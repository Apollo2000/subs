<i>The Kingslayer,</i>
<i>he escaped in the night.</i>

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:03,280
How?!

3
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,716
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

4
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:08,419
<i>Returning him may buy life</i>
<i>for my children.</i>

5
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:11,489
Ser Barristan Selmy, it is
time to put aside your sword.

6
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:14,693
You're too old
to protect anyone.

7
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:18,364
Even now I could cut through the
five of you like carving a cake.

8
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,333
Here, boy.

9
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:23,070
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,706
Where are my dragons?!

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,042
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

12
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:29,276
where I have put them.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,280
Walder Frey is a
dangerous man to cross.

14
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,582
<i>I love her.</i>

15
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,184
The Iron Throne is mine.

16
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:37,419
No one wants you
for their king.

17
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,288
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

18
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:42,358
<i>The night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

19
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,561
If Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

20
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,531
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

21
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:49,199
<i>Mance is gonna</i>
<i>march on the Wall.</i>

22
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:50,902
<i>One brother</i>
<i>inside his army</i>

23
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:52,570
will be worth 1,000
fighting against it.

24
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:54,505
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,575
<i>if you do what needs</i>
<i>to be done.</i>

26
00:00:57,677 --> 00:00:59,544
<i>Come along, Jon Snow.</i>

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,847
Time to meet
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

28
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:04,283
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

29
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:05,751
Dracarys.

30
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:10,990
When I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

31
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:12,491
I pray I serve you well.

32
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:15,127
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

33
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,775
The battle is over.
We have won.

34
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:31,045
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,116
If it weren't for your squire's
bravery you'd be a dead man.

36
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,586
Ser Loras Tyrell, I will
gladly wed your sweet sister.

37
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,724
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

38
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,426
<i>This war has just begun.</i>

39
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,194
<i>You will be king.</i>

40
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,031
It's Jon and the Halfhand.

41
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,100
Two blasts
is wildlings.

42
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,771
Run!

43
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:13,906
<i>Fall back!</i>

44
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,490
Brother?

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,408
Did you send the ravens?

46
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:33,815
Tarly, look at me.

47
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,486
Did you send the ravens?

48
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,025
<i>That was your job.</i>

49
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,828
Your only job.

50
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,006
We need to get
back to the Wall.

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,675
<i>It's a long march.</i>

52
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,444
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

53
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,248
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

54
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:10,118
or before winter's done,

55
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:12,320
everyone you've ever known

56
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,155

Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

What happened
to their fathers?

82
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,544
Some of them were killed

Thought you'd want
to question this one.

What do we want
with a baby crow?

90
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:12,390
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

<i>He wants to be</i>
<i>one of us.</i>

Friends twice your size.

Plenty of little men

97

tried to put their swords
through my heart.

98
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,488
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

99
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,190
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

100

101
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,471
Your Grace.

102
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:04,209
Your Grace?

103
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,911
Did you hear that?

104
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:09,014
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

105
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,450
Stand, boy.

106
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,589
We don't kneel for anyone

107
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:25,464
So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.

00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,632
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

109
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,336
You can leave us.

110

111
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,848
You like her back, Snow?

112
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:45,251
That why you want
to join us?

113
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,053
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

114
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,289

This chicken eater you thought

117
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,698
Can't believe this pup

118
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:00,033
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

119
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,268
He was our enemy

120
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:05,171
and I'm glad he's dead.

121
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:17,649
He was my brother once.

122
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:20,352
Back when he had
a whole hand.

123
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,889
What were you
doing with him?

124
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:27,226
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

125
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,094
Why?

126
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:30,896
He wants me to lead
one day.

127
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,400
But here you are,
a traitor

128
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,902
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

129
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,506
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

130
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,117
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

131
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,058
I want to be free.

132
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,228
No, I don't think so.

133
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,431
I think what you want
most of all

134
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,666
is to be a hero.

135
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:11,604
I'll ask you
one last time--

136
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:14,673
why do you want
to join us?

137
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:22,714
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

138
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:26,618
I saw...

139
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,219
You saw what?

140
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,590
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

141
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,359
and leave it
in the woods.

142
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,661
I saw what took it.

143
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,303
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

144
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,643
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

145
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,746
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

146
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,781
he already knew.

147
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,386
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

148
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,756
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

149
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,760
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

150
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,032
Did I come
to the right place?

151
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:20,572
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

152
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:43,896
What if you took off
that bit there?

153
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:49,635
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

154
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:53,571
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

155
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,743
I want you to take it off.

156
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,917
Mouth.

157
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,691
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.

158
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,562
I didn't hear that.

159
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:21,597
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,567
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

161
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:28,237
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

162
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:31,240
I will murder you, boy.

163
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:33,742
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

164
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:53,760
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

165
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,365
<i>The queen.</i>

166
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,414
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

167
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,617
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

168
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,486
No, I don't think so.

169
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,222
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

170
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,924
I'd let a wooden door
stop me?

171
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,432
They stay outside.

172
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,701
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

173
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:50,119
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

174
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:53,724
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

175
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,194
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

176
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:59,597
I should hope so.

177
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:02,933
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

178
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,035
Thanks to Father.

179
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,538
Thanks to Father.

180
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,142
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

181
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,711
No? Curious.

182
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:17,548
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

183
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,784
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

184
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,787
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

185
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,124
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

186
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,925
You're meeting
Father today?

187
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,028
How do you know that?

188
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:32,898
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

189
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:36,434
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

190
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:41,072
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

191
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:42,740
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

192
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:45,276
Do I need
to want something?

193
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:49,946
I'm sure
he loves me dearly,

194
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,681
as any father loves
his child,

195
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,384
his baby boy.

196
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,486
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

197
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,154
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

198
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:01,290
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

199
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,860
but Father never came.

200
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,433
You're going
to make me cry.

201
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,835
Why do you care
what I want from him?

202
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,339
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

203
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,607
Slandered?
When?

204
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,876
<i>You told him</i>
<i>I had my guards</i>

205
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,777
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

206
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

207
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,914
A girl of nine,
I believe.

208
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,749
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

209
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,817
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

210
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,252
If I remember correctly,

211
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,521
she never stole
a necklace again.

212
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:39,126
It's not slander
if it's true.

213
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,862
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

214
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,630
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

215
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,899
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

216
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,001
Because you're a liar.

217
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:51,105
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

218
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,608
Any lies in particular?

219
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,779
You're a clever man,

220
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,082
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

221
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:03,152
Still makes me
more clever than you.

222
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,959
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

223
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:13,462
Ser Taryn Mant and...

224
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,231
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

225
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,632
Ser Meryn Trant.

226
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,202
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

227
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,838
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

228
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,306
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater

229
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,241
was anointed
by the king himself.

230
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,977
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

231
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,613
nothing more.

232
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,582
That's exactly who I am.

233
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,383
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

234
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:36,687
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

235
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,490
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

236
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,360
You put your hand
on that door,

237
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,996
you lose the hand.

238
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,514
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

239
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,683
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

240
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,818
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

241
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,152
You're here to protect me.

242
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,388
I've been doing that
for a while now.

243
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,190
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

244
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:14,691
I grow poor
protecting you.

245
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,626
Poor?
Poor?

246
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,728
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

247
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:20,830
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

248
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:23,600
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

249
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:25,702
And now my pockets
are empty.

250
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,071
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

251
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:30,107
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

252
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,475
you'll need to pay more.

253
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:33,977
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

254
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:36,780
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

255
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,581
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

256
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,049
- How much?
- Double.

257
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,251
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

258
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:43,719
Knights
are worth double.

259
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:46,122
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

260
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,224
Which means
you can afford it.

261
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,796
Here. Here!

262
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:39,608
Help me!

263
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,567
Who are you?

264
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:10,308
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

265
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:15,347
I was a captain
and a knight.

266
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:19,251
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

267
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:27,594
The one true king
of Westeros--

268
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,298
Stannis Baratheon.

269
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,475
I thought you were dead.

270
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,144
Everyone thought
you were dead.

271
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:51,716
And your son?

272
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,891
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

273
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,961
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

274
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:15,706
I'm so sorry,
my friend.

275
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:18,276
I, too, have lost a son.

276
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,678
There is nothing worse
in this world.

277
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:25,582
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

278
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:29,152
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

279
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:33,756
Stannis lives?

280
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,992
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

281
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,793
Will you take me there?

282
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:40,229
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

283
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:41,730
This war is not over.

284
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:43,098
Not for you, maybe.

285
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,868
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

286
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,903
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

287
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,406
I am sworn to no man.

288
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,243
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

289
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:55,778
I delivered the ships.

290
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,981
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

291
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,417
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

292
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,920
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

293
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,589
They say he sees no one--

294
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,858
not his generals,
not even his wife.

295
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,895
Only the Red Woman

296
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,296
whispering in his ear,

297
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,165
telling him what
she sees in the flames

298
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,834
and burning men alive.

299
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,302
What?

300
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,839
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

301
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,775
All those who spoke
against her she called

302
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,411
servants of darkness.

303
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,915
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

304
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,222
I'm a pirate.

305
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,557
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

306
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,259
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

307
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,562
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

308
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,863
Take me back there, please.

309
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:48,798
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

310
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,467
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

311
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:53,102
You could try.

312
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,505
If you fail,
they will burn you.

313
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:58,408
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

314
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:00,577
And you've only
just come back to life.

315
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,846
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

316
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,615
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

317
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:08,117
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

318
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:10,053
but I don't ask you
for favors.

319
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:11,688
I have to stop her.

320
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:14,858
Please, do this for me.

321
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,064
When you are dead,

322
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:22,533
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

323
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,670
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

324
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,886
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

325
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,689
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

326
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:46,224
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

327
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,125
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

328
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,328
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

329
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,064
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

330
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,901
I don't think
we're going to get one.

331
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:48,222
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

332
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,293
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

333
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:54,129
For them
and for your sons.

334
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,331
Will it?

335
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:58,699
They rot in the ground

336
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,935
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

337
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,904
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

338
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,774
My best hunters
are after him.

339
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,430
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

340
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:31,999
My father's bannerman.

341
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:55,223
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

342
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:08,937
<i>She's your mother.</i>

343
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,606
She freed
Jaime Lannister.

344
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,009
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

345
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:15,811
and she robbed them
of their justice.

346
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,114
<i>Water.</i>

347
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,951
Water.

348
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:25,220
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

349
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,962
What's your name, friend?

350
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,863
Qyburn.

351
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:35,265
You're lucky to be alive.

352
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:41,004
Lucky?

353
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:08,969
The badge
looks good on you.

354
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:13,440
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

355
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,812
Are you enjoying
your new position?

356
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,982
Am I enjoying it?

357
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,418
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

358
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:26,486
Yes.

359
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,488
I heard how happy you were.

360
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:32,992
You brought a whore
into my bed.

361
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:35,628
It wasn't your bed
at the time.

362
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:41,000
I sent you here
to advise the king.

363
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:45,070
I gave you real power
and authority.

364
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,439
You chose
to spend your days

365
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,641
as you always have,

366
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:52,110
bedding harlots

367
00:29:52,144 --> 00:29:54,512
and drinking with thieves.

368
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:59,317
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

369
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:01,719
What do you want, Tyrion?

370
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:04,756
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

371
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,692
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

372
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:11,329
My beloved father who

373
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:14,065
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

374
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:15,933
after he fell
on the battlefield.

375
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:19,537
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

376
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,573
I organized
the defense of this city

377
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:25,776
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

378
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,544
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

379
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,847
while your grandson,
the king,

380
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,516
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

381
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,153
I bled in the mud
for our family.

382
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:39,656
And as my reward,

383
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,026
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

384
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,061
But what do I want?

385
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,531
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

386
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:51,801
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

387
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:54,271
You are a Lannister.

388
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:57,340
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

389
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,077
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

390
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:02,078
Hmm?

391
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:05,915
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

392
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:08,317
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

393
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:13,122
So tell me what you want.

394
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:19,830
I want what is mine
by right.

395
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:24,869
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

396
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:29,208
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

397
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,277
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

398
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:35,080
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

399
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:38,183
I am your son
and lawful heir.

400
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:42,788
You want Casterly Rock?

401
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,790
It is mine by right.

402
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:51,464
We'll find you
accommodations

403
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:53,400
more suited
to your name

404
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:55,802
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

405
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:58,705
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

406
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:02,409
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

407
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:04,110
<i>fit for your talents</i>

408
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:06,680
so that you can
serve your family

409
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:08,815
and protect our legacy.

410
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,484
<i>And if you serve</i>
<i>faithfully,</i>

411
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:13,053
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

412
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:16,923
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

413
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,225
<i>before mocking</i>
<i>the family name</i>

414
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:21,195
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

415
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:25,598
- Why?
- Why?

416
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:27,767
You ask that?

417
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:31,203
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

418
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:35,374
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

419
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:39,412
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

420
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:42,014
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

421
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,652
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

422
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,723
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

423
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:54,159
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

424
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:58,097
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

425
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,832
But neither gods nor men

426
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:02,768
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

427
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:05,904
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

428
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:08,807
Go, now.

429
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:15,714
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

430
00:33:17,716 --> 00:33:19,918
Go.

431
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:31,028
Oh, one more thing.

432
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:36,567
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

433
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,313
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

434
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:50,249
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

435
00:33:50,284 --> 00:33:53,753
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

436
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,125
But it's not
coming back.

437
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,761
The captain's tired
of risking his life

438
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,964
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

439
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:08,067
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

440
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,638
He's going
to stay in Dorne.

441
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:15,008
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

442
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,812
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

443
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,815
Don't ruin the game.

444
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:23,585
I told you,
I don't want to play.

445
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,721
What about that one there?

446
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:28,223
That one?

447
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:30,259
It's going to Volantis.

448
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,727
Why?

449
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,462
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

450
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:36,031
it looked like that one.

451
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,867
That's not how
the game works.

452
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:41,471
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

453
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,105
You've got
to invent a story

454
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,575
about where the ship
is going and why.

455
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,479
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

456
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:51,547
Because the truth

457
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:54,117
is always either
terrible or boring.

458
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,920
Lovely day for it.

459
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:58,856
Watching the ships.

460
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,859
Lord Baelish.

461
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,929
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa

462
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:06,598
alone for a moment?

463
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:20,945
I saw your mother
not long ago.

464
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,648
She's very eager
to see you.

465
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:29,719
And your sister.

466
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,356
Arya's alive?

467
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,527
You said
you'd take me home.

468
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:40,930
You said King's Landing
was your home.

469
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:43,499
You are the property
of the crown.

470
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,900
Stealing you
would be treason.

471
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,169
If you were to tell
just one person--

472
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:49,205
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

473
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,173
Because I'm a terrible liar.

474
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:53,842
You said so yourself.

475
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:57,045
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

476
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:01,816
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

477
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,052
that will take me far away
from the capital.

478
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,787
When I set sail,

479
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:09,356
I might be able
to take you with me.

480
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,392
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

481
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:17,097
You're her handmaiden?

482
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,969
Yes.
And you're his...?

483
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:25,473
I help manage
his affairs.

484
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:28,910
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

485
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:31,478
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

486
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:33,514
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

487
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:35,950
from sunrise till sunset.

488
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,955
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

489
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:45,293
Yes.

490
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:48,563
Given where we started.

491
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:50,832
And where is that?

492
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:54,368
It's not easy
for girls like us

493
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:56,571
to dig our way out.

494
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,944
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

495
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:06,813
I always do.

496
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:09,549
Watch out for her
with him.

497
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,940
They're growing fast.

498
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,677
Not fast enough.

499
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:12,115
I can't wait that long.

500
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:16,987
I need an army.

501
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:20,790
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

502
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:24,861
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

503
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:27,698
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

504
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,034
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

505
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,902
Do those people
have any better ideas

506
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,205
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

507
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:38,742
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

508
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:44,080
You're right.

509
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,285
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

510
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,086
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

511
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,489
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

512
00:38:53,556 --> 00:38:55,891
They followed me
across the poison water.

513
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:57,226
If they'll do it,
others will.

514
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,793
And with a true
khalasar--

515
00:38:58,828 --> 00:39:02,931
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

516
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,734
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

517
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:08,970
And not before.

518
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:37,798
Your Grace.

519
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,380
I heard you were dead.

520
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:53,282
Not yet.

521
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:58,287
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

522
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,357
We are alone.

523
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:14,538
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

524
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:17,441
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

525
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:20,444
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

526
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,780
And there is still
a war to fight.

527
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:25,515
I am fighting.

528
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,185
By burning
prisoners alive?

529
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,256
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

530
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,726
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

531
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,861
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

532
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,630
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

533
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,366
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

534
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,706
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

535
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,510
<i>Did I set</i>
<i>your ships ablaze?</i>

536
00:40:56,015 --> 00:41:00,152
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

537
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:04,824
I could have
saved those men.

538
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,492
You would have
taken the city,

539
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,401
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

540
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:10,097
and you would
stand beside him.

541
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:12,666
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

542
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,370
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

543
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:27,581
Do you hear them screaming?

544
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:30,918
All those burning men
in the water

545
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,620
crying for their mothers,

546
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:36,523
for their gods for help?

547
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:39,292
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

548
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,567
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

549
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,969
What I told
your son is true.

550
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:53,371
Death by fire

551
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:55,107
is the purest death.

552
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,244
This woman is evil!

553
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:00,946
She's the mother of demons.

554
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,815
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

555
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,350
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

556
00:42:05,385 --> 00:42:06,652
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

557
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:09,554
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

558
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:11,590
<i>Your Grace!</i>

559
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:41,653
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

560
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:45,724
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

561
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:53,199
Why have we stopped?

562
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,767
It's Lady Margaery,
Your Grace.

563
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:01,941
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>Who gave her permission?</i>

564
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:05,878
My lady. We should have
guards, my lady.

565
00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:08,281
Why?

566
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:13,186
Pardon me.

567
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:23,631
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

568
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:25,466
I have others.

569
00:43:31,273 --> 00:43:33,674
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

570
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,946
No.

571
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,714
He was a soldier.

572
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:42,649
He went to fight
on the walls

573
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,252
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

574
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,354
He never came back.

575
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:49,189
And your mother?

576
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:51,624
She died
when she had me.

577
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:56,463
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

578
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:00,166
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

579
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:08,175
Whenever you look
at this knight,

580
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:11,044
I want you to remember
your father.

581
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:15,514
He wasn't a knight.

582
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:17,483
He was just a soldier.

583
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:19,885
And what do knights
swear to do?

584
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:23,254
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

585
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:27,024
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

586
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:32,930
Was your father
a soldier, too?

587
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:36,867
You should be proud, too.

588
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:41,038
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

589
00:44:41,072 --> 00:44:43,807
your fathers
saved the city.

590
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:46,143
They saved us all.

591
00:44:46,177 --> 00:44:49,547
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

592
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,984
All of you.

593
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,792
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

594
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:04,894
clothe them,
or house them.

595
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:08,797
Directly to me.

596
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:25,714
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

597
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:27,349
Please, sit.
Sit.

598
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:29,852
I do apologize,
my lady.

599
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:32,222
Small council meetings.

600
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,357
At what point
does it become treason

601
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:36,259
to waste the king's time?

602
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,700
That's a lovely gown,
my lady.

603
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,736
Yes, it suits you
perfectly.

604
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,172
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

605
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:50,576
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

606
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,312
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

607
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:56,815
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

608
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,052
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

609
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:02,054
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

610
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:05,191
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

611
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:08,093
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

612
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:09,762
I've never seen
anything like it.

613
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:11,697
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

614
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,333
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

615
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:18,170
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

616
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:19,972
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

617
00:46:20,006 --> 00:46:24,376
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

618
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,944
the High Septon
told me about.

619
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:28,659
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

620
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:32,985
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

621
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:35,288
and approach them
with an open heart.

622
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:37,390
<i>An open heart is what</i>
<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

623
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,991
<i>if you're not careful,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

624
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:42,861
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

625
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:45,831
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

626
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:48,834
The king barely escaped
with his life.

627
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:52,338
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

628
00:46:52,405 --> 00:46:54,941
Facts become less and less
important to her

629
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,976
<i>as she grows older.</i>

630
00:46:57,044 --> 00:46:59,946
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

631
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,915
You're right, of course.

632
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,185
But you are
your father's son.

633
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,387
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

634
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:18,765
Hunger turns men
into beasts.

635
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:22,636
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

636
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:26,507
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

637
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:30,044
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

638
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,747
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

639
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:34,816
in time of need.

640
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,551
Well, as Ser Loras said,

641
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:39,721
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

642
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:41,689
charitable work before.

643
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:44,859
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

644
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,263
I'm sure she does.

645
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,495
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

646
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,665
with no food or water.

647
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:29,907
They will stand
until they drop.

648
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:34,144
Such is their
obedience.

649
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:38,249
They may suit my needs.

650
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,251
Tell me of their training.

651
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,108
They begin their
training at five.

652
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:05,110
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

653
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,313
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

654
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:09,748
the shield,
and the three spears.

655
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:13,386
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

656
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:19,458
<i>Their discipline</i>
<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>

657
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,260
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

658
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:24,329
Even the bravest men
fear death.

659
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:48,454
<i>My master says</i>
<i>the Unsullied are not men.</i>

660
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,856
Death means nothing
to them.

661
00:49:59,365 --> 00:50:02,333
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

662
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,983
Tell the good master
there is no need.

663
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,726
<i>My master points out</i>
<i>that men don't need nipples.</i>

664
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,712
To win his shield,

665
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:51,482
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

666
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:56,487
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

667
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:01,258
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

668
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,394
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

669
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,532
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

670
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:11,869
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

671
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:28,385
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

672
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,988
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

673
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:39,096
How many do you
have to sell?

674
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:46,405
8,000.

675
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,680
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

676
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:56,549
Many other buyers
are interested.

677
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:09,862
8,000 dead babies.

678
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:12,465
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

679
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:14,834
Once I own them,
these men--

680
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,403
They're not men.
Not anymore.

681
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:20,806
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

682
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,908
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

683
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:26,378
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

684
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:41,592
You'll be fair to them.

685
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:44,395
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

686
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:51,169
You won't order them
to murder babies.

687
00:52:51,204 --> 00:52:54,039
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

688
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,908
A great injustice
has been done to them.

689
00:52:58,078 --> 00:53:00,612
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

690
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,336
The warlocks.

691
00:54:02,808 --> 00:54:05,677
I owe you my life, ser.

692
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:07,346
The honor is mine,

693
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,581
my queen.

694
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:15,220
You know this man?

695
00:54:15,254 --> 00:54:17,055
I know him

696
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:21,560
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

697
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:23,162
and as the Lord Commander

698
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:25,964
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

699
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,435
King Robert is dead.

700
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,338
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

701
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,907
to ask your forgiveness.

702
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:37,977
I was sworn to protect
your family.

703
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:41,647
I failed them.

704
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:49,322
I am Barristan Selmy,

705
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:51,658
Kingsguard to your father.

706
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:54,093
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

707
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:57,197
and I will not
fail you again.

708

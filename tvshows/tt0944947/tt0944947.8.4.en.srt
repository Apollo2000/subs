3
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:12,091
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

4
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,425
To our fathers and mothers.

5
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,383
To our friends.

6
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:21,841
Our fellow men and women

7
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:24,550
who set aside their differences...

8
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,467
to fight together...

9
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,634
and die together

10
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,675
so that others might live.

11
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,592
Everyone in this world

12
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,467
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

13
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,841
It is our duty and our honor

14
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:49,133
to keep them alive in memory...

15
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,008
for those who come after us...

16
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,133
and those who come after them...

17
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,008
for as long as men draw breath.

18
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:05,425
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

19
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,634
And we shall never see
their like again.

20
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,759
To your health.

21
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,217
Have you seen Arya?

22
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,592
You can still smell the burning bodies,

23
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,175
and that's where your head is at.

24
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:19,258
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

25
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,592
Look, it's not about that.

26
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,425
Of course it's about that, you twat.

27
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,592
Why shouldn't it be?

28
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,883
The dead are dead. You're not.

29
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:41,717
Gendry.

30
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,550
That's right, isn't it?

31
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,133
Yes, Your Grace.

32
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,425
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

33
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,759
You are aware
he took my family's throne

34
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,175
and tried to have me murdered?

35
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:09,800
I didn't even know he was my
father until after he was dead.

36
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,091
Yes, he's dead.

37
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,759
His brothers are too.

38
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:18,883
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

39
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,883
I don't know, Your Grace.

40
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,800
Does anyone?

41
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,467
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

42
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,425
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

43
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:48,008
No, you are Lord
Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,

44
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,258
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

45
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:54,091
Because that is what I have made you.

46
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,050
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

47
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,342
To Gendry!

48
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,634
Lord Gendry!

49
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,634
Gendry!

50
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:16,133
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

51
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,800
Lord Gendry!

52
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,133
Gendry!

53
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,091
That's easy, isn't it?

54
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,550
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

55
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:36,425
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

56
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,342
- Come, my lord.
- See?

57
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,800
You're not the only one who's clever.

58
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,467
I have to go down
and get another barrel.

59
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,675
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

60
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,966
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

61
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,800
The last time I saw her,

62
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,175
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

63
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,008
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

64
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,550
- I do.
- So did you?

65
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,634
Never got the chance.

66
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,217
She did it to herself.

67
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,383
Or her god did it to her.

68
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:37,592
Lord of Light.

69
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:41,966
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

70
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,675
and then

71
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,050
he fucks off.

72
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,509
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

73
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:52,091
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

74
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,966
will leave you any happier than before.

75
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,217
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

76
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,675
Then you're in luck.

77
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,592
We may have defeated them,

78
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,592
but we still have us to contend with.

79
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,634
Thank you. I feel much better.

80
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,300
More ale!

81
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,217
This is clever.

82
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:37,091
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

83
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,717
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

84
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,467
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

85
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,383
I liked that one.

86
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,634
You know our history
better than anyone.

87
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,841
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

88
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,883
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

89
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,966
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

90
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,425
You don't want it.

91
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,925
I don't really want anymore.

92
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,300
I envy you.

93
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,133
You shouldn't envy me.

94
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,634
Mostly I live in the past.

95
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:25,425
- All of it.
- Go on.

96
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,091
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

97
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,217
We have to
celebrate our victory.

98
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,592
Vomiting is not celebrating.

99
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,467
Yes, it is.

100
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,841
Ah!

101
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,425
To the Dragon Queen!

102
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,966
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

103
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,759
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Drink!

104
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,342
I'm fine!

105
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:17,717
Your turn.

106
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,383
Um...

107
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:23,383
You are an only child.

108
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,133
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

109
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:29,050
- I did.
- I surmised it.

110
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,675
Drink.

111
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:32,925
Go again.

112
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:34,342
Why does he get to go again?

113
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,300
Because it's my game.

114
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:40,008
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

115
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,883
No.

116
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,342
Drink.

117
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,258
The other way around!

118
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,550
I saw him riding that thing.

119
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:52,383
- We all did.
- No. No.

120
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:55,717
I saw him riding that thing.

121
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

122
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,634
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

123
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,925
That's the kind of man he is.

124
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,091
He's little...

125
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,675
...but he's strong.

126
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,634
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

127
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:13,966
and get murdered for it!

128
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,342
Most people get bloody murdered,

129
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,634
they stay that way.

130
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,342
Not this one.

131
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,133
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

132
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:27,258
Ah! He comes back
and keeps fighting.

133
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:30,841
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

134
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:34,383
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.

135
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,383
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

136
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:40,050
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

137
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,383
A madman or a king!

138
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:00,717
- Drink.
- Drink.

139
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Drink.

140
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:33,550
Wrong!

141
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,717
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

142
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,008
Mm!

143
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:42,342
You were married. Before Sansa.

144
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:44,509
Drink.

145
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,759
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

146
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:52,841
No!

147
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:07,717
You're a virgin.

148
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:14,966
That's a statement about the present.

149
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,966
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

150
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,050
have you slept with a man.

151
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,717
Or a woman.

152
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,883
I have to piss.

153
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,966
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

154
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,634
Looked right into their blue eyes,

155
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,091
and here we are.

156
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,008
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

157
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,841
Please pardon me for a moment.

158
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,883
Drink it!

159
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,467
And after all that,

160
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,091
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

161
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:40,091
Just takes her, like that.

162
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,717
I mean it, Clegane.

163
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,383
My heart is broken.

164
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,717
Don't touch me.

165
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,133
You can touch me.

166
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:51,467
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

167
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,300
Maybe you should be.

168
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,925
Well, Clegane...

169
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,550
it's time to drown our sorrows.

170
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm not done with my drink.

171
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,300
You saved the day.

172
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,759
You owe me one.

173
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:12,342
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

174
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,925
Are you ready now?

175
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,133
This is my drink.

176
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,383
All right!

177
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:35,175
She could have made you
happy, for a little while.

178
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,675
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

179
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:42,592
And what's that?

180
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:45,050
That's my fucking business.

181
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,592
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

182
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,925
That was a long time ago.

183
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:57,717
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

184
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,759
Yes, I've heard.

185
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,592
Heard you were broken in.

186
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,217
Heard you were broken in rough.

187
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,675
And he got what he deserved.

188
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,091
I gave it to him.

189
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,509
How?

190
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,925
Hounds.

191
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,425
You've changed, Little Bird.

192
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,258
None of it would have happened

193
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,175
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

194
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,258
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

195
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,133
none of it.

196
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,050
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

197
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:48,634
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

198
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,258
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

199
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:26,841
Don't shoot.

200
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:32,759
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

201
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,342
You should be celebrating with them.

202
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:36,800
I am celebrating.

203
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,634
Yeah, I am too.

204
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,800
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

205
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:48,258
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

206
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,675
By order of the queen.

207
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:53,675
Congratulations.

208
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,925
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

209
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,634
I hardly know how to use a fork.

210
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:02,634
All I know is that you're beautiful,

211
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:03,841
and I love you,

212
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:05,759
and none of it will be worth anything

213
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,008
if you're not with me.

214
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,342
So be with me.

215
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:17,467
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

216
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,966
You'll be a wonderful lord,

217
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,091
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

218
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,925
But I'm not a lady.

219
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:50,717
I never have been.

220
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,050
That's not me.

221
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:21,592
You didn't drink.

222
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:27,467
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

223
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,717
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

224
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:37,133
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

225
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,300
Suit yourself.

226
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:52,634
You keep it warm enough in here.

227
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:59,008
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

228
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,467
Keep your fire going.

229
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,883
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

230
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:05,592
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

231
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:07,550
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

232
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,425
I learned in the North?

233
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:11,592
I hate the fucking North.

234
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,966
It grows on you.

235
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,300
I don't want things growing on me.

236
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,883
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

237
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:24,467
Has he grown on you?

238
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,133
He was very sad when you left.

239
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,467
You sound quite jealous.

240
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,800
I do, don't I?

241
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,675
It's bloody hot in here.

242
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,841
Oh, move aside.

243
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:00,550
What are you doing?

244
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,008
I'm taking your shirt off.

245
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,217
I've never slept with a knight before.

246
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:56,175
I've never slept with anyone before.

247
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,800
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

248
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,258
I told you...

249
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,258
Are you drunk?

250
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:25,925
No.

251
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:32,217
Only a little.

252
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,091
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

253
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,759
but I know this.

254
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,383
If he could have chosen a way to die,

255
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,467
it would have been protecting you.

256
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:54,509
He loved me.

257
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:59,592
And I couldn't love him back.

258
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,425
Not the way he wanted.

259
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,509
Not the way I love you.

260
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:13,091
Is that all right?

261
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,467
I wish you'd never told me.

262
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,509
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

263
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,175
I try to forget.

264
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:04,217
Tonight I did for a while,

265
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,091
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

266
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,925
I saw the way they looked at you.

267
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:13,383
I know that look.

268
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,550
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

269
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:20,217
Never on this side of the sea.

270
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:22,966
I told you I don't want it.

271
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,592
It doesn't matter what you want.

272
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,467
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

273
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,133
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

274
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,717
and take what is mine?

275
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:37,008
I'll refuse.

276
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,634
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

277
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,925
You can say nothing.

278
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,467
To anyone, ever.

279
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,550
Never tell them who you really are.

280
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:48,050
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

281
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,342
and tell no one else.

282
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:51,050
Or it will take on a life of its own

283
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,841
and you won't be able to control it

284
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:54,133
or what it does to people.

285
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:56,717
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

286
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,759
no matter what you swear.

287
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,383
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

288
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:18,383
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

289
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:24,841
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

290
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,592
She won't.

291
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:29,717
She's not the girl you grew up with.

292
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,091
Not after what she's seen,

293
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,800
not after what they've done to her.

294
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:40,050
I owe them the truth.

295
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:43,008
Even if the truth destroys us?

296
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,800
- It won't.
- It will.

297
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:49,133
I've never begged for anything...

298
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,550
but I'm begging you.

299
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:55,634
Don't do this. Please.

300
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,634
You are my queen.

301
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:07,091
Nothing will change that.

302
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,717
And they are my family.

303
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:15,342
We can live together.

304
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,258
We can.

305
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:26,175
I've just told you how.

306
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,175
Half are gone.

307
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,509
The Northmen as well.

308
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:19,050
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

309
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,133
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

310
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:24,925
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

311
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,800
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

312
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:29,133
that we saved them...

313
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:31,550
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

314
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,175
We will hit her hard.

315
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:37,467
We will rip her out root and stem.

316
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:41,550
The objective here is to remove Cersei

317
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,300
without destroying King's Landing.

318
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:51,258
Thankfully,
she's losing allies by the day.

319
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,175
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

320
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,550
in her queen's name.

321
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:58,300
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

322
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,425
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

323
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,300
as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,

324
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,091
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

325
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,175
We need the capital.

326
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,008
I watched the people of King's Landing

327
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,383
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

328
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,675
and that was before winter began.

329
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,300
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

330
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,383
We'll surround the city.

331
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,717
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

332
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,883
the dragons will destroy them.

333
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:30,383
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

334
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,133
we'll defeat them in the field.

335
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,883
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

336
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:37,966
her reign is over.

337
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,592
All right.

338
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:47,800
The men we have
left are exhausted.

339
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,091
Many of them are wounded.

340
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,050
They'll fight better if they have time

341
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,509
to rest and recuperate.

342
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,008
How long do you suggest?

343
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,675
I can't say for certain,

344
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,800
not without talking to the officers.

345
00:33:03,175 --> 00:33:06,050
I came north to fight alongside you

346
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,675
at great cost to my armies and myself.

347
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:12,759
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

348
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,634
you want to postpone.

349
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,592
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

350
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,300
You want to throw them into a war

351
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:20,925
they're not ready to fight?

352
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,717
The longer I leave my enemies alone,

353
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,300
the stronger they become.

354
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,383
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

355
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,759
and their allegiance

356
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:35,342
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

357
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,550
What you command, we will obey.

358
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,883
So...

359
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:51,883
if all are in agreement...

360
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,800
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

361
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,258
with the Northern troops

362
00:33:56,342 --> 00:33:58,883
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

363
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:01,300
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

364
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:03,300
and sail from there to Dragonstone

365
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:07,091
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

366
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:09,841
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,

367
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,217
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

368
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:17,175
We have won the Great War.

369
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:19,925
Now we will win the Last War.

370
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:23,217
In all Seven Kingdoms,

371
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,091
men will live without fear and cruelty

372
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:28,592
under their rightful queen.

373
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,217
We need a word.

374
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:50,300
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

375
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:52,675
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

376
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,234
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

377
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,342
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

378
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:58,008
And we will never forget them.

379
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,026
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who...

380
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,717
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

381
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,342
I respect that.

382
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:08,634
You respect it?

383
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:11,091
We needed her.

384
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,091
We needed her army, her dragons.

385
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:18,675
You did the right thing.

386
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:21,175
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

387
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:22,800
we don't trust your queen.

388
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,008
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

389
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,383
She's not one of us.

390
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,383
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

391
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:31,800
you won't make many allies.

392
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:33,425
That's all right.

393
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,634
I don't need many allies.

394
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,966
- Arya...
- We're family.

395
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,509
The four of us.

396
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:43,300
The last of the Starks.

397
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:48,800
I've never been a Stark.

398
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:51,550
You are.

399
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,634
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

400
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,592
You're my brother.

401
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:59,175
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

402
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,550
My brother.

403
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,841
It's your choice.

404
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,217
I need to tell you something.

405
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:25,217
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

406
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:29,841
What is it?

407
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:34,175
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

408
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,841
How can I promise to keep a secret

409
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:37,467
if I don't even know what it is?

410
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,217
Because we're family.

411
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Swear it.

412
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:48,008
I swear it.

413
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:53,675
I swear it.

414
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,008
Tell them.

415
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,091
So she's going
to stay here with you?

416
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,759
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

417
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:26,550
Say something snide.

418
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:28,759
I'm happy.

419
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:30,592
I'm happy that you're happy.

420
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:36,883
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

421
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:42,217
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

422
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:45,717
To climbing mountains.

423
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,258
To climbing mountains.

424
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:52,841
- What's she like down there?
- What?

425
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:54,883
That's not your concern.

426
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:57,509
I haven't been with a woman for years.

427
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:59,091
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

428
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:01,050
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

429
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,925
I knew you were fucking her.

430
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,759
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

431
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,509
Must be like looking in the mirror.

432
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,425
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

433
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,800
Where's your drink?

434
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:16,008
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

435
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:17,550
What are you doing with that?

436
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,175
Oh, this?

437
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,300
This is for you.

438
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,883
For both of you.

439
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,050
You're supposed to be south.

440
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,050
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

441
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:28,693
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

442
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,925
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

443
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,925
- and what do I have to show?
- You're a knight, thanks to me.

444
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:35,651
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

445
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:37,883
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

446
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,550
Power resides where men believe...

447
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,592
Shut your mouth.

448
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:44,067
- I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

449
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,966
but say another word
and I will belt you.

450
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,592
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all...

451
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,425
You couldn't do it on your best day,

452
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:51,592
you one-handed fuck.

453
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,258
And your best days are long gone.

454
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:54,841
You broke my nose!

455
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:56,693
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

456
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,008
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

457
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:02,008
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

458
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,675
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

459
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,258
Nice big castle, good lands,

460
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:08,383
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

461
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:11,133
- And you trust Cersei...
- I knew your sister was dead

462
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:13,008
the second I saw those dragons.

463
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:14,675
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

464
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,966
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

465
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,550
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

466
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,717
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

467
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,217
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

468
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

469
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:33,258
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

470
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:35,258
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

471
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:38,008
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

472
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:44,217
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

473
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,467
If anyone offered me money

474
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,800
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

475
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,342
What's double Riverrun?

476
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,383
Highgarden.

477
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,050
You could be Lord of the Reach.

478
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,966
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

479
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,258
He's not going to kill us.

480
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:01,091
He wouldn't be talking to us if...

481
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,342
The way I see it,

482
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:08,091
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

483
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:10,300
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

484
00:40:10,383 --> 00:40:12,509
No? Who were your ancestors,

485
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:14,759
the ones who made your family rich?

486
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,425
Fancy lads in silk?

487
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,175
They were fucking cutthroats.

488
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:20,675
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

489
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:23,175
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

490
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:25,592
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

491
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,675
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

492
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:32,175
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

493
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:33,800
with their cocksucking ways.

494
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:38,634
Highgarden.

495
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:41,966
Give me your word.

496
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:45,175
You have my word.

497
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,425
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

498
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,966
We ride south in the morning.

499
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,217
We could use an officer

500
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,550
with knowledge of the city's defenses.

501
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:58,883
Oh, no.

502
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:01,550
No, my fighting days are done.

503
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,675
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

504
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:07,383
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

505
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,759
Till then, don't die.

506
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,675
For fuck's sake.

507
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:39,300
On your own?

508
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:42,008
Not anymore.

509
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:45,133
I don't like crowds.

510
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,841
Me neither.

511
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,217
Why not? They all love you now.

512
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,883
You're the big hero.

513
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,634
Don't like heroes.

514
00:41:57,592 --> 00:42:01,050
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

515
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:04,050
Felt better than dying.

516
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:09,217
You're heading to King's Landing?

517
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,925
I have some unfinished business.

518
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:15,675
Me too.

519
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:23,883
I don't plan on coming back.

520
00:42:26,258 --> 00:42:27,883
Neither do I.

521
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:31,883
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

522
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,217
Probably.

523
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:20,425
My lady.

524
00:43:24,675 --> 00:43:27,425
"My lord" is the standard response.

525
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,258
Why her?

526
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
You know she loves your brother.

527
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:39,509
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

528
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:43,425
You seem determined to dislike her.

529
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:46,050
A good relationship

530
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,526
between the Iron Throne and the North

531
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,300
has been the core of every peaceful,

532
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:50,966
prosperous reign we've ever known.

533
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,550
Jon will be Warden of the North,

534
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:54,634
so a good relationship seems likely.

535
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,550
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

536
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:01,634
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

537
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:07,342
Sansa, look at me.

538
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:15,258
With Jon in the capital,

539
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:18,008
you'll be the true power in the North.

540
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:19,883
I'd feel much better about the future

541
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,300
if I left here today believing

542
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:22,966
that you and Daenerys were allies.

543
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,800
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

544
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:28,550
Your queen still has her dragons...

545
00:44:28,634 --> 00:44:29,800
She's your queen too.

546
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,091
You don't have to be her friend.

547
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,091
But why provoke her?

548
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:43,425
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

549
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,925
- or the North, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

550
00:44:48,383 --> 00:44:52,717
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

551
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,592
I don't want Jon to go down there.

552
00:44:57,675 --> 00:45:01,342
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

553
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:04,133
No, but as your brother once told me,

554
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:05,592
he's not a Stark.

555
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,550
Are you all right?

556
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,634
Her people love her, you've seen that.

557
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:24,050
You've seen how they fight for her.

558
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:27,300
She wants to make the world
a better place.

559
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:31,717
I believe in her.

560
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:47,925
Tyrion.

561
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:53,342
What if there's someone else?

562
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,050
Someone better?

563
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:05,425
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

564
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,300
Just a horse.

565
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:12,800
Rhaegal needs to heal.

566
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:14,592
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

567
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:18,008
You weigh as
much as two fleas fucking.

568
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,966
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

569
00:46:21,966 --> 00:46:24,717
We've had enough of the south.

570
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,841
The women down here don't like me.

571
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:31,091
This is the North, you know.

572
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:34,759
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

573
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,966
It isn't home.

574
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,509
We need room to wander.

575
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:41,675
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

576
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:44,217
as soon as the winter storms pass.

577
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,966
Back where we belong.

578
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:52,258
It's where he belongs too.

579
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,050
A direwolf has no place in the south.

580
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,675
Will you take him with you?

581
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:01,883
He'll be happier up there.

582
00:47:02,925 --> 00:47:04,217
So would you.

583
00:47:06,217 --> 00:47:08,634
I wish I was going with you.

584
00:47:13,008 --> 00:47:14,300
This is farewell, then.

585
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:17,550
You never know.

586
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:26,008
You've got the North in you.

587
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:28,966
The real North.

588
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:04,634
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

589
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:07,300
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

590
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:10,008
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

591
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,800
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

592
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,759
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

593
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,592
I hope it's a girl.

594
00:48:42,425 --> 00:48:44,550
You're the best friend I ever had.

595
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,050
You too, Sam.

596
00:49:49,592 --> 00:49:51,883
Think of the past 20 years.

597
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,800
The war, the murder, the misery.

598
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:58,300
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

599
00:49:58,383 --> 00:50:00,300
who didn't love him back.

600
00:50:02,383 --> 00:50:03,550
How many others know?

601
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:07,966
Including us? Eight.

602
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,133
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

603
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:12,008
It's information.

604
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:15,425
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

605
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:16,925
Then what happens?

606
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,592
She loses the North.

607
00:50:18,675 --> 00:50:21,467
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

608
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,966
No, it's worse than that.

609
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,800
He has the better claim to the throne.

610
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:28,091
He doesn't want the throne.

611
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:30,592
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

612
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,050
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

613
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,841
Wildlings, Northmen.

614
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,091
He's a war hero.

615
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,717
He loves our queen.

616
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:49,550
And she loves him.

617
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:54,175
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

618
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:56,383
She's his aunt.

619
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,859
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

620
00:50:57,883 --> 00:50:59,592
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

621
00:50:59,675 --> 00:51:01,925
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

622
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:06,342
You know our queen better than I do.

623
00:51:06,425 --> 00:51:09,133
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

624
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:11,759
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

625
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:13,091
Something she has in common

626
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:15,759
with every monarch who ever lived.

627
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:17,634
I worry about her state of mind.

628
00:51:17,717 --> 00:51:19,841
We are advisors to the queen.

629
00:51:19,925 --> 00:51:23,258
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

630
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:33,258
We still have to take King's Landing.

631
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,008
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

632
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:39,383
That would solve our problems.

633
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:45,383
Get to the skiff. Now!

634
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:48,925
Spears!

635
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:50,966
They're coming round again!

636
00:53:59,592 --> 00:54:01,050
Go!

637
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,342
Clear!

638
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:04,300
Man your stations!

639
00:54:04,383 --> 00:54:06,050
No!

640
00:54:23,966 --> 00:54:26,550
- Go! Go!
- Clear!

641
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,342
Missandei?

642
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:06,175
Missandei!

643
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:13,675
Missandei!

644
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:20,592
Our message was
well-received, then?

645
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:23,966
Your people have
heard the Usurper is coming.

646
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,550
They are grateful for your protection

647
00:55:26,634 --> 00:55:29,008
within the walls of the Red Keep.

648
00:55:31,258 --> 00:55:33,217
You're certain about the dragon?

649
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,550
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

650
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:37,883
That must have been glorious.

651
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:42,217
The glory is yours, my queen.

652
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:46,217
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

653
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,966
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

654
00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:52,550
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

655
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:11,091
She's coming for you.

656
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:13,425
Of course she is.

657
00:56:16,217 --> 00:56:17,925
Keep the gates open.

658
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:20,634
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

659
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:23,217
thousands of innocent people first.

660
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,800
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

661
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,800
We will storm the
city, my queen.

662
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:51,091
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

663
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:52,258
Your Grace.

664
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:57,509
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

665
00:56:57,592 --> 00:56:59,925
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

666
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,217
This is a mistake.

667
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,300
You saw my child fall from the sky.

668
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:14,925
They took Missandei.

669
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:17,008
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

670
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:21,300
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

671
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:22,592
and the Dothraki,

672
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:24,841
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

673
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:29,634
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

674
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:33,383
These are the people
you came here to protect.

675
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:35,091
I beg you, Your Grace.

676
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:38,883
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

677
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:42,800
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

678
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,675
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

679
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,217
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

680
00:57:58,383 --> 00:57:59,841
That is my destiny...

681
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:04,133
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

682
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:13,925
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

683
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:16,008
make it to King's Landing.

684
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:18,925
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

685
00:58:19,008 --> 00:58:22,342
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

686
00:58:23,883 --> 00:58:26,383
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

687
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:28,883
we should make the effort.

688
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:31,841
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

689
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:35,675
But perhaps it's good the people see

690
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:39,759
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

691
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:42,175
and Cersei Lannister refused.

692
00:58:43,883 --> 00:58:45,300
They should know whom to blame

693
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:47,509
when the sky falls down upon them.

694
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:04,258
I've served tyrants most of my life.

695
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:08,467
They all talk about destiny.

696
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,800
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

697
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:14,550
and walked out with three dragons.

698
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,383
How could she not believe in destiny?

699
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:19,342
Perhaps that's the problem.

700
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:20,634
Her life has convinced her

701
00:59:20,717 --> 00:59:22,592
that she was sent here to save us all.

702
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,592
And how do you know she wasn't?

703
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,759
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

704
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:38,050
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

705
00:59:39,592 --> 00:59:41,008
You know them both.

706
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:44,217
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

707
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:51,258
He doesn't want the throne.

708
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,800
That's why he bent the knee.

709
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,966
Have you considered the best ruler

710
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,467
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

711
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,841
We're discussing treason.

712
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:03,592
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

713
01:00:03,675 --> 01:00:07,008
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

714
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:13,133
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

715
01:00:13,217 --> 01:00:15,966
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

716
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,300
whose support we are going to need.

717
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:19,800
Joffrey was a man.

718
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:22,133
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

719
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:23,342
as I'm sure you'd agree.

720
01:00:23,425 --> 01:00:25,383
And he's the heir to the throne.

721
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:29,467
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

722
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:35,383
What about my earlier proposal?

723
01:00:35,467 --> 01:00:37,675
They could rule together
as king and queen.

724
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,634
She's too strong for him.

725
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:45,258
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

726
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:48,425
He could temper her worst impulses.

727
01:00:48,509 --> 01:00:50,467
As you have?

728
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,717
You're drinking quite a lot.

729
01:00:58,133 --> 01:01:01,759
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

730
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:04,759
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

731
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:06,717
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

732
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,440
How many kings and queens
have you served?

733
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:09,841
Five? Six? I've lost count.

734
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:11,776
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

735
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,425
you choose a person you believe in,

736
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:15,008
and you fight for that person.

737
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:17,175
Even if you know it's a mistake?

738
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,717
I believe in our queen.

739
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:25,467
She'll make the right choice.

740
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,925
With the help of her loyal advisors.

741
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:36,050
You know where my loyalty stands.

742
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,425
You know I will never betray the realm.

743
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:39,800
What is the realm?

744
01:01:39,883 --> 01:01:42,008
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

745
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:44,109
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

746
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,091
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

747
01:01:46,175 --> 01:01:48,841
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

748
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:50,133
We don't know their names,

749
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:52,091
but they're just as real as you and I.

750
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,383
They deserve to live.

751
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:55,383
They deserve food for their children.

752
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:03,425
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

753
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,217
So, what happens to her?

754
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:17,383
Please.

755
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:20,759
Don't.

756
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:27,925
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

757
01:02:29,425 --> 01:02:32,133
Each of us has a choice to make.

758
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:36,133
I pray we choose wisely.

759
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,883
I'm just about to start it.

760
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,383
Good luck.

761
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,383
Protect shell
right up to the wall.

762
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:54,109
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

763
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:55,966
He's headed down to the cellar.

764
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,091
I'll need a cart over here.

765
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,383
That's it, thanks.

766
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:01,050
Thank you.

767
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:02,526
It's really heavy, mind you.

768
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,800
We need some more water.

769
01:03:03,883 --> 01:03:05,467
Take it down there!

770
01:03:10,383 --> 01:03:12,800
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

771
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:16,175
What happened?

772
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,175
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

773
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:29,217
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

774
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,467
Missandei captured.

775
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,509
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

776
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:40,300
Seems like I won't get the chance.

777
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,675
They're going to destroy that city.

778
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:52,217
You know they will.

779
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,592
Have you ever
run away from a fight?

780
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,966
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

781
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,175
You're better than she is.

782
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:03,800
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

783
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:05,800
You don't need to die with her.

784
01:05:05,883 --> 01:05:07,425
Stay here.

785
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,634
Stay with me.

786
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:14,300
Please.

787
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:16,383
Stay.

788
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,883
You think I'm a good man?

789
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,342
I pushed a boy out a tower window,

790
01:05:32,425 --> 01:05:34,509
crippled him for life

791
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:35,592
for Cersei.

792
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:41,634
I strangled my cousin with my own hands

793
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,759
just to get back to Cersei.

794
01:05:47,759 --> 01:05:49,091
I would have murdered

795
01:05:49,175 --> 01:05:53,383
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

796
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:54,592
for Cersei.

797
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,300
She's hateful.

798
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:08,425
And so am I.

799
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:44,509
My lord.

800
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,841
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

801
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:53,634
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

802
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,717
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

803
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,841
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

804
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:06,509
Qyburn...

805
01:09:07,966 --> 01:09:09,759
you're a rational man.

806
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:12,800
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

807
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,342
We have a chance here,

808
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:19,091
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

809
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:20,175
Yes.

810
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:22,925
Help me.

811
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:26,966
I don't want to see this city burn.

812
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:30,342
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

813
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:35,300
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

814
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:39,675
I... I don't want to hear it.

815
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,175
Help me save this city.

816
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,800
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

817
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,592
Your queen.

818
01:09:48,675 --> 01:09:50,800
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

819
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:52,008
You are her subject.

820
01:09:52,091 --> 01:09:54,133
Her reign is over.

821
01:09:54,217 --> 01:09:56,759
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

822
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:59,383
We understand nothing of the sort.

823
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:03,258
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

824
01:10:03,342 --> 01:10:06,258
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

825
01:10:06,342 --> 01:10:09,634
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan...

826
01:10:27,509 --> 01:10:29,675
Ready!

827
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:30,800
Nock!

828
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:34,883
Draw!

829
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:44,008
I know you don't care
about your people.

830
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:47,759
Why should you?

831
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:52,841
They hate you and you hate them.

832
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:00,800
But you're not a monster.

833
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:04,050
I know this.

834
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:09,008
I know this because I've seen it.

835
01:12:12,883 --> 01:12:15,342
You've always loved your children.

836
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:18,841
More than yourself,

837
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,300
more than Jaime...

838
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,550
more than anything.

839
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:30,175
I beg you.

840
01:12:32,383 --> 01:12:35,841
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

841
01:12:39,383 --> 01:12:41,925
Your reign is over,

842
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:45,008
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

843
01:12:47,883 --> 01:12:50,759
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

844
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:42,258
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

845
01:14:07,008 --> 01:14:08,300
Dracarys.

846
01:14:17,509 --> 01:14:19,133
No.

847
01:15:32,776 --> 01:15:40,776

2
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,470
Come in.

3
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,440
And?

4
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,690
Nothing?

5
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,020
She won't eat.

6
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,410
We'll try again at supper.

7
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,240
I think they're watching me.

8
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,670
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

9
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,040
Of course they are. That's their job.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,270
What have I told you, Martha?

11
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,890
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

12
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,070
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

13
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,340
The Northern armies?

14
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,010
Just crossed the Trident.

15
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,800
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

16
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,470
How is she?

17
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,390
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

18
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,400
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

19
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,610
She shouldn't be alone.

20
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,690
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

21
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,650
Aren't you worried for her?

22
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,950
I'm worried for all of us.

23
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,240
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

24
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,490
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

25
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,290
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

26
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,000
We both know what she's about to do.

27
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,220
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

28
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,350
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

29
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,680
What do you want?

30
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,600
All I've ever wanted.

31
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,100
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

32
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,940
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

33
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,240
But I'm quite certain about yours.

34
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,250
I don't want it.

35
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,670
I never have.

36
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,920
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

37
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,680
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

38
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,050
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

39
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,930
But what I tell you now is true:

40
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

41
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,140
She...

42
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,190
is my queen.

43
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,000
Your Grace?

44
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,570
There's something you need to know.

45
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,160
Someone has betrayed me.

46
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes.

47
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,210
Jon Snow.

48
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,260
Varys.

49
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,020
He knows the truth about Jon.

50
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,480
He does.

51
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,400
Because you told him.

52
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,780
You learned from Sansa.

53
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,700
And she learned from Jon,

54
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,410
though I begged him not to tell her.

55
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,960
As I said...

56
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,380
he betrayed me.

57
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,250
I'm glad Sansa told me.

58
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,250
I am your Hand.

59
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,460
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

60
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,430
And Varys?

61
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,890
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

62
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,720
You spoke to him first.

63
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,140
Without coming to me.

64
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,560
Without asking my permission.

65
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,020
It was a mistake.

66
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,780
Why do you think Sansa told you?

67
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,360
- What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.

68
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,240
Yes, she trusts you.

69
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,580
She trusted you to spread secrets

70
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,170
that could destroy your own queen.

71
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,840
And you did not let her down.

72
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,600
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

73
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,810
Our intentions were good.

74
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,230
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

75
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,570
Varys as much as anyone.

76
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
But it doesn't matter now.

77
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,250
No.

78
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,170
It doesn't matter now.

79
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,910
It was me.

80
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,630
I hope I deserve this.

81
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,380
Truly, I do.

82
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,970
I hope I'm wrong.

83
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,770
Goodbye, old friend.

84
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,350
Lord Varys.

85
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,690
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

86
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,740
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons...

87
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,320
sentence you to die.

88
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,460
Dracarys.

89
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,180
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

90
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,890
Her only possession.

91
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,400
It's all right, Torgo Nudho.

92
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,650
Let me speak with him.

93
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,760
What did I say would happen
if you told your sister?

94
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,930
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

95
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,940
She betrayed your trust.

96
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,310
She killed Varys as much as I did.

97
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,150
This was a victory for her.

98
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,110
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

99
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,750
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

100
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,250
I don't have love here.

101
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,460
I only have fear.

102
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,260
I love you.

103
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,010
And you will always be my queen.

104
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,060
Is that all I am to you?

105
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,070
Your queen?

106
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,400
All right, then.

107
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,410
Let it be fear.

108
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,460
The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

109
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,130
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in Meereen.

110
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,090
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

111
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,090
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

112
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,510
They're afraid.

113
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,090
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

114
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,310
You can't expect them to be heroes.

115
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,600
- They're hostages.
- They are.

116
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,980
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

117
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,730
What does it matter
whose fault it is?

118
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,610
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

119
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,070
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

120
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,700
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

121
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,820
weakness.

122
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,660
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

123
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,580
Mercy is our strength.

124
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,370
Our mercy towards future generations

125
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,790
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

126
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,840
Ready the Unsullied.

127
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,260
Tonight you sail for King's Landing
to join the Northern armies.

128
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,060
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

129
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,310
Give them that chance.

130
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,600
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

131
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,070
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

132
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,580
Wait for me outside the city.

133
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,330
You'll know when it's time.

134
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,860
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

135
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,580
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

136
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,000
The next time you fail me...

137
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,960
will be the last time you fail me.

138
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,980
Let them pass.

139
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,830
Through the gate.

140
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,960
Get going.

141
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,580
The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

142
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,540
She wants to attack now.

143
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,340
Daybreak at the earliest.

144
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,680
- Careful with that.
- My lord.

145
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,010
Davos.

146
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,770
I need to ask you a favor.

147
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,150
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

148
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

149
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,200
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

150
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,870
Problem is
when he's got drink in him.

151
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,160
- See what he did the other week?
- Aye. Fighting as well.

152
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,880
Ay up. Where you going?

153
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,340
I'm Arya Stark.

154
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

155
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,310
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

156
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,560
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

157
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,770
I need to go talk to my captain.

158
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,730
Go ahead, talk to him.

159
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,860
Where's he going?

160
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,670
I drink to eat the skull keeper.

161
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,050
I want to eat the skull keeper.

162
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,350
I want to see the...

163
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,980
We speak the common tongue.

164
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,110
Good.

165
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,820
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

166
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,440
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

167
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,490
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

168
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,240
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

169
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,490
No.

170
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,450
Well, in that case,
as Hand of the Queen,

171
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,410
I outrank whomever gave your order.

172
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,080
Probably by quite a lot.

173
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,650
How did they find you?

174
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,410
Did you consider taking it off?

175
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,330
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

176
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,130
And you're going back to her,
to die with her.

177
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,750
You've underestimated her before.

178
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,340
She's going to die.

179
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,680
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

180
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,720
Difficult to do from here.

181
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,400
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

182
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Try.

183
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,520
If not for yourself, if not for her,

184
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,990
then for every one
of the million people in that city,

185
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,490
innocent or otherwise.

186
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,490
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

187
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,280
Innocent or otherwise.

188
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
You do care for one innocent.

189
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,120
I know you do.

190
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,710
And so does Cersei.

191
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,960
She has a reason now.

192
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,590
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

193
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,890
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

194
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,720
It's not impossible that she'll win.

195
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,180
She won't.

196
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,560
Her enemy's forces have been
depleted, as she said they would be.

197
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,270
Two of the three dragons are dead.

198
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,520
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

199
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,570
She has the Lannister army,
the Golden Company...

200
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,530
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

201
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,990
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

202
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,160
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

203
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,330
Why?

204
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,710
Escape.

205
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,790
The two of you, together.

206
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,590
Remember where we met,

207
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,970
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the Red Keep?

208
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,050
Take her down there.

209
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,180
Keep following the stairways down,
down as far as they'll go.

210
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,600
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

211
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,100
A dingy will be waiting for you.

212
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,270
Sail out of the bay.

213
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,020
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

214
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,980
Start a new life.

215
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,740
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

216
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,080
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war...

217
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,620
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

218
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,420
Do it.

219
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,290
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

220
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,380
Swear to me.

221
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,640
You have my word.

222
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,480
If it works,

223
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,440
give the order to ring all the bells
in King's Landing and open the gates.

224
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,650
That will be our signal
that the city surrendered.

225
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,990
I'll try.

226
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,370
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

227
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,950
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

228
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,580
Your queen will execute you for this.

229
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,290
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

230
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,330
without wading through
a river of blood,

231
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,210
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

232
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,550
Tens of thousands
of innocent lives...

233
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,640
one not particularly
innocent dwarf...

234
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,600
it seems like a fair trade.

235
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,530
If it weren't for you,

236
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,660
I never would've survived
my childhood.

237
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,120
You would have.

238
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,960
You were the only one

239
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,880
who didn't treat me like a monster.

240
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,260
You were all I had.

241
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,340
Eyes on the horizon!

242
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,760
Load the scorpion!

243
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,930
- Come on.
- Scorpion three!

244
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,600
Archers, close up!

245
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,610
Up to the espringal!

246
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,400
To the back of it!

247
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,500
Archers, line up!

248
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,220
This way! Come on!

249
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,760
Clear the streets now!

250
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,180
- No!
- In, now.

251
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,430
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!

252
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,310
Quickly.

253
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,230
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

254
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,690
- My son!
- Get inside!

255
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,780
- Just ahead of you, I can see it!
- All right, move it!

256
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,660
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

257
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,160
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!

258
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,330
- Quickly!
- All the way!

259
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,660
- Come on!
- Come on!

260
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,060
- Keep moving!
- Make way for the Golden Company!

261
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,320
Close the gate!

262
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,050
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

263
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,470
Call off your men.

264
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,070
Move along now, lads.

265
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,810
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.

266
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

267
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,320
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.

268
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,320
- Move.
- Stay with him.

269
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,280
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.

270
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,490
Get behind there.

271
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,160
Close the gate!

272
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,880
- No.
- No, Mommy.

273
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
- Vicky! Please!
- No, please, sir!

274
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,090
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!

275
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,220
- Open it!
- Open the gate!

276
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,060
- Get back.
- Look, try that one. Go. Go.

277
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,850
The gates are locked now!

278
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,480
Open! Open the gate!

279
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,950
Soldier! Soldier!

280
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,320
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

281
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,910
Stay back! It's closed!

282
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,450
Soldier!

283
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,870
Move away! Stop!

284
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,500
Let us in!

285
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,040
We're not leaving!

286
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,320
Turn!

287
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,300
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!

288
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,680
Get back! Back!

289
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,190
Fire!

290
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,800
Ready!

291
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,340
Move!

292
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,680
Fire!

293
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,850
- Reload!
- Reload!

294
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,600
Faster!

295
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,890
Hurry!

296
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,780
Fire!

297
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,770
Go!

298
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,860
Run!

299
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,000
Your Grace.

300
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,460
All we need is one good shot.

301
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,170
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, Your Grace.

302
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,800
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

303
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,640
Euron killed one of her dragons.

304
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,890
He can kill another.

305
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,400
Your Grace,
the Iron Fleet is burning.

306
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,270
The gates have been breached.

307
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,520
The Golden Company...

308
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,780
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

309
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,030
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

310
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,450
Yes, Your Grace.

311
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,200
The Red Keep has never fallen.

312
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,830
It won't fall today.

313
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,900
No, no, no!

314
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,360
Move, move!

315
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,470
Run.

316
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,050
Run!

317
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,390
Come on!

318
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,070
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

319
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,110
The bells!

320
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,620
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

321
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,620
Ring the bloody bells!

322
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,500
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

323
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,370
- Tell the queen to ring the bells.
- Ring the bells!

324
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,540
Ring the bell!

325
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,590
This way.

326
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,230
Ring the bell!

327
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,020
Ring the bell!

328
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,270
Ring them!

329
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,780
Ring the bells!

330
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,820
Ring the bells!

331
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,200
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!

332
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,540
In the name of the...

333
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,720
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!

334
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,930
Hurry up!

335
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,030
Ring the bells!

336
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,050
No!

337
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,260
Get back!

338
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,430
Get back!

339
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,970
Stay! Stay!

340
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,730
Quickly. Quickly.

341
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,240
Stop!

342
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,680
- Come here!
- Get off him!

343
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,720
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

344
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,600
No!

345
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,710
Go!

346
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,220
Go!

347
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,760
Find somewhere to hide.

348
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,680
The Kingslayer.

349
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,770
We need to get the queen
out of King's Landing.

350
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,890
Listen.

351
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,650
That's the sound of a city dying.

352
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,400
It's over.

353
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,030
Well, maybe for you.

354
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,410
If you kill another king
before you die...

355
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,280
they'll sing about you forever.

356
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,040
You're no king.

357
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,540
Oh, but I am.

358
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,080
And I fucked the queen.

359
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,760
If I win...

360
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:10,590
I'll bring your head to Cersei
so you can kiss her one last time.

361
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,580
Your Grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

362
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,740
The Red Keep is the safest place
in the city.

363
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:02,040
The Unsullied have breached the gates
of the Red Keep.

364
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,180
Maegor's Holdfast would be
a better place to wait out the storm.

365
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,050
You fought well...

366
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,590
for a cripple.

367
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,600
Another king for you.

368
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,410
But I got you!

369
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,080
I got you!

370
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,460
I'm the man
who killed Jaime Lannister.

371
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,990
Go home, girl.

372
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,490
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

373
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,620
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

374
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,040
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

375
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,420
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

376
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,880
I'm going to kill her.

377
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,300
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

378
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,010
I've been after it all my life.

379
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,260
It's all I care about.

380
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,390
And look at me. Look at me!

381
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,430
You wanna be like me?

382
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,280
You come with me, you die here.

383
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,790
Sandor.

384
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,800
Thank you.

385
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,950
Your Grace.

386
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,010
Hello, big brother.

387
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,640
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

388
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,280
Ser Gregor, I command you.

389
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,910
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

390
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,930
Yeah, that's you.

391
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,010
That's what you've always been.

392
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,110
You're hurt.

393
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:11,320
It doesn't matter.

394
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,290
You're bleeding.

395
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,560
Alanna!

396
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,850
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

397
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,770
Have you seen my wife?

398
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,480
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

399
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,420
Out of the way!

400
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,780
No!

401
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,800
Take my hand.

402
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,970
Take my hand.

403
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,390
Get up. Get up.

404
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,110
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

405
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,230
No!

406
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:02,990
Fucking die!

407
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:39,290
We need to fall back!

408
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,750
Fall back behind the wall!

409
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,880
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

410
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,590
Get out of the city!

411
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,340
Fall back!

412
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,850
Fall back!

413
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,180
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

414
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,970
You can't stay here.

415
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,470
You have to keep moving.

416
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,060
We can't go out there.

417
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,180
You have to.

418
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,270
Everyone out there is dead.

419
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,730
If you stay here, you'll die.

420
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,320
Follow me.

421
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,190
Follow me!

422
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,490
- Come on, quickly. Come to me.
- Lean him up there.

423
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,410
Come on, quickly. All of you.

424
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,370
Run!

425
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,170
Run!

426
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,140
Mama!

427
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,390
Mama!

428
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,430
Mama! No.

429
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,480
Mama! Mama!

430
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,770
Mama!

431
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,570
Get up.

432
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,400
Get up!

433
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,990
We have to keep moving.

434
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,950
Take her.

435
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,000
Take her!

436
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,500
- Take her.
- Come on!

437
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,630
Come on!

438
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,810
This way.

439
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,490
I want our baby to live.

440
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,790
I want our baby to live.

441
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,710
I want our baby to live.

442
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,840
Don't let me die, Jaime.

443
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

444
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,800
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

445
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,050
I don't want to die.

446
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,640
Just look... Look at me.

447
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,770
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

448
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,190
- Not like this. Not like this.
- Look... Look... Look me in the eye.

449
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,690
Don't look away. Don't look...

450
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,980
Look at me! Just look at me.

451
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,740
Nothing else matters.

452
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,240
Nothing else matters.

453
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,620
Only us.

454
01:12:08,305 --> 01:13:08,535

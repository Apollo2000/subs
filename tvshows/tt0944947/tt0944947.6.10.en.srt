00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:19,970
<i>Your Grace.</i>

3
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:23,707
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

4
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,541
You got my money?

5
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,943
Later.
Go away.

6
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,056
Grand Maester.

7
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,932
Ser Loras Tyrell.

8
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,504
Are you prepared to stand trial

9
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:04,307
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

10
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,312
There'll be no need for a trial.

11
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,217
I confess before the Seven

12
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
and freely admit to my crimes.

13
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,557
To which crimes
will you be confessing?

14
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,993
All of them.

15
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,430
I lay with other men

16
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,966
including the traitor
Renly Baratheon.

17
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,239
<i>I perjured myself before the gods.</i>

18
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,642
I am guilty of depravity...

19
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,145
dishonesty,

20
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,714
profligacy,

21
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:46,683
<i>and arrogance.</i>

22
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,218
I see that now.

23
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,823
I humble myself before the Seven

24
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:56,326
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

25
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:03,233
The gods' judgment is fierce,

26
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,869
but also fair.

27
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:09,339
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

28
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,708
beyond the reach of justice.

29
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:16,279
But the Mother shows her mercy

30
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:20,183
to those who kneel before her.

31
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,927
<i>I take full
responsibility for my many sins</i>

32
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,530
and unburden myself of my desires.

33
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:39,936
My only remaining wish

34
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,639
is to devote my life to the Seven.

35
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,809
<i>May I be a living example
of their grace</i>

36
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,578
<i>for others to witness.</i>

37
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,617
You understand fully

38
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,552
what this means?

39
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,154
I do.

40
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,858
I will abandon the Tyrell name

41
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,995
and all that goes with it.

42
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:08,865
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

43
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,738
I will never marry

44
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,240
and I will never father children.

45
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,779
<i>Brother Loras...</i>

46
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:27,651
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

47
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,691
Will you fight to defend your faith

48
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,227
against heretics and apostates?

49
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,829
I will.

50
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,192
No, I can't let them--

51
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:12,262
Faith is the way, Father.

52
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,986
All right.

53
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:38,922
I'm ready.

54
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,865
I have to go.
I'm--

55
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,901
I'm late for the trial.

56
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,149
<i>You mutilated him.</i>

57
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,151
You gave me your word.

58
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,620
And I have kept my word.

59
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,490
<i>Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,</i>

60
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,625
<i>Brother Loras is free to leave.</i>

61
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,627
And where is the queen mother?

62
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:20,997
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

63
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:25,035
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

64
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,106
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

65
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,735
Get the others.

66
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,712
Where's the king?

67
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,617
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

68
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,352
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,321
I was told that--

70
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,889
ah.

71
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,091
I have more important
things to do with my time

72
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,559
than waste them
in the presence--

73
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:59,329
Please, Grand Maester.
I bear you no ill will.

74
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,133
Please forgive me if you can.

75
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,033
This pains me, my lord.

76
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,202
Whatever your faults,
you do not deserve

77
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:42,272
to die alone in such
a cold, dark place.

78
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:46,109
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

79
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:50,346
the old must be put to rest.

80
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:34,624
The longer you wait,
the worse it'll be for you.

81
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:03,620
What are you doing?

82
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,056
There's something wrong.

83
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,625
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

84
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:17,594
The trial will begin shortly.

85
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:20,396
Cersei is not here.
Tommen is not here.

86
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:21,858
Why do you think they're not here?

87
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,766
If the accused is not here,

88
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:25,935
she will be tried regardless.

89
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,271
We cannot escape
the justice of the gods--

90
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:31,007
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you.

91
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:34,544
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

92
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,412
and she is absent anyway,

93
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:40,383
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

94
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:44,354
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

95
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,248
We all need to leave now.

96
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:19,656
Loras.

97
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,924
Stay with me.

98
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:37,173
Let me through.
Let me through.

99
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,344
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

100
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,587
Let us through.

101
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,079
<i>Confess.</i>

102
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,216
<i>Confess.</i>

103
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,556
- No.
- Confess.

104
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:46,002
Confess.
It felt good.

105
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:49,806
Beating me, starving me,

106
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,809
frightening me, humiliating me.

107
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,581
<i>You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.</i>

108
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,818
You did it because it felt good.

109
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,153
<i>I understand.</i>

110
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:07,423
I do things because they feel good.

111
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:13,729
I drink because it feels good.

112
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:17,934
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

113
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:26,242
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

114
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,411
I lie about fucking my brother...

115
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:34,450
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

116
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,021
I killed your High Sparrow...

117
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,159
<i>and all his little sparrows...</i>

118
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,097
all his septons, all his septas,

119
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:51,033
all his filthy soldiers,

120
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:54,337
because it felt good
to watch them burn.

121
00:19:56,174 --> 00:20:00,009
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

122
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:03,446
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

123
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:12,655
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

124
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,863
You've always been quiet.

125
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,807
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

126
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,976
Do you remember?

127
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:36,045
Good.

128
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,583
I'm glad to see your face.

129
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,421
I'm ready to meet the gods.

130
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:46,856
What?

131
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,793
Now?

132
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,361
Today?

133
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,867
You're not going to die today.

134
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,838
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

135
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:07,243
Ser Gregor.

136
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,549
<i>This is Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

137
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:16,252
He's quiet, too.

138
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,998
Your gods have forsaken you.

139
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:32,368
This is your god now.

140
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:45,381
No.

141
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:47,650
No.

142
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:52,421
Shame.

143
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,758
Shame.

144
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,562
Shame.

145
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,969
<i>I'm very sorry, Your Grace.</i>

146
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,272
Very sorry.

147
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:56,419
<i>For House Lannister!</i>

148
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,454
<i>Hear me roar!</i>

149
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:06,295
For House Frey!

150
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,465
We stand together!

151
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,435
May we stand together
through the centuries,

152
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:15,004
good friends to the last.

153
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:19,141
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

154
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:23,045
may we speak the words
of our alliance,

155
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:26,549
"The Freys and the Lannisters

156
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:28,851
send their regards."

157
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,671
You don't even have
to do anything, do you?

158
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,341
You just sit there,
a rich slab of beef,

159
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:53,876
and all the birds come pecking.

160
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,378
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

161
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,881
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

162
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,852
Those two have their eyes on you.

163
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:06,722
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

164
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,624
Not my type.

165
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:10,292
Not blonde enough?

166
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:16,198
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

167
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,467
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

168
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,936
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

169
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,741
Fuck it.

170
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:29,011
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

171
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,752
This came together rather well.

172
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,656
Your father would be pleased.

173
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,424
I'm sure he would be.

174
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:47,897
Edmure is back in a cell.

175
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,634
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

176
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:53,903
Give the family a bad name.

177
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:01,310
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

178
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:04,313
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

179
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:08,083
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

180
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:10,719
I'm a bit old for all that.

181
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:13,522
No, but back in your day.

182
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:16,559
The purpose of fighting

183
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:19,862
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

184
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:21,964
I've defeated mine.

185
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:25,768
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

186
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,436
Now it's mine.

187
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:29,839
What do you call that?

188
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,207
Victory.

189
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:33,809
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

190
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:39,181
Go on, mock me, boy.
You think I mind?

191
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:42,017
The Tullys mocked me for years.

192
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,286
The Starks mocked me.

193
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:45,855
Where are they now?

194
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:48,424
<i>You talk about war
as if you're an expert,</i>

195
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:50,826
but the one battle
I remember you fighting,

196
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:53,829
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

197
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:56,832
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

198
00:25:56,934 --> 00:26:00,269
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

199
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:04,240
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

200
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:07,343
and snigger behind our backs.

201
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:09,011
We don't mind, do we?

202
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:13,082
Fear is a marvelous thing.

203
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:14,783
They don't fear the Freys, though.

204
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:17,620
They fear the Lannisters.

205
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,089
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

206
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:22,625
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

207
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,127
every time you lose them,

208
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:27,196
why do we need you?

209
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:50,552
Show me.

210
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:55,324
Your Grace,
there's no need--

211
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,792
Show me.

212
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:13,108
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

213
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,878
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

214
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,748
<i>perhaps a ceremony
in the throne room?</i>

215
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:24,353
He should be with his grandfather,

216
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:27,289
his brother, his sister.

217
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,394
Burn him

218
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:35,464
and bury his ashes
where the sept once stood.

219
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,412
Whoa, whoa.

220
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,556
Hello.

221
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:45,034
From Lord Commander Snow
at Castle Black.

222
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,917
I'm--

223
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:03,519
I'm to be the new maester.

224
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,002
Oh.

225
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:22,504
According to our records,

226
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,373
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

227
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:27,509
He died.

228
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:30,179
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

229
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:33,415
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

230
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,784
He's since passed away.

231
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,922
Which is why I'm here.

232
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:45,127
This is irregular.

233
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:49,898
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

234
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:05,581
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

235
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:11,186
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

236
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:13,155
Follow me.

237
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:18,127
No women or children.

238
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:14,676
When we had feasts,

239
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:17,045
our family would sit up here...

240
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,949
and I'd sit down there.

241
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:25,854
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

242
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:27,723
You had a family.

243
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,991
You had feasts.

244
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:34,296
Aye, you're right.
I was luckier than most.

245
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,413
What is that?

246
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,983
Tell him.

247
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,222
<i>Tell him who it belonged to.</i>

248
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:06,695
The Princess Shireen.

249
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:09,097
Tell him what you did to her.

250
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,267
Tell him!

251
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:20,676
We burned her at the stake.

252
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,158
Why?

253
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,361
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

254
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:42,531
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

255
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,066
I only do what my Lord commands.

256
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:47,302
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

257
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:52,307
We are standing here because of him.

258
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:57,079
<i>Jon Snow is alive
because the Lord willed it.</i>

259
00:33:57,181 --> 00:34:00,782
I loved that girl
like she was my own.

260
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:04,186
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

261
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,856
So did her father.

262
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,626
So did her mother.

263
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:16,064
<i>Her own blood knew
it was the only way.</i>

264
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,767
The only way for what?

265
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:20,369
They all died anyway.

266
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,239
You told everyone
Stannis was the one.

267
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:26,675
You had him believing it,
all of them fooled.

268
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:29,244
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

269
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,314
I was wrong.

270
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,650
<i>Aye, you were wrong.</i>

271
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:39,388
How many died because you were wrong?

272
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:48,263
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

273
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:50,165
<i>She admits to the crime.</i>

274
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:55,070
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

275
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,674
I've been ready
to die for many years.

276
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:04,513
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

277
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:07,816
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

278
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:11,186
You know the great war
is still to come.

279
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:14,256
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

280
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:18,059
And you know I can
help you win that war.

281
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,209
Ride south today.

282
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:37,612
If you return to the North,

283
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:40,315
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

284
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,669
If you ever come back this way,

285
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:03,138
I will execute you myself.

286
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:37,939
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

287
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:41,710
Mother and Father's room?

288
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,013
You should take it.

289
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,383
I'm not a Stark.

290
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:50,886
You are to me.

291
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:56,224
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

292
00:36:56,326 --> 00:37:00,228
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

293
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,832
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

294
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,134
They came because of you.

295
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,074
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

296
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:14,943
- He did.
- And you trust him?

297
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:18,680
Only a fool
would trust Littlefinger.

298
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:24,586
I should have told you about him,

299
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:28,023
about the Knights of the Vale.

300
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,591
I'm sorry.

301
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:42,871
We need to trust each other.

302
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:45,974
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

303
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:48,577
We have so many enemies now.

304
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:06,861
Jon.

305
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:10,398
A raven came from the Citadel.

306
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,400
A white raven.

307
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,638
Winter is here.

308
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:32,053
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

309
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:49,304
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

310
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:51,506
he was assassinated.

311
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:54,175
100 red scorpions, was it?

312
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:56,778
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

313
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,014
You murder your own prince,

314
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:00,849
but you expect me to trust you?

315
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:03,918
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

316
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:06,287
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

317
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,890
What is your name again?

318
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,358
Barbaro?

319
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,060
Obara.

320
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:15,296
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

321
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:18,033
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

322
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:21,469
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes--

323
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:25,073
Do shut up, dear.
Anything from you?

324
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,075
No? Good.

325
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:29,577
Let the grown women speak.

326
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,381
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

327
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:36,451
They have declared war on Dorne.

328
00:39:36,553 --> 00:39:40,188
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

329
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:44,459
Cersei stole the future from me.

330
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,327
She killed my son.

331
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,463
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

332
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:51,766
She killed my granddaughter.

333
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,703
Survival is not what I'm after now.

334
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,971
You're absolutely right.

335
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,641
I chose the wrong words.

336
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:02,243
It is not survival I offer.

337
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:04,679
It is your heart's desire.

338
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:09,718
And what is my heart's desire?

339
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:13,521
Vengeance.

340
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:14,723
Justice.

341
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:20,328
Fire and blood.

342
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,604
Your ships are nearly ready.

343
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,006
I saw them painting the sails.

344
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:39,247
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

345
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,249
You're not coming with us.

346
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,855
New strategy?

347
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:50,158
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

348
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,861
If we take Casterly Rock,

349
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:56,531
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

350
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,566
You're not going to Westeros.

351
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:01,603
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

352
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:04,339
There's finally peace in Meereen.

353
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:07,776
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

354
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,879
Fuck Meereen.

355
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,881
Fuck the people.

356
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:15,250
I'm here for you, not them.

357
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:17,018
You promised me.

358
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,054
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

359
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:23,258
<i>This is what I command.</i>

360
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,361
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

361
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,963
I'll need to make alliances.

362
00:41:29,065 --> 00:41:32,433
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

363
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,605
Who are you marrying this time?

364
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:41,075
I don't know.
Maybe no one.

365
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:44,279
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

366
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:46,347
Are you a queen or fish bait?

367
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:51,753
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

368
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:54,088
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

369
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:57,091
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

370
00:41:57,194 --> 00:42:00,495
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

371
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:02,697
sits beside you in the throne room.

372
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:05,834
I don't want a crown.
I want you.

373
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:15,009
I love you.

374
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:17,579
And I make you happy.

375
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:19,547
You know I do.

376
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:25,486
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

377
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:34,362
I can't.

378
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:45,840
The dwarf told you to do this?

379
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:47,609
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

380
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:50,879
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

381
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,714
I'm no use to you over there.

382
00:42:52,816 --> 00:42:54,082
Don't get angry.

383
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:57,352
I'm not angry.
I'm full of self-pity.

384
00:42:57,454 --> 00:42:59,053
Who comes after you?

385
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,323
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

386
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:04,692
A great number of women, I imagine.

387
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:12,734
Specific orders will be left for you

388
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:15,770
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

389
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:17,672
Bay of Dragons?

390
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,775
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

391
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,081
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

392
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,618
I hope it brings you happiness.

393
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:38,293
I pity the lords of Westeros.

394
00:43:38,395 --> 00:43:40,561
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

395
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:44,599
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

396
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:05,586
How did he take it?

397
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:07,755
No tears.

398
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:12,460
I know it was hard for you.

399
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:14,595
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

400
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:17,598
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

401
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,871
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

402
00:44:23,974 --> 00:44:26,140
if it's any consolation.

403
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:30,845
It's not.

404
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:33,247
No, I suppose not.

405
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,882
I'm terrible at consoling.

406
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,285
Yes, you really are.

407
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:44,659
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

408
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:49,030
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

409
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:51,132
you have your dragons.

410
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:53,201
Everything you've ever wanted

411
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:56,204
since you were old enough
to want anything,

412
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:58,172
it's all yours for the taking.

413
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:01,876
Are you afraid?

414
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,914
Good.

415
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:09,751
You're in the great game now.

416
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:12,420
And the great game's terrifying.

417
00:45:12,522 --> 00:45:14,989
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

418
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,191
are madmen like your father.

419
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:21,396
Do you know what frightens me?

420
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:25,533
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

421
00:45:27,404 --> 00:45:30,972
A man I thought I cared for.

422
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:33,041
And I felt nothing.

423
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,544
Just impatient to get on with it.

424
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,717
He wasn't the first to love you

425
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:44,886
and he won't be the last.

426
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,694
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

427
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:58,733
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

428
00:45:58,835 --> 00:46:00,968
for as long as I can remember.

429
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:03,871
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things--

430
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:07,708
family, gods, kings, myself.

431
00:46:07,811 --> 00:46:09,644
It was often tempting

432
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:12,080
until I saw where belief got people.

433
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,050
So I said no, thank you to belief.

434
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:19,454
And yet here I am.

435
00:46:22,158 --> 00:46:24,425
I believe in you.

436
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:28,763
It's embarrassing, really.

437
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:32,633
I'd swear you my sword,

438
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:35,770
but I don't actually own a sword.

439
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,872
It's your counsel I need.

440
00:46:37,974 --> 00:46:40,408
It's yours.

441
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,943
Now and always.

442
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,279
Good.

443
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,616
I, um...

444
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:50,485
I had something made for you.

445
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:54,722
I'm not sure if it's right.

446
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:06,734
Tyrion Lannister,

447
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:08,736
I name you Hand of the Queen.

448
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:45,506
You're not one of mine, are you?

449
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,108
No, my lord.

450
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,876
Didn't think so.

451
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:51,212
Too pretty.

452
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:58,286
Where are my damn moron sons?

453
00:47:58,388 --> 00:48:02,123
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

454
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:04,058
They're here, my lord.

455
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,461
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

456
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:09,630
Tell them to come here now.

457
00:48:09,732 --> 00:48:11,999
But they're already here, my lord.

458
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,040
Here, my lord.

459
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,360
They weren't easy to carve.

460
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,930
Especially Black Walder.

461
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:45,600
What...

462
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:54,675
My name is Arya Stark.

463
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:56,277
I want you to know that.

464
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:59,113
The last thing
you're ever going to see

465
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:01,949
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

466
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,739
Forgive me, my lady...

467
00:50:00,176 --> 00:50:03,177
if you're at prayer.

468
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,279
I'm done with all that.

469
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:10,017
I came here every day
when I was a girl.

470
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:14,555
I prayed to be somewhere else.

471
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:16,757
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

472
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,693
never about what I had.

473
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:23,898
I was a stupid girl.

474
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,933
You were a child.

475
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:31,706
What do you want?

476
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:34,175
I thought you knew what I wanted.

477
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:35,876
I was wrong.

478
00:50:35,978 --> 00:50:38,646
No, you weren't.

479
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:43,315
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

480
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:45,651
I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

481
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:50,756
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

482
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:54,993
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

483
00:50:56,964 --> 00:50:59,732
Pull it out of my mind

484
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:01,667
and into the world?

485
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:06,739
And I only act if the answer is yes.

486
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:14,079
A picture of me on the Iron Throne...

487
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:18,784
and you by my side.

488
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:30,763
It's a pretty picture.

489
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,805
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

490
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:43,408
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

491
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,978
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

492
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,781
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

493
00:51:48,883 --> 00:51:51,083
The past is gone for good.

494
00:51:51,185 --> 00:51:53,252
You can sit here
mourning its departure

495
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:56,288
or you can prepare for the future.

496
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,857
You, my love,

497
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:01,593
are the future of House Stark.

498
00:52:01,695 --> 00:52:05,364
Who should the North rally behind?

499
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:08,133
A trueborn daughter
of Ned and Catelyn Stark

500
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:10,135
born here at Winterfell

501
00:52:10,237 --> 00:52:13,438
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

502
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,134
This is where I leave you.

503
00:52:42,236 --> 00:52:44,036
You're not coming with us?

504
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:48,907
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

505
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:52,177
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

506
00:52:53,981 --> 00:52:56,048
Strong magic

507
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,284
to protect men from what lies beyond.

508
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:03,222
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

509
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:04,324
I cannot pass.

510
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,975
Where will you go?

511
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,610
The great war is coming

512
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:27,512
<i>and I still fight for the living.</i>

513
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,683
I'll do what I can...

514
00:53:33,053 --> 00:53:35,254
as long as I can.

515
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:41,260
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

516
00:53:41,362 --> 00:53:43,695
I wish you both good fortune.

517
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,504
Are you sure you're ready for this?

518
00:54:25,606 --> 00:54:28,707
I'm the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

519
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:31,043
I have to be ready for this.

520
00:55:04,645 --> 00:55:07,279
<i>Ned?</i>

521
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:09,881
Lyanna.

522
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:12,084
Is that you?

523
00:55:15,856 --> 00:55:17,856
Is that really you?

524
00:55:22,796 --> 00:55:24,696
You're not a dream?

525
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,933
No, I'm not a dream.

526
00:55:29,603 --> 00:55:31,470
I'm here.

527
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,906
Right here.

528
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,342
I've missed you, big brother.

529
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:42,681
I've missed you, too.

530
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:48,920
I want to be brave.

531
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:51,456
Shh.

532
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:54,059
You are.

533
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:56,895
I'm not.

534
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:01,867
I don't want to die.

535
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:04,202
You're not going to die.

536
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:09,841
Get her some water.

537
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:12,244
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

538
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:14,679
Listen to me, Ned.

539
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:23,822
If Robert
finds out, he'll--

540
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:25,791
you know he will.

541
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:27,759
You have to protect him.

542
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:32,731
Promise me, Ned.

543
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,002
Promise me.

544
00:56:49,149 --> 00:56:51,116
Promise me, Ned.

545
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:57,389
Promise me.

546
00:57:27,955 --> 00:57:30,856
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

547
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,592
to side with wildling invaders.

548
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:37,629
We didn't invade.
We were invited.

549
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:39,431
Not by me.

550
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:41,333
The free folk, the northerners,

551
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:43,802
and the Knights of the Vale
fought bravely,

552
00:57:43,904 --> 00:57:46,204
fought together, and we won.

553
00:57:46,306 --> 00:57:51,042
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

554
00:57:51,145 --> 00:57:53,745
The Boltons are defeated.

555
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,780
The war is over.

556
00:57:55,883 --> 00:57:57,782
Winter has come.

557
00:57:57,885 --> 00:58:01,386
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

558
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:04,923
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

559
00:58:05,025 --> 00:58:07,125
The war is not over.

560
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:09,261
And I promise you, friend,

561
00:58:09,363 --> 00:58:12,297
the true enemy
won't wait out the storm.

562
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:13,899
He brings the storm.

563
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:37,956
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

564
00:58:38,058 --> 00:58:39,891
but you refused the call.

565
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,231
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

566
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,934
but in their hour of greatest need,

567
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:51,036
you refused the call.

568
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,173
<i>And you, Lord Cerwyn,</i>

569
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:59,144
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

570
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:01,713
Still you refused the call.

571
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:08,687
<i>But House Mormont remembers.</i>

572
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:11,489
The North remembers.

573
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:16,161
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

574
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,698
<i>I don't care if he's a bastard.</i>

575
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,400
<i>Ned Stark's blood
runs through his veins.</i>

576
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:26,972
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

577
00:59:43,657 --> 00:59:46,224
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

578
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:47,626
and truly.

579
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:56,134
My son died for Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

580
00:59:56,236 --> 00:59:59,304
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

581
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:01,840
I didn't commit my men to your cause

582
01:00:01,942 --> 01:00:04,576
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

583
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:08,313
But I was wrong.

584
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:16,254
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

585
01:00:16,356 --> 01:00:18,757
<i> He is the White Wolf.</i>

586
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:21,793
The King in the North.

587
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:31,736
I did not fight
beside you on the field

588
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,273
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

589
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:40,011
<i>A man can only admit
when he was wrong</i>

590
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:41,680
and ask forgiveness.

591
01:00:44,685 --> 01:00:46,985
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

592
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:52,090
There will be more fights to come.

593
01:00:52,192 --> 01:00:55,727
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

594
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:58,129
as we have for a thousand years.

595
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:02,200
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

596
01:01:04,638 --> 01:01:06,705
the King in the North!

597
01:01:08,608 --> 01:01:11,509
The King in the North!

598
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:14,913
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

599
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:18,350
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

600
01:01:18,452 --> 01:01:21,653
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

601
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:25,256
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

602
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,027
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

603
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:32,997
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

604
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,967
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

605
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:39,237
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

606
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:42,540
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

607
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:45,944
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

608
01:01:46,046 --> 01:01:48,880
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

609
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:57,088
<i>Company halt!</i>

610
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:01,559
<i>Halt!</i>

611
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,563
<i>Halt!</i>

612
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,243
Come on.

613
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,001
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

614
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:19,737
First of Her Name,

615
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,208
<i>Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

616
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,511
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

617
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,425
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

618
01:04:14,528 --> 01:04:16,694
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

619
01:04:17,305 --> 01:05:17,607

3
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,143
It's coming from the courtyard.

4
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,650
It's the Lord Commander!

5
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,699
Help me get him inside.

6
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,923
Thorne did this.

7
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:55,397
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

8
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,098
Trust?

9
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,570
The men in this room.

10
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,524
Does the wolf know you?

11
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,609
We need all the help we can get.

12
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,951
Ser Davos.

13
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:00,829
I saw him in the flames

14
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,081
fighting at Winterfell.

15
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,254
I can't speak for the flames...

16
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:12,974
but he's gone.

17
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,863
He was our Lord Commander.

18
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,781
He never should have been!

19
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,460
You all know why you're here.

20
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,259
Jon Snow is dead.

21
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:49,544
Who killed him?

22
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:52,514
I did.

23
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,883
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

24
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,268
and the other officers in this castle.

25
00:06:57,387 --> 00:06:59,054
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

26
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,110
You're right!

27
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,445
We've committed treason, all of us.

28
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:10,649
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

29
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,451
I had no love for him.

30
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,904
That was no secret.

31
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,241
But I never once disobeyed an order.

32
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:22,744
Loyalty is the foundation

33
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,879
on which the Night's Watch is built.

34
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,332
And the Watch means everything to me.

35
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,384
I have given my life,

36
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,588
we have all given our
lives to the Night's Watch.

37
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:40,478
Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

38
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:43,181
He let the wildlings through our gates

39
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:46,735
as no Lord Commander has ever done before.

40
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,606
He gave them the very
land on which they reaved

41
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:55,443
and raped and murdered.

42
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,781
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

43
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:02,784
I've no doubt about that.

44
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,088
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

45
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:10,375
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

46
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,628
And we made it.

47
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:27,642
He'll have seen we didn't come.

48
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,811
Thorne will have made it official by now.

49
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:31,396
Castle Black is his.

50
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:34,649
I don't care who's
sitting at the high table.

51
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:36,317
Jon was my friend.

52
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:39,621
And those fuckers butchered him.

53
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:42,157
Now we return the favor.

54
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:43,658
We don't have the numbers.

55
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,710
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

56
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,829
I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,

57
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:51,132
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

58
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:55,720
If you were planning to see
tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.

59
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,006
We all die today.

60
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,809
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

61
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:04,312
We need to fight, but
we don't need to die.

62
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,815
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

63
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,268
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

64
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:20,195
Bolt the door.

65
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,197
Don't let anyone in.

66
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:24,365
I'll be back as soon as I can.

67
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:37,629
She was 11 the first time I saw her.

68
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,383
The kennelmaster's daughter.

69
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,805
She smelled of dog.

70
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:53,728
I wasn't much older, but
everybody was already afraid of me.

71
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,398
You certainly were.

72
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,405
Myranda wasn't, though.

73
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:08,376
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

74
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,328
She was fearless.

75
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:13,081
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

76
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:22,590
Your pain will be paid
for a thousand times over.

77
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:28,263
I wish you could be here to watch.

78
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,187
Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?

79
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:40,692
Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

80
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:47,832
Buried, burned?

81
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,584
This is good meat.

82
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,119
Feed it to the hounds.

83
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,840
Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

84
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,843
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

85
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,596
Do you know who struck the killing blow?

86
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,681
- No.
- A shame.

87
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,683
I'd reward the man.

88
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:09,103
Still, a great victory.

89
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,222
Do you feel like a victor?

90
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:18,196
I rebelled against the crown

91
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,365
to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.

92
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,984
Do you think that burning
wagons in the night

93
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:25,320
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

94
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:28,740
is the same as facing a prepared
Nd provisioned Lannister army?

95
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:33,244
No.

96
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,831
A reckoning will come.

97
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,549
We need the North to face it.

98
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:40,501
The entire North.

99
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,838
They won't back us without Sansa Stark.

100
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,592
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

101
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,894
You played your games with her.

102
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,326
You played your games with
the heir to the Iron Islands

103
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,599
and now they're both gone.

104
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,517
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

105
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,152
They won't get far.

106
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,238
I'm glad to hear it.

107
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:03,658
Without Sansa, you won't
be able to produce an heir.

108
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:06,828
And without an heir, well...

109
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:12,000
let's hope the maesters are right

110
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:14,002
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

111
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,357
We can't stop.

112
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,577
We have to cross here.

113
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:00,797
I can't.

114
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,248
It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

115
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,802
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

116
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:07,422
I've seen what his hounds do to a person.

117
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:09,507
This way is better.

118
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,125
Over here. Come on.

119
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:00,892
Sansa.

120
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:03,945
Sansa.

121
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:27,135
Tell them to settle down!

122
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,469
Stay here. I'll lure them away.

123
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,671
No, I won't make it without you.

124
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,507
You will.

125
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:34,842
Go north, only north.

126
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,761
Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.

127
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:38,513
He'll help you.

128
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:50,241
See somebody, eh?

129
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,860
- There they are!
- Get them!

130
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,866
Where is Lady Bolton?

131
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,869
- Dead.
- Liar.

132
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:05,206
She broke her leg
jumping from the ramparts.

133
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,375
I left her to die in the snow.

134
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:14,348
Got something! Run!

135
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:17,969
Hyah!

136
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,813
Resist. Stay.

137
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Stay.

138
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:37,238
I can't wait to see what parts
Ramsay cuts off you this time.

139
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:47,915
Rider! Who is it?

140
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,551
It's a bloody woman.

141
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,154
No! Please!

142
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:56,294
Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

143
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,047
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

144
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,383
and give my life for yours if need be.

145
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,053
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

146
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,865
And I vow...

147
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:23,070
that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

148
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:25,039
and...

149
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,993
Meat and mead at my table.

150
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,245
... meat and mead at my table.

151
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:38,336
And I pledge to ask no service of you

152
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,921
that might bring you dishonor.

153
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:44,258
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

154
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:47,345
Arise.

155
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:35,943
Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you.

156
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,612
A ship from Dorne has
sailed into the harbor.

157
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,732
Myrcella.

158
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,725
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dead body?

159
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:00,728
Mother.

160
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,732
All I could think about when she died

161
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,034
was what would happen to her now.

162
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:13,657
Every day, every night,

163
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:16,076
what does Mama look like now?

164
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,714
Has she started to bloat?

165
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:24,752
Has her skin turned black?

166
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,923
Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?

167
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,764
I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.

168
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,151
I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

169
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,438
Shh, shh. Don't think about it.

170
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,240
I have to.

171
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,411
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

172
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:53,747
She's not suffering. She's gone.

173
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,700
No one can hurt her anymore.

174
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,087
She was good.

175
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:04,375
From her first breath, she was so sweet.

176
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:08,128
I don't know where she came from.

177
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:13,133
She was nothing like me.

178
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,686
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

179
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,471
I know.

180
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:21,809
I thought if I could
make something so good,

181
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:24,478
so pure...

182
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,817
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- Listen... listen to me.

183
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,453
She was my daughter and I failed her.

184
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:35,039
No, I knew this would happen.

185
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:37,291
The witch told me years ago.

186
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:42,329
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

187
00:22:42,415 --> 00:22:44,999
"And gold their shrouds."

188
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:46,667
Everything she said came true.

189
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:48,502
You couldn't have stopped it.

190
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,254
It's prophecy. It's fate.

191
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,340
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

192
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,594
You told me yourself when Father died.

193
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,562
You said we had to stay together.

194
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:01,899
You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

195
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,517
That was a prophecy, too.

196
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,903
I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

197
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,439
Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.

198
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,908
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

199
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:12,526
We're the only ones who matter,

200
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,745
the only ones in this world.

201
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,304
And everything they've taken from us,

202
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,449
we're going to take back and more.

203
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:23,704
We're going to take everything there is.

204
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:34,682
"The Seven Hells brim with
the souls of saintly men."

205
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,601
They scream in agony and
their shame is so great,

206
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,687
they do not feel the flames,

207
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:42,690
for now they see if not for a single sin

208
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:45,526
they concealed, they were saved."

209
00:23:45,611 --> 00:23:47,528
I'd like to see my brother.

210
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:49,897
- Confess.
- Please.

211
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:51,982
How is he? At least tell me that.

212
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,400
Confess.

213
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:59,573
I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

214
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,659
Sinners don't make demands.

215
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,461
They make confessions.

216
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:10,217
Septa Unella.

217
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:13,170
Our other guests need you.

218
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,433
There.

219
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,271
Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.

220
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:32,773
I'll speak with her.

221
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,578
My brother, can you tell me how he is?

222
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:43,283
It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.

223
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,453
Your husband misses you dearly.

224
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:50,591
The love between a man and wife is sacred.

225
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:53,844
It reflects the love the
gods have for all of us.

226
00:24:53,963 --> 00:24:58,432
But sin leads us away from the sacred.

227
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:01,351
And only confession can purge sin.

228
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,138
I have nothing to confess.

229
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:08,859
So you believe you are pure?

230
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,811
Perfect?

231
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:13,280
Wholly without sin?

232
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:15,983
None of us are.

233
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:20,738
You have started down the path.

234
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:24,324
But you have many miles to go.

235
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,924
I always envied Oberyn.

236
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,726
He lived.

237
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,428
He truly lived.

238
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,346
Sailed around the world.

239
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,348
Fought men from every country.

240
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:50,851
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.

241
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:53,020
- And men.
- And men.

242
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:55,689
He experienced everything

243
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,692
while I sat here in Dorne

244
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:03,697
trying my best to keep my
people alive and well fed.

245
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,532
But that is life.

246
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,253
We each have our roles.

247
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:14,124
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

248
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,093
And I was born to rule.

249
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,961
The gods are not fools.

250
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:20,931
You would have been a lousy adventurer.

251
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,517
And Oberyn, pfft,

252
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,302
he would have been a terrible ruler.

253
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:28,772
Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

254
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,191
Prince Doran.

255
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,038
The Princess Myrcella.

256
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,176
When was the last time
you left this palace?

257
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,595
You don't know your own people.

258
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,932
Their disgust for you.

259
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:15,936
Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

260
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,607
Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

261
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:24,411
You're not a Dornishman.

262
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,748
You're not our prince.

263
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:32,119
My son Trystane...

264
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:37,190
Your son is weak just like you.

265
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:41,361
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

266
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:06,637
I told you I'm not hungry.

267
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,889
We're not here to feed you.

268
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,093
We're here to kill you.

269
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:15,896
You want her to do it or me?

270
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:19,600
We are family. I don't want to hurt you.

271
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:22,436
Her or me?

272
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,025
You.

273
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,993
Good.

274
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:32,446
Smart boy.

275
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:51,632
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

276
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:02,109
We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

277
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:04,728
from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.

278
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:07,230
We'll be fine.

279
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:09,816
We're dressed like common merchants.

280
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:13,737
You walk like a rich person.

281
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:16,790
You've spent a lot of time
studying the way rich people walk?

282
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,877
You walk as though the paving
stones were your personal property.

283
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:24,164
I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

284
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:26,299
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

285
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,003
Because you have no cock.

286
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:50,857
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

287
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:17,217
- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- I know what mhysa means.

288
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,186
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

289
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,806
Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

290
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:24,641
The Sons of the Harpy?

291
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,309
Very possibly.

292
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:31,114
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

293
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:35,152
told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

294
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:37,404
You can see why they're unhappy.

295
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,790
Of course,

296
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:42,576
it could also be the freed men.

297
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:57,474
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

298
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,927
She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

299
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:20,781
It's a problem.

300
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,452
Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.

301
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,673
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

302
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,959
someone in this city wants to murder you.

303
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:36,046
We can't fight an enemy we don't know.

304
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:39,015
The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack

305
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:40,967
in the fighting pits very carefully,

306
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:43,720
which means they take orders from someone.

307
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,939
And have you started
looking for that someone?

308
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:48,809
My little birds have already taken wing.

309
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:53,396
Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

310
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:32,269
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

311
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,092
Goat?

312
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,794
Ram.

313
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,546
You think our friend got him?

314
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:03,967
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

315
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,221
We're on the right path, then.

316
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:11,441
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

317
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,610
I don't think she likes it very much.

318
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:15,896
She's too smart to like it.

319
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:17,814
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

320
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
somewhere far away from men like us.

321
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:22,819
I've been all over the world.

322
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,821
There's no escaping men like us.

323
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:27,624
There's no escaping her, eh?

324
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:30,911
You keep coming back. Why?

325
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:32,495
You know why.

326
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,583
Isn't it frustrating

327
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:40,086
wanting someone who doesn't want you back?

328
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:41,638
Of course it is.

329
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:44,307
You're a romantic. I admire that.

330
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,393
Sometimes I look at you and I think,

331
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:48,812
"So that's what I'll be
like when I grow old."

332
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:50,597
If you grow old.

333
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:51,932
If I grow old.

334
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:54,234
I hope I do.

335
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,069
I want to see what the world looks like

336
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:57,771
when she's done conquering it.

337
00:33:57,906 --> 00:33:59,906
So do I.

338
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,379
Huh, an army?

339
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:23,880
Not an army.

340
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,715
A horde.

341
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:52,575
Dothraki?

342
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,684
They have her.

343
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,944
No.

344
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:51,744
But there has to be a
price to pay for everything.

345
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,448
I know, but have you
tried telling him that?

346
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,341
Thank you.

347
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,977
Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

348
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:09,762
- Probably had it coming.
- Maybe so,

349
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:11,481
but I'm not risking it.

350
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,182
- Just can't do it.
- All right.

351
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:15,685
Honesty as well. He gets it.

352
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:22,275
Are you listening, blind girl?

353
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,612
Do you hear them talking?

354
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:29,415
Do any of them talk to you?

355
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,917
No.

356
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,870
So sad.

357
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:43,045
Stand and fight, blind girl.

358
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:46,265
I can't see.

359
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:48,468
That's your problem, not mine.

360
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,164
See you tomorrow.

361
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:14,103
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

362
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:16,355
We are both anointed knights.

363
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:20,026
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

364
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:22,278
I will grant amnesty to all brothers

365
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:24,730
who throw down their
arms before nightfall.

366
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:28,451
And you, Ser Davos, I will
allow you to travel south

367
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,404
a free man with a fresh horse.

368
00:44:32,907 --> 00:44:35,124
And some mutton.

369
00:44:35,243 --> 00:44:36,792
I'd like some mutton.

370
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:40,713
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.

371
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:44,417
I'll need some food if I'm gonna
make it south without starving.

372
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:50,423
We'll give you food.

373
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:53,726
You can bring the Red
Woman with you if you like.

374
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:57,263
Or you can leave her here
with us, whichever you choose.

375
00:44:57,348 --> 00:45:02,184
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

376
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:05,655
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

377
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:09,909
We'll discuss amongst ourselves
and come back to you with an answer.

378
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:29,211
Boys, I've been running from
men like that all my life.

379
00:45:29,297 --> 00:45:32,465
In my learned opinion,
we open that door...

380
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,016
And they'll slaughter us all.

381
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:36,435
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

382
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:38,821
Aye, but we don't need
to make it easy for them.

383
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:40,140
Edd is our only chance.

384
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,476
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

385
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,979
There's always the Red Woman.

386
00:45:47,115 --> 00:45:49,782
What's one redhead gonna
do against 40 armed men?

387
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:53,619
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.

388
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:38,896

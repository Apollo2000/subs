3
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,861
Is that Estermont?

4
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,313
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

5
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,484
The Sapphire Isle.

6
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,103
Why are we on a merchant ship?

7
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,938
Why no Lannister sails?

8
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,576
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

9
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:35,246
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

10
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,748
row ourselves to the Dornish
shore in the night.

11
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:40,784
You ever been to Dorne?

12
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,753
- No.
- I have.

13
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,505
The Dornish are crazy.

14
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,591
All they want to do is fight
and fuck, fuck and fight.

15
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,593
You should be happy to go back.

16
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,463
There's nothing
like a good fight

17
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,798
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

18
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,101
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

19
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,303
to clear your head
for the next fight.

20
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,522
It's how the two work together.

21
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:03,724
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

22
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,309
Well, I am.

23
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,112
But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

24
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,147
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

25
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,199
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

26
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,319
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

27
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,620
Your niece?

28
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:27,081
I've been doing this sort
of thing a long time.

29
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,133
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

30
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,418
I know.
Why are you here?

31
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,671
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

32
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,223
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

33
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:39,093
Because I don't want
to start a war.

34
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,479
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

35
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,650
It has to be me.

36
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,573
If I'm putting something
like this together,

37
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,608
a one-handed man
who happens to be

38
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,361
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not--

39
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,246
It has to be me.

40
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,537
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

41
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,041
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

42
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,678
Varys set him free.

43
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:23,637
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

44
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,305
give him my regards.

45
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:31,395
He murdered my father.

46
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:37,117
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

47
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,571
And then I'll give
him your regards.

48
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:51,415
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

49
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,218
Given the expense of
rebuilding the royal fleet--

50
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,552
How much can the crown afford?

51
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,154
<i>With winter coming,</i>

52
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:00,591
half what they ask, less?

53
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,894
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

54
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,929
House Tyrell could
front the gold

55
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,065
and the crown would
pay us back in time

56
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,768
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

57
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,609
You've already
given us too much.

58
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,613
No, we must arrange better
terms with the Iron Bank.

59
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,282
- Absolutely.
- In person.

60
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,953
- Me? - We must send an envoy
to the Iron Bank,

61
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:33,624
someone of importance to show
these bankers our respect.

62
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,627
As the king's Master of Coin, I can
think of no one more qualified.

63
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,762
I would be honored, Your Grace.

64
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:42,716
The king's expressed concern about his
father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

65
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,307
He's ordered Ser Meryn to
personally lead your escort.

66
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,061
My very own Kingsguard?

67
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:56,146
- Please express my--
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

68
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,148
Of course.
Of course.

69
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,069
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

70
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,214
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

71
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,583
Not small enough.

72
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:29,847
May I offer you
some wine, Your Holiness?

73
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,815
No.

74
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,855
The old High Septon would
have asked the vintage.

75
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,941
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

76
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:43,527
and should be kept pure.

77
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,747
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

78
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:48,916
Hmm.

79
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,368
How may I serve?

80
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:56,206
All over Westeros we hear
of septs being burned,

81
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,393
Silent Sisters raped,

82
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,045
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

83
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,599
Wars teach people to obey
the sword, not the gods.

84
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:08,602
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

85
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,621
<i>In the days before</i>
<i>the Targaryens,</i>

86
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:14,057
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

87
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:18,579
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

88
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:22,149
If I explain their holy
purpose to my son the king,

89
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,318
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

90
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,486
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

91
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:31,108
An army that defends the bodies
and souls of the common people?

92
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:34,077
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

93
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,079
And to you, of course,

94
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,465
as the chosen representative
of the Seven.

95
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,084
An honor I never expected.

96
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,970
Or, indeed, ever wished for.

97
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:45,004
Which is why you were chosen.

98
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,176
You and I both know
how the world works.

99
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,411
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

100
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,247
beyond the reach of justice.

101
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:57,017
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

102
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:00,237
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

103
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:08,862
What would you say if I told you of
a great sinner in our very midst?

104
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,848
Shielded by gold and privilege.

105
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:16,453
May the Father judge him justly.

106
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,405
What are you doing?

107
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,294
Help me!
Help me!

108
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,503
Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,056
Get off me!

110
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,681
Come on.

111
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,233
Shut up!
Move!

112
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,826
This is Lord Petyr
Baelish's establishment.

113
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,957
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

114
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:46,376
<i>Boy fucker.</i>

115
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:49,379
<i>You buggering filth!</i>

116
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,799
There's a special place in the
seventh hell for your kind.

117
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,519
Please.
Please, I'll pay.

118
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,554
I'll-- I'll pay
all of you.

119
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,723
Yes, you will.

120
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,760
Seize him.

121
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,428
Sinner.

122
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,679
Get your hands off me.

123
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:41,264
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,

124
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,400
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

125
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,569
Who do you think you are?

126
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,072
Justice.

127
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,831
Why is my brother in a cell?

128
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:00,417
I-I don't know.

129
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,169
I-I didn't order it.

130
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:04,454
We both know who did.

131
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:08,542
You told me she was
returning to Casterly Rock.

132
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,927
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

133
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,430
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

134
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:16,299
<i>Arresting my brother</i>
<i>is her revenge.</i>

135
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,468
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

136
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:27,944
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

137
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:33,007
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

138
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,286
Of course I do.

139
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,155
You're my queen.

140
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,574
I can't bear
to think of my brother

141
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,376
locked away in some grimy cell.

142
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,798
I'll set him free for you.

143
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,382
Do you promise?

144
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,809
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

145
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,727
Did I arrest him?

146
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:04,514
Well, no.

147
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:06,900
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

148
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:10,487
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

149
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,772
I did.

150
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:16,860
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

151
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:19,613
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

152
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:22,249
no matter his perversions.

153
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,117
Then...

154
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,205
can I tell Margaery you'll
have Ser Loras released?

155
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,924
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

156
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,926
You're the king.

157
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,711
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

158
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,264
he'll release the poor boy.

159
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,054
Halt!

160
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:09,996
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

161
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,885
Give the order and we'll
clear out this rabble.

162
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:19,139
You mean, kill them?

163
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:20,974
Here at the sept?

164
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:24,169
You'd be sending them to meet
the gods that they love.

165
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,266
<i>Bastard!</i>

166
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,484
<i>You're an abomination!</i>

167
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,775
<i>Born of sin!</i>

168
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:41,077
<i>Filthy bastard!</i>

169
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,001
We'll find another way.

170
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:51,788
<i>Abomination!</i>

171
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,462
My queen?

172
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,970
There was no way to free Ser
Loras without violence.

173
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,642
You're the King of the Andals,

174
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,361
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

175
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,613
<i>the Protector of the Realm,</i>

176
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,983
<i>and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother by law.</i>

177
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,986
I'm going to speak
with the High Sparrow.

178
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:25,071
Are you?
When?

179
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,042
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

180
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,628
He was praying just now.

181
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,549
I have to send word
to Grandmother.

182
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,886
Will you come back later?

183
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:44,224
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

184
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,310
Of course.

185
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,848
You think
highly of this boy?

186
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,400
Good.

187
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,402
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

188
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,188
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

189
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,550
Perhaps, but that
wasn't Ned Stark's way.

190
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,030
I should have given you a son.

191
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,367
Not your fault.

192
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,335
Whose, then?

193
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,871
I gave you nothing but weakness.

194
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,292
And deformity.

195
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,263
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

196
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,265
My lady.

197
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,051
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

198
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:30,804
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

199
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,115
You march on Winterfell soon?

200
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,535
We must to beat the snows.

201
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:49,122
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

202
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:51,291
and left me behind.

203
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,795
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

204
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,547
I won't.

205
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,584
I need you.

206
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,254
You only need faith, my king.

207
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,760
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

208
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,315
To serve my Lord.

209
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,654
Lord Ashford.

210
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:29,129
Lady Caulfield.

211
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,333
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

212
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,218
I've never even heard
of these people.

213
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,804
They haven't heard
of you, either.

214
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:40,256
But we need men
and they have some.

215
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:45,395
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

216
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,814
More than Lord Wibberley.

217
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:03,530
- Not him.
- <i> I know, I'm sorry.</i>

218
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,915
But we need men and supplies

219
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,450
and Roose Bolton's
the Warden of the North.

220
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,835
He murdered my brother.

221
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,122
We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

222
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:15,625
We can't watch the Wall
with 50 men.

223
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,460
And we can't get more men

224
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,796
without help from
the Warden of the North.

225
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,871
Apologies, my lady.

226
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,451
Lord Commander.

227
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,870
How can I help you?

228
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,173
<i>Come with us when we ride south.</i>

229
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,476
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

230
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,928
Its hidden tunnels,
its weaknesses,

231
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,614
its people.

232
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,933
Winterfell was your home once.

233
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,937
Don't you want to chase
the rats out of it?

234
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,992
Castle Black is my home now.

235
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:26,629
<i>The Night's Watch take no part in
the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

236
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,698
There's only one war.

237
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,000
Life against death.

238
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:36,172
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

239
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,791
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

240
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:42,295
Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

241
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:47,183
No visions.
No magic.

242
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,219
Just life.

243
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,658
Do you feel my heart beating?

244
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,912
There's power in you.

245
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,882
You resist it,
and that's your mistake.

246
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,750
Embrace it.

247
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:34,597
The Lord of Light
made us male and female.

248
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:37,267
Two parts of a greater whole.

249
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:42,021
In our joining, there's power.

250
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,574
Power to make life,

251
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,943
power to make light,

252
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,862
and power to cast shadows.

253
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,949
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

254
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:56,286
Then we shouldn't tell him.

255
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,789
- I can't.
- Why?

256
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,126
I swore a vow.

257
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,763
I loved another.

258
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,048
The dead don't need lovers.

259
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,351
Only the living.

260
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,641
I know.

261
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,727
But I still love her.

262
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,827
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

263
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,616
Are you lonely?

264
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:19,669
Just bored.

265
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,337
My father used
to tell me that boredom

266
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,006
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

267
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,674
Were you bored a lot, too?

268
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,276
I know Castle Black

269
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,711
is no place
for a child, but--

270
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:32,348
I like it. I thought
I'd be left at home.

271
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:35,018
I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

272
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,103
Why do you say that?

273
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:40,890
She told me, "I don't
want to bring you."

274
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,639
She shouldn't have said that.

275
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:56,489
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

276
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,386
When you were an infant,

277
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,890
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

278
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:17,260
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

279
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:22,331
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

280
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:26,352
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

281
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:29,605
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

282
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,640
I still remember how you smiled when
I put that doll in your cradle.

283
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:40,366
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

284
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,091
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

285
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,714
I was told you would die.

286
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:57,767
Or worse,

287
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,635
the greyscale would go slow.

288
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:02,805
<i>Let you grow just enough</i>
<i>to know the world</i>

289
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,108
<i>before taking it away from you.</i>

290
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,810
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

291
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,896
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

292
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:12,949
<i>before the sickness</i>
<i>spread through the castle.</i>

293
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:16,986
I told them all to go to hell.

294
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:21,457
<i>I called in every maester</i>
<i>on this side of the world.</i>

295
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:24,660
Every healer.
Every apothecary.

296
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:28,988
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

297
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,968
'Cause you did not belong
across the world

298
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:34,720
with the bloody Stone Men.

299
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:37,795
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

300
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,094
And you are my daughter.

301
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,775
<i>I thought
I might find you here.</i>

302
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,279
<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>

303
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,249
Father never talked about her.

304
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:57,837
Sometimes I'd find him down
here lighting the candles.

305
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,840
They say she was beautiful.

306
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,209
I saw her once.

307
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,345
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

308
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,049
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

309
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,134
Everyone was there.

310
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:15,638
The Mad King, your father,

311
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,223
Robert Baratheon,

312
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,141
and Lyanna.

313
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:22,028
She was already
promised to Robert.

314
00:26:22,062 --> 00:26:23,896
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

315
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:27,483
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

316
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,285
watching these legendary men

317
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,204
tilting at the lists.

318
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,124
The last two riders
were Barristan Selmy

319
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:37,159
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

320
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,997
When Rhaegar won, everyone
cheered for their prince.

321
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,999
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet

322
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,001
and they saw that silver hair.

323
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,420
How handsome he was.

324
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:50,256
Until he rode
right past his wife,

325
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,308
Elia Martell,

326
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,260
and all the smiles died.

327
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,897
I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

328
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:02,351
He rode past his wife

329
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:06,355
and he lay a crown of winter
roses in Lyanna's lap.

330
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,491
Blue as frost.

331
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,913
How many tens of
thousands had to die

332
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:16,278
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

333
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:21,287
Yes, he chose her.

334
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:23,873
And then he kidnapped
her and raped her.

335
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:33,883
Come.

336
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,352
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

337
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,192
You're dressed for riding.

338
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,695
I am.

339
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:47,646
Where are you going?

340
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,648
King's Landing.

341
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,534
King's Landing?

342
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:53,402
Cersei sent for me.

343
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:56,155
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

344
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,823
You can't leave me here.

345
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:00,409
I know how hard it is to live
with people you despise.

346
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,128
Believe me.

347
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:04,130
But it won't be for long.

348
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:05,498
How do you know?

349
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,252
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

350
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,722
He'll march south
to King's Landing

351
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,724
before the winter snows
block his way.

352
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:17,727
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

353
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,262
- You don't know that.
- I do.

354
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,649
Once he liberates these
lands from the Boltons,

355
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:26,185
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

356
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:28,154
With the North behind him,

357
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,689
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

358
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:33,492
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

359
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,244
He has a larger army.

360
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,830
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

361
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:41,417
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

362
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:43,953
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

363
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,206
And if you're right?

364
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:49,125
Stannis takes Winterfell,

365
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:52,136
he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.

366
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,514
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

367
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:58,134
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

368
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,469
But I--

369
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:02,138
I wouldn't--

370
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:03,689
Wardeness of the North?

371
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:06,609
You are the last
surviving Stark.

372
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:08,360
He needs you.

373
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:09,645
And what if you're wrong?

374
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,397
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

375
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:14,116
Or he does and the
Boltons defeat him?

376
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:16,318
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

377
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,070
and make him yours.

378
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,955
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,791
Of course you do.

380
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,626
He's already fallen for you.

381
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,661
His father frightens me.

382
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,165
He should.
He's a dangerous man.

383
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,885
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

384
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,040
And you've learned to
maneuver from the very best.

385
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:40,426
I'll return before too long.

386
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:43,345
You'll be strong without me.

387
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:53,072
The North will be yours.

388
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,575
Do you believe me?

389
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:01,780
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

390
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,263
Breakfast.

391
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:13,152
That would have been
a shit way to die.

392
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:16,272
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

393
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,692
Aye, but your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.

394
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:22,361
I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.

395
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:24,496
No?

396
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:27,249
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

397
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:29,118
Sounds like a good song to me.

398
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:31,503
Sounds like all the rest.

399
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,125
What about you?

400
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:38,594
What shit way would you choose?

401
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:42,881
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

402
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,253
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

403
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,637
How disappointing.

404
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:51,857
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

405
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:54,143
I've had an exciting life.

406
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,386
I want my death to be boring.

407
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:59,865
How do you want to go?

408
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,318
In the arms of the woman I love.

409
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:08,123
She want the same thing?

410
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:14,830
Let's go.

411
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,675
The captain of that ship--

412
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,260
what was he, Braavosi?

413
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:30,012
Pentoshi.

414
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:31,680
And he's headed to Oldtown?

415
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,732
As I said.
Why?

416
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,568
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

417
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:39,238
and telling the locals that
Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

418
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,240
A bag of gold.

419
00:32:41,274 --> 00:32:43,075
I'm not sure you understand

420
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,644
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

421
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,446
It was a heavy bag.

422
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,532
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

423
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,368
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

424
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:03,846
<i>How many you count?</i>

425
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,214
Four.

426
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:06,932
How many do you think
you can take?

427
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,118
One if he's slow.

428
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:14,523
Halt!

429
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,642
Over the hill.

430
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,529
Fucked in the ass.

431
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,235
Hyah!

432
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,491
Morning, lads.

433
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,576
Glad we found you.

434
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,045
Who are you?

435
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,047
Cooper.

436
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,382
This is Darnell.

437
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:41,750
You're from King's Landing.

438
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,585
Accent gave me away?

439
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:47,172
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

440
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,924
Why are you here?

441
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,759
Our ship capsized in the night.

442
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,094
We managed to swim ashore.

443
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,930
It was a near thing, really.

444
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,433
Thought the sharks would get us.

445
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,519
There are no sharks in Dorne.

446
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:05,023
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

447
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,942
Dolphins, maybe.

448
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:10,112
Throw your swords in the sand.

449
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,915
Boys, there's no need for this.

450
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,417
Just point us
in the right direction,

451
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:17,169
we'll find our way home.

452
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:19,621
Swords in the sand now.

453
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:41,810
Hyah! Hyah!

454
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,241
That one should be slow enough.

455
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,873
<i>Nice move.</i>

456
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,210
Luck.

457
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:50,429
You had a wonderful teacher.

458
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:07,145
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

459
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:10,532
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

460
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,401
We'll ride to the Water Gardens

461
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,119
with a nice breeze in our faces.

462
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:16,314
First we need
to bury these bodies.

463
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:18,156
Birds have to eat, too.

464
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,648
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

465
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,078
We're not here to start a war.

466
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,881
Do you know how long it'll take
us to dig all those holes?

467
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:29,084
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

468
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,003
Not at all, really.

469
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:03,119
Mama.

470
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:10,959
Nym, Obara.

471
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,095
Will it be war?

472
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,631
Prince Doran will weep for
your father, but nothing else.

473
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,966
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

474
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:21,303
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

475
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:24,106
We don't need an army
to start a war.

476
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,893
<i>Queen Cersei loves her children.</i>

477
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,878
And we have one of them.

478
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,897
You may have a problem.

479
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,405
A ship's captain who
found me in Planky Town

480
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:42,074
claiming he had
information to sell.

481
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:46,078
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

482
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,498
He's come for Myrcella.

483
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:52,250
If he gets to her before we do,

484
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:55,220
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

485
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:58,590
You must choose.

486
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,509
Doran's way and peace,

487
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,345
or my way and war.

488
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:09,101
I'm with you always.

489
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,686
Nym?

490
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:17,075
Obara?

491
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,996
When I was a child, Oberyn
came to take me to court.

492
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,748
I had never seen this man,

493
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:25,334
and yet he called
himself my father.

494
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,835
My mother wept,

495
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,122
said I was too young and a girl.

496
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,544
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

497
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,547
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

498
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,767
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

499
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:44,553
My father pointed to the spear

500
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,605
and then to my mother's tears.

501
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,565
I made my choice long ago.

502
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:01,787
Will you untie me?

503
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:04,823
<i>Will you please untie me?</i>

504
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:07,075
Will you please?

505
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,767
Thank you.

506
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,777
Who are you?

507
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,195
Your captor.

508
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:47,115
Do you have wine?

509
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:49,184
<i>No.</i>

510
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,086
Can't sleep without wine.

511
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,288
Then stay awake.

512
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:01,036
You're going the wrong way.

513
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,382
My sister is in Westeros.

514
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:07,269
Westeros is west.

515
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:08,804
We're heading east.

516
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,223
<i>I'm not taking you</i>
<i>to your sister.</i>

517
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:15,026
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

518
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:18,313
I am.
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

519
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,065
She's the queen I serve.

520
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,991
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

521
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,494
It so happens I was
heading there myself.

522
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:34,663
What business would you
have with the queen?

523
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:38,300
Gold and glory.
Oh, and hate.

524
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:41,052
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

525
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:45,841
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

526
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:58,854
<i>A highborn knight from
the North of Westeros</i>

527
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:01,406
down on his luck in Essos.

528
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,443
Dragon epaulets,
bear sigil breastplate.

529
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,864
You're Jorah Mormont.

530
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:11,666
<i>I have to ask.</i>

531
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:13,869
How exactly were you
serving your queen

532
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,705
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

533
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,374
Is it possible
that you were running?

534
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,960
Why would you be running?

535
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,196
And why would she
have sent you away?

536
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,465
Oh, wait.

537
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,719
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

538
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,387
<i>It's all coming back to me.</i>

539
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,856
I was drunk through most of
the small council meetings,

540
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,608
but it's all coming back.

541
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:40,478
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

542
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,732
<i>She found out, didn't she?</i>

543
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:47,219
<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>

544
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:51,990
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

545
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,209
Risky scheme.

546
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,912
<i>One might even say desperate.</i>

547
00:41:58,464 --> 00:42:01,883
You think Daenerys will
execute me and pardon you?

548
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:05,696
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

549
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:29,778
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

550
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:33,582
What?

551
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,500
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

552
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,619
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

553
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,421
into the streets
of King's Landing.

554
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:42,123
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

555
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:44,426
He liked to sing to them.

556
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,961
He sang to them?

557
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:47,963
Yes.

558
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:50,334
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

559
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:53,468
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

560
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,103
Just like all
the other minstrels.

561
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:56,304
And what did you do?

562
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,939
I made sure no one killed him.

563
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,976
And I collected the money.

564
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,361
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

565
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:05,563
- He was good?
- He was very good.

566
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:07,232
Viserys never told you?

567
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:10,368
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

568
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:12,070
Rhaegar never liked killing.

569
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:13,204
He loved singing.

570
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:15,323
And what did you do
with the money?

571
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:18,543
Well, one time, he gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.

572
00:43:18,577 --> 00:43:21,246
One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.

573
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:25,050
One time, we got horribly drunk.

574
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:29,087
Your Grace.

575
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:32,724
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

576
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,592
How many others are there?

577
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:37,646
50? 100?

578
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,648
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

579
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:43,485
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

580
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,021
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

581
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:48,606
Go, Ser Barristan.

582
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:50,025
Sing a song for me.

583
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:52,527
Your Grace.

584
00:43:57,383 --> 00:44:00,869
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

585
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,988
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

586
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:05,256
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

587
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,775
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

588
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:09,344
So their names would live on.

589
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:10,996
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

590
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,349
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

591
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,267
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

592
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:17,886
Is that what
you used to tell men

593
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,805
before you set them to
butchering each other for sport?

594
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:23,608
Your Grace, today is the traditional
start of the fighting season.

595
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:25,560
I do not recognize
this tradition.

596
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:28,730
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

597
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,465
your city, together.

598
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:34,536
Without them, former
slaves and former masters

599
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,731
have nothing in common.

600
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,410
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

601
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:46,047
<i>I can't promise this is the
answer to all our problems,</i>

602
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:48,416
but it's a start.

603
00:45:24,203 --> 00:45:26,454

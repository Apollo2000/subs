1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,039
Clegane, look into the flames.

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,580
What do you see?

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,372
THE HOUND: A wall of ice.

4
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,788
The Wall.

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,079
The only thing standing
between us

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,746
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

7
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:21,539
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

8
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,330
Last time we saw
The Night King,

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,372
it was at Hardhome.

10
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:27,621
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

11
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,382
TORMUND GIANTSBANE:
And that's where I'll go.

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,205
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

13
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,581
ARYA STARK:
This suits you, Lady Stark.

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,997
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

15
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,080
(GRUNTING)

16
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:55,039
- JAIME LANNISTER: Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

17
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,705
Do you fight with us...

18
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:59,663
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,038
DAENERYS TARGARYEN:
What do you think I should do?

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,788
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

21
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:07,205
you're not different.

22
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:09,289
You're just more of the same.

23
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,456
MAN: Listen.

24
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,414
(LOW RUMBLING)

25
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:19,247
(DRAGON GROWLS)

26
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:37,622
( theme music playing )

27
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,622
( insects chirping )

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,913
( gasps, grunts )

29
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,622
( gasping )

30
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:35,247
( grunts )

31
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:41,621
( gasping )

32
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,955
( coughing, panting )

33
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:50,830
You could've killed me.

34
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,288
The fuck were you doing
back there?

35
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,580
Ending the war.

36
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,787
Killing her.

37
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,205
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

38
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,205
- And?
- ( grunts )

39
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,787
Listen to me, cunt.

40
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,330
Till I get
what I'm owed,

41
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,163
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

42
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,038
you don't
get to kill you,

43
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,497
only I get
to kill you.

44
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,496
That was only
one of them.

45
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,330
She has two more.

46
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:41,413
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

47
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,038
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

48
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,038
No, I do not.

49
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,204
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

50
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,829
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

51
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,581
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

52
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,080
I have to tell
Cersei.

53
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,872
May as well jump
back in that river.

54
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,163
( men shouting
in distance )

55
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,080
( shouting continues )

56
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,289
( Drogon screeches )

57
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,913
( roaring )

58
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,204
I know what Cersei
has told you.

59
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:22,954
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

60
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,204
burn down your homes,

61
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,955
murder you,
and orphan your children.

62
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,580
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

63
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,787
I'm not here
to murder,

64
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,538
and all I want
to destroy

65
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,621
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

66
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:43,830
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

67
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,288
I offer you a choice...

68
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,621
bend the knee
and join me.

69
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,787
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

70
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,787
Or refuse...

71
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,289
and die.

72
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:11,164
( snarls )

73
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,622
( roaring )

74
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:28,830
Step forward,
my lord.

75
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:39,954
You will not kneel?

76
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,331
I already have
a queen.

77
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,038
Tyrion:
My sister.

78
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,246
She wasn't your queen

79
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,288
until recently,
though, was she?

80
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,621
When she murdered
your rightful queen

81
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,246
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

82
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,539
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

83
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:59,580
There are
no easy choices in war.

84
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,954
Say what you will
about your sister,

85
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,455
she was born
in Westeros.

86
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,705
She's lived here
all her life.

87
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,538
You, on the other hand,

88
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,288
murdered your own father

89
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,413
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

90
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,247
One with no ties
to this land...

91
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:24,247
with an army of savages
at her back.

92
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,913
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

93
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:31,371
I respect that.

94
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:34,413
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

95
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,829
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

96
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,079
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,414
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

98
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,414
You are not my queen.

99
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,204
You will have
to kill me, too.

100
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,080
Step back
and shut your mouth.

101
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,038
Who are you?

102
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,289
A stupid boy.

103
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,621
I am Dickon Tarly,

104
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,038
son of Randyll Tarly.

105
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,246
You are the future
of your house.

106
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,621
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

107
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,497
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

108
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,622
I will not.

109
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:34,662
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

110
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,246
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

111
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,912
I meant what I said.

112
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,455
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

113
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,787
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

114
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,164
I gave them a choice.

115
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,996
They made it.

116
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:50,163
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

117
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,331
I'm not beheading
anyone.

118
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:57,704
( roaring )

119
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:59,164
Your Grace.

120
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,038
Daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

121
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,704
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

122
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,829
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

123
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,663
sentence you to die.

124
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:39,414
Dracarys.

125
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,705
( both screaming )

126
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:58,830
- ( man shouts )
- ( Drogon roaring )

127
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,539
( door closes )

128
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,955
My... my lord...

129
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,456
How many men
did we lose?

130
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,080
We haven't done
a full accounting.

131
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:50,246
It's not only armies
that win wars.

132
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,746
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us.

133
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,414
We can buy
mercenaries.

134
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,204
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

135
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,413
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

136
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:03,871
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

137
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,496
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

138
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,580
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

139
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,455
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

140
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,662
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

141
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,912
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

142
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,456
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

143
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,413
This isn't a war
we can win.

144
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,788
So, what do we do?

145
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,456
Sue for peace?

146
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,371
I sit on
her father's throne,

147
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,038
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

148
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,871
And in her mind,
she's winning.

149
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,955
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

150
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:41,829
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

151
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,205
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

152
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,455
He didn't.

153
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,455
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

154
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,330
I'm not talking
about Father.

155
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,871
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

156
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:58,164
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

157
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,872
She confessed
before she died.

158
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:07,413
And this was
before or after

159
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:10,496
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

160
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,121
After.

161
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,621
And you believed her?

162
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,371
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

163
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:19,039
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

164
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,787
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

165
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:25,330
Which one would have
made Olenna

166
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,038
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

167
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,913
She was telling
the truth.

168
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,497
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

169
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,079
She should have
died screaming.

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,371
She's dead,
like her son,

171
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,455
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

172
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:50,038
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

173
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,580
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

174
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,746
I know my choice.

175
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:57,247
A soldier
should know his.

176
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:04,247
( Drogon screeching )

177
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,205
( roaring )

178
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:59,414
( snarling )

179
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:03,622
( snarling stops )

180
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,830
( exhales )

181
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,371
( screeching )

182
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,538
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

183
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,331
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

184
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,330
but, yes, they are.

185
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,829
Gorgeous beasts.

186
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,746
They're not
beasts to me.

187
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,580
No matter
how big they get

188
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,746
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

189
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,372
they're my children.

190
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,371
You weren't gone long.

191
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,538
No.

192
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,538
And?

193
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,247
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

194
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,996
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

195
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,705
No, I'm not.

196
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:46,079
How many men
did your army kill

197
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

198
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,621
Thousands.

199
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,746
We both want
to help people.

200
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:56,455
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

201
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,539
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

202
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,413
When you first
came here,

203
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:08,163
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

204
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,788
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

205
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,246
So, it was
a figure of speech?

206
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,581
( footsteps approaching )

207
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:21,581
( speaking Dothraki )

208
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,788
Your Grace.

209
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,204
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

210
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:46,455
an old friend.

211
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,954
I served
with your father.

212
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,122
He was a great man.

213
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,331
You look strong.

214
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,496
You found a cure?

215
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,455
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

216
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:02,954
I return to your
service, my queen,

217
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,746
if you'll have me.

218
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,122
It would be my honor.

219
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:27,663
( ravens cawing )

220
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,746
( ravens cawing )

221
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,372
( panting )

222
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,038
Ravens.

223
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,872
We need to send ravens.

224
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:55,079
I put very little stock
in it myself.

225
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,538
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

226
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,746
especially
when winter comes.

227
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:02,079
I remember Wolkan.

228
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,455
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

229
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:07,954
Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

230
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,163
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

231
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,954
- or the company.
- ( all chuckling )

232
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,121
Sandhu: A crippled boy
claims to have seen

233
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,246
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

234
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,413
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

235
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:21,079
Ebrose:
Yes, it is a bit much.

236
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,788
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Sam: Brandon Stark.

237
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,456
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

238
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:33,787
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

239
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:36,954
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

240
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,538
And?

241
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,455
Somehow,
a crippled boy

242
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,538
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

243
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,289
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

244
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,996
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

245
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:54,121
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

246
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,539
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

247
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,539
( clears throat )

248
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:12,163
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

249
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:16,330
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

250
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,704
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

251
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,662
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

252
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:24,163
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

253
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,496
to search every word
of every faded scroll

254
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,288
about the Long Night,

255
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,121
they may find something
that lets us defeat

256
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,039
the Army of the Dead
for good.

257
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:38,331
It could be done.

258
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,538
And this news
could be authentic.

259
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,205
It's possible.

260
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,038
It's also possible
that this message

261
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,330
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

262
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:54,288
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

263
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,330
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

264
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,038
Sandhu: That does
seem far more likely

265
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,996
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

266
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,538
Archmaester, please.

267
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,705
It's real.

268
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:06,705
I've seen it.

269
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,038
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

270
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,413
at Winterfell
for clarification.

271
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,288
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

272
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,996
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

273
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:21,496
Maester: It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

274
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:24,121
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

275
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,912
- ( all chuckling )
- Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

276
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,580
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

277
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,872
- ( all laugh )
- Ah, Lodos.

278
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:40,704
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

279
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,662
I'm afraid so.

280
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,912
Horrible business.

281
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,538
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

282
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,580
He's a good lad.

283
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,330
Right.

284
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:53,246
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

285
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,997
( slurping )

286
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:01,079
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

287
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,289
That's why
they're rulers.

288
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,413
She gave Tarly
a choice,

289
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:10,246
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

290
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,996
What else
could she do?

291
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:15,121
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

292
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:17,455
I am her Hand, not her head.

293
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,704
I can't make
her decisions for her.

294
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,996
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

295
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:27,371
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

296
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,122
I was only a purveyor
of information.

297
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,330
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

298
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,912
I'm not the one
doing it.

299
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,371
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

300
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,413
I'm not the one
doing it.

301
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:47,996
When their hair
caught fire

302
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:50,871
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

303
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,497
I'm not the one
doing it.

304
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,663
( sighs )

305
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:03,371
Daenerys is not
her father.

306
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,787
And she never will be

307
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,830
with the right counsel.

308
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,497
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

309
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,330
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

310
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,871
Did you read it?

311
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,913
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

312
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,497
What's it say?

313
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,164
Nothing good.

314
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:44,038
I thought
Arya was dead.

315
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,121
I thought Bran
was dead.

316
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:48,539
I'm happy for you.

317
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,330
You don't look happy.

318
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:54,704
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

319
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,705
marching towards
Eastwatch.

320
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,288
If they make it
past the Wall...

321
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,996
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

322
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:04,662
I need to go home.

323
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:06,371
You said you don't
have enough men.

324
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,954
We'll fight
with the men we have.

325
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,580
Unless you'll join us.

326
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,746
And give the country
to Cersei?

327
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:16,580
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

328
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,912
Perhaps not.

329
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:22,330
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

330
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:25,580
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

331
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,330
What if we
prove her wrong?

332
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:30,747
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

333
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,080
So bring
the dead to her.

334
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,413
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

335
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:39,787
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

336
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,829
Only one soldier.

337
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,747
Is that possible?

338
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,288
The first wight
I ever saw

339
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,121
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

340
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:54,455
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

341
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,746
and show her the truth.

342
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,787
Anything you bring back
will be useless

343
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,621
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

344
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,163
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

345
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,413
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

346
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:08,996
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

347
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,830
He might listen to me.

348
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,663
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

349
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,662
I can smuggle you in,

350
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,288
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

351
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,496
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

352
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:31,912
Well, it will all
be for nothing

353
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,704
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

354
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,079
Fair point.

355
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,372
How do you propose
to find one?

356
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:42,997
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

357
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:48,038
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

358
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,663
Allow me
to serve you.

359
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,163
The Free Folk
will help us.

360
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,912
They know the real north
better than anyone.

361
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,455
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

362
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,663
They won't have to.

363
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:10,121
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

364
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:12,746
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

365
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,330
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

366
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,705
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

367
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

368
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:27,288
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

369
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,497
I am a king.

370
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,538
And I came here

371
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,371
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

372
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:36,580
or your dragons
burn me alive.

373
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:40,996
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

374
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:43,996
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

375
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,164
for all our people.

376
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:52,039
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

377
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:56,247
because it's
our best chance.

378
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:14,246
( all chattering )

379
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:18,581
Glover: The King in the North
should stay in the North.

380
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:25,496
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

381
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,331
- But perhaps we should have.
- ( all murmuring )

382
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,621
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

383
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,080
Men: Aye.

384
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,954
You are very kind,
my lords.

385
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,996
But Jon is our king.

386
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:49,538
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

387
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,164
( chatter )

388
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,496
Sansa: I warned Jon
this would happen.

389
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,163
That he couldn't
leave the North

390
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:05,996
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

391
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,371
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

392
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,164
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

393
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,121
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

394
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,663
And?

395
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,704
Nothing.

396
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:27,496
Don't do that.

397
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,997
- What?
- Say what you mean.

398
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,122
You always liked
nice things.

399
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,830
They made you feel
better than everyone.

400
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,330
Are you angry with me?

401
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:46,662
They were insulting Jon,

402
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:48,038
and you sat there
and listened.

403
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,538
I listened
to their complaints,

404
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,580
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

405
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,538
Their opinions
are important to you.

406
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,246
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

407
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,204
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

408
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,205
Not if they lose
their heads first.

409
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,829
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

410
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,704
We took it back,

411
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,662
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

412
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:15,121
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

413
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,662
All of us,
working together.

414
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:20,996
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

415
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:24,539
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

416
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,996
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

417
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,954
you'll need
their support...

418
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,079
so you can
work together

419
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,038
to give you
what you really want.

420
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,622
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

421
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,372
You're thinking it
right now.

422
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:48,330
You don't want to be,

423
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:50,622
but the thought
just won't go away.

424
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,414
I have work to do.

425
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,372
My lady.

426
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:09,747
( door opens, closes )

427
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,662
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

428
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,622
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

429
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:27,621
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

430
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:30,288
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

431
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,663
Too many steps.

432
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,829
You're not
staying here?

433
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,330
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

434
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,163
What if someone
takes the boat?

435
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,456
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

436
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:52,288
We don't have time
for this.

437
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,455
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

438
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,621
The Dothraki
are coming.

439
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,746
All the more reason
for you to train.

440
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,746
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

441
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:02,288
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

442
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,288
And here I am,
ready to train.

443
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,246
Why down here?

444
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:08,079
I don't think
you want people to see

445
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,996
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

446
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:13,787
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

447
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:16,331
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

448
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,205
I'll leave you
to it.

449
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,331
I needed to see you.

450
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:34,622
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

451
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,121
You made me look
like a complete fool.

452
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:43,413
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

453
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,371
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

454
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,954
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

455
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,455
Father would have
been proud.

456
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,204
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

457
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,704
I once told Bronn

458
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,539
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

459
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,039
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

460
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,121
He was going to execute me.

461
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,829
He knew
I was innocent.

462
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,163
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

463
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,538
he hated me
because of what I am.

464
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,705
A little monster
sent to punish him.

465
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:27,787
Did he...
did he think...

466
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,580
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

467
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:31,501
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

468
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:39,539
Daenerys will
win this war.

469
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,330
You're
a military man.

470
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:46,080
You must know there's
no way around that.

471
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:49,704
Daenerys
is not her father.

472
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,580
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

473
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:55,080
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

474
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,621
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

475
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:59,079
you can ask her
yourself.

476
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,456
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

477
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:04,581
Not right now,
anyway.

478
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:08,997
She has a more
important request.

479
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:14,622
( chatter )

480
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:50,705
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

481
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:59,996
Thought you might
still be rowing.

482
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,164
( chuckles )

483
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:06,704
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

484
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,996
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

485
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:12,496
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

486
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:13,912
Haven't been here
in years.

487
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,330
Why should
they recognize me?

488
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,997
Sometimes I hardly do.

489
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:22,830
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

490
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:29,704
Anybody give you
any trouble?

491
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,163
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

492
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,038
and I never get
a second look.

493
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,538
But you were right.

494
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,079
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

495
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,580
Don't be so sure.

496
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:42,497
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

497
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,247
Bad things are coming.

498
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,704
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

499
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,829
- Well, the thing you need to understand is...
- I'm ready.

500
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,288
- You...
- Let's go.

501
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,204
You should know
what you're heading into.

502
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,204
What do you think
I've been thinking about

503
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,580
with every swing
of the hammer?

504
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:03,038
How happy I am
making weapons

505
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,496
for the family
that killed my father?

506
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,204
The family that
tried to kill me?

507
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:09,330
( scoffs )

508
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,580
I've been getting ready.

509
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,038
I never knew what for,

510
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,581
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

511
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,330
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

512
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:22,247
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

513
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,080
But this...

514
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,247
this I know.

515
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:38,746
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

516
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:41,539
Situation's complicated
enough already.

517
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:44,581
Well, who should
I say I am?

518
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,829
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

519
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,710
- someone's going to...
- Gold cloak: You there!

520
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:57,289
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

521
00:36:58,497 --> 00:36:59,954
What can I do
for you?

522
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:02,455
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

523
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,871
- Gold cloak: The docks are that way.
- Davos: That they are.

524
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,371
I try to stay
away from them

525
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,622
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

526
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:14,621
- Still five gold dragons?
- ( laughs ) Are you joking?

527
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,871
You must be even older
than you look.

528
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,787
- 15.
- 15?!

529
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:19,913
Apiece.

530
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:22,955
- ( sighs )
- ( coins jingling )

531
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,456
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

532
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,331
Gold cloak #2:
What's in the boat?

533
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:41,038
Not more gold.

534
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,787
- Wine?
- Mm.

535
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,788
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

536
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:47,830
Come have a look.

537
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,288
- Fermented crab.
- What?

538
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,163
Davos:
Fermented crab.

539
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:03,163
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

540
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,121
A man thinks he's done.

541
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:07,704
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

542
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:09,621
But before he gets
his breeches up,

543
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,996
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

544
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:16,538
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

545
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:19,039
Here, have a taste.

546
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,580
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

547
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,079
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

548
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,372
( laughing )

549
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:44,830
( chattering )

550
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Oi, dwarf!

551
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:07,954
I really wouldn't
try any more

552
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,996
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

553
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,871
That dwarf...

554
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,496
Where'd you get
that scar?

555
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,038
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

556
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,121
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

557
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:21,163
Davos: Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

558
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:23,580
( coins jingle )

559
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,538
Arrangement?

560
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,746
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

561
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:30,622
( grunting )

562
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,288
- ( sighs )
- This is Gendry.

563
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,788
He'll do.

564
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,497
Go, go, go.

565
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,787
Qyburn:
I could give you something.

566
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,289
That won't
be necessary.

567
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:58,955
Ser Jaime.

568
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:04,456
- ( door closes )
- Why was Qyburn here?

569
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,122
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

570
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:15,331
I met with Tyrion.

571
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:25,955
What did our brother
have to say?

572
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,996
Daenerys
wants to meet.

573
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:33,621
To discuss
her surrender?

574
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,455
To discuss
an armistice.

575
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:38,246
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

576
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,996
Because an army
of dead men

577
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,539
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

578
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,871
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

579
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,289
( chuckles )

580
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:53,121
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

581
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,622
Bronn.

582
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,538
He betrayed you.

583
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,913
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

584
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,038
Do you think
anything of importance

585
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,538
happens in this city
without me knowing?

586
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,787
You let it happen.
Why?

587
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:15,455
I've come
to believe that

588
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,163
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

589
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,704
could be in our
immediate interest.

590
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:24,038
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

591
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,205
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

592
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,830
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

593
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:37,871
Whatever stands
in our way,

594
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,621
we will defeat it.

595
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,413
For ourselves,
for our house,

596
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:44,414
for this.

597
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,621
Who will you say
is the father?

598
00:41:58,622 --> 00:41:59,913
You.

599
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,080
People won't like that.

600
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:15,121
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

601
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:19,080
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

602
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,955
Never betray me again.

603
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,954
Davos:
We're leaving today.

604
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:45,538
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

605
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,121
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

606
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,580
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

607
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,912
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

608
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:55,912
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

609
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,912
Understood.

610
00:42:57,913 --> 00:42:59,371
- ( hammering )
- ( chatter )

611
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,538
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

612
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:02,996
You survived King's Landing.

613
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,996
Yet again.
Your Grace, this is Clo...

614
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,413
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

615
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:09,996
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

616
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:11,122
Bastard son.

617
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:16,662
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

618
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,496
Our fathers
trusted each other.

619
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:19,830
Why shouldn't we?

620
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:24,621
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

621
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,830
I met yours
in my shop.

622
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,872
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

623
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,746
I grew up on
stories about them.

624
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:48,747
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

625
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:53,288
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

626
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,079
Let me come
with you.

627
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,954
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

628
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,787
No,
but I'm a fighter.

629
00:43:58,788 --> 00:44:01,872
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

630
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:05,787
You know
how to use one?

631
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,163
Well,
that's a problem.

632
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:09,705
I prefer a hammer.

633
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,414
He can handle himself.

634
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:18,288
We could use the help.

635
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,163
As my father
used to say,

636
00:44:20,164 --> 00:44:22,246
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

637
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:24,496
than dead for
the rest of your life."

638
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,912
I owe you my life.

639
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:28,704
Twice over.

640
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:31,954
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

641
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:34,414
I can't wait out
this war.

642
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:40,121
Yeah, nobody mind me.

643
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:44,163
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

644
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,079
Man:
All right, come on.

645
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
( grunts )

646
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,912
Tyrion:
You may not believe it,

647
00:44:57,913 --> 00:45:00,621
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

648
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:03,746
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

649
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:05,039
Not even Grey Worm.

650
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,787
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

651
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:15,787
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

652
00:45:15,788 --> 00:45:19,622
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

653
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,456
Take it with you.

654
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:29,621
But bring it back.

655
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,788
Our queen needs you.

656
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:42,622
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

657
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:45,788
Your Grace, I...

658
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:05,455
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

659
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,816
with the King
in the North anymore.

660
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:10,997
I've grown used to him.

661
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,705
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

662
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:26,456
Heave!

663
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,580
( fire crackling )

664
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:54,038
Gilly: Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

665
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,246
No.

666
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,205
15,782.

667
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:06,205
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

668
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:10,871
None anymore.

669
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,538
That's true.

670
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,871
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

671
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:19,080
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

672
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,829
What does
"annulment" mean?

673
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,704
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

674
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:35,079
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

675
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,580
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

676
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:41,121
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

677
00:47:41,122 --> 00:47:43,038
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

678
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:44,414
These maesters...

679
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,871
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

680
00:47:49,872 --> 00:47:52,163
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

681
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,954
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

682
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,621
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

683
00:47:56,622 --> 00:47:58,538
But that's all right,
isn't it?

684
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,621
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

685
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:04,246
as long as we can have access
to the full records

686
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:08,289
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

687
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:12,247
Steps.

688
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:17,414
That number
was the steps.

689
00:48:22,955 --> 00:48:23,997
( giggles )

690
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,954
Are you sure
you want to do this?

691
00:49:41,955 --> 00:49:44,372
You always wanted
to be a maester.

692
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:50,164
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

693
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:10,539
- ( whispering )
- ( horse whinnies )

694
00:50:29,414 --> 00:50:30,913
( dog barking )

695
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:50,788
( quiet chatter )

696
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:21,122
Wolkan:
I found it, my lord.

697
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,538
It, uh, took
some searching.

698
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:28,622
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

699
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,954
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

700
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:37,830
Uh, yes, my lord.

701
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:44,539
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

702
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:05,913
( door closes, lock clicks )

703
00:54:16,663 --> 00:54:18,538
Tormund: Isn't it your
job to talk him out

704
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:20,538
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

705
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:23,331
I've been failing
at that job of late.

706
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:26,996
How many queens
are there now?

707
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,330
Two.

708
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,496
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

709
00:54:31,497 --> 00:54:33,330
or the one who
fucks her brother?

710
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:35,163
( chuckles )

711
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:36,164
Both.

712
00:54:36,165 --> 00:54:38,205
How many men
did you bring?

713
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:42,829
Jon:
Not enough.

714
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,456
The big woman?

715
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,580
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

716
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:53,413
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

717
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:56,538
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

718
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:57,539
You are.

719
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:03,539
You really want to go out there?
Again?

720
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,581
You're not
the only ones.

721
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:18,704
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

722
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,581
Said they were
on their way here.

723
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:28,872
You're the Hound.

724
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,705
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

725
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,580
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

726
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:43,871
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

727
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:46,038
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

728
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,246
Gendry:
Don't trust him.

729
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:50,205
Don't trust
any of them.

730
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,455
They're the Brotherhood.

731
00:55:57,456 --> 00:56:00,038
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

732
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,413
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

733
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:04,122
Jorah:
Thoros?

734
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,246
I hardly
recognized you.

735
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:13,455
Ser Jorah Mormont.

736
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:16,413
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

737
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,455
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

738
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:22,288
Tormund:
You're a fucking Mormont?

739
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:24,413
Like the last
Lord Commander?

740
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,621
He was my father.

741
00:56:26,622 --> 00:56:29,621
He hunted us
like animals.

742
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:32,662
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

743
00:56:32,663 --> 00:56:34,330
( growls )

744
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:36,954
Here we all are

745
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:38,538
at the edge
of the world

746
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:40,121
at the same moment,

747
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:42,622
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

748
00:56:44,456 --> 00:56:46,704
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

749
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:49,080
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

750
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:53,079
There's a greater
purpose at work.

751
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,371
And we serve it
together,

752
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,662
whether we
know it or not.

753
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:01,580
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

754
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:04,954
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

755
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,746
Are we coming
with you or not?

756
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:09,954
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

757
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:14,371
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

758
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:16,371
He's right.

759
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:18,372
We're all
on the same side.

760

How can we be?

761

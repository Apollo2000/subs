1
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,805
Lady Crane:
<i>My son.</i>

2
00:01:57,272 --> 00:01:59,338
My firstborn son.

3
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:06,275
My child king, hush.

4
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:11,350
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

5
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,056
Fight no more, sweet child.

6
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:19,191
Your wars are won.

7
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,194
The wolves are buried

8
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:25,594
and the false stag done.

9
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:32,171
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

10
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,806
Let the crown fall.

11
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:36,506
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

12
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:41,445
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

13
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:49,819
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

14
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,655
and my brother the Imp

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,558
who killed his own king.

16
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:58,331
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

17
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,701
I will slay him, I swear.

18
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,367
With noose or with knife,

19
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:06,072
though it take me a fortnight,

20
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:09,709
a moon or my life.

21
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,668
Bobono: <i>What is that
I hear and smell?</i>

22
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:40,074
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

23
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,810
<i>It's time to see if truth they told</i>

24
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,741
<i>who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.</i>

25
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:47,578
Man:
<i>Get the wig!</i>

26
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,352
Izembaro: <i>You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.</i>

27
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,616
<i>And now you've taken
your father's life.</i>

28
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,856
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

29
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:01,194
<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>

30
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:06,463
Bobono:
<i>My greatest crime!</i>

31
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,900
You're good at that.

32
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,469
Where did you learn?

33
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,203
I'm a jealous woman.

34
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,609
I've always liked bad men

35
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,812
and they've always liked me.

36
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,379
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

37
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:57,687
stinking of some whore's perfume.

38
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:00,622
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

39
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:03,454
And then I'd feel terrible,

40
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,525
so I'd patch them up.

41
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,025
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

42
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,765
And good at putting holes in them.

43
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:11,099
And that.

44
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:16,169
What happened to the actress?

45
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,375
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

46
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,109
Bianca.

47
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,746
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

48
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,882
after what I did to her face.

49
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,319
Mmm.

50
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,485
I never did learn to cook.

51
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:37,154
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

52
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:42,129
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

53
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,763
You should come with us.

54
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,902
- I can't.
- Why not?

55
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,435
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

56
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,606
And besides, we need a new actress.

57
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:54,443
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

58
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,941
Come with us.

59
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:59,012
What's left for you here?

60
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,947
You wouldn't be safe.

61
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,854
Not while she's looking for me.

62
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:08,090
<i>Who?</i>

63
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,759
She doesn't have a name.

64
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:16,997
Where will you go?

65
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,370
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

66
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,441
But what's west of Westeros?

67
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:27,907
I don't know.

68
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,574
Nobody does.

69
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,777
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,812
The edge of the world, maybe.

71
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,216
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

72
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:48,299
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

73
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,965
I don't want any.

74
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:55,269
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

75
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,209
Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

76
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,917
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

77
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,353
I was a famous kisser.

78
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:49,022
You lads know how to kiss proper?

79
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,193
Course we do.

80
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,829
This is for masters, this technique.

81
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,765
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

82
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,266
He says he's ready.

83
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,370
All right.
Now, pay attention.

84
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:08,476
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

85
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:11,883
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

86
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,384
Very romantic.

87
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,487
Take your middle finger, yeah,

88
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,690
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

89
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,093
<i>So fucking close!</i>

90
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,830
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

91
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,526
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

92
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,700
Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.

93
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:38,172
Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?

94
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,626
Where's the other one?

95
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,261
- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!

96
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,663
Those are your last words, fuck you?

97
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,634
Come on, you can do better.

98
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,101
Cunt!

99
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,673
You're shit at dying, you know that?

100
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:48,909
I'd call that a successful gambit.

101
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,809
- Would you?
- Look around.

102
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:53,010
The city has come back to life.

103
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,784
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.

104
00:09:56,884 --> 00:10:00,653
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

105
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,924
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

106
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:06,257
Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,730
I'm going to miss you.

108
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,433
I know.

109
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:17,536
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

110
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:20,905
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

111
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,414
We need friends in Westeros.

112
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:28,083
And we need ships.

113
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,717
Most of all, we need our queen.

114
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:33,286
She'll come back.
She has to.

115
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:36,088
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

116
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,625
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

117
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,328
I can't go off on a secret mission

118
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,031
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.

119
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,905
Varys.

120
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:54,009
The most famous dwarf in the world.

121
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,605
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant

122
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:27,374
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.

123
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,709
Have been permitted?

124
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,944
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

125
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,581
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

126
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,716
Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

127
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,255
The king is aware of their presence?

128
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:43,789
<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>

129
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,592
He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.

130
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,310
Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon

131
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:07,114
wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.

132
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:08,847
His Holiness the High Septon

133
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:11,819
is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.

134
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,386
Your Grace, this is not a request.

135
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,692
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

136
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,394
You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

137
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:24,331
The High Septon commands you.

138
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:26,533
<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

139
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,941
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,975
He made no such promises.

141
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,100
If you refuse to come of your
own free will--

142
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,340
Get out.

143
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,759
Move aside, ser.

144
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:54,965
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

145
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,237
I choose violence.

146
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:48,985
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

147
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:02,831
Looks like a siege, my lady.

148
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:06,299
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

149
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:18,144
My lady.
My lady.

150
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,853
Who goes there?!

151
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,187
State your business!

152
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,322
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

153
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:31,257
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

154
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:36,164
Tell him I have his sword.

155
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,608
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

156
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:56,321
Podrick fucking Payne.

157
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,018
I thought you'd be dead by now.

158
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,521
Not yet.

159
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,292
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

160
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:10,265
You think they're fucking?

161
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,899
What?

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,605
No.

163
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,572
Why not?
I'd fuck her.

164
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,307
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

165
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,707
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

166
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:24,011
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

167
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,081
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

168
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,015
The way she looks at him.

169
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,621
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

170
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,821
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

171
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:37,659
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

172
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,163
You must have shown it to her by now.

173
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,900
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

174
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:48,437
Oh. - An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.

175
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,336
Every day.

176
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:54,241
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

177
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,879
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

178
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,577
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

179
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,250
<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

180
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,452
All right.

181
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,823
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

182
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:09,125
Show me your stance.

183
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:12,126
Now listen to me, Pod.

184
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,894
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,800
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

186
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,002
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

187
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,708
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

188
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,408
Jaime: <i>I never thought
you'd find her.</i>

189
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,942
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

190
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,146
Why would you assume that?

191
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:34,182
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

192
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,919
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

193
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,956
Well, I'm proud of you.

194
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:42,658
<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

195
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,528
<i>against all odds.</i>

196
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,596
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

197
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:50,298
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

198
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,138
so there is that complication.

199
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,226
What the hell are you doing here?

200
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:59,009
I've come for the Blackfish.

201
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,909
You're welcome to have him.

202
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,780
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

203
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:08,048
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

204
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,221
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

205
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,690
The Tully army.

206
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,525
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

207
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,294
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

208
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,129
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

209
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,929
so you can see the conundrum.

210
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,134
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

211
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,667
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

212
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:28,269
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

213
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,773
Exactly.

214
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:35,413
We shouldn't argue about politics.

215
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,250
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

216
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,315
I know there is honor in you.

217
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,184
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

218
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:45,188
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

219
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:47,554
I do no such thing.

220
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:50,228
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

221
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,865
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

222
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,570
What do you propose?

223
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,340
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

224
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,776
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

225
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,874
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

226
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,580
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

227
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,453
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

228
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,355
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

229
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,523
All right.

230
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,027
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

231
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:24,432
He won't listen, but his men might.

232
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,999
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

233
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,136
I need your word.

234
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,373
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

235
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:34,910
you'll grant a safe passage north.

236
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,208
You have my word.

237
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,242
You have until nightfall.

238
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:58,831
You gave it to me for a purpose.

239
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,138
I've achieved that purpose.

240
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,610
It's yours.

241
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,340
It will always be yours.

242
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,658
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

243
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,894
Yes, Lady Brienne?

244
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,923
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

245
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,901
and if you attack the castle,

246
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,031
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

247
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,204
Of course it does.

248
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,800
To fight you.

249
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,476
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

250
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,756
Blackfish: <i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

251
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,092
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

252
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,997
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

253
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:03,262
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

254
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:06,832
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

255
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,471
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

256
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,506
I can feel it.

257
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,173
As I have said,
my name is--

258
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,709
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

259
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,614
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

260
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,413
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

261
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,949
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

262
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,353
on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.

263
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:30,122
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

264
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:33,830
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

265
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,365
- He's not my friend.
- No?

266
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:41,100
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

267
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,968
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

268
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,876
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

269
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:51,214
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

270
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,411
He gave me this sword to protect her.

271
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,186
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

272
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,583
until the day I die.

273
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:14,072
She's exactly like her mother.

274
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,407
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

275
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,580
You have more than she does.

276
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,217
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

277
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,182
But this is my home.

278
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,249
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

279
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,957
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

280
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,407
Find the maester.

281
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:58,213
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

282
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,713
What should I write?

283
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:06,384
Tell her I failed.

284
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:38,817
There's to be a royal announcement?

285
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,891
There is.

286
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,586
Why wasn't I informed?

287
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,659
There is to be a royal announcement

288
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,733
in the throne room

289
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,830
at this very moment.

290
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,871
Where are you going?

291
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,843
To stand by my son.

292
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:04,611
Your place is in the gallery

293
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:07,380
with the other ladies of the court.

294
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,723
Pycelle:
<i>Your Grace...</i>

295
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,075
Tommen:
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

296
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,812
the Faith and the Crown

297
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,149
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

298
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:46,887
One collapses, so does the other.

299
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,958
The Father judges us all.

300
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,492
If you break his laws...

301
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,634
<i>you will be punished.</i>

302
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,200
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

303
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,637
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

304
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,441
and Cersei Lannister's trial

305
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,615
<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

306
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,211
<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

307
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:21,586
Furthermore, after much prayer

308
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:23,761
<i>and reflection,</i>

309
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,960
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

310
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,034
trial by combat will be forbidden

311
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,169
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

312
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,201
Tommen: <i>The tradition
is a brutish one,</i>

313
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,275
<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

314
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,011
<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

315
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,609
<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

316
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,682
will stand trial before seven septons

317
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,581
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

318
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,817
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

319
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,783
Crowd:
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

320
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:16,644
Your Grace...

321
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:20,214
that old rumor you told me about.

322
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:24,223
My little birds investigated.

323
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:28,824
And?

324
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,024
Was it just a rumor
or something more?

325
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,759
More.

326
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,598
Much more.

327
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:45,778
Missandei:
<i>You seem happy.</i>

328
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,713
I am happy.

329
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:50,780
You should both be happy as well.

330
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,252
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

331
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:57,788
Now it's like a man reborn.

332
00:25:57,888 --> 00:25:59,986
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

333
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:03,763
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

334
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,197
Unsullied never drink.

335
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,560
- Why not?
- Rules.

336
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,966
And who made these rules?

337
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,963
Your former masters?

338
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,139
<i>Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.</i>

339
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,305
Have a drink with me.

340
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:22,542
And you?
What's your excuse?

341
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,076
I have tried wine before.

342
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:26,980
It made me feel funny.

343
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:29,048
That's how you know it's working.

344
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,021
Here's to our queen.

345
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,390
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

346
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:42,831
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

347
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,638
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

348
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,935
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

349
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,213
Tyrion:
<i>Do you like it?</i>

350
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,348
Tastes like it has turned.

351
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,687
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

352
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,858
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

353
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,826
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

354
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,767
Make my own wine.

355
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:19,365
The Imp's Delight.

356
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,941
Only my close friends could drink it.

357
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,108
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

358
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:30,783
I do not know any jokes.

359
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,016
Grey Worm?

360
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,317
Right.

361
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:41,190
Three lords
walk into a tavern--

362
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,795
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

363
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,391
<i>They order ale,</i>

364
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,997
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

365
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,603
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

366
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:55,036
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

367
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:59,306
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

368
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:04,046
The Stark reaches into his cup,

369
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:06,954
pulls out the fly and shouts,

370
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,621
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

371
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,055
Spit it out."

372
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,195
It's funnier in Westeros.

373
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:22,503
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

374
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:23,636
Yes.

375
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:27,368
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

376
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:29,603
Not a true story, necessarily.

377
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,709
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

378
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:34,614
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

379
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,111
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

380
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,646
I do.

381
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:40,080
Tell a joke.

382
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:48,960
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

383
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,660
The first says,

384
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,134
"Do you know
how to swim?"

385
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:59,699
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

386
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:05,311
Ah!

387
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,877
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

388
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:12,649
You don't even know what a joke is.

389
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,649
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

390
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:18,123
You lied to us.

391
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:21,061
I make joke.

392
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,033
More jokes.

393
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:35,508
I once walked into a brothel

394
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,242
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

395
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,009
- The madam says--

396
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,927
The Masters have come
for their property.

397
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,376
Lord Edmure.

398
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,778
<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

399
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,152
A man of your birth deserves better.

400
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:25,223
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

401
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:29,192
I have your word?

402
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:33,795
Oh, good.

403
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:35,931
Good, that's--

404
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,006
that's a fine thing.

405
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,738
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

406
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,805
Whatever game you're playing.

407
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:46,777
The Blackfish is an old man.

408
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,983
A good death is all he can hope for.

409
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:52,151
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

410
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,083
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

411
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,987
You're a potent man.

412
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,423
A son I've never met

413
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:03,259
born of a wife that I haven't seen

414
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,694
since our first night together.

415
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:06,328
You should be with them both.

416
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,697
I can arrange that, you realize?

417
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:11,833
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

418
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:15,139
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

419
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,676
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

420
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,211
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

421
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,848
Is that it?

422
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,388
After you've massacred my family.

423
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,586
Kept me in a cell for years.

424
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,653
Stolen our lands.

425
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:34,326
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

426
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:36,563
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

427
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:39,161
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

428
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:41,506
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

429
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,365
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

430
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:45,707
It's not.

431
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:51,110
You understand. On some
level you understand

432
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,144
that you're an evil man.

433
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,880
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

434
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,285
Well, that is convenient for you.

435
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,192
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

436
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,358
Your square jaw,

437
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,230
your golden armor.

438
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,003
Tell me, I want to know.

439
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,668
I truly do.

440
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,240
How do you live with yourself?

441
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:25,108
All of us have to believe

442
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:28,214
that we're decent, don't we?

443
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:31,480
You have to sleep at night.

444
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,018
How do you tell yourself

445
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,725
that you're decent

446
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,323
after everything that you've done?

447
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:47,503
I was your sister's prisoner once.

448
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,239
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

449
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,811
Yeah.

450
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:01,811
She should have killed you.

451
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,783
Perhaps, but she didn't.

452
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:08,918
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

453
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:11,292
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

454
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:12,956
I admired her.

455
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,923
Far more than her husband or her son.

456
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:17,298
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

457
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:20,036
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

458
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,300
You don't have a choice.

459
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:24,405
The love she had for her children,

460
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,471
I was a little awed by it.

461
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,938
Reminded me of my sister.

462
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,176
Oh.
Oh, I see.

463
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,814
You're a madman.

464
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,780
I'm not here to trade insults.

465
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,386
- Your sister was a strong--
- Don't talk about Cat!

466
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:44,388
- I'll talk about whomever I want.

467
00:33:45,428 --> 00:33:47,494
She loved her children.

468
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:50,161
I suppose all mothers do,

469
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,998
but Catelyn and Cersei,

470
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,163
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

471
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:58,070
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

472
00:33:58,171 --> 00:33:59,975
Start a war.

473
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:03,845
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

474
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,111
The things we do for love.

475
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:14,221
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

476
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:17,220
That's exactly why I came here.

477
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,990
I love Cersei.

478
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,125
You can laugh at that if you want.

479
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,298
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

480
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,264
She needs me.

481
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,204
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

482
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:37,780
I'll send for your baby boy.

483
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:41,148
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

484
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,548
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

485
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,217
Your son doesn't matter to me.

486
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:50,994
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

487
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:54,224
Only Cersei.

488
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:58,363
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

489
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,532
who ever lived to get back to her,

490
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,137
that's what I'll do.

491
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:33,664
Guard:
<i>Who goes there?</i>

492
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,500
Edmure Tully,

493
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,070
son of Hoster Tully

494
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,538
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

495
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:43,811
I demand entry.

496
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:46,711
Don't let him in.

497
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,182
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

498
00:35:49,284 --> 00:35:50,516
I have to obey his commands.

499
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,219
He's been their captive

500
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:55,119
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

501
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:58,258
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

502
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,626
would decide to let him come home?

503
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:04,896
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

504
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,297
Don't let him in.

505
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,099
He's my lord, my lord.

506
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,970
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

507
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,873
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

508
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:17,943
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

509
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,715
Edmure:
<i>I demand entry.</i>

510
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,182
My lord has given an order.

511
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:24,282
With a knife to his throat.

512
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:26,818
That is not a valid order.

513
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,660
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed--

514
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:36,028
Man:
Aye, ser.

515
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:39,664
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

516
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,434
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

517
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:58,019
- Lower the drawbridge.
- Man #2:<i> Aye, ser!</i>

518
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:44,133
Black Walder:
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

519
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:47,901
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

520
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:29,675
Welcome home, my lord.

521
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:37,652
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

522
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:41,521
Open the gates.

523
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:44,456
- My lord--
- Your lord has given a command.

524
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:21,494
Man:
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

525
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:37,411
Find the Blackfish.

526
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:40,749
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

527
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,421
Find him.

528
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:13,413
Go on.

529
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:14,751
Come with us.

530
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:16,383
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

531
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:18,786
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

532
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,523
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

533
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:25,659
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

534
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:30,932
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

535
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,606
Guard:
<i>All the way down!</i>

536
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,509
- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

537
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,610
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

538
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:46,447
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

539
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:23,218
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

540
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:24,885
Good.

541
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:27,289
Bring him to me.

542
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:29,789
He died fighting, my lord.

543
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:02,117
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

544
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,621
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

545
00:43:04,722 --> 00:43:05,773
If the slavers' forces--

546
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:07,805
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

547
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,566
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying--

548
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:11,512
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

549
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:14,028
<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

550
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:16,300
All right, what should the army do?

551
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,168
We'll not go to the beach.

552
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,570
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

553
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:23,106
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

554
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:24,641
- We stay here.
- And then?

555
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,539
We wait for them to come to us.

556
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:28,840
Then we fight them.

557
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,717
Clegane.

558
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:42,918
What the fuck you doing here?

559
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,121
Chasing them.
You?

560
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,056
Hanging them.

561
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,856
Any particular reason?

562
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:51,326
They're our men.
Or they were.

563
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,997
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

564
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,262
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

565
00:44:55,365 --> 00:44:56,867
Same reason.

566
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:59,003
I was helping build it.

567
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:01,335
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

568
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,704
You've got friends?

569
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,675
Not anymore.
They're mine.

570
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:08,376
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

571
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:10,112
Fuck your name.
They're mine.

572
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:11,748
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

573
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:13,817
Happy to do it again.

574
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,186
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

575
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:20,023
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

576
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,590
You can have one of them.

577
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,800
Two.

578
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:43,546
No, no, no.

579
00:45:43,648 --> 00:45:46,115
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

580
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,853
Hanging?

581
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,349
All over in an instant.

582
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,885
Where's the punishment in that?

583
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,590
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

584
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,157
Except this one here.

585
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,329
I'll only gut one of them.

586
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:00,865
Beric:
<i>No.</i>

587
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:02,730
I'll chop off one hand.

588
00:46:02,835 --> 00:46:05,901
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

589
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:07,405
That's generous.

590
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:14,242
Bunch of nancies.

591
00:46:14,346 --> 00:46:16,847
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

592
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:18,114
just to gut these three.

593
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:19,516
You're getting old, Clegane.

594
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:21,083
He's not.

595
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:25,721
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

596
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,188
Got anything to eat?

597
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:10,635
Enjoying yourself?

598
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:12,802
I prefer chicken.

599
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,574
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

600
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:21,344
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

601
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,381
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

602
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:29,318
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

603
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:31,788
He gave a failed, drunk priest

604
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,625
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

605
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:37,061
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

606
00:47:37,163 --> 00:47:40,329
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

607
00:47:40,432 --> 00:47:42,499
for something larger than ourselves.

608
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:52,811
Cold winds are rising in the North.

609
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,215
And you're going to go stop them?

610
00:47:56,346 --> 00:47:57,882
We need good men to help us.

611
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:01,750
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

612
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:04,990
Beric:
<i>True enough.</i>

613
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:08,159
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

614
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,760
- Why?

615
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:13,764
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

616
00:48:13,864 --> 00:48:18,102
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

617
00:48:18,202 --> 00:48:21,173
and I'm better than you now.

618
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,075
Aye, you're probably right.

619
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:26,012
You're a fighter.

620
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:28,345
You were born a fighter.

621
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,847
You walked away from the fight.

622
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,619
How did that go?

623
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,686
Good and bad, young and old,

624
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,561
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

625
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:46,631
<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

626
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,633
It's not too late for you.

627
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:58,108
<i>(footsteps approach)</i>

628
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:54,231
Lady Crane?

629
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,343
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

630
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:14,385
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

631
00:50:16,624 --> 00:50:18,726
Instead...

632
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:23,262
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

633
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:26,767
He must always receive what is his.

634
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,567
You can't change that.

635
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,103
I can't change that.

636
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:34,240
No one can.

637
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:39,344
And now he's been
promised another name.

638
00:50:54,896 --> 00:50:57,096
- Hey!
- Get out!

639
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,901
- Yah!

640
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,151
Hey!

641
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:27,787
- Yah!

642
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,389
Ah!

643
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,838
Woman:
My basket!

644
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:20,432
It will all be over soon.

645
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:24,671
On your knees or on your feet?

646
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:37,650
Haven't we been through this already?

647
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:41,590
That won't help you.

648
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,327
You told her to kill me.

649
00:56:02,036 --> 00:56:03,672
Yes.

650
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:06,240
<i>But here you are.</i>

651
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:09,043
And there she is.

652
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:22,125
Finally a girl is no one.

653
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:29,028
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

654
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:31,267
and I'm going home.

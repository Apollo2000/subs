1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:03,579
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood,

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:05,582
stone, even steel.

3
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:07,984
<i>And, of course, flesh.</i>

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,153
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

5
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:13,357
I've seen making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

6
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,760
Our order does not deal
in pig shit.

7
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:18,262
King Stannis is my God.
He raised me up

8
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:20,732
and gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,401
And you think a Fire God
commanded all that?

10
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:26,238
- It was Stannis.
- Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

11
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:28,074
Don't tell him that.

12
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,009
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

13
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,312
No, it gives me joy
to kill people.

14
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,547
Killing's the sweetest
thing there is.

15
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:37,083
You shipped off my only daughter
and now you want

16
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,620
to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

17
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:41,221
He needs to be out there.

18
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:43,356
The men will fight more
fiercely seeing their king

19
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,827
fighting beside them instead of
hiding behind his mother's skirts.

20
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:50,531
Stannis two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

21
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,833
Scouts assure us Robb Stark
won't risk

22
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,736
marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,604
He'll risk anything
at any time.

24
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,506
<i>We'll ride at nightfall.</i>

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,775
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

26
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,970
My dear nephew,
you do understand Stannis

27
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,512
Baratheon sails this way?

28
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:10,583
They say Stannis never smiles.
I'll give him a red smile.

29
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:14,320
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's Landing in a day.

30
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,755
Will it hold?

31
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,124
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

32
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,193
Stannis knows King's Landing.

33
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:22,362
He knows where
the walls are strongest

34
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:25,132
and he knows which gates
are weakest.

35
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,168
Mud gate.
That's where he'll land.

36
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:32,972
And if Stannis does attack
the mud gate, what do we have?

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,074

Aye, but we have

King's Landing hasn't
been home for 20 years.

48
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:18,998
I spent most of my life
dodging the Royal Fleet.

49
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,302
And now I'm sailing
right at them.

50
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:25,471
This is the Royal Fleet.

51
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,473
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

52
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,743
Of course there are several
Royal Fleets at the moment.

53
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,346
Not after tonight.
When the sun rises,

54
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,414
Stannis will sit
on the Iron Throne

55
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,849
and you will be his Hand.

56
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:39,185
- Gods be good.
- God.

57
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,287
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

58
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,023
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

59
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:46,123
The people of King's Landing
did not choose the false King

60
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,660
Joffrey Baratheon.

61
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:50,229
They will be glad to see
his head on a spike.

62
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:52,866
Well, first we have
to put it there.

63
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,435
Our ships outnumber
theirs 10 to one.

64
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,571
Our army outnumber
theirs five to one.

65
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:59,839
Those walls have
never been breached.

66
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:02,041
And the men
guarding the walls,

67
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:05,045
when they see you,
they don't see a liberator.

68
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,415
They see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

69
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:11,150
I have faith
in the Lord of Light.

70
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:13,086
I have faith
in our cause.

71
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:16,256
And I have faith
in my captain.

72
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:53,227
Are you afraid, my lion?

73
00:06:57,398 --> 00:07:02,401
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

74
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,538
Of course I'm afraid.

75
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,142
I won't let
them hurt you.

76
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,482
I'm a Lannister.

77
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:21,185
I don't have
a choice in all this.

78
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,321
But it's not your war.

79
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,562
It is now.

80
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,803
You can't fuck your way
out of everything.

81
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,974
I have so far.

82
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,181
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

83
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,596
That I should make love
to you like it was your

84
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,521
last day on this earth.

85
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,698
<i>As you know, Your Grace,</i>

86
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,367
it is not only
the sworn duty of a Maester

87
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:14,772
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

88
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,575
but also to offer guidance

89
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,845
and counsel
in times of war.

90
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,281
Your words are always
wise and measured.

91
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,784
- If you could--
- If anything,

92
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:29,889
a Maester's duties
become more urgent

93
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:34,426
in times of war
and turmoil.

94
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:37,797
I remember back
in the days of king--

95
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,532
You brought me something?

96
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,701
Yes.

97
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:47,408
Essence of Nightshade

98
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:52,346
is as dangerous
as it is efficacious.

99
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,848
A single drop
in a cup of wine

100
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:59,019
suffices to soothe
ragged nerves.

101
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:01,821
<i>Three drops</i>
<i>will bring on a deep</i>

102
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,790
<i>and dreamless sleep.</i>

103

<i>10 drops, however--</i>

104
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:08,827
I know what 10 drops
will bring.

105
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:12,897
- Your Grace, if I may ask--
- You may not.

106
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,868
You must have
a lot of work to do.

107
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:19,904
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

108
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:24,209
Yes.
A siege is very--

109
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,811

124
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,229
And I like
your nose.

How many times
you break it?

126
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,769
Well, now let's see.

127
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:27,506
<i>First time I was five.</i>

128
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,315
Me mom smacked me
with an iron poker.

129
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,842
Ooh.

130
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,144
Oh, it wasn't me
she was aiming at.

131
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,213
She was trying
for me little brother.

132
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:36,881
Now he was a real pest.

133
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,818
Second time I was nine.

134
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,954
Got in a scrap
with a few older boys.

135
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,190
They won.

136
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,825
Third time...

137
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:58,169
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

138
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,842
Poor nose.

139
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:05,678
Don't feel sorry
for him.

140
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,914
He'll be halfway up your ass
before the night's through.

141
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,595
Welcome, friends.

142
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,300
This round's on me.

143
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,779
I don't think
he likes me.

144
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,727
You think
you're a hard man?

145
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:59,167
I know it.

146
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:04,605
It's warm in here.

147
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,641
We've got beautiful women

148
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,309
and good brown ale.

149
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:11,312
Plenty for everyone.

150
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:13,047
And all you want

151
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:16,083
is to put one of us
in the cold ground

152
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,019
with no women
to keep us company.

153
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,988
Oh, there's women
in the ground.

154
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,657
I put some there myself.

155
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,860
So have you.

156
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:29,329
You like fucking
and drinking

157
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,231
and singing.

158
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:35,802
But killing--

159
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,671
killing's the thing
you love.

00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:41,774
You're just like me.

161
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,611
Only smaller.

162
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,281
And quicker.

163
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,184
Eh?

164
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,355
Your Lord Imp
is gonna miss you.

165
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,999
Aye.

166
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,871
I expect he will someday.

167
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:17,344
<i>Here we are.</i>

168
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:30,656
One more drink
before the war?

169
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,791
Shall we?

170
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,103
I've always
hated the bells.

171
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,938
They ring for horror--

172
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:50,641
a dead king,
a city under siege.

173
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:52,877
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

174
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,916
Podrick, is that it?

175
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,285
"Is that it?"
Nice touch.

176
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,789
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

177
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:05,526
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

178
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,996
I'm entirely sure you're entirely
sure what I'm suggesting.

179
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,565
Do you trust him?

180
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,770
Oddly enough, I do.

181
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,906
Good.

182
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,212
The map you asked for.

183
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,053
There must be 20 miles
of tunnels beneath the city.

184
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,788
Closer to 50.

185
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:39,492
<i>The Targaryens built this</i>
<i>city to withstand a siege</i>

186
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:43,263
and to provide escape
if necessary.

187
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:45,232
I'm not escaping.

188
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,234
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship.

189
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,936
And if the ship goes down,
I go with her.

190
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,805
That is good to hear.

191
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,973
Though I'm sure many
captains say the same

192
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,477
while their ship
is afloat.

193
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,246
You look well suited
for battle, My Lord.

194
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,648
Well, I'm not.

195
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,617
For all our sakes,
I hope you are wrong.

196
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:07,754
My little birds tell me
that Stannis Baratheon

197
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:11,324
has taken up with a Red
Priestess from Asshai.

198
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,692
What of it?

199
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:16,230
You don't believe in
the old powers, My Lord?

200
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,433
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting--
what do you think?

201
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:24,004
I think you believe
in what you see

202
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,807
and in what those
you trust have seen.

203
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,944
You probably don't
entirely trust me.

204
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,879
Mm, don't take it
personally.

205
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,848
I don't entirely
trust myself.

206
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:37,717
And yet I have seen things

207
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,386
<i>and heard things--</i>

208
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,089
things you have not,
things I wish I had not.

209
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:50,761
I don't believe I've ever
told you how I was cut.

210
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,365
No, I don't believe
you have.

211
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,204
One day I will.

212
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:03,810
The dark arts have provided
Lord Stannis with his armies

213
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:07,147
and paved his path
to our door.

214
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:11,385
For a man in service to such
powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

215
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,788
I can think
of nothing worse.

216
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,289
And tonight,

217
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:20,593
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

218
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:49,157
They're welcoming
the new king.

219
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,026
I've never known bells
to mean surrender.

220
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:55,296
They want to play
music with us? Let's play.

221
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,231
- Drums.
- Drums!

222
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,791
<i>Remember, wait till the shit--</i>

223
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:26,727
<i>The ships are in the bay.</i>

224
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,114
They must be far enough
in so they won't be--

225
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:29,764
I know what "in" means.

226
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:32,133
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

227
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,602
No, I watched my brother
chopping wood.

228
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,503
I saw you kill a man
with a shield.

229
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,439
You'll be unstoppable
with an axe.

230
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,276
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

231
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,680
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

232
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,420
Just because I pay you
for your services doesn't

233
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,749
diminish our friendship.

234
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,217
Enhances it, really.

235
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,020
Oh, enhances.
Fancy word for a sellsword.

236
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,888
Been spending time
with fancy folks.

237
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,168
Lady Sansa
and, uh, Sheila.

238
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:11,837
Shae.

239
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,439
Shae, yes.

240
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:15,574
Surely my sister
has asked you to join

241
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,243
the other highborn ladies
in Maegor's holdfast.

242
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,667
She has, My Lord,

243
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,813
but King Joffrey sent
for me to see him off.

244
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,050
Sansa.

245
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,252
He's been a great
romantic, my nephew.

246
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,187
<i>Sansa, come here.</i>

247
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,958
I will pray for your
safe return, My Lord.

248
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,493
Will you?

249
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,029
Just as I pray
for the King's.

250
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,768
Stay safe, My Lady.

251
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:43,936
And you, my lion.

252
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:52,010
Your king rides forth
to battle.

253
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:54,980
You should see him
off with a kiss.

254
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,249
My new blade.

255
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:59,051
Hearteater I've named it.

256
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,122
Kiss it.

257
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,666
You'll kiss it again
when I return

258
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:16,635
and taste
my Uncle's blood.

259
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,436
Will you slay him
yourself?

260
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,906
If Stannis is fool enough
to come near me.

261
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,942
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the Vanguard?

262
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:27,711
A king doesn't discuss

263
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,147
battle plans
with stupid girls.

264
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:33,117
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You're right, I'm stupid.

265
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,353
Of course you'll be
in the Vanguard.

266
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,355
They say my brother
Robb always goes

267
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,057
where the fighting
is thickest.

268
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:40,892
And he is only
a pretender.

269
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,529
Your brother's turn
will come.

270
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:46,532
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

271
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:01,480
Some of those boys
will never come back.

272
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,649
Joffrey will.

273
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,417
The worst ones
always live.

274
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:08,453
Shh.
Come, My Lady.

275
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:59,477
- Where's our fleet?
- On the way.

276
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:02,925
Why isn't it here now?
They're coming.

277
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,283
Hound, tell the Hand that his
King has asked him a question.

278
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:09,352
The King has asked
you a question.

279
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,821
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound
to tell the king

280
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,656
that the Hand
is extremely busy.

281
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,466
The Hand of the King
would like me to tell

282
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,859
you to tell the King--

283
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,594
If I tell the Hound
to cut you in half,

284
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,162
he'll do it without
a second thought.

285
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,997
That would make me
the Quarterman.

286
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,066
It just doesn't have
the same ring to it.

287
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,902
Cut me in half and I won't
be able to give the signal.

288
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,570
<i>No signal, no plan.</i>

289
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,644
No plan and Stannis
Baratheon sacks this city,

290
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,517
takes the Iron Throne,
puts your pinched

291
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,065
little head atop
a gate somewhere.

292
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:38,680
It might be quite amusing,

293
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,549
except that my head
would be up there, too.

294
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,451
I've never much
liked my head,

295
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,988
but I don't want to see
it removed just yet.

296
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,060
Where are their ships?

297
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,929
It is wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

298
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:56,066
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

299
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
There are
no surprises here.

300
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:59,669
If it's true there is dissension
in their ranks,

301
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:01,871
maybe their sailors
have mutinied.

302
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,007
Maybe.

303
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,790
I don't know why
she wants me here.

304
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,760
She's always saying
how stupid I am. She hates me.

305
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:28,997
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

306
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,000
I doubt it.

307
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,936
Maybe she's
jealous of you.

308
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,938
Why would she
be jealous?

309
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:37,974
Sansa.

310
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:44,014
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

311
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:47,485
You look pale, child.

312
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,620
Is your red flower
still blooming?

313
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:51,823
Yes.

314
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:53,524
Fitting, isn't it?

315
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,495
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

316
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,530
Pour Lady Sansa
some wine.

317
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:01,399
I'm not thirsty,
Your Grace.

318
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:04,969
So? I didn't
offer you water.

319
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:10,808
What's he doing here?

320
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:13,211
Ser Ilyn?

321
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:15,847
<i>He's here to defend us.</i>

322
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,582
When the axes smash
down those doors,

323
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,017
you may be glad
to have him.

324
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:21,319
But we have guards
to defend us.

325
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:22,987
Guards we have paid.

326
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,952
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones

327
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:26,558
out of the doors.

328
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:32,963
The lads caught a groom and
two maids trying to sneak away

329
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:35,466
<i>with a stolen horse</i>
<i>and some gold cups.</i>

330
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,769
The battle's first
traitors.

331
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,437
Have Ser Ilyn
see to them.

332
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:43,241
Put their heads on spikes outside
the stables as a warning.

333
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,312
The only way to keep
the small folk loyal

334
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:50,482
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

335
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:55,288
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

336
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,026
You said he was here
to protect us.

337
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,997
He is.

338
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:05,767
Traitors are a danger
to us all.

339
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,536
More wine.

340
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,952
There they are.

341
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:31,226
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

342
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:35,063
<i>Archers!</i>

343
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,069
Nock your arrows!

344
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:44,672
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

345
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:48,542
- Hold fast.
<i>- Hold fast!</i>

346
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,777
What are you doing?
We need to attack them.

347
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:55,081
- Hold fast.
<i>- Boulders ready!</i>

348
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:57,417
<i>Hold fast!</i>

349
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:02,055
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

350
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,058
Where are
the rest of them?!

351
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,930
There's only one ship.

352
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:16,704
Archers, stand to!

353
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:18,139
<i>Man the below!</i>

354
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,708
- Nock!
<i>- Nock and set!</i>

355
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,746
Draw!

356
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,354
Hold.

357
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,423
<i>Hold!</i>

358
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,799
There's no one on board.

359
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:51,442
<i>More rocks coming up!</i>

360
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:08,259
<i>Hold.</i>

361
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,401
Wildfire.

362
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:19,604
Steer clear!
Steer clear!

363
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,830
Matthos!
Get down!

364
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,990
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace...

365
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,126
The dwarf has played
his little trick.

366
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,595
- The wildfire--
- He can only play it once.

367
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:29,898
We're too far
from the gates.

368
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,734
The fire,
their archers--

369
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:35,603
hundreds will die.

370
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:37,772
Thousands.

371
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:53,053
Come with me
and take this city!

372
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,606
Sansa, come here,
little dove.

373
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,015
My queen.

374
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,116
What are you doing?

375
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:25,451
Praying.

376
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:27,920
You're perfect,
aren't you?

377
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:30,289
Praying.

378
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:32,157
<i>What are you praying for?</i>

379
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:34,593
For the Gods to have
mercy on us all.

380
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:37,829
Oh.
On all of us?

381
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,464
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

382
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:42,399
Of course,
Your Grace.

383
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:44,101
Even Joffrey?

384
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:49,539
- Joffrey is my--
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

385
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:52,609
Praying to the Gods
to have mercy on us all.

386
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:55,112
The Gods have no mercy.
That's why they're Gods.

387
00:29:56,448 --> 00:29:59,450
<i>My father told me that</i>
<i>when he caught me praying.</i>

388
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:02,888
My mother just died,
you see.

389
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:05,390
I didn't really understand
the concept of death,

390
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,926
the finality of it.

391
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:10,362
I thought that if I prayed
very, very hard,

392
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:13,598
the Gods would return
my mother to me. I was four.

393
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:16,401
Your father doesn't
believe in the Gods?

394
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:19,170
He believes in them, he just
doesn't like them very much.

395
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,208
One for her.

396
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,679
Here.

397
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,415
Sit.

398
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,451
Drink.

399
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:39,824
Not like that.
Drink, girl.

400
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:45,163
I should have been
born a man.

401
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:48,367
I'd rather face 1,000 swords
than be shut up inside

402
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,936
with this flock
of frightened hens.

403
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,306
They are your guests
under your protection.

404
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,774
You asked them here.

405
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:56,942
It was expected of me,

406
00:30:56,976 --> 00:31:01,280
as it will be of you if you ever
become Joffrey's queen.

407
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:04,651
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

408
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:08,521
these hens will return
to their cocks

409
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:11,992
and crow of how my courage
inspired them,

410
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:13,827
lifted their spirits.

411
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:16,130
And if the city
should fall?

412
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:20,934
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

413
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:23,069
The Red Keep
should hold for a time,

414
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:24,905
long enough for me
to go to the walls

415
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,907
and yield to Lord Stannis
in person.

416
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:30,477
If it were anyone else
outside those gates,

417
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,446
I might have hoped
for a private audience.

418
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,349
But this is Stannis Baratheon.

419
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:39,152
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

420
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,390
Have I shocked you,
little dove?

421
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:47,527
Tears aren't a woman's
only weapon.

422
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,730
The best one's
between your legs.

423
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:55,001
Learn how to use it.
Drink.

424
00:31:58,338 --> 00:32:00,473
Do you have any notion
of what happens

425
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:03,377
when a city is sacked?

426
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:06,013
No, you wouldn't,
would you?

427
00:32:07,082 --> 00:32:11,153
If the city falls,
these fine women

428
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:14,222
should be in
for a bit of a rape.

429
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,091
<i>Half of them</i>
<i>will have bastards</i>

430
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,660
in their bellies
come the morning.

431
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:21,529
You'll be glad of
your red flower then.

432
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:23,998
When a man's blood
is up,

433
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:27,000
anything with tits
looks good.

434
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,668
A precious thing like you

435
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:32,672
will look very, very good.

436
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,941
A slice of cake

437
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:37,211
just waiting to be eaten.

438
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:42,783
More pressure!

439
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,263
- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!

440
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:58,499
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

441
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:02,269
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>Steady!</i>

442
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:05,506
He's a serious man--
Stannis Baratheon.

443
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,975
They're coming.
They're coming ashore.

444
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,711
Rain fire on them.

445
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,479
Archers!

446
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:13,914
There are too many.

447
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,850
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

448
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:19,219
that manages to touch
solid ground.

449
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:23,990
Pod, run to
the King's gate.

450
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:25,758
Bring any men
guarding it here now.

451
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,827
Yes, My Lord.

452
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:31,730
Let's go. Stannis is sending
us fresh meat.

453
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,699
You, too.

454
00:33:35,102 --> 00:33:37,804
Any of these flaming
fucking arrows come near me,

455
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:40,241
I'll strangle you
with your own guts.

456
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,382
Pull, pull! Go!

457
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,518
Nock!

458
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:55,123
<i>Draw!</i>

459
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,460
- <i>Draw!</i>
- Draw!

460
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:08,471
<i>Kill the Lannisters!</i>

461
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,073
Loose!

462
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,474
Loose!

463
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:16,646
Form the line!

464
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:20,783
Stannis!

465
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:22,519
- Draw!
- <i>Draw!</i>

466
00:34:22,553 --> 00:34:25,121
- Loose!
- <i>Loose!</i>

467
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,579
<i>They cannot</i>
<i>breach the wall!</i>

468
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,023
Yah!

469
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,567
The mud gate, go now!

470
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:14,770
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the mud gate!

471
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,804
Any man dies
with a clean sword,

472
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,807
I'll rape
his fucking corpse.

473
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,445
<i>When we were young,</i>
<i>Jaime and I,</i>

474
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,880
<i>we looked so much alike.</i>

475
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>Even our father</i>
<i>couldn't tell us apart.</i>

476
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:04,921
<i>I could never understand why</i>
<i>they treated us differently.</i>

477
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,825
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

478
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:11,661
and I was taught to smile

479
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,596
<i>and sing and please.</i>

480
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,633
He was heir
to Casterly Rock

481
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,235
and I was sold to some
stranger like a horse

482
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,504
to be ridden
whenever he desired.

483
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:24,239
You were Robert's queen.

484
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:26,241
And you will be
Joffrey's. Enjoy.

485
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:31,879
I don't think
I know this one.

486
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,752
Pretty.

487
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,927
That's the worst
curtsy I've ever seen.

488
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:50,863
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

489
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:54,100
Straighten your back
and bend.

490
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,738
Better.
You learn fast.

491
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:02,743
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

492
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:05,713
A few weeks,
Your Grace.

493
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:10,817
When did you
leave Lorath?

494
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,787
I had a Lorathi
handmaiden once.

495
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,992
But she was
a nobleman's daughter.

496
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:21,894
You're not.

497
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,499
When did you come
to Westeros?

498
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,869
10 years ago,
Your Grace.

499
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:34,105
From Lorathi commoner
to the Red Keep

500
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:38,009
in 10 years, all without
learning how to curtsy.

501
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,679
I imagine that's
a very interesting story.

502
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:44,015
What's your name?

503
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:46,551
Shae, Your Grace.

504
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,787
Tell us a story, Shae.

505
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:57,163
When I was 13, I--

506
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:00,133
Your Grace!

507
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:03,236
What news?

508
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,338
The Imp has set
the river afire.

509
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:07,907
Hundreds of ships
are burning, maybe more.

510
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:11,411
Stannis's fleet
destroyed, but...

511
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:14,647
But-- but his troops

512
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:17,182
have landed outside
the city walls.

513
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:19,318
Where is Joffrey?

514
00:38:19,352 --> 00:38:21,620
On the battlements
with Lord Tyrion.

515
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:23,888
Bring him back
inside at once.

516
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,858
- But, Your Grace--
- What?

517
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:29,127
The King's presence
is good for morale.

518
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:31,763
Bring him back
to his chambers now.

519
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:33,765
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

520
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:36,468
Do you want him to be mocked as
a coward for the rest of his life?

521
00:38:36,502 --> 00:38:38,837
- No, but I--
- Now!

522
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,078
When I told you about
Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.

523
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,849
Do you want to hear
the truth?

524
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,917
You want to know why
he's really here?

525
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,688
He's here for us.

526
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:59,925
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

527
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:03,061
but he will not
take us alive.

528
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:38,431
<i>- Ah! Help me!</i>

529
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,186
We'd better run!

530
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:01,923
Fall back!

531
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:10,230
Get the ladders up!

532
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:46,302
Faster, you bastards!
Faster!

533
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,371
Come on, kill the scum!

534
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,542
Someone bring me a drink.

535
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,784
Fuck the water.
Bring me wine.

536
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,231
Can I get you
some iced milk

537
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,667
and a nice bowl
of raspberries, too?

538
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:18,336
Eat shit, dwarf.

539
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:21,039
You're on the wrong
side of the wall.

540
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:24,109
I lost half my men.

541
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:26,512
The Blackwater's on fire.

542
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:29,648
Dog, I command you to go
back out there and fight.

543
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:35,654
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

544
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:38,456
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city--

545
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:40,926
your king's city.

546
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,162
Fuck the Kingsguard.

547
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,665
Fuck the city.

548
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:49,500
Fuck the King.

549
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,388
Loose!

550
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:11,258
Put your backs into it!

551
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,527
All right, get up!

552
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:17,465
Loose!

553
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:18,766
<i>Clear!</i>

554
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:21,870
Forward!

555
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:23,973
Loose!

556
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,787
Forward ladders!

557
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,335
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>up the wall!</i>

558
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,770
<i>Archers on the north wall!</i>

559
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:58,405
<i>- Heave!</i>

560
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,173
<i>- Heave!</i>

561
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,875
Your Grace,

562
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,245
<i>the queen has sent me to bring</i>
<i>you back to the Red Keep.</i>

563
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,849
If you won't defend your
own city, why should they?

564
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:11,651
What would you
have me do?

565
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:12,752
Lead.

566
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:14,954
<i>Get down there</i>
<i>and lead your people</i>

567
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:16,556
against the invaders
who want to kill them.

568
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,558
What did my mother
say exactly?

569
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:20,360
Did she have urgent
business with me?

570
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:22,162
She did not say,
Your Grace.

571
00:43:23,764 --> 00:43:26,332
<i>All men to the battlements!</i>

572
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:29,269
Ser Boros,
Ser Mandon,

573
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:31,537
stay with my Uncle
and represent the king

574
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:33,309
on the field of battle.

575
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:37,143
<i>Archers, hold your line</i>

576
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:39,012
<i>or I'll kill you myself.</i>

577
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,684
<i>Stand fast!</i>

578
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,827
No!

579
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:56,929
Get up, you fool.

580
00:43:56,964 --> 00:44:00,100
<i>We need more arrows!</i>

581
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:04,571
<i>Where is the king?</i>

582
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:08,008
- <i>Why isn't he with us?</i>
<i>- Who are we fighting for?</i>

583
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:11,078
<i>Who leads us?</i>

584
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,582
I'll lead the attack.

585
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,283
I'll lead the attack!

586
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:18,654
- Yes?
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

587
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,323
Pod, my helmet.

588
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,761
Ser Mandon, you will bear
the King's banner.

589
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:27,330
Men, form up.

590
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,001
<i>Men--</i>

591
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,202
- <i>men!</i>
- Come on.

592
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,905
They say I'm half a man.

593
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,641
But what does that make
the lot of you?

594
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:41,210
The only way out
is through the gates.

595
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:42,978
And they're at the gates.

596
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,513
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

597
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:48,417
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their asses.

598
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,421
<i>Heave!</i>

599
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:55,556
<i>Heave!</i>

600
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:57,391
Don't fight for your king

601
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:00,227
and don't fight
for his kingdoms.

602
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:03,830
<i>Don't fight for honor.</i>
<i>Don't fight for glory.</i>

603
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:06,266
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

604
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,768
This is your city
Stannis means to sack.

605
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,837
That's your gate
he's ramming.

606
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:14,941
<i>If he gets in, it will be</i>
<i>your houses he burns,</i>

607
00:45:14,975 --> 00:45:17,477
your gold he steals,

608
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:20,346
your women he will rape.

609
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:23,383
Heave! Heave!

610
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:27,120
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

611
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:31,292
Those are brave me
knocking at our door.

612
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:33,828
Let's go kill them.

613
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,453
The battle is lost,
Your Grace.

614
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:02,023
Stannis's troops
are at the gates.

615
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:04,493
When the Gold Cloaks
saw the king leaving,

616
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,160
they lost all heart.

617
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:08,696
Where is my son?

618
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:10,769
I want to escort him
back to the battle.

619
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:12,590
Why do I care what you want?

620
00:46:13,734 --> 00:46:16,336
- Bring me--
- Now listen to me-- ah!

621
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:25,510
Don't be afraid. The queen has
raised the drawbridge.

622
00:46:25,544 --> 00:46:27,779
This is the safest
place we can be.

623
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:30,815
Joffrey's not hurt.
He's fighting bravely.

624
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:32,717
<i>His knights have</i>
<i>rallied behind him.</i>

625
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,285
<i>They will save the city.</i>

626
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,854
Shall we sing a hymn?

627
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:40,025
<i>♪ Gentle mother ♪</i>

628

631
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:52,438
Run to your chamber
and bar your door.

632
00:46:52,473 --> 00:46:55,842
Stannis won't hurt you.
This one will.

633
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,779
Come with me.

634
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:01,515
I need to say goodbye
to someone.

635
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,684
The queen said
they'd rape everyone.

636
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,653
No one is raping me.

637
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:10,792
Go. Run.

<i>from war, we pray. ♪</i>

639
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:51,132
The lady is starting to panic.

640
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,468
What are you doing here?

641
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:55,603
<i>Not here for long.</i>

642
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:58,272
- I'm going.
- Where?

643
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:01,876
Someplace that
isn't burning.

644
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:05,112
North, might be.

645
00:48:05,146 --> 00:48:07,815
Could be.

646
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:10,484
What about the king?

647
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:13,820
He can die just fine
on his own.

648
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,526
I can take you with me.

649
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:23,962
Take you to Winterfell.

650
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,236
I'll keep you safe.

651
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:36,242
Do you want to go home?

652
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:40,713
I'll be safe here.

653
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:42,449
Stannis won't hurt me.

654
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,320
Look at me.

655
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:49,690
Stannis is a killer.

656
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:51,691
The Lannisters
are killers.

657
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:54,494
Your father was a killer.

658
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:57,364
Your brother is a killer.

659
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,034
Your sons will be
killers someday.

660
00:49:02,937 --> 00:49:05,839
The world is built
by killers.

661
00:49:09,277 --> 00:49:11,778
So you'd better get
used to looking at them.

662
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:18,185
You won't hurt me.

663
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:26,994
No, little bird,
I won't hurt you.

664
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:52,920
Heave! Heave!

665
00:49:57,826 --> 00:49:59,527
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

666
00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:01,730
Ah!

667
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:06,567
Attack!

668
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:22,017
Roll it over!

669
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,962
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

670
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:37,166
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

671
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,142
Oh, fuck me.

672
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,096
Shh.

673
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,731
Be calm, my sweet.

674
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,833
They're still fighting.

675
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,437
No one's going
to hurt you.

676
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,109
<i>I'll tell you a story.</i>

677
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:57,478
You know the one about the
mother lion and her little cub?

678
00:51:57,513 --> 00:52:00,481
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood.

679
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:02,783
Yes, my love.

680
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:06,254
In the Kingswood there lived
a mother and her cub.

681
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:08,389
She loved him very much.

682
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:12,060
But there were other things
that lived in the woods.

683
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:15,030
- Evil things.
- Like what?

684
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,734
Like stags.

685
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,870
Stags aren't evil.

686
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,239
They only eat grass.

687
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,774
And wolves.

688
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,376
My Lord.

689
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,712
<i>He could hear them</i>
<i>howling in the night.</i>

690
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,780
<i>The little cub</i>
<i>was frightened.</i>

691
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,049
<i>His mother said,</i>
<i>"You are a lion, my son.</i>

692
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,718
<i>You mustn't be afraid.</i>

693
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:51,800
For one day all the beasts
will bow to you.

694
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:53,802
You will be king.

695
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:59,509
<i>All the stags will bow.</i>Ts
<i>all the wolves will bow.</i>

696
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:03,814
The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

697
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:08,386
<i>all the birds in the sky</i>
<i>and the beasts in the sea--</i>

698
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:12,523
they will all come
to you, little lion...

699
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,526
to rest a crown
upon your head."

700
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,234
And the cub said,

701
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:26,470
"Will I be strong
and fierce like my father?"

702
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,040
"Yes," said his mother.

703
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:33,477
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

704
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:55,798
I will keep you safe,
my love.

705
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,800
I promise you.

706
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,111
Back to the boats!

707
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,382
Stand and fight!

708
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,986
<i>Stand and fight,</i>
<i>damn you!</i>

709
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:19,856
No!

710
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:23,494
Father.

711
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:31,734
The battle is over.
We have won.

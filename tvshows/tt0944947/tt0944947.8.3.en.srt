3
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,298
Oi!

4
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,173
Mind out.

5
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:02,465
Move!

6
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:19,486
Look, on the west wall!

7
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,675
Get down to the crypt!

8
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,688
Just hold.

9
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,980
We'll take him.

10
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,688
- Come on, help the lads!
- Yes, my lady.

11
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,939
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

12
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,105
- Come on.
- Close the gate!

13
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,813
That's it.

14
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,563
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You took your time.

15
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,147
Do you speak their tongue?

16
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,147
Tell them to lift their swords.

17
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,481
Valar morghulis.

18
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,481
Valar dohaeris.

19
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:40,397
Open the gate!

20
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:41,897
Open the gate!

21
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Open the gate!

22
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,772
Come. Come on.

23
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:03,147
Easy.

24
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,522
There's no need to execute me,
Ser Davos.

25
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:35,189
I'll be dead before the dawn.

26
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:38,314
_

27
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:20,272
The Night King is coming.

28
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:24,022
The dead are already here.

29
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,356
Stand your ground!

30
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,481
Get down to the crypt.

31
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,688
I'm not abandoning my people.

32
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,272
Take this and go.

33
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,439
I don't know how to use it.

34
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,439
Stick them with the pointy end.

35
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:22,522
Edd!

36
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:24,980
Edd!

37
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:45,189
Sam, get up!

38
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,397
Oh, God. Sam.

39
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,939
Edd!

40
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:42,189
Fall back! Fall back!

41
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:46,563
Fall back!

42
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:47,730
Come on!

43
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,439
Open the gate!

44
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,397
Open the gate!

45
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,688
Let us in!

46
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,397
Open the gate!

47
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,855
Open the gate!

48
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,855
Keep moving!

49
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:07,980
Come on!

50
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,772
- Keep moving, fast.
- To your posts.

51
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:15,855
- Go!
- Keep moving!

52
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:19,439
Come on, run!

53
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:20,688
Keep moving!

54
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,569
_

55
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,890
_

56
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,439
Dany!

57
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,147
Grab your weapon now!

58
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:47,813
Guard the barricades!

59
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:50,147
Through that pass!

60
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,730
Hey! Hey! Hey!

61
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:53,231
Close up the gaps!

62
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,231
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

63
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,231
Get in! Get in!

64
00:23:58,314 --> 00:23:59,980
Get in! Come on!

65
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:36,397
Move!

66
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:09,730
_

67
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:11,314
_

68
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:13,439
- Come on!
- Come on!

69
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:15,064
- Come on!
- Come on!

70
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:17,855
Protect the gate!

71
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,980
Protect the gate!

72
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:22,563
They're coming! Come on!

73
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,231
Fall back!

74
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:45,189
Light the trench!

75
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,397
Light the trench!

76
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:51,105
- Wait!
- Light the trench!

77
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,647
She can't see us.

78
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:24,439
Light the trenches!

79
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,064
With a torch, light the trenches!

80
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,605
- Right there.
- Torch it!

81
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:46,314
Light the trenches!

82
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:32,189
Clegane.

83
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:41,314
You must try not to worry yourself.

84
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:56,481
At least we're already in a crypt.

85
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:03,147
If we were up there,

86
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:06,730
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

87
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:09,813
Something that makes a difference.

88
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:12,605
What?

89
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,314
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?

90
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,757
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

91
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,231
And got your face cut in half.

92
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,022
And it made a difference.

93
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,105
If I was out there right now...

94
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,563
You'd die.

95
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:28,897
There's nothing you can do.

96
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:34,772
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

97
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:37,272
to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

98
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:40,563
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

99
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:43,064
Witty remarks won't make a difference.

100
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,605
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

101
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,522
It's the truth.

102
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:55,563
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

103
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,064
look the truth in the face.

104
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:06,314
Maybe we should have stayed married.

105
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,231
You were the best of them.

106
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,605
What a terrifying thought.

107
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:20,064
It wouldn't work between us.

108
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,064
Why not?

109
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,563
The Dragon Queen.

110
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:29,939
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

111
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,688
Yes.

112
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:35,605
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

113
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,314
We'd all be dead already.

114
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,939
They lit the trench.

115
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:16,647
Bran...

116
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,980
I just want you to know...

117
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,147
I wish...

118
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:31,688
The things I did...

119
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:34,688
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

120
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,356
Where you belong.

121
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:41,647
Home.

122
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:54,522
I'm going to go now.

123
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,189
Go where?

124
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:48,272
Man the walls!

125
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:50,939
Man the walls!

126
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,314
Man the wall!

127
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:02,980
Man the walls!

128
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,563
Come on!

129
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,439
Get out there! Get moving!

130
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:11,647
Come on. Come on! Come on!

131
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:17,481
Go, go, go!

132
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:19,022
Come on!

133
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,397
They're against the wall!

134
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:06,730
Get more men up here!

135
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,980
- Fill the gaps, quickly!
- Get in there!

136
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:14,605
They're climbing the walls!

137
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:17,231
- Relieve the archers!
- Relieve the archers!

138
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:20,481
Archers on top!

139
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,314
- Move up!
- Go, go! Come here!

140
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:24,939
- Come on!
- Move back!

141
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:26,939
- Stand away!
- Go on, go on. Go! Go.

142
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:29,356
- Step back.
- All the way, archers!

143
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:46,314
Hold the wall!

144
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:47,939
The wall, they're coming up!

145
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:51,481
- Hold the wall!
- Hold the wall!

146
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:52,730
Draw!

147
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,605
Come on!

148
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,813
They're coming up!

149
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,189
Look out!

150
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:04,314
Clegane!

151
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:06,897
Clegane!

152
00:41:17,397 --> 00:41:19,314
Clegane!

153
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:21,605
Clegane, we need you!

154
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,939
You can't give up on us.

155
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,231
Fuck off! We can't beat them.

156
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:27,813
Don't you see that, you stupid whore?

157
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:29,605
We're fighting Death!

158
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,022
They can't beat Death.

159
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:37,189
Tell her that.

160
00:49:11,688 --> 00:49:12,980
Open the door!

161
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:16,939
Open the door!

162
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,772
- Come on!
- Open the door!

163
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,272
Open the door!

164
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:26,897
Please!

165
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,147
Open it!

166
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:46,897
Rah!

167
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:54,730
Aah!

168
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:05,522
Come on! Go!

169
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,481
- Come on!
- Run!

170
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:35,980
We've gotta go!

171
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:40,481
The Lord brought him back for a purpose.

172
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:47,064
Now that purpose has been served.

173
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:53,522
I know you.

174
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:00,397
And I know you.

175
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:10,481
You said we'd meet again.

176
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,772
And here we are.

177
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,105
At the end of the world.

178
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:18,189
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

179
00:53:19,855 --> 00:53:21,397
You were right about that too.

180
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:24,314
Brown eyes...

181
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,605
green eyes...

182
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:29,272
and blue eyes.

183
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,439
What do we say to the God of Death?

184
00:53:55,688 --> 00:53:56,772
Not today.

185
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:23,314
Here they come!

186
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,147
Steady, lads.

187
00:54:29,522 --> 00:54:30,605
Steady now.

188
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:34,813
Make every shot count.

189
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:45,314
Over there!

190
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:49,605
There!

191
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:31,356
Get off.

192
00:57:08,563 --> 00:57:09,647
Dracarys.

193
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:55,064
Come on! Come on!

194
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:59,563
No! No, no, no!

195
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:51,813
- Bran!
- Go!

196
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:10,813
Jorah!

197
01:10:56,397 --> 01:10:57,563
Theon.

198
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:10,939
You're a good man.

199
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,980
Thank you.

200
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:43,481
I'm hurt.

201
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:57,064

01:21:21,855 --> 01:21:23,939
We have won the Great War.

203
01:21:25,772 --> 01:21:27,356
Now, we will win the last war.

204
01:21:35,356 --> 01:21:37,439
We'll rip her out
root and stem.

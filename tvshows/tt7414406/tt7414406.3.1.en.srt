1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,044
- Previously on
"All American"...

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,005
Everybody loves
a good comeback story.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,549
Crenshaw's being converted
into a magnet school.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,426
Ain't no way
we're letting our school

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,261
get stripped away from us
piece by piece.

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,762
I'm afraid it's too late.

7
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,305
When will people learn
that you can't

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,974
keep taking resources
out of the neighborhood

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,892
and expect the hood
to stay standing?

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,644
- Hey, what is that?
- It's the resource.

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,563
I'm bring back the
resource I took away.

12
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,606
As of this fall,
i'll be reenrolling

13
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,734
as a student
at south crenshaw high.

14
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,069
Now they're holding
off on converting the
school for another year.

15
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,446
What's the plan?

16
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,488
Win the state
championship next year.

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,489
With the right coach.

18
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,490
You're serious?

19
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,325
Come coach for me.

20
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,411
You know simone hicks
is pregnant with your kid.

21
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,912
The kid's not mine.

22
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,831
Did you really think
that I would let someone

23
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,541
murder my baby brother,

24
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,209
and I wouldn't come
back to town?

25
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,211
Leslie, I really
need you to call me back.

26
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,798
Everyone's gone,
and I just feel like
everything's falling apart.

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,967
I thought I was alone.
You always got me.

28
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,221
Spencer! No!

29
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,265
Your shoulder's
completely healed.

30
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,808
You're back to your
old self, spencer james.

31
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,435
If there was any
residual nerve damage,

32
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,687
we'd know by now,
none of which you have.

33

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

34
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,926
Hey, yo, spencer,
remind me again why
we're on a bus.

35
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,552
'cause I know one
of your beverly peeps

36
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,970
must have offered you
a ride or something.

37
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,972
I don't know, man.

38
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,725
Coming back home to
crenshaw after being
in beverly,

39
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,644
city just hits different.

40
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,522
I like sitting here,

41
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,816
getting to slowly
enjoy it again, you know.

42
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,986
Dog, I'm hot
and I'm tired.

43
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,864
Ok, whatever nostalgic
kool-aid you sippin' on,

44
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,699
I don't want
no part of that.

45
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,159
I'm just trying to get to
beverly before next year.

46
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,536
Whatever, man.

47
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,871
We home.

48
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,376
No, I'm serious, man.

49
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,003
He went straight home
butt naked.

50
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,713
All he got
was grounded?

51
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,298
If I threw a party
at my neighbor's crib

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,633
while they were gone
and got busted,

53
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,135
smashed some chick
on their lawn,

54
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,970
my senior year
would be in a coffin.

55
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,180
Yo, we're finally
seniors, man.

56
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,016
Hell, yeah, we are.
It's about damn time.

57
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,060
Sucks you're not gonna
be with us, spence.

58
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,854
Yeah, now we're stuck
with his ugly ass
on our field.

59
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,730
Man, shut up.
Y'all gonna see
plenty of me, all right?

60
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,065
Ain't nothing gonna change.

61
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,525
Except for the color
of your jersey.

62
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,568
And winning the state
title this year.

63
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,236
Ooh, ok. We'll see.

64
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,113
Hey, hey, tomorrow night,
my half birthday.

65
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,948
All right, one last
celebration to hang out

66
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,825
before we officially
become rivals again.

67
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,535
You know a half birthday
ain't a thing, right?

68
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,328
I'm pretty sure
I just made it one.

69
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,038
Yes, you did.

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,957
Yo, how you not even
a student here anymore,

71
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,584
but you got us out here
doing manual labor?

72
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,795
'cause it's a dope idea,
and it's important to liv.

73
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,470
All right?
Think that's it.

74
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,306
We're done.

75
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,266
I'm proud of you.

76
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,185
It's not bad for your
first move as president

77
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,769
of the black student caucus.

78
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,688
Well, it's senior year.

79
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,316
It's time to make
a statement.

80
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm surprised you're here.

81
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,085
I've barely seen you
all summer.

82
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,587
Whatever, man.
It's cool. I get it.

83
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,297
I know you're all
booed up now.

84
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,673
So I guess that road trip
to coop's vegas show

85
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,342
was just in my imagination.

86
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,302
I'm surprised you remember
the rest of us was there.

87
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,305
You and simone was all,
black love forever.

88
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,432
Hail mary, blah blah blah.

89
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,228
I'm happy, man.
You look it.

90
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,979
And I'm happy for you,
man, for real.

91
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,106
Besides, I'm not the one
who went all incog-negro

92
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,900
these past few weeks
since the road trip.

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,068
You good?

94
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,487
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
All good.

95
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,113
My ma just got me busy
around the house, you know.

96
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,702
Oh, god.
You all right, man?

97
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,455
Heh. Simone. Um...

98
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,749
Uh, she's having
the baby.

99
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,167
What?

100
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,460
She's having a baby.
I got to...

101
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,128
Go to the hospital?
Go, go.

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,005
I'm gonna go--i'm gonna
go to the hospital.

103
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,399
I guess it's a good thing
jordan told me about today.

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,861
Yeah. I guess
we've both been busy.

105
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,281
Have we?

106
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,830
Wait, where'd jordan go?

107
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,124
He's either on his way
to meet simone at the hospital

108
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,251
or he passed out halfway
there from excitement.

109
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,169
Oh, my god,
she's having the baby.

110
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,921
She's having a baby.

111
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,928
So...how--how
have you been?

112
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,555
Is your arm still...?

113
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,307
I didn't have no more
relapses all summer.

114
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,934
Not since the jamboree.

115
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,145
So, yeah, I'm all good.

116
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,646
Except for the fact that
you've been avoiding me

117
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,189
these last couple of weeks.

118
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,566
I must have missed the part

119
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,026
where you came
looking for me.

120
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,485
Heh. Touche.

121
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,279
I was just trying
to give you space.

122
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,575
I should finish
cleaning up.

123
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,535
liv.

124
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,790
Giving each other space.

125
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,375
It's the right call.

126
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,252
Oh, what?

127
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,006
Hey, raise your damn
paintbrushes for my boy.

128
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,550
Asher adams in the hizzouz.

129
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,427
Jj, man,
I missed you.

130
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,554
I thought he wasn't back from
him mom's cruise till tomorrow.

131
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,514
Me, too.

132
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,311
I missed you.

133
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,063
I missed you, too.

134
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,231
Yo, man,
you still here?

135
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,359
I thought you and
coach baker had that
press interview thing.

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,943
Damn, you're right.

137
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,570
I appreciate you.
I got you.

138
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
Everything looks good.

139
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,543
How are you feeling?

140
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,962
I'm fine.
Thank you.

141
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,714
Sweetie.

142
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,925
Sorry it took me
so long to get here.

143
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,094
Are you ok?

144
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,887
Yeah, I'm ok.

145
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,598
Why are you all alone?
Where's your mother?

146
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,183
Is the baby...

147
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,060
The baby's fine,
mr. Hicks.

148
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,312
Your daughter had
a precipitous labor.

149
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,356
Which is just
a fancy way of saying

150
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,274
everything happened
super quick.

151
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,944
That's my girl.
Always the overachiever.

152
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,197
Where is the little guy?

153
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,369
Um, he's with
his new family.

154
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,704
Mom did the handoff.

155
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,999
And they just left,
actually.

156
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:03,214
Ok. Um, was he ok?
Was he healthy?

157
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,632
yep.

158
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,634
Simone--
Dad, what?

159
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,219
Look, that's all I know.

160
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,720
I mean, I figured
it'd be too hard

161
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,347
if I actually held him
or anything.

162
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,641
So once I confirmed with
the doc he was healthy,

163
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
I just let mom
take care of everything.

164
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,687
All right.

165
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,482
Um, well, you know,
jordan's pacing a hole
in the floor out there.

166
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,151
Why don't I get him
for you, give you two
some time alone?

167
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,862
Um, I'm actually--
I'm kind of tired,

168
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,406
so can you just tell him
i'll text him later?

169
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,782
Text him? Simone--

170
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,577
Dad, please.

171
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,204
Just tell him. Ok?

172
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,515
- The prodigal son returns.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,976
- Single, too.
- Oh, boy.

174
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,020
Feels like you're
the one I should be
doing the story on.

175
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,939
Ha ha ha.
Maybe--maybe next time.
Here he is.

176
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,941
Hey. My bad.
Them buses took a minute.

177
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,359
What's good, coach?

178
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,819
Not the bus.

179
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
Come on.

180
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,449
The spencer james hasn't
at least upgraded to
an uber or something?

181
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,034
He likes
to ride the bus,

182
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,619
forces him to slow down.

183
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,245
He can take
everything all in.

184
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,830
Spencer james, renata booth.

185
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,042
She's the sports editor
for the "l.a. Tribune."

186
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,085
Big fan.
Thank you.
That means a lot.

187
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,712
Yeah. This will be
pretty painless.

188
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,506
Just want to cover
your heroic comeback,

189
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,132
what's in store for
south crenshaw football.

190
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,759
You know,
stuff like that.

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,511
Ok, well, I'll leave
y'all to it.

192
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,221
Renata, make us look good.

193
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,890
- I'll catch you later, spence.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,225
Shall we?

195
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,809
Yeah. Ahem.

196
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,979
So, why'd you
abandon beverly?

197
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,232
I thought we were focusing
on south crenshaw high?

198
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,776
We will. But I'd be
a horrible reporter

199
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,278
if I didn't
get context.

200
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,156
Ok. Well, I ain't
abandon nobody.

201
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,075
It was just time
to come home.

202
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,662
My family, my community,
they needed me.

203
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,665
And how do your former
eagle teammates feel
about being left behind?

204
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,334
Look, I'm sorry, but
you're looking for beef

205
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,835
that just ain't there.

206
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,379
You really believe
the beverly eagles

207
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,256
are happy to lose you
to their rivals?

208
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,675
Crenshaw chargers
were my home first.

209
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,635
All the more reason
for the eagles to feel

210
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,595
like the rebound girl

211
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,097
that got dumped
when the ex came back.

212
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,516
Ok, look.

213
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,351
Beverly is my past.

214
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,144
South crenshaw is
my future.

215
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,980
Can we just focus on that?

216
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,920
Billy.

217
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,797
hey.

218
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,465
I thought that
was you.

219
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,175
What you doing here?
I thought they only let in

220
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,177
faculty and staff
for the orientation.

221
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,430
Just dropping off
my renovations proposal

222
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,764
with the interim
principal.

223
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,099
Oh, nice.

224
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,018
Walk me?
Yeah.

225
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,147
How's it being back
as the head coach?

226
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,150
Oh, I'm excited.
Yeah, I'm excited.

227
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,401
and?

228
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,777
I'm anxious.
Ha ha ha!

229
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,571
If I'm keeping it real.

230
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656
Uh, there's a lot riding

231
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,742
on this football team's
success this year, so.

232
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,744
You're no stranger
to pressure, billy.

233
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,371
I mean, if anyone can turn
this around, it's you.

234
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,332
Let's hope so.

235
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,668
Hey, uh, I heard about
you and micah.

236
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm sorry that
didn't work out.

237
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,713
Yeah.

238
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
I mean, he was a
great guy, but honestly--

239
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,467
There wasn't
the passion there?

240
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,053
He was a safe choice.

241
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,096
I bet.

242
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,932
And he deserves to be
more than somebody's
safe choice.

243
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,519
Are you kidding me?

244
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,271
Whoever that is,
i'm not supposed to like him?

245
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,065
Superintendent
d'angelo carter

246
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,858
is the one who tried
to convert south crenshaw

247
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,152
into a magnet, and,
no, we do not like him.

248
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,696
Nice to see you again,
ms. James.

249
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,199
I don't like
to lie, so I won't
say the same.

250
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,077
That for me?

251
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,536
It's for the
interim principal,

252
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,080
and none of
your business.

253
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,500
Then they're for me
and my business.

254
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,085
Ahem.

255
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,212
Ok, good to
meet you, man. I'm coach--

256
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,963
I know who you are.

257
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,423
I guess it's no surprise

258
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,343
bully baker has
no recollection of me.

259
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,011
Am I missing
something?

260
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,013
Yeah, I used to be a student
here at south crenshaw

261
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,306
with billy and corey.

262
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,808
I was just some stem nerd

263
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,435
the football team
used to terrorize.

264
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,812
Why don't
I remember you?

265
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,773
Because you transferred
freshman year.

266
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,858
Sent to boarding school,
actually.

267
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,318
Boarding school, yeah.

268
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,362
But, hey, it's all
in the past now.

269
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,863
Yeah.

270
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,412
I'll be in touch.

271
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,246
ok.

272
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,420
"she's the sleeper
hip-hop ninja

273
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,130
"that no one saw coming.

274
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,507
"and coop isn't the only
prodigy to shine on this tour.

275
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,385
"producer layla keating
proves sometimes

276
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,137
"it really does run
in your blood.

277
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,347
These young'uns are about
to change the came. Watch."

278
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,141
You heard it here first.

279
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,685
Not one bad review, layla.
Not one.

280
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,478
Coop, I'm trying to get
us home in one piece.

281
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,231
I'll calm down, but I need
to hear you say it first

282
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
with me, loudly.

283
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,525
Say what?

284
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,653
We some bad bitches!

285
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,658
We some bad bitches!

286
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,495
Man, the tour--tour
was everything.

287
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,748
But on the real,
I missed home,

288
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,208
especially spencer,
patience.

289
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,335
Yeah, I still can't
believe she left
the tour early.

290
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,628
I really thought
she wanted this.

291
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,380
Man, you and me both.

292
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,840
Guess we'll get
the real tonight

293
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,341
when we see her
at spencer's.

294
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,926
Mm-hmm.

295
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,137
What's up?

296
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,597
What?

297
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,015
You're not coming with me
to see spencer?

298
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,516
I thought you said
things between you two

299
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
were cool again post-vegas.

300
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,646
Vegas was amazing,
but I just don't know

301
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,190
what me and spencer
are anymore.

302
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,858
So what better time
to find out?

303
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,153
Coop, we've been
driving all night.
I look a mess.

304
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,696
I'll see him later.

305
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,490
What are--what is that?
What is this?

306
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,451
Like a chicken.
Scared?

307
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,577
Are you done?

308
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,079
No, I'm not done.

309
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,998
Bawk. Bawk bawk.

310
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,631
Oh, my god, if one of
y'all doesn't make a move soon,

311
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,799
i'm gonna kill myself.

312
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,634
Can't rush genius,
all right?

313
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Oh, then I guess
you shouldn't have

314
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,845
a problem hurrying up then.

315
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,853
Well, this ain't my house.

316
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,398
I'm gonna remember that
next time you want

317
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,608
to netflix and chill
and eat dinner.

318
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,818
Ow. Ow.

319
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,030
What's up? What's up?
What's up?

320
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,282
Ha ha ha! Yeah.

321
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,742
aw.

322
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,160
ahh.

323
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,412
Man, I missed
your ugly face.

324
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,831
Yeah, I missed
yours more, fool.

325
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,708
Welcome home, rockstar.
What's up?

326
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,585
Good. Glad to see you
back on your feet.

327
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,254
Appreciate that.

328
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,672
You better be
saving the best for last.

329
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,132
Come on. Oh, I am.

330
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,676
Uh-oh.

331
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,427
I missed you.

332
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,555
These last two weeks
have been like a decade.

333
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,223
Girl, we could have been
together till the end.

334
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,808
You abandoned me.

335
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,976
Yeah,
you never did explain

336
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,185
why you came home
so early.

337
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,603
Yeah.
Isn't jp's tour playing

338
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,313
at madison square
garden tomorrow night?

339
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,982
Like, who skips out
on that?

340
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,693
Hey, the road
ain't for everybody.

341
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,695
But whatever, we
don't got to talk
about me right now.

342
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,614
Coop, you got some
bigger issues.

343
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,116
What's going on?

344
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,617
We didn't want to mess
with your head

345
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,244
while you was
on the road, but...

346
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,664
Uh, so tyrone has
an older sister,

347
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,249
and she's back
in town.

348
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,042
What you mean he's
got a sister?

349
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,253
Folks back in the day used
to talk about his sister

350
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,214
who left the gang and bounced
when she was like 18,

351
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,883
never looked back.

352
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,384
So why's she back now?

353
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,897
Can I help you?

354
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,817
D.a. Baker.
Monique stephanie moore,
attorney.

355
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,819
And tyrone moore's sister.

356
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,032
I don't take meetings
at my house.

357
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,285
You can call my office
if you'd like to schedule
a time to talk.

358
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,203
Or we can talk now.

359
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,347
God, they are all
so beautiful, aren't they?

360
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,681
Indeed.

361
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,141
You got a new
family member in here?

362
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,810
Yes. Um, no.

363
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,563
I'm just taking in
the miracle of life.

364
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,565
You know,
they're all so small,

365
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,067
so amazing.

366
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,902
Miracle of life it is.

367
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,113
That's my son. Shay.

368
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,241
I know I'm biased,
but isn't he something?

369
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,077
He's definitely
one cute kid.

370
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,496
We never thought
this would happen.

371
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,915
Now we got our own
personal miracle.

372
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,126
My wife couldn't
carry to term.

373
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,003
It was devastating
watching her

374
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,296
try to will it
into happening,

375
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,049
every time only
to lose the baby.

376
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,968
I'm so sorry.

377
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,679
I finally accepted
that kids just weren't
in the plans for us.

378
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,640
Then adoption fell
in our laps.

379
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,434
Right place, right time.

380
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,356
I'm sorry. I just
made you uncomfortable

381
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,066
flapping about all
of our business.

382
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,068
No. No, I'm, um...

383
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,571
Very happy for you.

384
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,367
And for little shay.

385
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,536
Thank you,
brother.

386
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,329
Thank you.

387
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,963
Yo, I know I'm late.
My bad.

388
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
Did you find quan?

389
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,967
Yep. All he knows
is that tyrone's sister

390
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,385
is some big shot lawyer.

391
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,178
For real?
Yeah.

392
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,222
What kind of lawyer?
He don't know.

393
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,974
She went to see preach
a couple of months ago.

394
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,144
After that, preach
called quan to keep
an eye on me,

395
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,021
but I had already
left on the tour.

396
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,856
Quan ain't seen mo since.

397
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,816
I guess she's laying low.

398
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,693
Well, I guess that's
a good thing, right?

399
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,821
No, not if she was
laying dormant

400
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,198
waiting on me to get back
so she can get her revenge.

401
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,035
Ok, easy, don corleone.

402
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,037
I mean, it just
sounds like

403
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,663
mo left town
a long time ago,

404
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,248
and now she made
an amazing life

405
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,042
for herself
as a lawyer.

406
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,419
I mean, why would
she risk all of that
to get revenge?

407
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,171
You aren't even the one
who killed ty.

408
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,298
Look, all I'm saying
is maybe she's just

409
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,883
here to say good-bye
to her brother

410
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,384
and move on for good.

411
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,844
So you saying
i'm paranoid.

412
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,763
Wait, what?
No, I'm just offering

413
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,639
a different perspective.

414
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,641
Where did that come from?

415
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,853
Whatever. It's fine.
Forget it.

416
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,606
Ok, no, obviously
it's not fine.

417
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,941
Why'd you leave me behind
on the road?

418
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,028
And don't give me no b.s.
About you just wanting
to get home.

419
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,488
Is that what this
is about?

420
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,364
Babe, it's not
a big deal.

421
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,409
Look, I keep telling you

422
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
that the touring life
isn't for everyone.

423
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,331
It had nothing
to do with you.

424
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,334
Whenever you're ready
to trust me with the truth,
you let me know.

425
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,754
In the meantime, I've got
other problems to deal with.

426
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,301
Grace, the guy has
a background in education.

427
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,178
It's not so crazy
that carter

428
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,305
would be appointed
interim principal.

429
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,808
That man took that job
for one reason and one
reason only--

430
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
To make sure
you and spencer

431
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,811
don't succeed at
saving the school.

432
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,729
- Eh...
- I don't trust him, billy.

433
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh, really?
'cause I couldn't tell.

434
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
hi.

435
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,318
hey.
hey.

436
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,028
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

437
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,488
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

438
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,573
I should be at
work already, so.

439
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,534
Ahem.

440
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,370
Uh, how's spencer?
We Miss him.

441
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,996
Oh, he's doing well.

442
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,748
Yeah?

443
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,583
Actually, we're having

444
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,253
our weekly baker family
dinner tonight.

445
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,421
Could you let him know
that he's welcome to join?

446
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,550
I know the kids would
love to see him,

447
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,261
and he's family.

448
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,596
I'll let him know.

449
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,475
Um, you know, why
don't you and dillon
join us as well?

450
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:08,021
Spencer is part of
both of our families.

451
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,441
Isn't it time we left
the past in the past?

452
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,486
For the kids' sakes?

453
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,530
We'll be there.

454
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,741
Thank you.

455
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,034
All right, y'all.

456
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,036
All right now.

457
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,668
What?

458
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,879
What you just did,
it was both generous

459
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,256
and...amazing.

460
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,008
Anyway.

461
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,135
The reason for my visit.

462
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,136
Is that--

463
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,847
Mama t's mac and cheese.

464
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,683
And a pressed carnation.

465
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,268
Laura.

466
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,103
Oh, come on. We've
had the same tradition

467
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,688
since the start
of every season

468
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
since before
we were married.

469
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,151
It seemed like bad luck
to stop now.

470
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,486
ok.

471
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,948
Monique was
cagey at best.

472
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,159
She just had a lot
of questions, you know,

473
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,495
about tyrone's
initial arrest

474
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,081
and preach's conviction.

475
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,500
Nothing about shawn's mom
and the plea deal?

476
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,461
Oh, yeah, that, too.

477
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,839
I just said I wasn't
at liberty to discuss
current cases.

478
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,342
And as for the rest,
she can make an appointment

479
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,677
with my office
and my people
would provide her

480
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,512
with whatever information
we could.

481
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,098
That's well handled.
Well handled.

482
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,017
Ah, we'll see.

483
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,854
How you settling
in here?

484
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,942
Uh, physically I'm ok.

485
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,568
Emotionally, I don't know.

486
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,947
Well, you have a lot
of history here, billy.

487
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,574
You got to figure out a way

488
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,826
to put your ghosts to rest

489
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,789
so that you can focus
on your bright future ahead

490
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,500
with the chargers.

491
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,295
You sure you don't want
to go back downstairs?

492
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm not trying to get
murdered by your mom.

493
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,634
The perks of having
a single parent

494
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,594
who's also the d.a.--

495
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,221
Alone time,

496
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,848
lots and lots of alone time.

497
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,394
Hey. You've been super
quiet about your summer.

498
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,853
Not really.

499
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,856
Yes, really. Heh.

500
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,192
Come on.
What'd I miss?

501
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,568
Nothing.

502
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,364
I mean, the blm
demonstrations

503
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,367
and parts of america
showing its racist ass,

504
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,995
I've just been neck-deep
in podcast stuff.

505
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:32,291
But whatever. Ok.

506
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,376
Let's just forget
about summer.

507
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,508
We have the entire
house to ourselves.

508
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,303
Are you sure talking
is what you want to do?

509
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,938
I appreciate you.
See you next week.

510
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,440
You got it.

511
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,249
A little far from
home, ain't you?

512
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,209
So the rumors
are true.

513
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,961
You transferred
to westlake.

514
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,047
Oh, my bad. Was I supposed
to sit on the bench

515
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,174
and play backup
to spencer james?

516
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,009
The colors look good
on me, don't they?

517
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,136
You abandoned your
school when they
needed you the most.

518
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,888
That's low even
for you, cam.

519
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,682
Ain't that what you
did? Twice, in fact?

520
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,767
Ain't the same.

521
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,769
No. You right.

522
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,687
I ain't dog my old team
on the way out.

523
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,897
What are you
talking about?

524
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,066
Oh, you don't remember?

525
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,070
"star crenshaw athlete
dismisses beverly

526
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,529
"as his past.

527
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,324
Says 'crenshaw is
my future.'"

528
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,743
oh, hold up. This is
my favorite part.

529
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,453
"'as for the state
championship,'"

530
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,789
"he says, 'i'm not worried.

531
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,666
'i won last year.
I'll just win again.'"

532
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,460
that ain't even how the
interview went down, man.

533
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,961
Yeah. Whatever.
You know what?

534
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,755
I ain't got to explain
myself to you.

535
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,923
My boys at beverly already
know how I really feel.

536
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,549
They do now.

537
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,009
Worry about your
own problems, all right?

538
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,386
I ain't got
no problems.

539
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,678
I'm living my
best life, dog.

540
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,097
Till the season starts

541
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,515
'cause you gonna have
to beat the eagles

542
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,433
and us chargers
to win state.

543
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,935
Ain't no chance
of that happening.

544
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,063
You bet on
the wrong team, dog.

545
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,149
You sure about that?

546
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,819
In fact, why don't
we test that theory?

547
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,612
You know, a few of me
and my westlake boys

548
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,114
are getting together
in an hour

549
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,615
for a street
pick-up game.

550
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,534
Why don't you grab
some of your boys?

551
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,160
Beverly, crenshaw,
whatever.

552
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,079
We'll make it
a friendly competition.

553
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,081
Nah. I'm good.

554
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,999
I ain't falling for
the okey-doke again.

555
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,793
I ain't got nothing
to prove to you.

556
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,002
Yeah, I get it.

557
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,004
You know, I'd be
hesitant, too,

558
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,007
if my body was
all messed up
from a shooting.

559
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,731
He's not gonna stop
until you talk to him.

560
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,316
Look, I literally
kicked mom out

561
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,901
two minutes ago.

562
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,945
So what is this,
like a tag-team thing?

563
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,619
Why won't you
talk to him, simone?

564
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,330
I will. I just...

565
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,040
These are his last
days of summer vacay.

566
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,709
He should be hanging
out with his boys

567
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,461
and living it up,

568
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,796
not stuck here,
baby-sitting me.

569
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,550
You want to try that again?

570
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,136
I watched the two of you
together all summer.

571
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,763
And that excuse just
sounds stupid.

572
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,688
He loves my baby, dad.

573
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,025
Even though
it wasn't his,

574
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,320
even with all the drama
that I caused...

575
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,450
He still loves him.

576
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,160
And now
that baby's gone,

577
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,413
so I can't just
look him in the face

578
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,708
and see him hurting and
know that I caused that

579
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,376
yet again.

580
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,299
What if he hates me
for it, dad?

581
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,384
Oh, honey,

582
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,637
you're not giving
jordan anywhere near

583
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,347
enough credit.

584
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,643
I mean, that boy gets on
my last damn nerve.

585
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,187
But there's one thing
I know for sure...

586
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,482
Is how much he loves you.

587
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,401
Don't shut him out.

588
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,872
Hey, jordan?

589
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,292
Jordan, you here?

590
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,009
My bad.

591
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,719
I let myself in.

592
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,221
I should've rung
the bell.

593
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,682
Why? You have a key.

594
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,850
Yeah, I should probably
give this back.

595
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,105
This ain't my home no more.

596
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,731
Spencer, I--

597
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,776
Spence.

598
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,653
Hey, man.

599
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,154
I didn't get
the chance to talk to
you at school yesterday

600
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,406
it's good to see you, man.

601
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,616
Yeah, you, too.
You, too.

602
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,203
This is my fault.

603
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,871
I was looking for jordan.
He ain't answering my texts.

604
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,999
Uh, I think he's
with simone.

605
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,626
But he's gonna be at
jj's half-birthday later.

606
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,919
Oh. Right. Ok.

607
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,087
All right. Bet.
I'mma go.

608
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,548
I'll let you, ok?

609
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,174
Um, one sec.

610
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,051
Hey. Uh...

611
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,388
Is everything ok,
or did something happen?

612
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,766
Nah, everything's cool.

613
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,227
Besides, it's like
you said yesterday...

614
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,483
Space, right?

615
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,379
hey.

616
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,593
Uh, so...

617
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,136
Welcome home.

618
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,305
Thanks. Um...

619
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,848
Look, I tried to be
a big girl

620
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,059
and text before
the awkward run-in.

621
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,644
Yeah. Yeah. I ran
into cameron when
I got the text.

622
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,936
No. It's fine.

623
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,730
And, listen, about vegas,

624
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,815
it wasn't
a big deal, so...

625
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,736
Layla, it was
a big deal to me.

626
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,216
Here you go, babe.

627
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,054
Guess we missed
a lot this summer.

628
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,223
Yeah, I guess so.

629
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,394
Whenever she
was pregnant, like,

630
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,854
she would eat
everything, bro.

631
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,440
What up, j.?
Everything good?

632
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,193
Simone doing ok?

633
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,444
Simone's fine.

634
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,987
What are you
doing here, spence?

635
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,533
I mean, now, seeing as
beverly is in your past.

636
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,953
Yeah, we figured you'd
keep it that way.

637
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,287
That reporter
twisted my words.

638
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,789
Forget it.

639
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,960
Yo, who's up for
some cutthroat pool?

640
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,004
Y'all got
some room for us?

641
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,966
Or are you afraid
of a little friendly
competition?

642
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,134
Man, if you
don't kick rocks--

643
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,469
The more,
the merrier.

644
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,221
Cool.

645
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,895
Yeah. No, no, no.
I'll hold. I'll hold.

646
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,398
Oh, hi! Hello? So clearly,
your phone's working.

647
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,275
Why haven't
you hit me back?

648
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,654
What's the point

649
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,406
when we can't even have
an honest conversation?

650
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,241
Can you just put down
the damn phone, please?

651
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,868
No, no. I cannot, ok?

652
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,244
I'm on hold, trying
to make an appointment

653
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,662
to visit preach at
the county tomorrow.

654
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,955
He'll know what
the deal is with mo.

655
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,248
Ok, fine. Whatever.

656
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,333
And, you know,
for the record,

657
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,877
it's not that
I don't trust you.

658
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,128
I'm just trying to protect
you and your career.

659
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,379
Protect me from what?

660
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,298
Just from being
in the middle.

661
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,636
Look, I signed an n.d.a.,
so I can't say much,

662
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,890
but the reason that I
left the tour early is

663
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,475
because of j.p.

664
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,311
Like, he takes cutthroat
to a whole nother level.

665
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,272
And layla's dad isn't
who y'all think he is.

666
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,816
What exactly
did j.p. Do?

667
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,735
w--
One second, one second.

668
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,487
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm still here.
I'm here.

669
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,489
What do you mean?

670
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,782
Well, where is he?

671
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,200
What happened?
ok.

672
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,038
Preach got
released today.

673
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,003
So you and spencer.

674
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,714
Yeah. It, um--
It kind of
happened in vegas,

675
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,132
but I wasn't really
sure till tonight.

676
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,218
Wow. Vegas. Heh!

677
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,011
Sounds like I missed a lot.

678
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,263
Uh, how was your
sobriety sister?

679
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,226
The one you stayed
in l.a. To help over
the vegas weekend.

680
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,395
Yeah. Um, yeah,
she's better. Thanks.

681
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,730
Good.

682
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,613
Hey, how's simone
doing?

683
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,325
Say her name again.

684
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,078
Chill. He ain't
worth it, all right?

685
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,496
Get off me.

686
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,082
Uh-oh.
Trouble in paradise?

687
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,500
Why don't you mind
your business?

688
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,008
That's
what you got, man.

689
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,683
Looks like I bet on
the wrong partner.

690
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,101
All right, jj.

691
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,894
Do your thing.

692
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,942
Fancy now. God.
ooh!

693
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,611
6, corner pocket.

694
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,995
yo.

695
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,413
You need me to help
you move or something?

696
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,126
Watch yourself.

697
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,136
Ooh, man! What a shot.

698
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,691
Oh, ok. So we're using
illegal moves now, huh?

699
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,777
You accusing me of cheating?

700
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,487
Jordan, he's
on your team, dude.

701
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,865
Oh, my bad.
I guess I forgot.

702
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,784
It's hard to tell where
your loyalties lie
these days, spence.

703
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,369
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Stop being a bitch, man.

704
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,955
If you got something to
say to me, just say it.

705
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,874
Jordan, what the hell!

706
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,208
What, spence?

707
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,672
oh!

708
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,716
Talking to you, boy.

709
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,426
What the hell's wrong with you?
Gonna shut your damn mouth?

710
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,887
What the hell's wrong
with you, boy?

711
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,854
Ten months we lived
together,

712
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,398
played side-by-side.

713
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,945
You ratted me out
when I first got here.

714
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,989
Parents lying
about their affair,

715
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,658
my dad dying.

716
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,746
All that, and not once--

717
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,124
Not once did we ever lay
hands on each other...

718
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,170
Until today.

719
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,964
What am I missing, man?

720
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,632
Right.

721
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,134
All that, and still you
turn your back on me

722
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,220
without giving it
a second thought.

723
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,639
And, worse, you took
my dad with you.

724
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,182
Hold up.

725
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,850
Your pops was

726
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,936
never coming back
to beverly regardless.

727
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,814
And as for the rest,
jordan, you was there, man.

728
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,316
You stood by my side in
that school board meeting.

729
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,026
You told me you
understood.

730
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,611
I understand you
felt you had to leave

731
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,279
to save your community,
spence. I do.

732
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,116
I just wish that you
would've thought

733
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,535
about the community
you're ripping apart.

734
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,955
All right? That's it.

735
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,915
Jordan--

736
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,469
Well, you were right.

737
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,930
You always said I'd
eventually stop running

738
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,099
and find my way back home.

739
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,102
Making things right is
always the correct
thing to do,

740
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,770
but it's not
always easy.

741
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,648
Well, that's
an understatement. Heh.

742
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,693
Some amends just take
a conversation,

743
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,446
but others
take a lifetime.

744
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,575
So you mean I really
got to apologize, mom?

745
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,201
Yes, billy.

746
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,663
You have to
apologize.

747
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,631
All right. Come on.
Come on. We gonna be late.

748
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,511
I don't know, ma.

749
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,138
Maybe I shouldn't go
to this dinner.

750
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,307
why?

751
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,101
Maybe because he
and jordan were punching
each other in the face.

752
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,690
Uh-uh. In this family, we
don't hide from conflict.

753
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,651
We face it, own our part,
and make it better.

754
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,320
I'd own my part
if I knew how.

755
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,155
What did jordan expect
me to do,

756
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,531
let south crenshaw close?

757
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,158
Spencer, you don't
get it, man.

758
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,744
Jordan being upset, it's
not about football.

759
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,287
You gave him
a brother,

760
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,790
a pretty amazing
brother at that.

761
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,709
And in a snap,
you took that away.

762
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,797
But you have no idea
how devastating that is.

763
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,006
Trust me.

764
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,508
I'm sorry, d.

765
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,676
It's all right.

766
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,804
But you got to do
for jordan what
you did for me.

767
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,014
Help him understand
that it doesn't matter
where you live.

768
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,517
That brotherhood is
never gonna change.

769
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,107
Yeah, all right.
Come on, man.

770
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,866
Hey, d'angelo.

771
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,536
Look, man,

772
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,998
i, uh, I just wanted to
sincerely apologize

773
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,667
for, uh...

774
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,169
For any bullying
that happened
when we were kids.

775
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,839
I am--i'm not the same
person I was back then.

776
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,468
And I'm hoping we can
put the past behind us

777
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,098
and, you know, kind of
rebuild this place together.

778
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,308
Consider the bullying
ancient history.

779
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,561
Cool.

780
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,604
But having to leave
my family behind

781
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,481
and go away to
boarding school

782
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,068
because of billy baker
and his bright future,

783
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,070
that I can't forgive.

784
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,325
Oh, hey,
and, by the way,

785
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,952
I raised the gpa
requirement

786
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,246
for all athletic
participation this year.

787
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,290
South crenshaw high
will become synonymous

788
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,833
with
academic excellence.

789
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,877
Good luck scraping
your team together.

790
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,639
There he is.
Hey. What's good?

791
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,433
How you feeling?
Where's jordan?

792
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,435
Oh, we gave him a pass
on the family dinner.

793
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,729
I guess simone wasn't
returning his calls,

794
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,314
so he got worried.

795
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,774
But, look, I heard
about the fight.

796
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,484
Jordan will come
around.

797
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,195
He just needs time.

798
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,406
Y'all are family.
Remember that.

799
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
All right.
What's happening here?

800
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,162
I think
you sit--he can sit here?

801
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,788
yes.

802
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,667
Jordan, it's me.

803
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,004
Look, I'm sorry, man.
For real this time.

804
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,840
Decisions I had
to make hurt you,

805
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:02,011
and that ain't something
i'd ever intentionally do.

806
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,140
I meant it when I said
we was brothers, man.

807
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,808
That ain't ever
gonna change,

808
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,852
so just--

809
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,232
Look, just hit me back
when you're ready to talk.

810
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,202
Tamia cooper, I've been
waiting to finally meet you.

811
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,536
Enough of the b.s.

812
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,913
What you want?

813
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,749
I want to make amends.

814
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,461
When I first came to town,
I was hellbent on revenge.

815
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,047
But over the summer, I had
some time to calm down,

816
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,966
do some digging of my own.

817
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,344
My brother terrorized
this community,

818
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,888
and I'm sorry.

819
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,515
I was his sister.

820
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,808
And instead of
protecting him,

821
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,810
I left him behind to
save myself.

822
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,271
That's why I went to
d.a. Baker and got

823
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,314
the ammo I needed to
get preach released.

824
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,233
How is that
even possible?

825
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,694
Preach's first strike
was a marijuana
possession years ago.

826
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,904
Marijuana's legal now.

827
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,073
I got that initial
charge overturned.

828
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,868
Which makes his current
charge a second strike,
not a third.

829
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,788
And he's already spent
more than enough time
in prison for that.

830
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,582
You have no reason
to believe me

831
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,918
after what tyrone did
to you and your friends.

832
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,296
But if you would
let me, I would like

833
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,047
to keep making amends.

834
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,724
Honey.

835
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,104
I messed up everything.

836
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,899
I pushed jordan away,
I pushed my baby away.

837
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,153
I didn't even look at him.

838
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,114
You didn't push
anyone away.
And the baby is--

839
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,283
Oh, god. I know.

840
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:52,204
I did the right thing,
but, dad, it hurts.

841
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,916
It really hurts, dad.

842
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,464
I don't even know
my own son's name.

843
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,386
It's shay.

844
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,847
Your son's name
is shay.

845
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,849
And he's
beautiful.

846
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,100
Here.

847
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,606
Ohh. How did
you get these?

848
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,191
I took them.

849
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,860
I figured one day
you'd want to know,

850
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,154
and I didn't want
you to regret never
getting to see him.

851
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,994
Tell me everything.

852
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,581
Well, let's see. He's
got your big head.

853
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,432
Hello?

854
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,476
Jordan, I am so sorry.

855
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,062
Hey, hey, it's ok.
It's ok, all right?

856
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,690
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm on my way up right now.

857
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,777
Well, bougie loafers
aside, I do think

858
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
that carter may
be a problem

859
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,863
for the football
team this season.

860
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,866
Hey, as long as the chargers
have you and spencer,

861
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,493
hey, ain't
no stopping y'all.

862
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,953
You can say that
again.

863
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,830
All right. I like
that attitude...

864
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,498
Whoo-hoo.

865
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,458
Here's to that.
Here's to that.

866
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,755
Hey, I got to
tell you something.

867
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,590
I got that.
Yeah? You good?

868
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,263
My arm ain't 100%.

869
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,390
It went numb

870
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,809
the day after
the jamboree.

871
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,352
And it didn't happen
again all summer,

872
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,812
which is why I ain't
say nothing.

873
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,065
So you're
telling me now. Why?

874
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,775
It happened again
tonight.

875
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,570
Just for a moment after
my fight with jordan.

876
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,030
I'm sorry.

877
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,327
Look, what if
I do have permanent
nerve damage, coach?

878
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,079
What if the doctor
was wrong, all right?

879
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,123
What if I can't play?

880
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,126
Ok, ok, don't worry
about it, son.

881
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,546
Um, I'm gonna call in
a few favors.

882
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,382
And I'll get you one
of the best doctors
in the league.

883
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,217
He'll check you out.

884
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,469
Try not to worry, all right?

885
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,554
We got this.

886
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,940
My dad's right.

887
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,734
You're gonna be ok.

888
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,819
I'm proud of you for
telling him the truth.

889
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,333
liv.

890
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,005
We're just not
gonna talk about
what happened this summer?

891
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,205
Greg, move your head.

891
00:42:22,305 --> 00:43:22,267

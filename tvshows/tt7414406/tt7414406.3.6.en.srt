What you all
doing here?!

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,052
Hey.
Hey, Ms. Grace.

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,054
Look, I know it's mad
early, but is Spencer up?

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,638
Uh, I'm sorry, Tamia.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,265
Spencer went to
the cabin this weekend.

7
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,184
To get away from me?

8
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,270
To get away
from everything.

9
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,108
You want to come in?

10
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,662
yes!
Oh, I thought you...

11
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,629
You're just
in time, Spencer.
Look at this.

12
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,302
Hey,
What's taking you
so long, old man?

13
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,573
It's broken.

14
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,201
Don't worry about it. Heh!
Oh. Heh! Ok.

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,411
Um, ok, so...

16
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,622
Mm-hmm?
A toast

17
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:07,210
to...bellas
before fellas.

18
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,046
Cheers to that.
Yes. Mmm.

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,048
I'm surprised
you weren't holed up

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,675
in the studio
this weekend.

21
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,844
Yeah, I'm taking a break
from the studio.

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,054
Things got weird
between Spencer
and Coop last night,

23
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,681
and now I'm worried
that things are
gonna get weird

24
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,432
with me and Coop, so--
So you're hiding.

25
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,892
Yes, absolutely.

26
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,228
What about you?
Any big plans?

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,855
Um...

28
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,691
Asher has some surprise
itinerary planned

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,318
for this weekend,
right down to the second.

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,445
Oh. Intriguing.
Yeah.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,198
Yeah, we haven't had much
alone time lately, so...

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,159
Right, well,
amen to alone time.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,161
Wait.
What about Spencer?

34
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,748
Um, he--he left
to his family cabin

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,750
this morning, clear
the last of the boxes

36
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,586
and his head, I guess.

37
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,796
I offered to go
with him, but, um,

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,090
he said he wanted
to be alone, so--

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,301
Well, this is
the first time
he's been back

40
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,927
since he lost
his dad there.

41
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,555
I mean, is it really
a good idea

42
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,057
for him to be
all alone?

43
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,477
Did Spencer
tell you

44
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,813
about our fight,
how he blames me?

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,481
He did.

46
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,483
You agree with Spencer?

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,611
You blame me
for him getting shot?

48
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,237
I'd never blame you.

49
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,489
Look, I love you

50
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,617
like I love Spencer
and Dillon,

51
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,827
hear me?

52
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,829
The truth is,

53
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,123
you both made
some serious mistakes.

54
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,375
Y'all two aren't
that different.

55
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,378
You and Spencer are two
of the most loyal,

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,590
passionate, convicted
people that I know,

57
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,177
and it's those same qualities
that'll bring you two
back to each other.

58
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,307
I remember...the summer
before fifth grade,

59
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,602
when you wanted to play
football for Spencer's
pop warner team.

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,480
Spencer wore
his coach down

61
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,440
until he said yes,

62
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,359
but then?

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,569
I didn't show up.
At the last minute,

64
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,572
you realized that football
was Spencer's thing,

65
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,783
and you didn't want
to butt in,

66
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,535
but Spencer didn't
know that; he just

67
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,704
felt betrayed because
you left him hanging.

68
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,332
I didn't think
the friendship
would survive.

69
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,834
Then I apologized and
bought him ice cream...

70
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,712
With his allowance.
see?

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,927
Ms. Grace, if you would
have seen Spencer's face
last night,

72
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,347
you'd know that this time,
it ain't the same.

73
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,357
What's this?
It's the deed
to the cabin.

74
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,776
I'm leaving it
to Spencer and Dillon.

75
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,321
Hopefully they'll pass it on
to their kids one day,

76
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,907
part of the james legacy.

77
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,255
Hey, pops, what's wrong?

78
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
dad?

79
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,927
dad?

80
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,388
Dad! Hey!

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,223
Hey, come on,

82
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,809
come on. Come on!

83
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,940
rrr!

84
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,468
Um, we're here for you.

85
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,897
Yeah.
ha!

86
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,822
You ok?
Yeah.

87
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,415
So you're cool
with us being here?

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,750
'cause I can tell
everyone to go home.

89
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,126
They'll totally
understand.

90
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,170
I did say I wanted
to be alone.

91
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,005
I knew it.
I'm sorry--

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,049
I'm messing with you.
I was about to bounce

93
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,343
outta here before
y'all showed up.

94
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,845
And now?
I'm breathing
a little easier.

95
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,348
Thank you.

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,309
Uh, well, actually, olivia
deserves the credit.

97
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,520
It was her idea to come.

98
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,608
Ash, thanks for being
cool with all of this.

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,445
Yeah, it's not how I
imagined our weekend,
but...

100
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,572
Spencer's our friend.

101
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,574
He needs us.

102
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,911
Plus, we are at
a remote cabin in
the middle of the woods.

103
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,746
An awesome lake
and no parents.

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,208
Not a one.
Pretty damn sure we can
find some alone time.

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,961
Think we're gonna have
so much alone time, you're
gonna be sick of me.

106
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,713
Heh heh! Well,
it's a good thing you
brought a whole pharmacy.

107
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,425
Shut up!

108
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,594
Billy.
What's up?

109
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,306
Uh...

110
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,767
The kids are a little old
for costume parties,

111
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,395
and they're not here.

112
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,063
You got jokes,

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,690
but seriously,
these tools are real.

114
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,109
I came to use 'em.

115
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,154
Picked up a couple
of things while I've
been living on my own.

116
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,780
Little twin told me
that there was some issue

117
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,365
with the, uh,
garbage disposal?

118
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,700
Right.

119
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,702
Uh, you're welcome
to give it a shot,

120
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,164
but, uh, the handyman's
coming on monday--

121
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,708
Uh-uh! I got this.

122
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,168
Oh, really, now?

123
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,503
I'll be done
in no time.

124
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,256
ok.

125
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,554
Hey, B?

126
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,140
Ooh. Yeah?

127
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,518
Thanks.

128
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,111
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, guys. Hey.
Gem here.

129
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,739
I just found a portable
cassette player.

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,741
I read about those
in the library.

131
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,451
Yeah, that thing
belongs in a museum.

132
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,286
No, it belongs
in the memory pile.

133
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,330
No. No, no, no.

134
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,581
That's the junk pile.

135
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,957
No, that's
the memory pile.

136
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,417
No, that's
the memory pile.

137
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,794
Uh-oh.

138
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,796
We got to start over.
In my defense,

139
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,674
I didn't even know
we were making
separate piles.

140
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,302
Ok, ok. Why don't y'all go
hang with the girls, man?

141
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,179
Seriously, I got this.
Don't worry about it.

142
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,972
They're on a hike, man.

143
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,975
Come on. We got you.
Let's go through
these piles again.

144
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,602
Thanks.

145
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,146
I'm glad y'all
showed up.

146
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,775
Yo, I still can't believe
that jj convinced vanessa
to come with him.

147
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
Ho ho! Well,
she loves the wilderness.

148
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,238
She does?
Yeah.

149
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,324
So this is
the perfect place
to pop the question.

150
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,867
Wait. What?
Yeah.

151
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm gonna ask her
to be my girlfriend.

152
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,874
That ain't what
"pop the question"
means, dawg.

153
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,252
Ok, hold on,
you two.

154
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,254
Heh heh!
You do realize that

155
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,464
your couple's name will
be "va-jay-jay," right?

156
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,801
Yo, spence,
junk pile or memory pile?

157
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,554
Looks like junk to me.

158
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,186
Oh! Oh, my!

159
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,814
Ok, can you--
Where is vanessa?

160
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,108
I thought she was--
Girl, these mosquitoes.

161
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,110
She's napping.
I thought she
was strolling with us.

162
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,736
She doesn't like
the wilderness.

163
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,363
Apparently, you also
don't like it. Ha ha!

164
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,365
Yeah, yet she came to
a cabin in the woods.

165
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,784
I'm sorry.
Am I detecting

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,412
a little something
with vanessa?

167
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,539
No. She's fine.

168
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
Yeah, ok.

169
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,587
Olivia,
what's the deal?

170
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,424
Vanessa actually
met Asher

171
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,593
over the summer
in mexico.

172
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,011
oh.

173
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,429
oh!

174
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,014
No, no,
nothing happened.

175
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,016
They just became,
like...

176
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,059
Vacay bffs.

177
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,270
Yeah, but Asher didn't
mention anything until

178
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,898
a couple weeks after
vanessa became the
new beverly transfer.

179
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
Damn.
Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,862
Aw, well, I'm sorry
I asked.

181
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,073
I mean, no, it's--
It's not a big deal.
We're cool.

182
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,035
You know, she's here
to party with jj, so...

183
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,038
Well, there will be
no partying for me.

184
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,665
I still got to
finish these college
admissions essays.

185
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,916
No, no,
no, no, no.

186
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,752
This is
a homework-free,

187
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,171
college app-free,
stress-free
weekend.

188
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,175
Yeah, easy for you to say.
I'm pretty sure you finished
all yours already.

189
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,926
Guilty.

190
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,928
Oh, I just had a lot
of down time this summer.

191
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,555
Oh, my god.

192
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,891
Guys, I'm screwed.

193
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,392
I don't even know what
to write about.

194
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,227
Just write
about you and all

195
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,063
the amazing things you have
planned for the future.

196
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,066
Yeah, sorry, but
it's not that easy.

197
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,109
Getting pregnant
literally shocked me

198
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,737
out of the
parental-controlled
life I was living,

199
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,781
and now I look
in the mirror,

200
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,825
and I'm just
second-guessing everything.

201
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,703
"tibi ipsi esto fidelis."

202
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
"to thine own self,
be true."

203
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,418
You just have to be patient
and listen to yourself,

204
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,213
and you will find clarity.
Why are you laughing?

205
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,840
Ok, oprah, coming through
with the wisdom.

206
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,593
Ok, in latin, too!
ooh!

207
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,889
I mean--
Ha ha ha!

208
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,891
Ok, all right. Ahem.

209
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,727
Hold on. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait one--

210
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,730
These bags are 100%
from the junk pile, right?

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,984
No, no, no,
we are not doing this
again. We're good.

212
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,986
ok.
All right.

213
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,825
Now can we have some fun?
Oh, let's get it on!

214
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,451
Yo, what are we
getting on?

215
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,871
Oh, I brought the party
to us, man. Heh heh!

216
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,919
Heh! Gentlemen,
this is my porta-party.

217
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,632
Uh, a portable party.

218
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,051
Heh! Dude.
This is impressive,
my friend.

219
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,303
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, I knew you were
gonna go for that one.

220
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,516
That, my friend,
is the xjr 3000.

221
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,309
It's illegal
in 34 states.

222
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,770
All right. Heh! Ok.
Which one's mine?

223
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,523
Right there.

224
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,131
Your boys are
about to get their
butts handed to them.

225
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,134
Hey, you ok?

226
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,763
The 8 years he
was gone...

227
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,308
Corey wrote birthday letters
to me and Dillon.

228
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,771
wow.

229
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,190
What do they say?

230
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,192
I don't know.

231
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,195
I don't know if I
want to read 'em.

232
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,198
It's like finding
a piece of him,

233
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,201
and corey had a lot
of different sides.

234
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,788
I just don't know
which one of him's
in this box.

235
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,919
I know it's not exactly
the same, but...

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,297
When I was digging
through my mom's
song lyrics,

237
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,508
it left me with more
questions than answers.

238
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,802
Corey didn't mail
those letters
for a reason.

239
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,221
You saying I
shouldn't read 'em?

240
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,056
It's your choice,

241
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,184
but you also don't have
to make it right now.

242
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,312
I mean, those letters
aren't going anywhere.

243
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,198
Yeah.

244
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,910
Man, he just up and left.

245
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,120
Like, Spencer better have
lost his damn mind

246
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,831
'cause he actin' like
he don't know better!

247
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,502
I mean, how he just
gonna leave me hangin'
like that...

248
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,170
All unresolved?
Oh, my god.

249
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,755
Is this gonna be you
the whole weekend?

250
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,173
Is that gonna be
your phone all weekend?

251
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,508
Forget about my phone.
Why don't you just

252
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,843
go to the cabin
and talk to Spencer?

253
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,886
Man, I'm not chasin'
after nobody...

254
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,264
Unlike whoever's blowing
you the hell up.

255
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,890
Do I need to be worried?

256
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,517
No, no, it's whatever.

257
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,143
It's lil jewel.
She's been calling me

258
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,563
nonstop for the last
few days, so I don't know.

259
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,481
Lil jewel, as in
"the bitch that stole

260
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,149
your song" lil jewel?
Mm-hmm.

261
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,151
What does she want?
I have no idea!

262
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,196
I haven't taken her calls,
hence the stalking.

263
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,408
Look, Coop,
just go talk to Spencer.

264
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,035
If you don't, it's
gonna drive you crazy.

265
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,122
You know, and besides,
he's at that cabin
where his dad died,

266
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,582
alone...

267
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,209
So, fight or not, you know,

268
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,337
he could probably use
his best friend right now.

269
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,301
Ok? So are you
gonna go or not?

270
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,477
Hey, babe,

271
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,105
jj's about to do
a back flip off
a tree branch

272
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
into the murky water.
You don't want
to Miss this.

273
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,319
As much as I would love
to see jj use one
of his 9 lives,

274
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,321
I really got
to finish this essay.

275
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,990
What are you working on?

276
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,621
You're applying
to princeton?

277
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,833
Yeah.

278
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,335
why?

279
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,711
Because it's princeton.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,546
It's also on
the east coast.

281
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,381
And they have one of
the top tennis programs

282
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,966
in the country.
You--you play tennis?

283
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,552
Yes. I mean, I did,

284
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,137
in another life.

285
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,931
How did I not
know this about you?

286
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,725
To be fair, you really
only knew pregnant simone,

287
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,312
and tennis simone,
now, that is a whole
different vibe.

288
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,272
How good were you?

289
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,483
When I was younger,

290
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,277
they said I had
serena williams potential.

291
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,488
Seriously?
Yeah.

292
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,491
I was really good.

293
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,494
I was very good,

294
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,705
but tennis, that was
my mom's dream for me.

295
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,416
I just wanted to be
a normal kid, you know?

296
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,252
So sophomore year,
I took a break,
and then last year,

297
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,131
well, the whole
pregnancy thing.

298
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,759
Now that I've had
some time away from it,

299
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,178
i'm thinking maybe...

300
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,722
I wasn't just playing
for my mom.

301
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,433
I actually
kind of Miss it,

302
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,478
like, a lot.

303
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,605
wow.

304
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,406
What else don't I
know about you?

305
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,829
Well, tennis simone's
got a few secrets.

306
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,624
Babe, I am joking.

307
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,885
"Spencer,
happy birthday, son.

308
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,887
"our first one apart.

309
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,223
"just one more thing
to thank your mother for.

310
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,894
"don't go sacrificing
your dreams for nobody.

311
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,313
"i could have made
a comeback after the cancer.

312
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,941
"my nfl dream didn't
have to die,

313
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,570
"but instead, I focused
on life with your mother,

314
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,365
"and she threw it away.
All right, so I was gone a lot.

315
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,576
"i had to provide
for our family,

316
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,786
"the family
your mother betrayed,

317
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,205
"with billy, no less.
Billy!

318
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,833
"keep an eye
on your friends, Spencer.

319
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,335
Those bonds ain't real."

320
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,968
June 18, 1998.

321
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,221
Uh, what is the day
jeff hamilton hit

322
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,475
his 8,000th
dodger home run?

323
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,726
no.

324
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,104
Uh, our tiny apartment
in miami.

325
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,523
Our a/c unit died
that day,

326
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,735
and you thought
you could fix it.

327
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,695
Yeah.

328
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,115
We ended up with
a shattered unit
on the pavement.

329
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,201
Mm-hmm.
This is gonna
be different, though.

330
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,203
Oh, is it?
Ready?

331
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,707
Whoa.
Uh-oh. Whoa!

332
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,543
Whoa! Oh, nuts.

333
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,713
I'm glad to see your,
uh, new handyman skills
are really paying off.

334
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,091
Hey, woman,
are you just gonna

335
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,718
make fun of me, or you
gonna help me fix this

336
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,138
before it overflows
into the--oh, boy.

337
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,140
Ok, ok, you guys
ready to experience

338
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,768
my life-changing
fettucine a la jj?

339
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,521
Fettucine?
I thought we were
having hot dogs and burgers.

340
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,065
You won't be disappointed.
We're already
disappointed.

341
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,567
I vote for burgers.
I'm on it.

342
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,528
Hey, your loss.
Whoa, your--

343
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,071
Since when did you
know how to cook?

344
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,323
Oh, since his dad lost
all their takeout money.

345
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,953
Yo, jj, you got
garlic in there at all?

346
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,955
Yeah, this is
looking good.

347
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,582
How good?
Like, like...

348
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,881
Tough crowd.

349
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,050
Full of jokes.

350
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,010
I'm not laughing.

351
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,763
Thanks,
but it's all good.

352
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,974
Is it? Your friends
are having fun

353
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,059
with something I know
really devastated you.

354
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,477
What do you want
me to do?

355
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,105
I don't know,
but the Asher

356
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,524
I met this summer
was relaxed

357
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,277
and hopeful
and confident.

358
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,029
Do any of them
even know him?

359
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,031
He's really great.

360
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,160
Maybe you should
introduce yourself
sometime.

361
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,843
Damn...

362
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,845
You showed those
letters who's boss.

363
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,847
Somebody had to.

364
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,855
We can talk
about it

365
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,025
or...
Not talk about it.

366
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,152
Whatever you need.

367
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,449
I hoped reading
these letters would, uh...

368
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,286
I don't know. I hoped
it would be like a--

369
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,954
A gift?

370
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,247
Yeah.

371
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,374
mmm.
Exactly.

372
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,755
I mean, he blames
my moms for everything,

373
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,758
even the choices
he made, and, uh,

374
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,427
I don't want to
remember him like that.

375
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,138
I've got corn. Heh!

376
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,890
Thanks.

377
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,391
Ahem.

378
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,144
They seem closer
than ever.

379
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,941
You ever wonder
what we missed being
gone this summer?

380
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,653
Yo, ash,
where's my oregano at?

381
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,162
How many letters
have you read?

382
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,248
Just one.

383
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,250
Spencer...

384
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,252
Of course your dad

385
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,254
was angry in
his first letter.

386
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,256
I mean, everything
was still fresh,

387
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,591
and the dad that you
actually got to know

388
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,802
had moved past
all that.

389
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,929
I mean, don't you
want to know how?

390
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,391
I just wish he was here
to tell me himself.

391
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,476
He is.

392
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,480
These letters
are the gift.

393
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,482
They're a second chance
to get to know

394
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,110
your dad in a way that
time stole from you.

395
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,321
And whatever's in
those letters...

396
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,242
You're strong enough
to handle.

397
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,488
Thanks for coming.
Well, lil jewel,

398
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,033
I needed you
to stop draining my
phone battery, so...

399
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,660
Can--can we sit?

400
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,079
Look,

401
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,082
i'm still
finding out all
the details myself,

402
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,918
but I had no idea
j.p. Stole your song.

403
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,087
I came up
as a young girl
in this game,

404
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,591
and I would never do
another female dirty
like that.

405
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,218
ok.

406
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,846
Well, you said
your piece, so,

407
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,681
yeah, it's over now.
Doesn't matter.

408
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,308
Come on tour with me.

409
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,934
We'll take it
a city at a time.

410
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,936
Sing your song

411
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,730
the way it was always
supposed to be done.

412
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,357
I'll get you a tutor

413
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,775
so you can keep up
with school.

414
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
Please,

415
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,653
give me a chance
to make this right.

416
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,407
"it's taken me
a minute,

417
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,242
"but I found my...

438
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,754
Say it with your
whole chest, babe.

439
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,297
Fine.
Uh, queen beyonce.

440
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,299
How's that?
All right, period.

441
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,678
Hmm, hey.
Here, let me help you.
I got it.

442
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,097
ok.

443
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,516
Um...hey,

444
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,060
do you want to go
for a moonlight
walk later?

445
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,938
If you're lucky,
I might let you get
to second base.

446
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,065
Sure you'll be free?

447
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,026
Spencer might get
a splinter or something
and need your help.

448
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,029
Wow. Um...

449
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,032
Wait, are you--
Are you joking?

450
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,452
What happened
to our quality time, liv?

451
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,829
There's still plenty of time.
Spencer needed my help.

452
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,874
Why are you the one always
giving Spencer what he needs?

453
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,592
Ooh, wow.
Come on, jj.

454
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,095
jj,
What games you got in
that porta-party, man?

455
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,722
You name it, I got it.

456
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,557
All right, then.
Ladies and gentlemen,

457
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,018
it is time to turn up.
Hey.

458
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,353
You seem happier.
Hey, I got

459
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,481
this dope-ass cabin,
my best friends are all here.

460
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,692
You got to celebrate the moment.
Uh-huh, yeah, man!

461
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,486
It's officially
game night!

462
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,489
Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah.

463
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,491
Come on.

464
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,117
Have fun.

465
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,244
What's the worst
that could happen?

466
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,295
Ha ha ha!
Healthy.

467
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,756
Come on.
Something I eat?

468
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,758
Uh, something--
Something you eat.

469
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,384
Uh, healthy,
healthy, healthy.

470
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,513
Uh, white people like it.
Avocado!

471
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,848
yes.

472
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,475
All right, come on,
come on. 4 words.

473
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,727
4 words.
Uh, back.

474
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,187
Oh! Oh!
Is it back?

475
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,314
Time, time!
ah!

476
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,982
Damn!
Babe, what was that?

477
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,734
"back to the future"!
What?

478
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,736
"back to the future"?

479
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,947
I've never seen
that movie in my life.

480
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,115
Whoa! What?
No, I haven't.

481
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,242
It's the greatest
movie ever.

482
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,785
Uh, if you're 40,

483
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,787
and for the record,
the greatest movie

484
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,747
ever is "parasite."
Come on.

485
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,084
Yeah, jordan doesn't
do subtitles.
Have you met him?

486
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,168
Seriously?

487
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,670
Who are you?

488
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,672
Ooh, ok, um,
he's an actor.

489
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,215
Pretty famous, sexy.

490
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,841
uh--
Michael b. Jordan.

491
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,094
Damn.
ooh.

492
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,554
He's sexy, but no.
Um, older.

493
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,013
The real michael jordan.

494
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,181
She said an actor, bro.

495
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,766
Time's almost up.

496
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,977
Let's go.
Ok, no, um, um--oh!

497
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,437
You had a poster of him
up in your bedroom
when you were 10.

498
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,649
Samuel l. Jackson.

499
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,277
Yes! Nice!

500
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,112
You want to go?
Yeah, I'll go.

501
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,739
All right! Next!

502
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,325
All right!
Run me my crown.

503
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,327
Run me my crown.

504
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,704
You ok?

505
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,706
You're kind of quiet.

506
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,207
Yeah, just tired,
I guess.

507
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,834
You got it!
Doesn't matter.

508
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,627
Hey, party people.

509
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,671
It's time
to turn up for real.

510
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,423
Oh, we're not drinking
this weekend.

511
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,882
Oh, no, don't stay
sober 'cause of me.

512
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,759
um,
I'm so sorry, liv.

513
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,969
I completely forgot
you don't drink.

514
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,345
It's all good.
I mean, it's not

515
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,555
something I'd expect
you to know, so...

516
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,682
No liquor.

517
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,310
How 'bout
a different game--

518
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,686
Never have I ever?

519
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,313
Never have I ever not

520
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,939
gotten into trouble
playing that game.

521
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,191
Besides, doesn't really
work without shots.

522
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,819
Au contraire.

523
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,030
huh?

524
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,409
Jalapeno-infused
pickle juice. Heh heh!

525
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,661
A burn you'll
never forget.

526
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,872
What don't you have
in that porta-party, man?

527
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,790
Well, heh heh!
Whoa, ho ho!

528
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,795
Ha ha ha ha!
All right.

529
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,214
You know the rules.
Drink if you've done it.

530
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,217
Here we go. Um...
Never have I ever said,

531
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,678
"i love you"
just to get someone
to hook up with me.

532
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,513
ha!

533
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,515
Oh, my god.
That was such a setup.

534
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,477
And you all failed,
except for Spencer.

535
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,480
Hey, when my bro
says it, he means it.

536
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,106
Heh heh!
You're lucky, layla.

537
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,734
Uh, all right,
all right. Never have I ever

538
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,694
walked in on
my parents doing it.

539
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,696
No. Don't sip,
jordan.

540
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,657
Asher!
No. No!

541
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,244
R.v. Trip, '08.
I don't want to talk
about it. I don't.

542
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,872
Ho ho! You gonna talk
about it. Ha ha ha!

543
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,416
Not the one up to sonoma?
How could you not
tell me that part?

544
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,418
I was scarred for life.

545
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,672
Never have I ever

546
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,299
bought a pair
of $300 shoes

547
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,301
in vegas.

548
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,471
No cheating.
Drink up, liv.

549
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,139
Who got next?
you?

550
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,058
Uh, I'll--i'll go.
Yes, yes.

551
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,518
I'll go. All right.

552
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,729
Never have I ever run...

553
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,358
Naked through
a football field.

554
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,695
Jordan! Naked?

555
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,363
Naked, naked, naked.
Really?

556
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,281
ok?

557
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,742
What was it?
What, freshman year?

558
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,244
Yeah, yeah.
The varsity players
stole our clothes

559
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,204
when we were
in the shower,
thanks to ash

560
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,581
acting like he owned
the place during tryouts.

561
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,166
Oh, confidence,
thank you very much.

562
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,918
Confidence! Ok.

563
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,378
Whatever you want
to call it,

564
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,380
your dumb ass stays
getting us in trouble.

565
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,966
wow.

566
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,593
Never have I ever crapped
all over folks

567
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,304
that were supposed
to be my friends.

568
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,848
Vanessa, it's--
yo,

569
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,975
It's just jokes.
Right?

570
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,852
Never have I ever
spent the summer getting

571
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,230
to know somebody else's
boyfriend a little too much.

572
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,399
liv!

573
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,025
Dude, what the hell?
Yo, ash.

574
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,987
Just relax.
Let's just play the game.

575
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,197
You want to play?
Fine. Never have I ever

576
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,491
cheated a concussion
protocol to play
in a game.

577
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,368
What is he
talking about?

578
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,954
Jordan.

579
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,540
You cheated your
concussion protocol?

580
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,417
How could you
not tell me
something like that?

581
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,252
What, like you didn't
tell me about princeton?

582
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,880
wow.
That is not the same!

583
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,508
It is exactly the same,
simone! Could you wait?
Hey, give me a second!

584
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,137
Simone! Listen to me!
Simone! Sweetheart! Come on!

585
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,682
Why are you risking your life
just for a game, jordan?!

586
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,142
Are you kidding me?

587
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,436
You know what football
means to me.

588
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,271
And what about me?
What do I mean to you?

589
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,232
'cause stuff like this,
it affects the both of us!

590
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,486
I actually care
whether you live or die,

591
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,071
jordan, and you didn't even
care enough to tell me.

592
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,449
Hey, simone--
What, do you
not trust me?

593
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,410
Is this really even
about me?

594
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,705
Or do these college
applications have you
so freaked out

595
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,166
about your future that
I have just become
the punching bag?

596
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
You know what?
Just forget it, ok?

597
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,089
This trip is
making me realize
that maybe we don't

598
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,675
know each other
as well as I thought.

599
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,553
Maybe Spencer
and Olivia were right
about this summer.

600
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,473
You don't mean that.
Maybe we rushed this,

601
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,975
we rushed us.
Simone.

602
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,186
Simone!

603
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,570
So I thought liv had
never been to vegas--

604
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,281
Simone's never
have I ever?

605
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,700
Maybe they took
a girls' trip or something.
Seriously?

606
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,412
Simone was 9 months' pregnant.
How many girls' trips you
think she took this summer?

607
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,415
What, you think liv lied
about not going to vegas
for Coop's show?

608
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,917
You were there.
You'd have seen her.

609
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,795
Same way you saw her
when she flew to mexico?

610
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,257
All right,
party people, huh?

611
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,551
We--we switching up the game?
Think game night's
over, jj.

612
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,345
What?
What are you talking about?
Liv never came to mexico.

613
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,348
She did. She flew
to mexico to surprise
her boyfriend,

614
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,811
only when she got there,
she ended up getting
surprised.

615
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,274
Uh, ok. Uh,
why don't we all just--

616
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,109
Where is she?

617
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:09,158
You and...ash?

618
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,128
Well, so much for finding
you here, sad and alone.

619
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,677
Are you sure
it said, "insert

620
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,012
"two screwdrivers..."

621
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,179
"spin, and then
reconnect?"

622
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,181
billy, I really think

623
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,101
we should just call
the guy to fix this.

624
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,728
Oh, no. We got this,
we got this.

625
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,354
We've been
doing it for hours.

626
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,189
We definitely
don't got this.

627
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,609
Would you just have
some faith, woman?

628
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,571
Hexa wrench and two
screwdrivers, please.

629
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,698
Thank you.

630
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,869
mmm?

631
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,996
The disposal is
reconnected.

632
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,247
Power on?

633
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,874
Hey!
Hey!

634
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,876
Disposal liftoff!

635
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,878
What I'm talkin' about.

636
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,505
Give me some.

637
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,467
All right, uh...this
calls for a toast.

638
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,718
Mm-hmm.

639
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,181
Old habits die hard.
Mm-hmm.

640
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,808
We toasted fixing
the a/c

641
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,936
with vodka, too.

642
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,563
Yup, only now,
we're toasting

643
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,233
with better-quality vodka...
ha!

644
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,947
Under--ahem--slightly
different circumstances.

645
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,198
Cheers.

646
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,991
All right. Good job.

647
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,497
ooh.

648
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,875
Well, I'm sorry I
interrupted your evening.

649
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,671
I hope your date doesn't
get upset that you're
a little bit late.

650
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,675
You know, I knew you'd
eventually start dating
at some point.

651
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,177
I just want you
to be happy.

652
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
Uh, and you should go
with the green dress.

653
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,808
You always look
good in green.

654
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,143
That's incredibly
adult of you...

655
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,437
Even sweet,

656
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,107
but I'm--i'm not
going on a date.

657
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,150
oh.
I had plans

658
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,153
with girlfriends,
but I canceled them

659
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,448
to help deal
with disposalgate.

660
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,951
Ah. Heh heh!
And, uh,

661
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,578
fyi...

662
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,373
We both deserve
to be happy.

663
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,375
Yeah.

664
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,003
And for the record,

665
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,923
I am not...
Dating anyone.

666
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,510
You're--oh. I mean,
no, I didn't...

667
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,138
I mean, I'm not
dating, either.

668
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,890
Oh. No? Ah.
no.

669
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,646
hmm.

670
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,735
Coop, it's not
what it looked like.

671
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,486
Look, I didn't invite
nobody, ok? They just--
No, no.

672
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,113
You did all
the talking last time.

673
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,406
This time,
you gonna listen!

674
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,074
How you just gonna
switch up on me?

675
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,826
That night at the hospital,
you told me

676
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,412
the shooting
was not my fault!
Now, all of a sudden,

677
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,540
you and this beverly hills
therapist decided it's
easier to blame me?

678
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,627
Come on! I guess you forgot
to mention all the times
you butted into my life!

679
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,880
When I decided
to help shawn,
you got involved!

680
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,257
When I joined the gang,
you got involved!

681
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,509
And I told you not
to confront tyrone,

682
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,553
but no!
You didn't listen!

683
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:19,140
How the hell
you gonna fault me
for being loyal and--

684
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,224
Faithful?

685
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,726
You lied to me!

686
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,019
I was completely
honest with you

687
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,437
about meeting vanessa
this summer!

688
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,813
Yeah, weeks after
she got here.

689
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,981
You knew
the whole time

690
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,107
and didn't say
anything. Why?

691
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,068
Why not
confront me, liv?

692
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,653
Unless you had crap
to feel guilty about, too!

693
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,655
You think I don't
see how close you
and Spencer are

694
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,407
after spending
the whole summer together?

695
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,992
Why--why can't we all
just leave summer

696
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,619
in the past?!
Because this summer

697
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,496
meant something
to me, liv!

698
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,539
I've realized so much
about myself!

699
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,541
You mean vanessa
helped you realize.
no.

700
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,543
No, I did the work!

701
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,171
I'm capable
of doing things
for myself, liv!

702
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,840
I'm not some mess-up
that needs someone to fix
my problems all the time!

703
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,802
Is that how I
make you feel?

704
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,389
I torpedoed my junior
year and got kicked
out of my house.

705
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,392
You got me to stop
drinking and found me
a place to live.

706
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,229
I almost missed my combine,
you made sure I had a spot.

707
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,856
I take steroids, you call
your dad in to the rescue.

708
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,442
My dad's alcoholism?
Liv to the rescue.

709
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,319
Why is any of that
a bad thing?

710
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,988
Because I didn't
need you to save me!

711
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,033
What I needed was
for you to believe
that I could save myself!

712
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,202
But of course,
you had to show up

713
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,621
every time with
that "s" on your chest!

714
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,165
And your need
to play superhero?

715
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,167
It's what got you shot,

716
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,419
not me.

717
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,047
I guess I don't
know how to stand by

718
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
and watch someone
I love in pain
and not try to help.

719
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:39,011
I know, and it's one
of the reasons
that I love you,

720
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,973
but I'm realizing
that may not be
the right thing for me.

721
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,059
I let myself lean on you
because it was easier

722
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,687
than having to find
a way out of my own mess,

723
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:51,232
and I'm so grateful
that you were here for me.

724
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,613
But ever since school
started, we haven't been
able to reconnect.

725
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,660
It's been different
because we're different.

726
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,914
I don't think either of us
ever really came back
from this summer.

727
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,711
Tell me I'm wrong.

728
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,923
So what does this
mean for us?

729
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,054
I guess it just
means that we're
better off as friends.

730
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,352
Friends, yeah.

731
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,815
Hopefully, one day
we'll get back there.

732
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,151
You know,
when you left

733
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,153
for beverly, I told you

734
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,780
to forget about me
and go be great.

735
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,620
Now I...i wish you
would have listened.

736
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:50,041
I mean, we--we both wouldn't
be feeling this pain
in our chest right now.

737
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,551
Take care
of yourself, spence.

738
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,187
You, too.

739
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,833
Sorry about
you and Coop.

740
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,836
It didn't end
the way I wanted...

741
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,048
But we said everything
we needed to say,

742
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,051
and there's peace
in that.

743
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,930
Yeah, well, I guess
everybody knows where
they stand now.

744
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,557
I'll be in the car.

745
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,861
"happy birthday, son.

746
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,156
"you're almost an adult.
Can't even believe it.

747
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,367
"I've missed so much.

748
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,370
"i'm writing this
from my family's cabin.

749
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,372
"this seems to be
the one place where I

750
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,000
"can always find my peace.

751
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,211
"i'd hoped to bring you
and Dillon here one day.

752
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,215
Maybe I still can,
'cause I'm comin' home."

753
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,386
"I've forgiven
your mother.

754
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,388
"I've forgiven myself.

755
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,390
"now the only question is,

756
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,226
will you and Dillon
be able to forgive me?"

757
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,228
i'm sorry.

758
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,856
The real reason

759
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,275
I didn't tell you
about playing with
a concussion was

760
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,571
'cause I knew it was
wrong, and I didn't
want to disappoint you.

761
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,742
Jordan, we're gonna
disappoint each other
sometimes.

762
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,744
That's not
a deal-breaker for me

763
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,163
as long as we work
through it together,

764
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,749
but that can only happen
if there's trust.

765
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,917
I do trust you.
Do you?

766
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,462
I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't.

767
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,590
I mean, there's still so much
you don't even know about me.

768
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,223
I know you in the ways
that matter,

769
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,809
all right?

770
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,936
You're beautiful
on the inside and out,

771
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,939
and you're brave. Heh!

772
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,942
You're, like,
next-level brave, babe.

773
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,780
I watched you
give up baby shay
'cause you knew it was

774
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,657
the right thing
for him, and you did
not let it break you.

775
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,202
You're selfless,
you're loyal,

776
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,413
you're ambitious,
you're all the things
a man wants in a woman.

777
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,582
Respect matters to you,

778
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,336
and when you love,
simone...

779
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,215
You do it
with all your heart.

780
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,470
And all the other
details, they'll...

781
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,680
They'll come, all right?

782
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,725
They'll fall into place
as we grow together.

783
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,857
I love you, too.

784
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,073
You know, I'm starting
to think that maybe I should

785
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,077
write my college essay
about the loves of my life.

786
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,080
You and baby shay,
y'all changed
the game for me.

787
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:29,343
"i know earning
your trust again won't be easy,

788
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,179
"but I have to try,

789
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,390
"and earning your love
again is a privilege

790
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,017
"i probably don't deserve,

791
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,229
"even if things don't turn out
the way I want,

792
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:45,234
"even if putting my truth out
there means unimaginable pain.

793
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,195
"renee taught me that.

794
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,823
"we're no longer together.

795
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,577
"i stayed in that relationship
far longer than I should have.

796
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,204
"i put her happiness
before my own

797
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,040
"because facing the truth
that I cared for her,

798
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,960
"but not the way she
really deserved, meant

799
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,796
"causing her pain,
but by trying

800
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,799
"to spare her pain,
I only hurt her

801
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,218
"and myself more.

802
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,429
"if I'd faced the truth,

803
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,765
"maybe I would have
made it home to you sooner.

804
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,895
"my final birthday wish
for you, son--

805
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,314
"do better than me.

806
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,524
"always face the truth,

807
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,152
"no matter how hard.

808
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,905
I'll see you soon."

809
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,033
Hey, uh--

810
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,243
Spencer, I'm only
gonna ask you this
one time,

811
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,079
and please
respect me enough
not to lie about it.

812
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,128
What really happened
in vegas this summer?

813
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,287
Greg, move your head!

813
00:42:21,305 --> 00:43:21,710

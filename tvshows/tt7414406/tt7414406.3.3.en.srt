1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,511
Here we go. On the ball,
on the ball, on the ball!

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,346
Down, set!

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,681
Mike 10.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,474
One. Set, hut.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,814
Too slow, Baker.
Do it again.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,987
Aah! Set, hut.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,614
Again!

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,748
We're gonna keep doing this
till you get it right.

9
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,833
You need to get rid
of the ball faster.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,752
You're not
letting me!

11
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
What do you want me
to do, not read
the defense?

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,504
I want you to react
to the defense.

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,839
What's the difference,
coach?

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,090
One takes longer.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,675
Stop thinking
and just react.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,177
Do it again.

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,930
On the ball.
Let's go.

18
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,600
Adams, where was
the linebacker positioned

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,018
on that last play?

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,729
JJ?

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,355
Uh...

22
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,983
He was playing deep.

23
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,985
He was shallow.

24
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,154
I need you to pay
attention to those details.

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,906
You can learn a lot
on the sidelines.

26
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,369
Uh, sure, baby.
What's up?

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,879
yo.
I saw that, bro.

28
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,964
Saw what?

29
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,052
Uh, the new girl
was throwing some
major vibes over here.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,346
-nO, she wasn't.
-tRust me.

31
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,140
I know when a girl's
checking me out. Heh.

32
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,184
What? You think
she's into you?

33
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,436
Oh. It's on.
I'm gonna ask her out.

34
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,021
She's the coach's daughter.

35
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,023
So? You dated
the coach's daughter
last year.

36
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,650
Same thing.

37
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,026
Hey. The heart wants
what it wants, right?

38
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,861
She's not even
into football, dude.

39
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,867
You're too shallow.

40
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,578
What?

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
You're playing
too shallow.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,207
ok.

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,349
Green 19! Green 19!

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,685
Set, hut!

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,110
Whoo! Let's go!

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,701
Yo, chris.
You planning on

49
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,327
throwing in my direction
ever again?

50
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,454
-yO. Just get open.
-wEll, I've been open.

51
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,124
Look. I know I wasn't
your first choice
at quarterback,

52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,917
but I got the job,
and I'm not

53
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,502
just out here to
throw you the ball
all day.

54
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,713
Sometimes, the best play
isn't to spencer james.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,137
So these are your old
stomping grounds, huh?

56
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,599
I put some numbers up
on this field.

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,684
I got to tell you
it was, uh--it was
a lot easier

58
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,437
when the ball was
in my hands.

59
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,314
What, you feeling
the heat already?

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,317
Ask me that again
tomorrow night.

61
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,735
We got off
to a rough start,

62
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,030
but we're starting to
come together.

63
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,781
I'd feel better if we--
If we had a kicker.

64
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,284
All right, y'all.
Bring it in!

65
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,494
I have a treat
for you today.

66
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,871
Y'all know who
this cat is--

67
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,122
Manny tramack.

68
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
He was my qb in the nfl,

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,917
also a very good friend.

70
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,585
13 years in the league.

71
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,378
He's got a super bowl ring.

72
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,505
Of course, he waited
for me to retire to get that,

73
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,132
but, uh, I'm not bitter.

74
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,800
Anyway, he's gonna be
hanging out with us

75
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,469
and working
with the quarterbacks,

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,930
so treat him
with respect. Manny.

77
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,723
Yeah. Well,
I was only the backup

78
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,183
on that super bowl
team.

79
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,018
-sTill got my ring.
-I Heard that

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,937
heh heh.
Seriously, guys,

81
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,023
coach is excited
about this team,

82
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,900
about this season,
and I know

83
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,568
he's putting
the hard work
in for you,

84
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,195
so you got to put it
in for him

85
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,405
and for each other.

86
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,117
All that hard work,
all that sacrifice,

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,370
it means nothing
without trust,

88
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,040
trust in your coaches,
trust in your teammates.

89
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,211
You lack that trust,
you can't win.

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,637
push it.
Let's go. Come on.

92
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,889
Come on, come on.
Get it. Light weight.

93
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,933
You got it, you got it.
It's a light weight.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

94
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,685
That's all you got, boy?
Come on now.

95
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,311
Chris did 25 reps
this morning.

96
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,189
You stuck on 18?
Come on. Fight it.

97
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,776
There you go.

98
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,028
Darnell,
my office, please.

99
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,787
What's up, coach?

100
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,622
You tell me.

101
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,000
You, uh, obviously
have something

102
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,626
you need to get
off your chest,

103
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,420
so now's your chance.

104
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,796
No. I'm--i'm good.

105
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,257
Oh, now you're good?

106
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,342
Because, uh, it seems
to me like

107
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,512
you don't want
to be here.

108
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:09,225
Do you want to be
here, darnell--ahem.

109
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,645
Look. If this is
about the starting qb--

110
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,690
It was your decision.
I get it. It's your team,

111
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,400
or is it spencer's team?

112
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,111
I haven't really figured
that out yet.

113
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,074
Look. I'm--i'm sorry,
coach.

114
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,743
I'm gonna let
that one slide

115
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,829
because, uh, ooh--
Because I get it.

116
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,499
Ahem. You're frustrated.
Look, darnell.

117
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,501
I just need you
to hang in there,
all right?

118
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,086
You are very important
to this team.

119
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,379
You just got to
wait your turn.

120
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,007
Wait my turn?
I'm a senior, coach.

121
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,842
What do I tell ucla?

122
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,594
They're coming to the game
tomorrow night.

123
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,970
What if they pull
my scholarship offer

124
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,805
when they see me
sitting the bench?

125
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,223
They won't because
I told them not
to come.

126
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,725
-You what?!
-Relax.

127
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,560
I didn't make this
about you.

128
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,063
Yeah? Am I excused?

129
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,856
I'm just looking out
for your best interests.

130
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,775
No. No.

131
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,737
Corey always looked out
for my best interests,

132
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,741
and this ain't something
he ever would have done.

133
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,255
Hey. We still on
for tonight?

134
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,216
Oh. That was t-tonight?

135
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,675
Heh. I guess not.

136
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,803
I'm so sorry.
It's just...

137
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,223
Jordan and I planned
this little
date night thing.

138
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,892
Ooh. No.
It's no problem.
How's he doing?

139
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,520
He's not really
clicking with
the new coach,

140
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,271
so it's a lot
of pressure.

141
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,315
I know what you mean.
Spencer is definitely

142
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,150
feeling the pressure
at crenshaw.

143
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,860
You know, at least last year,
he and jordan

144
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,570
had each other
to talk to.

145
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,115
Yeah. I mean, he's
never gonna admit it,

146
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,492
but he misses spencer
being around the house.

147
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,037
Wait, wait. Ok.
I have a bad idea.

148
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,039
Ok. Sounds promising.

149
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,126
What if your date
with jordan became

150
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,212
a double date
with spencer and me?

151
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,880
Jordan would never
do that.

152
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,715
Right. That's where
the bad idea comes in.

153
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,259
We don't tell them.

154
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,095
Ooh. That is
a bad idea

155
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,847
but maybe one
that could work.

156
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,641
I mean, what do we
really have to lose?

157
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
Our boyfriends.

158
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,978
Very true.

159
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,230
-lEt's do it anyway.
-yEah! Ok.

160
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,650
-oPeration bad idea...
-iN motion.

161
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,068
Hey, guys.

162
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,486
Vanessa, hey.

163
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,029
Layla, you busy tonight?

164
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,698
I thought as my
first official friend

165
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,533
we can hang out
or something.

166
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,912
Right. Um...i just--
I have so much schoolwork

167
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,414
to do right now.

168
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,625
Oh. Ok. Sure.

169
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,752
I guess I'll see
you around then.

170
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,384
Why did you blow
the new girl off
like that?

171
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,052
I really like her.
I just feel like

172
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,637
I can't be her friend
right now.

173
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,890
-Why not?
-It's a long story.

174
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,202
-Hey. Yo, dre.
-What's up, coop?

175
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,705
Yo. What was mo
talking to you about?

176
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,207
Yo. If she didn't
ask you to be here,

177
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,875
you best stay out of it.

178
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

179
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,722
Spencer james don't
wait in line.

180
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,432
Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

181
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,850
Oh, hell, no.
Get up here.

182
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,393
Hey. Get out of the way.

183
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,062
Move. Move, please.

184
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,980
None of you bringing us
that state title this year,

185
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,315
but he is.

186
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,067
-My man.
-Thanks, man.

187
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,027
Can I just get
some chips, please?

188
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,363
You don't want
the spencer james?

189
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,740
-The what?
-Yeah.

190
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,243
-nAmed a sandwich after you.
-oH, my god.

191
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,745
It's the least we can do,
you coming back to
save our high school.

192
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,497
I think I'm good
with the chips.

193
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,791
Man, this one's
on the house, man.
Go sit. I got you.

194
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:05,461
-oK. Thank you.
-yOu got it!

195
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
Yo. Did you really
just order

196
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,548
a sandwich named
after you?

197
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,550
I didn't mean to,
all right?

198
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,218
Can I sit down?

199
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,891
When we gonna get
past this, man?

200
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,268
Yo. I thought you
had my back, bro.

201
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,686
Darnell, I didn't pick
chris over you.

202
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,062
You know how I
convinced my mom

203
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,939
to let me stay
in crenshaw?

204
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,232
Because I thought
it was best
for my future.

205
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,900
It's a long season, man.

206
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,402
Look. All you got to do--

207
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,195
Is wait my turn.

208
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,532
Damn, man.
You and coach got
the same old speech.

209
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,369
Look. Yo. I thought
we had a plan, bro.

210
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,913
You and me. We said
when you got back here
we was gonna--

211
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
Hey, yo. Hey.
Coach wants us to run
through the game plan

212
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,042
for the offense.

213
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,794
Starting offense.

214
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,301
Better run along, bro.
Your qb needs you.

215
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,052
Here we go.

216
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,348
One spencer james special
to the man himself.

217
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,809
-Thank you.
-Aw, man. Thank you.

218
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,248
-Yo!
-Yo.

219
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,752
What's the plan
for inglewood
tomorrow night?

220
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,295
Say what?

221
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,713
That's who you got
right?

222
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,465
Uh, yeah, yeah.
This ain't them, though.

223
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,759
I was just checking out
who beverly's playing tomorrow.

224
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,386
Shouldn't you be
focusing on your
own game?

225
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,513
Oh. We're ready
for inglewood. Yeah.

226
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:45,311
I was, uh--
I was only--heh.

227
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,522
I don't know.
It's, uh--it's not
like it's a switch

228
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,232
I can just turn
off, you know?

229
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,443
I get it.
Those were your guys.

230
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,738
Plus jordan's gonna
be there without me,
and...

231
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,200
My dad never missed
a game when I went here,

232
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,744
not one,
and after tomorrow,

233
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,121
i'm not gonna be able
to say the same
about my boy, so...

234
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,748
Hey. Jordan's gonna
be fine.

235
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,416
He's come a long way
as a quarterback.

236
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:12,004
Yeah, he has. He has,
and this is his year.

237
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,424
I, uh--I just wish
I could be there
to see it, you know?

238
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,551
My dad missed
most of my games.

239
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,762
It wasn't his fault.
He worked hard.

240
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,972
If it makes you feel better,
my best games

241
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,641
were the ones he missed

242
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,226
maybe because
I was less nervous

243
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
or maybe, uh--maybe
I played harder

244
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,523
so he'd regret
not being there.

245
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,650
That doesn't make
me feel better.

246
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,485
Sorry. Bad anecdote.

247
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,404
My point is that jordan's
gonna have a great year

248
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,197
whether you're there
or not.

249
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,699
I'd focus on inglewood.

250
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,201
Got a good defense,
a speedy little back.

251
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,537
He's gonna be a problem.

252
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,789
I got you.

253
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,874
Thanks, man.

254
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,793
Man, why you
putting so much
pressure on yourself?

255
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,878
Because there's a lot
riding on this season.

256
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,798
-iT's all on me.
-iT's not all on you.

257
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,467
Just be spencer james,
and you'll be good.

258
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,511
Yeah? What if I ain't
the old spencer james?

259
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,471
Now that you mentioned it,
the old spencer

260
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,223
would have never wore
that jacket.

261
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,850
I'm serious, coop.
I still don't know

262
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,560
if I'm physically
100% yet.

263
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,395
Bro, every doctor
in the country said

264
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,566
that you were
fully healed. Trust that.

265
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,527
Wait. What's wrong
with my jacket?

266
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,945
Nothing.

267
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,407
Well, I ain't
wearing it.

268
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,075
Heh heh.

269
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,744
What's up with you?

270
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,080
Not much, man.
Just...keeping my eyes open.

271
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,249
What's that mean?

272
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,376
Well, I think something big
about to go down.

273
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,253
I seen mo talking
to a rival gang,

274
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,963
and she was fired up.

275
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,381
I don't know.
Maybe she's just
trying to--

276
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,300
Don't say it, ok?

277
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,427
If one more person
say that she

278
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,845
just trying to clean up
the neighborhood,

279
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,263
i'm gonna lose
my damn mind.

280
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,931
Ok. It don't matter
anyway.

281
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,808
You out of that life
now, right?

282
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,769
There's no reason
to get involved.

283
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,146
I got to roll.
I'm meeting layla.

284
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:57,943
And you think that
that jacket is better
than the last one?

285
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,696
Beverly hills got you
all messed up.

286
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,450
You're gonna
love this movie.

287
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,536
Just be prepared.
It's a little sad.

288
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,622
Think the main character
dies at the end.

289
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,625
-yOu've seen it?
-nO. Simone told me.

290
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,919
Why are we watching it
if she already ruined
the ending?

291
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,670
She said it was good.

292
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:21,383
You know, we could always
just skip the movie and talk.

293
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,594
I really want to
watch the movie.

294
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,554
I really want to talk.

295
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,972
About what?

296
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,307
About summer.

297
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
Jordan, why are you
so dressed up?

298
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,855
I have a date
with simone.

299
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,899
-cAn we come?
-wHat?

300
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,901
We could make it, like,
a double date thing.

301
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,444
I thought you really
wanted to see this movie.

302
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,989
I mean, we already
know how it ends.

303
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,866
Come on. It'll be fun.

304
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,994
Uh, yeah. Whatever.
Let's go.

305
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,496
Let's go.

306
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,964
Hi! Look who it is!

307
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,300
Hi, guys. I got
us a 4-top.

308
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,511
Great.

309
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,221
-lAyla, what's going on?
-dOn't be mad.

310
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,931
Jordan's running late
as usual.

311
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,599
This some kind
of setup?

312
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,768
Uh, we prefer to call
it a...

313
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,979
Bad idea
with good intentions.

314
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,231
-yEs.
-yOu know, just the 4 of us

315
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,816
hanging out.

316
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,442
And jordan's cool
with this?

317
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,194
We're about to
find out. Heh.

318
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,113
heh.

319
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,656
Uh, hi, guys.

320
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,702
I didn't--I didn't realize
this was, like,

321
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,078
a double date.

322
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,163
-jOrdan invited us.
-sOrt of.

323
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,790
Where...is he?

324
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:39,670
Oh. Um, he had to go
to, um...

325
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,755
Where did he say he
was...going?

326
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,132
Home.

327
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,592
Because he knew
i'd be here?

328
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,845
No, no. I mean,
you know, he's--

329
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,763
Yeah, man. He saw
you walk in

330
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,973
when we were
at the valet.

331
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,391
Why would you
say that?

332
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,767
Well, I'm not
gonna lie to him.

333
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,728
So, you know, it's just
the 5 of us.

334
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,149
Oh, what's up,
what's up, my peeps?

335
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,650
Oh, come on.

336
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,152
This was a really
bad idea.

337
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,904
yep.

338
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,739
Well, I'm sure most
of you already know

339
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,741
my lovely date vanessa.

340
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,701
We're gonna need
a bigger table.

341
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,462
ah!
Wow, wow.

342
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,506
Guys, this is love
at first sight.

343
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,674
Really?

344
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,967
No, it's not.

345
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,344
The moment I asked v out,

346
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,678
I knew she as the one.

347
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,347
-wAit. V?
-I Know it's corny,

348
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,891
but we already have
nicknames.

349
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,809
I call her v.

350
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,978
What does she call you?

351
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,689
Well, she doesn't have
a nickname for me yet.

352
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,525
-JJ.
-tHis is not gonna end well.

353
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,320
Why do you care?

354
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,571
Look. I hope
it works out, man.

355
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,906
Thanks, spence.

356
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,909
oh!
Game:

357
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,285
next.

358
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,828
It's all right, man.

359
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,999
You didn't tell me
you were one

360
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,001
of those competitive
bar sports guys.

361
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,337
I'm not
a bar sports guy.

362
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm just better than JJ,

363
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,424
which isn't saying much.

364
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,343
I thought he was
your friend.

365
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,970
You've been
passive aggressive
to him all night,

366
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,763
and why did you
tell him I don't
like football?

367
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,223
You don't like football.

368
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,142
Ok. So why stop there?
Seriously.

369
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,603
Why didn't you run down
the whole list for him--

370
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,066
Avocados, rom coms,
whistling, being lied to?

371
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,902
Oh. That's right.
Nobody's supposed to know

372
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,071
that we know each other.

373
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,615
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to--

374
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,410
Look, asher.
I'm new here,

375
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,704
and I'm just trying
to make some friends.

376
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,664
I don't need
you sabotaging
my relationships

377
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,290
before they
even start.

378
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,292
Trust me. You don't want
a relationship with JJ.

379
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,794
Maybe I do.

380
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,426
Wonder what they're
talking about.

381
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,469
I'm not.

382
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,263
Ok. A little advice.

383
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,348
If you want to keep
them from knowing

384
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,768
that we know that they
think we don't know

385
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,437
about their
summer secret,

386
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,647
then I'd stop looking
over there so much.

387
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,483
It sounds like
you're enjoying this
a little too much.

388
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,862
No, but, you know,
I wouldn't mind
making asher pay

389
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,196
for messing up
a good thing

390
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,032
and breaking
your heart.

391
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,950
Seriously, liv,
why in the hell

392
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,535
haven't you told
him that you know
about summer?

393
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,954
It's gonna blow up
in everyone's faces.

394
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,539
I have my reasons.

395
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,376
hi.

396
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,965
So you know how I'm really
good at reading a room?

397
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,216
Uh-oh.

398
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,885
Olivia's clearly
avoiding asher,

399
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,096
who seems more concerned
with JJ dating the new girl.

400
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,848
-hOw am I doing so far?
-sCary good.

401
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,768
Mm-hmm. Tell me
what's going on.

402
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,728
Ok, but you have to
promise not to
tell anyone.

403
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,813
It's, like, the biggest
summer secret ever.

404
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,191
Ok. Olivia went to see
asher in mexico

405
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
while we were
in vegas,

406
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,447
and when she got there,
he was on the beach
with another girl,

407
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,909
and--wait for it--
That other girl is

408
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,619
JJ's date.

409
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,248
wow.

410
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,886
-wHat's good, coop?
-yO. I need you to tell me

411
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,554
what's going on.
With mo.

412
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,056
-I Know something's up.
-yO. I already told you.

413
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,641
To stay out of it.
I know,

414
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,768
but you owe me, dre.

415
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,061
-I Do?
-yEah.

416
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,772
For what?

417
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,441
Those, uh,
lakers-rockets tickets.

418
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,193
Man, jb hooked me up
with them.

419
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,195
But he got them
from my connect.

420
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,115
Look, man. Just--
Just tell me what's
going down.

421
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,578
All right. Fine.
It's about to be
big news anyway.

422
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,332
Police just arrested
the dude that shot
spencer james.

423
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,708
Mo got someone
to snitch?

424
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,628
That's all I can say.

425
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,839
Tell your boy the neighborhood
looking out for him.

426
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,304
You want some?

427
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,889
No, thanks.

428
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,852
I once ate 92 wings
in one sitting. Ha!

429
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,145
why?

430
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,396
Had to break
the record.

431
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,565
-wHose record?
-mIne.

432
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,567
hmm.

433
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,944
Going for another
record tonight?

434
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,112
Maybe.

435
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,738
Please don't.

436
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,365
You're probably
wondering why I'm not

437
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,783
home studying
like I said.

438
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,035
-nO. It's cool.
-iT's not cool.

439
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,079
It's complicated,

440
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,456
but maybe we can
hang out this weekend
if you want.

441
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,708
I'd like that.

442
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,293
And we could
double date, yo.

443
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,420
Oh. Or just me
and her.

444
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,218
Ok. Ok.
Heh heh. Heh heh.

445
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,806
Ok. Trip 20.

446
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,143
-tHat was a nice shot.
-tHanks.

447
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,729
So...how is he?

448
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,190
He's ok.

449
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,277
He's pretty stressed
about his first game
tomorrow night.

450
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,488
Look. I'm really sorry
that he didn't show up.

451
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,365
Jordan don't want
to see me, it's not
your fault.

452
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,743
Spencer, he does want
to see you.

453
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,579
I can tell.
He just needs more time.

454
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,665
Yeah. Feels weird
we both got games
tomorrow

455
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,335
but they ain't together.

456
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,296
You mind wishing him
good luck for
tomorrow night?

457
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,548
Of course.

458
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,634
I need some more
blue cheese.

459
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,344
I'll be back.

460
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,766
How's it going
with JJ?

461
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,060
Fine. He's really nice

462
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,895
and likes wings apparently.

463
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,188
New information.

464
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,023
I-is it
a love connection?

465
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,483
He's not really my type.

466
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
Hey, coop.
Uh, everyone's out.

467
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,119
I know.
I came to see you.

468
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,581
Oh. Right. I think
I know what this
is about.

469
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,749
Come in.

470
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,752
Somebody snitched,
right?

471
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,212
- No.
- What?

472
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,089
Coop, I really
can't.

473
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,174
I mean, how do you just
catch a dude after
all this time?

474
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
He turned himself in.

475
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,302
That doesn't make
any sense.

476
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,012
I agree.

477
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,806
We don't know
why he did
what he did.

478
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,933
There were
no witnesses,

479
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,017
there was no
hard evidence,

480
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,019
the case had gone cold,

481
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,981
but sometimes,
people feel guilty
about their crimes,

482
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,774
and they need to
confess,

483
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,777
and legally, that's
all I can tell you.

484
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,201
Darnell, right?

485
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,787
-Oh. Hey, Mr. Tramack.
-mAnny. Mind if I sit?

486
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,914
Sure. Is that the, um--

487
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,375
Spencer james special.

488
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,752
Glad to see you're
focusing on your
schoolwork.

489
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,212
It's all I got now.

490
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,964
That's not true.
From what I hear,

491
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,300
you have a bright
future tossing
the football around.

492
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,843
I don't know about that.

493
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,096
Darnell, I was
an nfl qb for 13 years.

494
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,849
You know how many
of those I was a backup?

495
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,727
-fIrst 7.
-yEah, but I'm sure

496
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,353
you started your
senior year of high school.

497
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,689
Actually, no. No.
I was injured.

498
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,691
Then how'd you make it
to the nfl?

499
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,276
I stopped looking
so far into the future,

500
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,903
started focusing
on each day,
one at a time.

501
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,865
You see, in my mind,
I was always
a starting qb.

502
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,409
When my time came,
I was ready.

503
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,079
When your time comes,
you gonna be ready?

504
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,748
Yes, sir.

505
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,963
How's the sandwich?

506
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
Hmm. Could use
some mayo.

507
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,888
Can I get next?

508
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,639
Sure.

509
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,190
So asher
and the new girl.

510
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
I need a do-over.

511
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,074
Layla told you?

512
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,450
Why didn't you tell me
you went to see him

513
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,910
after leaving me
in vegas?

514
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,620
Kind of like how you
told me you and layla

515
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,623
got back together
that same trip

516
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,500
right after I left?

517
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,128
You're right.
I guess we was both--

518
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,091
Spencer, can we not
do this?

519
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,968
I just want summer
to be behind us, ok?

520
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,014
All the secrets,
all the mistakes.

521
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,432
So why don't you
tell ash you saw him

522
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,850
with the new girl
in mexico?

523
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,021
Because it'll just make
things worse.

524
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,689
I mean, sometimes,
talking things out

525
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,900
doesn't make them better.

526
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,860
I mean, look
at the two of us.

527
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,783
I just want you
to be happy.

528
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,660
And what about you?

529
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,787
Are you happy?

530
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,811
Thanks for driving me
all the way home.

531
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,438
You didn't have to
do all that.

532
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,650
-yOu ok?
-yEah.

533
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,486
Um, I'm just wondering
what you were thinking

534
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,197
staring out the window
the entire ride.

535
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,783
You pissed at me for
trying to force you
and jordan back together?

536
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,869
No. No. I'm not mad.

537
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,832
Ok. Um...is it olivia?

538
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,375
What do you mean?

539
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,794
Well, I'm pretty good
at reading a room, too,

540
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,546
and I saw you guys
playing pool,

541
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,381
you both seemed
pretty upset,

542
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,800
and look. I know you're
like family,

543
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,637
but have you noticed that
you confide in her

544
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,223
more than me?

545
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,933
And ever since you
got back from summer,

546
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,310
you've been
pretty secretive.

547
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,936
I just got a lot
on my mind.

548
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,565
Spencer, I'm right here.
Will you just talk to me?

549
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,651
Like, I know us getting
back together is still
kind of new,

550
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,155
but you can trust me
with whatever it is
you're hiding.

551
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,162
There's something
wrong with my arm.

552
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,500
W-wait. I--
The doctors said that--

553
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,586
They said it was healed.
I know,

554
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,088
but something ain't
right.

555
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,093
It just goes numb
without warning,

556
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,553
and if that happens
during a game,

557
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,639
everybody's gonna know
i'm damaged.

558
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,561
Everything's
on the line, layla--

559
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,188
My future,
the school's future.

560
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,149
I mean, what if
I can't deliver?

561
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,567
What if I can't do
what I--

562
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,194
Spencer, hey.

563
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:34,324
We're gonna figure
it out...together...ok?

564
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,499
-Dad?
-Hey. What's happening, man?

565
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,293
Big night.
How you feeling?

566
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,711
-nErvous.
-yEah. Ok.

567
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,046
Well, you know
that's normal,

568
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,923
first game jitters.

569
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,092
Look. I'm sorry--
I'm sorry I can't
be there.

570
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,345
It's cool. Uh,
don't worry about it.

571
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,056
Um, look, dad.
I got to get dressed, so--

572
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,933
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.
Just real quick.

573
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,644
I want you to, uh,
watch out for number 99.

574
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,521
He's got a quick
first step.

575
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,356
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Montes
is gonna double him, so...

576
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,276
Oh, ok. Cool.
Good call.

577
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,945
All right.
Well, uh, looks like
y'all don't need me.

578
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,322
Um, you two
getting along?

579
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,699
I don't know.
I don't know.

580
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,034
It's like anyone else
makes a mistake,

581
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,452
and she just corrects it.

582
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,496
I make a mistake,
and she explodes like

583
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,582
it's the end of the world.

584
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,667
Ok. Well, she's, uh--
She's just pushing you
to be great.

585
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
She's trying to see
if you're gonna
be a leader, right?

586
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,296
Well, it was so much
easier last year

587
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,006
when spence was
on the team.

588
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,674
Everyone was so focused
on him,

589
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,259
it took the pressure
off me.

590
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,636
This is your team now,
jordan, all right?

591
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,556
It's time for you to
step up and be the star.

592
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,309
Look, son. I may not
be there anymore,

593
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,685
but I'm with you.

594
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,145
I'm gonna always
be with you,

595
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,063
so--so I want you
to go out there

596
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,065
and be great,
you understand me?

597
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,611
Hey, dad.
Um, you and spence,

598
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,487
good luck tonight.

599
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,781
Heh. All right, man.

600
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,917
-yO, spence.
-cAn this wait, coop?

601
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,502
I wish it could.

602
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,129
I was gonna wait
and tell you
after the game,

603
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,464
but the word is
already getting around.

604
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,049
Tell me what?

605
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,176
They arrested the dude
that shot you.

606
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,304
He turned hisself in.

607
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,056
I think it's part
of mo's plan.

608
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,849
Are you serious
right now?

609
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,560
The dude is locked up.
He ain't on the streets
no more.

610
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,312
-tHat's all that matters.
-mAybe she threatened him

611
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,813
-coop, stop.
-oR his family.

612
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,190
Enough!

613
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,108
I don't need this
right now.

614
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,362
Look. I got enough problems
of my own, all right?

615
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,530
I ain't got time for your
conspiracy theories.

616
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,252
Must be hard seeing
everyone in uniform,

617
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,797
not being able
to play.

618
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,423
I made my own mess.

619
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,301
I'm man enough to own up
to my mistakes.

620
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,220
I'll see you
out there?

621
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,971
Olivia, wait.

622
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,142
About summer.

623
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,644
Asher, I really don't
want to talk about--

624
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,229
Look. I know vanessa.

625
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,147
I knew her before she
came to beverly.

626
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,359
I met her in mexico,
and we...

627
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,362
You what?

628
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,072
-wE connected.
-cOnnected?

629
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,033
What is that,
code for...

630
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,162
No. No, no, no.
We didn't do that.

631
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,373
I didn't cheat on you.

632
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,210
We just--we formed
a strong...

633
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,712
I don't know.
I don't know what to call it.

634
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,672
We just connected
in a lot of ways

635
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,382
that I needed
at the time.

636
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,385
Asher, it's--it's
totally cool.

637
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,011
Summer was weird.

638
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,680
I mean, we were barely
back together

639
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,306
and hadn't really
figured us out,

640
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,642
so...

641
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,521
Whatever happened
happened,

642
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,482
so let's just leave
summer in the past

643
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,651
and move on, ok?

644
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,280
-oK.
-oK.

645
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,964
We'll take
the ball.

646
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,063
It's my arm.
It won't move.

647
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,195
Help!

648
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,878
We're midway
through the second quarter,

649
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,296
and nobody expected this.

650
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,672
South crenshaw is down
21 points.

651
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,965
-sPence, your arm ok?
-yEah.

652
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,467
Actually,
it feels great.

653
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,344
-aLl right. Jet sweep.
-yEs, sir.

654
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,970
Let's see
if south crenshaw's offense

655
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,847
can get going on this drive.

656
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,725
Inglewood's defense has been
lights out all night long.

657
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,936
Down. Green 19.

658
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,396
Quarterback
chris jackson in shotgun.

659
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,441
Set, hut!

660
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,818
He dumps off
to spencer james,

661
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,778
who makes a man eat it.

662
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,071
Here he goes.

663
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,116
To the 30.

664
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,329
To the 20.

665
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,331
The 10.

666
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,460
Touchdown! Spencer james
finally giving the crowd

667
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,212
something to cheer about.

668
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,769
-cAn I help you?
-dO I need permission to sit?

669
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,396
Depends on what it's for.

670
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,022
I want to know if you
had something to do

671
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,482
with spencer's shooter
turning hisself in.

672
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,942
Yes, I did.

673
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,819
You didn't expect
an honest answer?

674
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,947
What, you'd threaten him,
his family?

675
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,032
Look, coop.
This is getting old.

676
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,784
I don't care
if you like me,

677
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,369
don't care if you trust me.

678
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,454
I have nothing
to prove to you,

679
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,041
never did,
but know this.

680
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,129
I will clean up
this neighborhood my way,

681
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,339
and I'm just
getting started.

682
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,598
Tell spence
the neighborhood's
looking out for him.

683
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,820
Quarterback
chris jackson

684
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,655
has struggled to move the ball
all night.

685
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,325
Coach, he's thinking
about that hit that
took him out.

686
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,993
It's in his head.

687
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,162
Why don't you go over there
and cheer on your team?

688
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,542
South crenshaw's driving

689
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,377
with a minute left
to go in the half.

690
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,422
Jackson shotgun.

691
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,882
Fakes the handoff.

692
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,383
Tosses to spencer james.

693
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,052
He has some daylight.

694
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,511
To the 20.

695
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,971
The 10.

696
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,556
He's tackled
at the 5-yard line.

697
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,475
South crenshaw is knocking
at the door

698
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,435
with 22 seconds left
in the half.

699
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,438
This would give them momentum
going into the second half.

700
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,523
Jackson takes the snap.

701
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,276
He has spencer james wide open.

702
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
He keeps it.

703
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,865
Oh, no! He fumbles the ball!

704
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,035
It's scooped up by inglewood.

705
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,037
Oh, my. They're gonna
take it all the way back

706
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,539
for a 21-point halftime lead.

707
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,127
We spotted them 3 touchdowns.

708
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,879
We spotted them
3 touchdowns.

709
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,798
Does anybody think
this game is over yet?

710
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,299
-nO, sir.
-nO, sir.

711
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,343
All right. Me neither.

712
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,220
We can turn this tide, y'all.

713
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,097
We just need to tighten up
on that defense.

714
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,349
No more points,
no more points.

715
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,267
I'm also gonna change up
the offense.

716
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,019
Darnell's the qb
for the second half.

717
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,187
Yo, coach. What?

718
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,438
That's cold, coach.

719
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,065
Everybody, relax.

720
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,733
I just want to switch it up
a little bit,

721
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,277
see if darnell can put
some points on the board.

722
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,029
Y'all, I know we got
this comeback in us.

723
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,115
I know we do.

724
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,700
We just got to get it done.

725
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,243
-aRe we gonna get it?
-lEt's get it.

726
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,619
Uh-uh.
Are we gonna get it?

727
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,413
Let's get it!

728
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,289
All right. Go get it then
let's get it!

729
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,711
So coach
billy baker is making a change

730
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,462
at quarterback.

731
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,464
Nevada transfer darnell hayes
will get the snaps

732
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,258
in the second half.

733
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,345
Set...go!

734
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,972
Hayes drops back...

735
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,102
And finds spencer
for a touchdown!

736
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,104
Great way to start
the second half.

737
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,484
Darnell hayes
takes the snap,

738
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,570
and he keeps it.

739
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,530
Shows off some moves,

740
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,782
and he's in for a touchdown!

741
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,453
Hayes really provided a spark
for this offense.

742
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,456
South crenshaw pulls
into within a touchdown.

743
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,333
Spencer, slant
z corner.

744
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,668
I'm gonna hit you
on the stride.

745
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
Ready?

746
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,880
This is it.
7-point game

747
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,799
with 8 seconds on the clock.

748
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,718
51 spike, 51 spike.

749
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,726
Set, hut!

750
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,561
Hayes drops back.

751
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,899
Throws a fade
to the back of the end zone.

752
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,276
-oOh! He caught it!
-yEs!

753
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,278
Spencer james
with an impossible catch

754
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,946
for a touchdown!

755
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,950
That was one of the best catches
you'll ever see.

756
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,119
Extra point will send us
to overtime.

757
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,829
What a game!

758
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,132
Here's the snap.

759
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,676
And the kick is no good.

760
00:34:55,718 --> 00:35:00,014
Wow! South crenshaw's
comeback falls one point short.

761
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,433
Heartbreaking way
to lose the game.

762
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,487
-Hey!
-Hey. What's up?

763
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,864
I'm so proud
of you.

764
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,282
We lost.

765
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,784
Yeah, but you were
unbelievable.

766
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,077
We still lost.

767
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah, but that
second half?

768
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,372
You guys are gonna
be good this year,

769
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,457
and, you know,
at least your
arm didn't--

770
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,128
-iT went numb.
-wHat?

771
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,879
You played so well,
I thought--

772
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,631
Naw. It wasn't
during the game.

773
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,884
It happened right before.

774
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,761
Standing on the field,
listening to the drums,

775
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,681
they sounded like
the shooter.

776
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,642
Hey. Um...

777
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,061
Have you thought
about therapy?

778
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,521
I did physical therapy
for months, layla.

779
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,107
I'm not talking
about physical therapy.

780
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,152
Oh. What do you mean?

781
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,572
Um, well, after we
spoke last night,
I did some research,

782
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,991
and sports psychology
therapy is

783
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,034
a growing medical field,

784
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,871
and, you know, clearly,
whatever's going on

785
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,372
is more than just
physical.

786
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,582
You think it's all
in my head?

787
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,751
No. I--I don't know.

788
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,045
Maybe your head's
messing with you,

789
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,797
and I found
a sports therapist

790
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,424
who's supposed to be great,

791
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,884
and I just--I don't know.

792
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,846
-I Just thought maybe that--
-oK.

793
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,641
-yEah?
-yEah.

794
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,061
I need to find out
what's going on.

795
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,939
Ok. Heh.

796
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,692
-sO how'd beverly do tonight?
-uH...

797
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,110
Who's embarrassed?

798
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,279
Come on. Show of hands.

799
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,573
Nobody's embarrassed?

800
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,074
I'm embarrassed.

801
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,035
Your fans,
who came out tonight

802
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,703
thinking they were gonna see
the defending state champs,

803
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,996
they're embarrassed.

804
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,664
Something isn't working.

805
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,710
This team lacks focus,
fundamentals, discipline,

806
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,546
but most of all,
it lacks leadership.

807
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,593
Practice tomorrow 7 a.m.

808
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:12,355
Hey. We, uh, won
that game out there, right?

809
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,483
Huh? I mean, we're still
gonna roll

810
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,360
to the state title, y'all!

811
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,321
Let's hear it because
around here we celebrate wins.

812
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,826
Hey. Hey!
Stop celebrating.

813
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,453
What?

814
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,331
Look. She's right.
I'm embarrassed.

815
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,209
How many tackles
did you miss
tonight, JJ, huh?

816
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,336
All of you. Look.
We play like that
again,

817
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,004
and we won't win
another game.

818
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,339
Celebrate that,
please.

819
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,008
I just meant we won
the game.

820
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,510
Would you sit down?

821
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,807
Listen up.
This game tonight,

822
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,976
this embarrassing-ass
performance,

823
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,811
that's on me,
all right?

824
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,605
It's my job to
make sure we're
ready, mine,

825
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,982
and I failed...

826
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,904
And that won't happen
again, all right?
You hear me?

827
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,782
It's time to wake up.

828
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,117
Coach wants you here
by 7 a.m.

829
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,661
I want you here
00.

830
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,290
anyone not here,
you can turn in
your jersey.

831
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,054
I'm guessing
you don't want

832
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,056
another one of my
bad anecdotes.

833
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,350
Depends.
What do you got?

834
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,436
Well, the year
I won this ring,

835
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,313
lost our first game
of the season.

836
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,735
That probably wasn't
on a field that was named
after you, though, huh?

837
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,196
No. I'm sure that
stings a bit.

838
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,324
My point is
it is a long season,

839
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,117
and the way your guys
finished the game--

840
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,494
-wE didn't finish it.
-yOu almost did.

841
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
Your guys fought
to the end,

842
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,457
and they get that
from you.

843
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,125
You probably think
i'm crazy

844
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,960
for walking away
from a championship
team, huh?

845
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,130
-nO.
-cOme on.

846
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,258
Maybe a little. Heh.

847
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,801
But you are right
where you want to be.

848
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,470
-oH, man.
-yOu left beverly

849
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,055
to build
something better here.

850
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,681
A rebuild doesn't
just happen overnight.

851
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,352
I'd start by finding
a kicker.

852
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,102
heh.

853
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:22,026
Score isn't gonna
change the longer
you look at it.

854
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,569
aah!

855
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,573
We were so close.

856
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,451
Now you're just
torturing yourself.

857
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,828
Come on. You got to put
this one behind you.

858
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,460
Hey. Look at that.

859
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,295
On to the next one?

860
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,964
Yeah.

861
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,883
On to the next one.

862
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,180
-Asher.
-Hey.

863
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,099
This is unexpected.

864
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,267
Look. I just wanted
to apologize
for last night.

865
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,353
I know you're new here
and just trying to
make friends,

866
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,562
and if you want to
date JJ--

867
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,398
I don't need
your permission.

868
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,150
You know, the hardest thing
about being the new kid

869
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,985
has been seeing you.

870
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,737
You're not
the same person.

871
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,907
I'm still trying to
figure out who
the real asher is,

872
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,494
the sweet, confident,
hopeful guy I met
on the beach

873
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,122
or this shifty guy
who wants to pretend
we never met?

874
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,333
I pretended we never met
because I didn't want
to hurt olivia...

875
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,962
But just so you know,
I told her the truth
tonight.

876
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,965
About summer?
What did she say?

877
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,591
She was surprisingly
cool with it.

878
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,926
-rEally?
-sHe said,

879
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,803
"whatever happened
happened,

880
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,139
and you should just
leave summer
in the past."

881
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,308
I'm a girl, asher,
and if I was your girlfriend

882
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,144
and olivia was a girl
from the summer,

883
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,522
I wouldn't be cool
with it.

884
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,066
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe olivia's

885
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,818
trying to forget
about summer

886
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,570
because she's
hiding something, too?

887
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:58,581
Yo. That grab
in the back of the end
zone, bro--wow!

888
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,749
Like, I thought
I overthrew that for sure.

889
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,586
Like, how--how'd you
just pull that down?

890
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,754
Man, I wish we won
that game, bruh.

891
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,508
Hey. That's
the last game we lose.

892
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,927
So we good now,
you and me?

893
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,180
-yEah, we good, bro.
-hA ha ha!

894
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,890
Hey. We did click
on that field.

895
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,892
Dude, it was like we was
reading each other's minds.

896
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,144
-rIght?
-aNd I'm telling you, bro.

897
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,646
With us in the lineup,
it's a wrap.

898
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,399
Nobody can stay
within 3 touchdowns
of us, man.

899
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,151
Let's bring it home
for south crenshaw.

900
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,903
Yo. We got to.

901
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,654
Yo, darnell.

902
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,538
-dArnell hayes?
-yEah.

903
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
We're here
about your mom.

904
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,417
There was a--

905
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,087
She's hurt real bad, son.

906
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,455
Greg, move your head!

906
00:42:22,305 --> 00:43:22,267

1
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:08,120
My intention
in running for the presidency,

2
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,645
is to preserve
American democracy,

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,478
by preventing America
from taking part

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,687
in another World War.

5
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:16,895
Did you read the Roper Poll?

6
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:19,019
Thirty-nine percent say Jews
are like other people.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,269
Fifty-three percent say
we're different

8
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:22,853
and should be, quote,
"restricted."

9
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:25,228
- Wrong turn.
- Herman, please drive.

10
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:28,436
You tell your thief cousin,
I'll have the police on him.

11
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:31,520
I'm a lot of things, kiddo,
but a thief I'm not.

12
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,311
He wanted it to go on like that.

13
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,478
I'd be the mistress,
never the wife.

14
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,728
You're beautiful.

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,144
You're bright.
You'll meet someone.

16
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:43,645
We have room for one flag,
the American flag.

17
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:47,186
Evelyn. A beautiful name
for a beautiful lady.

18
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:48,395
Call me Lionel.

19
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:50,937
They think Lindbergh can win.

20
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,019
He can.

21
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,728
Your choice is simple.
It is between Lindbergh...

22
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:58,853
and war.

23
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,603
Win or lose,
there's a lot of hate out there.

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,478
And he knows how to tap into it.

25
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,436
Sandy?

26
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,228
Move. Attack!
Watch out, Yankees.

27
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,228
Hey! You stepped on General Lee!
Sandy!

28
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:56,937
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

29
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,687
- Buddy, come on!
- Excuse me.

30
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,687
Sorry, kid. This is as near
as you're gonna get.

31
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,353
You can't get any closer.

32
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:36,687
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

33
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,853
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

34
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,645
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

35
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:57,412
Thank you.

36
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,269
I'm happy to be back
in New Jersey with you.

37
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:04,353
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

38
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:24,353
My intention
in running for the presidency

39
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:25,978
is to preserve
American democracy

40
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:26,937
by preventing America

41
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,353
from taking part
in another world war.

42
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,520
Your choice is simple.

43
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:34,995
It is not between
Charles A. Lindbergh

44
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,978
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

45
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,353
It is between Lindbergh...

46
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,812
- and war.
- Yeah, yeah!

47
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:45,395
Lindbergh!
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

48
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:48,311
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

49
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,812
The excitement continues here

50
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,269
at Newark's municipal airfield
as Cha-

51
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,853
- That wasn't so bad.
- He says the same thing

52
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:00,057
wherever he lands the plane,

53
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,186
from California to Florida
to Maine,

54
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,978
but they keep
putting it on the radio

55
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,812
no matter how many times
he says it.

56
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:09,561
"Lindbergh or war."
It's a terrible thing to say.

57
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,520
Well, war is no good.

58
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,019
Lindbergh is worse.

59
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,978
Evelyn doesn't think so.

60
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,603
She... She what?

61
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,853
She says everyone
doesn't understand

62
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:25,395
that Lindbergh
is not against the Jews.

63
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,061
He just wants peace.

64
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,978
- Ma...
- Uh, that's what she said.

65
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,311
- Talk to her.
- I would, but she's late.

66
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,019
How long is her union meeting
supposed to last?

67
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:37,371
I need to get
to the shopping already.

68
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,478
There isn't
a union meeting today.

69
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,269
There isn't?

70
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:45,937
Evelyn went to the airport
to see Charles Lindbergh.

71
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,353
The pilot.

72
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,019
He's coming to Newark, you know.

73
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,663
You're wetting the whole mount

74
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,311
and not letting it dry.
See right here?

75
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,853
That's water damage on the edge
of your Horace Mann.

76
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:03,561
I thought I patted it dry.

77
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,353
Let me show you
the way it's done.

78
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:10,353
See, I only wet the top portion
of the mount.

79
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,061
See?

80
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,978
I didn't know
you should use tongs.

81
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,186
You don't have to,

82
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,978
but it helps
to protect the stamp.

83
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,103
You have any?

84
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,311
You can have these.

85
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,895
Gee, thanks!

86
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,144
Let's do something different.

87
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,228
Like what?

88
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,269
Follow people.

89
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:29,812
- Why?
- To see where they live.

90
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:31,478
- That's it?
- That's a lot.

91
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,478
I go all over,
even leave Newark.

92
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,520
Go anyplace I want.
People live everywhere.

93
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,353
How do you get home
before your mom?

94
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,520
The trick is to go
as far as I can

95
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:43,144
and get back before she does.

96
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,269
Come on.

97
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,186
Why do you hide your money?

98
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,770
I took it from my mom and dad.

99
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,019
When they're not around,
I go through my mom's purse

100
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,603
or my dad's jacket and pants.

101
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:08,687
It's easy
'cause nobody counts the coins.

102
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,228
But don't take all of it.
That might tip them off.

103
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,061
...wasn't
able to knock Godoy out...

104
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,144
Tabatchnick's.

105
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:27,645
Yes, sir.

106
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,061
There's the end
of round two, where Louis rocks Godoy

107
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:35,186
with jolting lefts and rights
to the head.

108
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,311
What's the paper say?

109
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:38,812
The Germans
are gonna invade England.

110
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,853
They're bombing London
every night now.

111
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:44,061
Idiots. Another idiot war.
What's the news in Jersey?

112
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:46,728
I only looked at the local pages
for a minute or two,

113
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,061
but it's mostly about Lindbergh

114
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:49,728
flying here today
for a campaign stop.

115
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,162
Another fucking idiot.

116
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,228
Yes, sir, he is.

117
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:54,645
Roosevelt, too.
All fucking idiots.

118
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,645
Use the siren, I'm hungry.

119
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,269
The siren's for state business,
Mr. Steinheim.

120
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:02,311
Are we going to Tabatchnick's
as the racing commissioner?

121
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,937
He looks interesting.

122
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,812
Dresses sharp, and he's going
on the 24 West Orange.

123
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,853
A lot of nice houses out there.
You ready?

124
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,228
Not yet. Let him get on first.

125
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:34,353
Okay, now.

126
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:54,228
- We could get lost.
- You can't get lost.

127
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,478
You tell the directions
by the house numbers.

128
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,812
Even numbers are south and east,
and odd is north and west.

129
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,019
The bigger the number,

130
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,063
the farther you are from Broad
and Market streets.

131
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,186
It's simple.

132
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:31,812
C'mon, move!

133
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,228
Don't get right behind him.

134
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,186
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Told you.

135
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,019
Where are all the kids?

136
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:14,144
Rich kids don't play
in the street.

137
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,937
They have backyards.
Wanna see one?

138
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,103
No, thanks.

139
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,812
Darn it. That didn't last long.

140
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,228
What are you doing?

141
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,395
I gotta get the house number.
Keep track of where I go.

142
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,228
Then I put pins in a map.
You should do it, too.

143
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,269
Then you can see
all the places you've been.

144
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,103
Got it, let's go.

145
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,937
Abe is here!
How 'bout some service?

146
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,537
Good morning, Mr. Steinheim.

147
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,895
- What can I get for...
- Four pounds of sturgeon,

148
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:10,144
three of the smoked whitefish,
three of the belly lox,

149
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,812
two of the sable,
two dozen herring fillets,

150
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,144
three dozen bagels,
four bags of pickles.

151
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,728
And hurry it up,
I don't got all day.

152
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,829
All right,
let's move it, fellas. Let's go, let's go.

153
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:21,978
Hey, kid. Keep a sharp eye
he don't try to thumb the scale.

154
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,144
He's only joking, folks.
All right, come on.

155
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:26,204
- Let's move, guys.
- There's always Horowitz's.

156
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:30,895
All right, that'll be...
37.63, Mr. Steinheim.

157
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,436
Thank you,
let me get your change.

158
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,561
- Please do.
- Get him his bags.

159
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:39,144
Look at this.
Indian head nickel, huh?

160
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:41,061
- Next.
- I'm watching you.

161
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,269
So, Saturday night,
you coming over?

162
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,603
- I hope.
- Okay, take me home.

163
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,186
What do you mean "hope"?

164
00:13:57,978 --> 00:14:00,937
I had to park it
a couple of blocks down.

165
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,937
- Down on third?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,770
- Evening, James.
- Mr. Levin.

167
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,228
Got here just before
they closed, I think.

168
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,579
- Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.

169
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,186
You worked the weekend again?

170
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,019
End of the month is coming up.
I'm still short on my quota.

171
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,770
- Is that Black Forest?
- It is.

172
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,937
All right.
I'll take that and, uh...

173
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,520
half dozen of your jelly-filled.

174
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:32,228
I saved those for you. Patty?
The jellies from the back.

175
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:35,353
You listen to, uh, Lindbergh
at the airport?

176
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:37,019
You missed nothing.

177
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,353
Who was there to greet him?

178
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,687
The Republican congressman.
Vreeland and the other guy.

179
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,061
A few state assemblymen.
Some ministers and whatnot.

180
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:50,520
Oh, the rabbi from B'nai Moshe,
what's his name, Bergensdorf...

181
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:51,978
- Bengelsdorf.
- Yeah.

182
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,353
Pompous son of a bitch.

183
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:58,061
But no one from Bergen
or Hudson or Essex counties.

184
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:02,645
Frank Hague told every Democrat
on any ticket north of Brunswick

185
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,603
that if they even drive by
that airport,

186
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,367
they're gonna be looking
for work tomorrow.

187
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:08,728
Well, Frank Hague can do that,

188
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:10,895
and he's always been rock solid
for Roosevelt.

189
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,353
And Roosevelt for him.

190
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:15,311
Still, I wish the president

191
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:16,728
would answer
that son of a bitch.

192
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:20,061
He's presidential, Norman.
That's what he's showing us.

193
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:21,144
You remember what he said

194
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:23,561
when Lindbergh
won the nomination?

195
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:25,770
"By the time this is over,"

196
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:28,061
that young man will be sorry

197
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,603
not only that
he entered politics,

198
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,561
"but that he ever learned
to fly."

199
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,770
From his mouth to God's ears.
Hey, enjoy the Black Forest.

200
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,621
But in central London,

201
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,436
with searchlights moving closer
to our position,

202
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,812
one expects to hear more bursts
at any moment like before.

203
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:50,103
There, what's known as that
hard stony sound, closer still.

204
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:53,812
Doesn't sound like they can
hold on much longer, does it?

205
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:56,395
- England?
- Every night, they're bombed.

206
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:58,770
First Poland, then France,
Norway, the Dutch,

207
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,103
now England, all alone.

208
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:01,537
We're doing what we can.

209
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,281
Roosevelt just transferred
eight submarines;

210
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,746
gave them to the English
up in Canada.

211
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,970
And before that, the destroyers,
to protect their ships.

212
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,311
And when Roosevelt isn't there?

213
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,978
- What are you talking?
- Maybe Monty's right to worry.

214
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,103
- What if Lindbergh does win?
- Everyone sees what he is.

215
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,186
Everyone I talk to
knows that he's just...

216
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,520
Who do you talk to?

217
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,788
We live in Newark, in Jersey,
in the Jewish section of town.

218
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,645
Not just Jews.
Italians, negroes, other people.

219
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:23,603
You ask them,

220
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,269
they see this schmuck
for what he is.

221
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:28,144
Listen to your brother.
Lindbergh is a hero.

222
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,645
To most people in this country,

223
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:32,269
there's never been a bigger hero
in their lifetime.

224
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:36,228
Lindbergh is a fascist putz.

225
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,120
Roosevelt's gonna mop the floor
with him, you'll see.

226
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,371
...taken off from the HMS Ark Royal

227
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:43,353
was met upon landing
by Vichy French colonial forces

228
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,061
- present in Dakar.
- Dakar?

229
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,561
- Where the hell is that?
- Lebanon, maybe?

230
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,037
They faced warning shots

231
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,436
from the Allied fleet's
heavy cruiser, The Australia,

232
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,728
and quickly returned to port.

233
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,395
Later in the day,
an attempt was made

234
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,978
to set Free French troops
ashore on a beach

235
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,478
to the southeast of the city,

236
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,204
but at the last minute,
General de Gaulle...

237
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:05,019
Ah. Africa. Western Africa.

238
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,329
Is it good for the Jews?

239
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:08,436
Can you find
a decent delicatessen in Dakar?

240
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,680
Attacks from
his ships on coastal defenses continue.

241
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:16,895
- You missed dinner.
- Yeah, I figured.

242
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:20,687
The boss man made me drive him
down to the track at Freehold.

243
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,269
- He had a trotter running.
- Did it win?

244
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,687
No. His horses never win.

245
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,186
He just runs them so
he can mingle with the goyim.

246
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,478
Run around Jersey
as racing commissioner

247
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,311
with a siren on the car.

248
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:34,687
Dad says Mr. Steinheim is smart
and rich

249
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,019
and that you're lucky to have
this job driving for him.

250
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,478
He's a swindler. And a screamer.

251
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,103
A what?

252
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,287
Look, I've been in his office

253
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,061
when his subcontractors come in
to get paid.

254
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,287
You know, Steinheim tells them,
"Hey, look, we're out of money,"

255
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,746
you know,
this is the best I could do.

256
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,287
"Look, take it, rob me,
it's all I got."

257
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,228
Then he pays them a half,
a third...

258
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,770
If he can get away with it,
a quarter.

259
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,978
These people, Sandy,
they need the money to survive.

260
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,728
And he's a bastard to his wife,
his sons, everybody.

261
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,395
Y... Yeah, but... but Dad says...

262
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,454
Look, your dad sees
what Steinheim made of himself,

263
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:06,645
not who he is.

264
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:12,853
Look, your dad
really went to bat for me,

265
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,061
getting Steinheim to take me on.

266
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,436
I know he did.
You know, he...

267
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,329
He walked right up to him
at the high holiday services

268
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:20,853
and talked up my being an orphan
and all.

269
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,103
Your dad's a good man.

270
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,770
I heard Steinheim's gonna pay
your way to Rutgers.

271
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:30,436
Mm. He got on the phone
to the university president.

272
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,228
Steinheim, he starts...

273
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,537
Starts shouting at people,
you know,

274
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,937
"You're gonna take this boy,
all right?"

275
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,561
And his grades
are not the issue.

276
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,478
The boy is an orphan,
potentially a genius,

277
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,061
and you're gonna give him
a scholarship,

278
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,395
and I'm gonna build you
a college building,

279
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:47,728
the most beautiful in the world.

280
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:49,269
But not so much as a shithouse

281
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,353
unless the orphan boy
goes to Rutgers.

282
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:55,186
- "All expenses paid."
- Jeez.

283
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,478
- He must like you.
- Yeah, maybe.

284
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,186
So, any dessert left,

285
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,103
or did you and your brother
eat every god damn bite?

286
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:05,829
He's one of the greatest presidents
we ever had. He saved this country

287
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,788
-from a depression, and he's
playing it -MONTY: From a perspective.

288
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,621
- Exactly the way he should.
- You're talking about this community.

289
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,204
- He's being presidential.
- He's gonna get

290
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:13,162
- his ass beat. Outside of this community...
- Roosevelt?

291
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,579
- Lindbergh's gonna beat him.
- Ridiculous. Don't be an idiot.

292
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,704
- Oh, I'm the idiot?
- You know, My farmers are backing him.

293
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,913
- They like the entertainment.
- Herman, believe what you

294
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:23,245
- want but the man has a chance!
- He has more than a chance. Fascism is winning.

295
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,371
- Has anybody in this house noticed this?
- Enough! Enough.

296
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,728
Enough politics.
I can't take it anymore.

297
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:30,478
You? When you go upstairs,
you need a bath,

298
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:31,788
and you need
to put your sketches away.

299
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,937
They're all spread out
on your bed and floor.

300
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,019
You missed supper,

301
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,770
but I have some leftovers
I can heat up.

302
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,478
And you two, please?

303
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,561
- Turn off the radio.
- And miss Winchell?

304
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,245
- Herman...
- Now Winchell's a mensch.

305
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:43,954
That's a Jew
that takes no guff from anyone.

306
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,496
Damn right,
and he means what he says.

307
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,978
Not like some of them,
not like this rabbi from B'nai Moshe.

308
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,228
- Bengelsdorf?
- Bengelsdorf.

309
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,395
Out there on the airfield,
shaking the hand of a man

310
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,937
who shook Göring's hand
and got a Nazi medal for it.

311
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,228
Bengelsdorf did that?

312
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,687
Honey? Do you want real food
or are you okay with cake?

313
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,995
- Cake's more than fine.
- What if Lindbergh just wants peace?

314
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,228
Kiddo, this is peace
with a man who is jailing

315
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,269
- and killing our people.
- But not Americans.

316
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,663
Oh,
knock it off with the Lindbergh puppet.

317
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,895
Enough! Enough! Enough!
Enough, do you hear me?

318
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,788
- You're still wrong.
- We're just talking.

319
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,895
Mom. Do Gracie.

320
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,978
Not right now, honey. I...
I can't. Just go upstairs.

321
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,770
- Go to sleep, it's really late.
- Come on, please?

322
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:23,728
Just a little bit.

323
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:27,436
Or you could do Baby Snooks.

324
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I can't do Gracie

325
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,728
unless your father
does his George Burns.

326
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:34,061
Oh God, I won't remember.

327
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,853
Come on,
you know it well enough.

328
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,770
- Oh, all right, all right.
- Oh boy, oh boy.

329
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,937
Oh, she's got the...

330
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,228
Oh, George?

331
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:52,746
Yes, Gracie?

332
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,561
I got a letter from my brother.

333
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,061
Your brother, he writes?

334
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:59,895
Not well, but he writes.
He tells me about my niece.

335
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:02,395
- She's got three feet.
- Your niece has a third foot?

336
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,812
Oh, that's nothing.
I got an aunt who sees

337
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,937
- with her mouth.
- Sees with her mouth?

338
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:09,144
Sure,
she sees if the soup is hot.

339
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,978
So, tell me about your niece
who grew another foot.

340
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:14,603
- Herman, you're killing us!
- Hey!

341
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,770
- What?
- Dad, come on!

342
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,412
- You stepped on my line.
- The whole thing is wrong.

343
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:20,603
Oh, all right, uh...
Right. Uh, so...

344
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,407
Tell me 'bout your niece
who has three feet.

345
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:25,603
He tells me, "Oh, you wouldn't
even know little Jean",

346
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:28,353
"she's grown another foot."

347
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:32,144
- Oh, I... I'll be right back.
- Where you going, Gracie?

348
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:34,645
I left the stove in the kitchen.

349
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,353
Say good night, Gracie!

350
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,395
Good night!

351
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,436
And good night,
and good night, and good night.

352
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Thank you, thank you.

353
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,520
Sandy, don't forget to pick up
your sketches.

354
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,978
And wash your neck.

355
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,728
When he came out
against the Jews

356
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:59,561
in the Des Moines speech,
I was... outraged.

357
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:03,144
But since then,
his message has been anti-war,

358
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:07,937
which makes me conflicted
because I hate war.

359
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:11,228
As do I, and I'll do everything
within my power

360
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:13,687
to stop our country
from being entangled

361
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,478
in yet another
European conflict.

362
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:21,228
Now, to that end, last month,
I met with Lindbergh.

363
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,311
He met with you? In private?

364
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:30,478
And despite what you might hear,
he's a gracious man.

365
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,603
Mm. What did he tell you?

366
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:35,895
Well, it's more
what I was able to tell him.

367
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,019
I explained to him

368
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:42,978
that our people are committed
irrevocably to America,

369
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,478
where though Ireland
still matters to the Irish

370
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,603
and Poland to the Poles,
Jews retain no allegiance,

371
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:52,520
sentimental or otherwise,
to those Old-World countries

372
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,895
where we were
never really welcome.

373
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,853
And from that meeting,
going forward,

374
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:02,812
Lindbergh has not said anything
derogatory about our people.

375
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,937
Not to me, and not in public.

376
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:09,353
- He listened to you.
- Um... it would seem.

377
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:12,770
But there are so many, though,
who don't trust him.

378
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,770
- My brother-in-law...
- I understand,

379
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:19,019
and I'm gonna do my best
to convince them otherwise,

380
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:22,103
which brings me to the purpose
of this dinner

381
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:24,895
and my asking you
to accompany me

382
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,603
to the airfield today.

383
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:33,812
Are you still planning to leave
the classroom next year?

384
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:37,728
Uh, yes, I already notified
the school board.

385
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:40,353
And your plan was to take
a position to work

386
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,645
for the teachers union.

387
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:50,395
I don't mean to, how does it go,
toot my own horn,

388
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:53,603
but I can make that happen,
if that's what you want,

389
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:56,645
I certainly have friends
in the teachers union.

390
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,645
But I have another offer

391
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,561
that I'd like for you
to consider.

392
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:07,812
Come work with me.

393
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:16,395
With his
aircraft now overdue by almost ten hours

394
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,269
after taking off
from an airfield near Nashville

395
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:20,713
and beginning
what should have been

396
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,561
little more
than an hour flight west

397
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,770
to a scheduled campaign stop
in Memphis.

398
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:27,019
Search parties
began again at dawn,

399
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,269
combing every hill and field

400
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:31,103
of the 220 miles
between the cities,

401
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:33,019
looking for Lindbergh's famed...

402
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,103
Did he crash his plane?

403
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,978
Don't be silly.
Lindbergh doesn't crash.

404
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:44,019
It can happen to any pilot.

405
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:46,061
As I recall,
he had a few crash landings

406
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:47,937
when he flew
for the postal service.

407
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,812
That was early.
Lindbergh hasn't crashed

408
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:52,895
since he crossed the ocean.
And he flies everywhere.

409
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:03,770
Well... I have some news.

410
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:08,103
I'm gonna see
about getting a job.

411
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:14,186
A job? Where? Why?

412
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:17,436
Because your father and I need
to save a little extra money

413
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,978
if we're going to buy a house.

414
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,269
- In Union?
- No, here in Weequahic.

415
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:25,353
But Mom, you won't be home?

416
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,770
Not in the daytime,
but I will be there

417
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,603
every morning
to see you off for school

418
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,561
and I will be there
every night with dinner.

419
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:34,478
But what about after school,
or... or on the weekends?

420
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,478
Who's going to fix our snacks
or lunches?

421
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,579
Come on, you're old enough

422
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,019
to spread some jelly
on some bread.

423
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,478
If you ever couldn't reach me,

424
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:44,478
you could call your father
or Aunt Evelyn or Uncle Monty,

425
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,728
I'll put all the numbers
by the phone.

426
00:25:57,645 --> 00:26:00,144
Our new house
will have a backyard, right?

427
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,603
'Cause only poor kids
play in the street.

428
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,144
Now,
don't get ahead of yourself.

429
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,436
She doesn't even have
the job yet.

430
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,269
And what gave you the idea
we're poor?

431
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,228
We're not poor.

432
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:13,311
Poor people don't have a car
or food on the table.

433
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,645
I don't know.

434
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:25,103
This is what
they don't understand.

435
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:27,937
At a certain point,
to make the big money,

436
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,687
you need money!

437
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,269
You show me a meshugenah,
he socked away two,

438
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:34,812
three million,
he thinks he's got it made.

439
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:37,311
He's all done.

440
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,853
Wants to sit back, retire,
enjoy life...

441
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:41,937
And why not?

442
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,812
Because that's when
you've got the money

443
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,978
that can really work for you.

444
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:47,770
That's when,
if you know what you're doing,

445
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:48,937
and you know how to do it,

446
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,144
you can turn it into 30,
40 million.

447
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,812
That's when
you can use that money

448
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:56,061
to get into rooms
where you couldn't go.

449
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:57,978
Money makes money.

450
00:26:58,061 --> 00:26:59,853
It gets you to the deals
and the properties

451
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:01,978
that you couldn't touch before.

452
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:05,436
And the high hats who wouldn't
let you in their club

453
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,061
or want you buying a house
next to theirs,

454
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:09,812
they won't like you any better.

455
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:13,103
But they'll make way,
because they need your money

456
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,687
to get it done,
to make the deal.

457
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:26,019
Hey, putzik.
You gonna get the door,

458
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,687
or am I paying you for nothing?

459
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,770
You always gotta push.

460
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:37,144
That's the way the world is.

461
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,687
If you don't push,
they push you.

462
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:41,770
Take care, Abe.

463
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,228
Yolds.

464
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,103
'Scuse me?

465
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,895
Yolds. Every one a behaima.

466
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,853
What, canst redden Yiddish, kid?

467
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,812
Not so much, no. I mean,
my grandfather used to speak it

468
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:56,579
to my grandma if they didn't
want to be understood.

469
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,812
- But he's gone now, so...
- A yold is a schmuck.

470
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:01,978
A rube, a dumb animal
waiting to get taken.

471
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:04,061
Yeah? What's a behaima?

472
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:05,728
A fat cow.

473
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,770
Same thing.

474
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,353
I don't know, Ev.

475
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:14,895
Maybe this is a silly idea
to start with.

476
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:17,103
Why? The boys are older,

477
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:18,895
there's no reason
you can't go back to work

478
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,436
and begin saving money.

479
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:23,269
What have you circled?

480
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:28,687
Two jobs for seamstresses
and one office cleaning company,

481
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,061
but that's at night.

482
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:38,978
Why did you go to the airport?

483
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,395
What?

484
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,853
Why did you go to the airport
to see Lindbergh?

485
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:48,895
Ma told me.

486
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,895
A friend of mine
asked me to go with him.

487
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:56,561
- A friend? Angelo again?
- No. I told you, that's over.

488
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:59,269
- I am done with Angelo.
- Good.

489
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:04,311
Who, then?

490
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,144
Rabbi Bengelsdorf.

491
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:11,978
Bengelsdorf? Evelyn...

492
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,019
Lindbergh is not an anti-Semite.

493
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:16,978
- Like hell he's not!
- Bess, do you really think

494
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:20,269
that a rabbi,
and someone as... as smart

495
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:23,228
and accomplished as Lionel,
could ever support someone

496
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:25,895
- who was truly against the Jews?
- Lionel?

497
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:27,186
Well, that's his name.

498
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,645
He's got to be in his 50s.

499
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:32,186
Evelyn, for the love
of all that's holy...

500
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:35,436
He's 60, actually.
But he's widowed.

501
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,269
And oh my goodness,
you can tell our mother,

502
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:38,937
I think he's Jewish.

503
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,603
I mean, it's not like a rabbi
is any kind of job

504
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:44,019
for a nice Jewish boy,
but you know, at this point,

505
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:46,395
I'm just gonna have to take
what I can get.

506
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,061
He's a good man, Bess.

507
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:56,019
I think
I might have found someone.

508
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,061
Whoa.

509
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:42,978
Isn't this a little
too much warpaint?

510
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,144
No...

511
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:48,311
Now that is a shade too bold.

512
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:50,687
If it's good enough
for Barbara Stanwyck,

513
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,561
it's good enough
for Elizabeth Finkel Levin.

514
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:56,061
Pucker.

515
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,269
Hm. Barbara Stanwyck, huh?

516
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:13,478
It's her favorite shade.
So says Louella Parsons.

517
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:17,895
Oh, one more touch...

518
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,103
Grandma Sara's.

519
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:31,311
Oh, don't cry!
You're gonna ruin my best work!

520
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:08,019
Um, Mr. Stern's office, please?

521
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:10,311
Fourth floor,
elevator on your far right.

522
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,812
Thank you.

523
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,311
Fourth floor, please.

524
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:31,103
Hi, Phil. Wanna play chess?

525
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:33,311
No! I have errands to run.

526
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:35,937
- Can I come with you?
- No, I have a bus to catch.

527
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,561
I can play with you tomorrow.

528
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:48,537
And now,
the second half of the eighth inning.

529
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:51,061
Rudy York, first baseman,
will be the first man up

530
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:54,061
for the Tigers.
He's batting right-handed again

531
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:57,353
and followed by Greenberg
and then Pinky Higgins.

532
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,645
- Score?
- Seven-one, Tigers.

533
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:01,103
But Greenberg has an RBI double,

534
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:03,269
so that's one for the Hebrews,
regardless.

535
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:05,853
The Reds are subbing out
the pitcher.

536
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:07,829
Mr. Steinheim doesn't need you
tonight for anything?

537
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:10,186
Let me see,
he'll be screaming at his wife

538
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,621
and running down his sons
at dinner,

539
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,079
but I can't really help him
with that.

540
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:15,162
Don't be stupid and mouth off
like this when he can hear you.

541
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,311
I'm stupid?
To hell with Steinheim.

542
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:20,144
- He's a goniff.
- A goniff? He's a builder.

543
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:21,913
And one of the most important
in New Jersey.

544
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:25,144
He chisels his contractors.
He's against the unions.

545
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:26,508
He screws over
the working people

546
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:27,871
every chance he gets,
I didn't know

547
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:30,103
you had so much admiration
for all of that.

548
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:32,586
You really wanna tell me that
the worst human being ever born

549
00:34:32,645 --> 00:34:35,019
is a man who wants to make you
an educated person

550
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,746
and find a place for you
in his building company?

551
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,621
Hitler is the worst human being
ever born, and frankly,

552
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,311
I'd rather be fighting
that son of a bitch

553
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,520
than waste my time
with a Jew like Steinheim,

554
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,287
who only brings shame
on the rest of us by...

555
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:45,454
Don't talk to me like a child.

556
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,103
He doesn't bring shame
on anyone.

557
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,120
You think it would be any better
if you were working

558
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,037
- for an Irish builder?
- I do not want to be in debt

559
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:53,079
to the likes of Abe Steinheim
for the rest of my life.

560
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,412
- In debt to a...
- There's more to him

561
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:55,663
than just money,
and like him or not,

562
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,412
there's no reason for you
to give up on college.

563
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:58,913
To hell with Steinheim,
and to hell with you...

564
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:01,417
- You think that everything in this life...
- What is this now?

565
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,687
- We were just...
- Nothing, Aunt Bess.

566
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:08,812
It's baseball.

567
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,353
You look beautiful.

568
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,353
I look hired.

569
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:20,978
Hahne's department store,
women's apparel.

570
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:24,019
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

571
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,941
Well, first, I went to see
Malka the dressmaker.

572
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,395
- Mm-hm.
- She'd already filled the position with her niece.

573
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:35,687
- Malka.
- Yeah. But then she said...

574
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,269
I have everyone
of the National Parks issue

575
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,353
except for
the Great Smokey Mountains.

576
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:44,561
Ten cent one.
I think it's black.

577
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:52,478
Did you know men stars
in Hollywood kiss each other?

578
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,144
What are you talking about?

579
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,978
You didn't know that, did you?

580
00:35:56,061 --> 00:36:00,770
That's bullshit, who told...
No, let me guess, Earl Axman.

581
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,269
His dad was in a movie
in Hollywood and he told Earl.

582
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,537
- So there.
- Your friend knows too much for a little kid

583
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:07,061
and not near enough
to be a grown-up.

584
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,645
He has a great stamp collection.

585
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:11,853
Big deal. Did he tell you
rich kids play in backyards?

586
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:15,395
He did, didn't he?
It's more bullshit.

587
00:36:15,478 --> 00:36:17,037
He's got a mom
that'll go out with anyone.

588
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,954
She goes out with guys
that aren't even her own age.

589
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:19,895
How do you know?

590
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,645
Everyone on Summit Avenue knows.

591
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:23,408
- I don't.
- That's not all you don't know.

592
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,853
Like what?
What don't I know?

593
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:45,853
Leave it on.

594
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,770
A little paint
and powder does it?

595
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:58,311
The pearls, too.

596
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,937
In the words of perhaps

597
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:02,269
our greatest prophet, Isaiah,

598
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:05,770
"They shall beat their swords
into plowshares"

599
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:09,269
and their spears
into pruning hooks.

600
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,353
Nation shall not take up sword
against nation...

601
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:18,061
"Nor shall they train
for war anymore."

602
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,895
Please turn to page 158

603
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:24,853
as the cantor leads us
in Ashrei.

604
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,371
Philip, your mother is concerned
you may be a little too young

605
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:49,812
- to watch the newsreels.
- I'm not.

606
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,746
Well, I told her that
it hasn't bothered you yet,

607
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,770
but if you see anything
that bothers you,

608
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,013
put your hands over your eyes

609
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,061
- and we'll talk about it later.
- I won't need to.

610
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,037
Will there be anything
about Lindbergh having to land

611
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,144
- the plane in that field?
- It's too soon.

612
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:02,269
That happened Thursday.

613
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:03,871
They didn't find him
until yesterday morning.

614
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:06,853
They need a couple days
to get the film to the theaters.

615
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,728
I'm sure all we'll get
is the usual 41-word

616
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:11,436
piece of film
from the Lone Ostrich

617
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,812
standing in front
of his airplane somewhere.

618
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:15,645
What's the 41-word thing?

619
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,019
That's all Lindbergh says,

620
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:19,186
a 41-word speech
about Roosevelt and war.

621
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,853
Then he gets back
on his little plane

622
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:22,061
and flies off.

623
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:26,520
...Is to preserve
American democracy

624
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:28,478
by preventing America
from taking part

625
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:33,687
in another world war.
Your choice is simple.

626
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,269
It's not between
Charles A. Lindbergh

627
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:40,019
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
It's between Lindbergh and war.

628
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:42,954
Who do you think
is going to fall for this

629
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:44,770
stupid barnstorming stunt?

630
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:52,704
The Luftwaffe,
Hitler's air force,

631
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:54,186
continuing its raids on Britain,

632
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:58,061
has decided the city of London
is a military objective.

633
00:39:58,144 --> 00:40:01,436
High explosive incendiary bombs
are dropped throughout the night

634
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,728
and many Londoners shelter in
the underground train stations.

635
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:06,728
Why is everything on fire?

636
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:08,603
The Germans bombed the city.

637
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,269
Why?

638
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,228
It's war.

639
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,853
But war is soldiers
shooting each other.

640
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:16,603
This is the new kind of war.

641
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:19,579
...German bombers and British
night fighters in the air until dawn.

642
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,812
And despite the damage,
Londoners manage,

643
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:24,269
one way or another, to endure.

644
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:33,561
Lionel, I'm... I'm flattered,
but the truth is,

645
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:36,978
I never even learned
my Hebrew letters.

646
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,103
We weren't
particularly observant,

647
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,937
especially after we lost
our grandparents.

648
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:46,395
Shouldn't you be looking
to fill this position

649
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:50,061
with somebody better versed
in... in all of this?

650
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:52,103
I mean, I can't tell you
the difference between

651
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:56,728
- the Talmud and the... Mi...
- Mishnah.

652
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,478
Well, the Mishnah is
the original oral law

653
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,812
of the Jews as collected,

654
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:07,186
and the Talmud is volumes
and volumes of rabbis

655
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,395
and sages arguing about it.

656
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:11,937
Well, we do like to argue.

657
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,228
Sadly, that's too true.

658
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:16,728
And I will confess to you
that there are times

659
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:20,103
when I look at all these books
and I wonder...

660
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,603
what it amounts to.

661
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:25,603
It certainly doesn't amount
to a good reason

662
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,061
that you can't serve
as my assistant.

663
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:34,353
Here, this is education enough.

664
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:40,687
Aristotle meets the Bible.
Maimonides.

665
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:08,061
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

666
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,436
Do you have a scarf
to match my eyes?

667
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,603
Royal blue, I would think.

668
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:19,311
Uh, royal blue number one.
Royal blue number two...

669
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,937
and number three.

670
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,645
- I would think that...
- Let's try number two.

671
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,788
You don't happen to have
any of the Lindbergh scarves,

672
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:39,895
do you?
They're all the rage now.

673
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,353
I... don't believe we do.

674
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,103
Of course not. For that,
we need to go to Smithson's.

675
00:42:46,186 --> 00:42:47,269
Right.

676
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,603
...Forces
claim the ruthless occupation

677
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:59,395
is being imposed
on every city and town.

678
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:02,395
German authorities say
they're being infiltrated

679
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:04,645
by saboteurs and agitators

680
00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:08,061
and are responding
with necessary countermeasures.

681
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:12,061
This footage smuggled out
allegedly shows German soldiers

682
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:17,978
on occupied duty, checking
papers, making arrests.

683
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:25,186
These are supposedly real
images of occupied Poland.

684
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:32,937
Behind the fighting units
come the SS elite units

685
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,812
and security police.

686
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:41,186
Then there are
the neighbor helpers.

687
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:54,853
Communists, gypsies, Jews,
and undesirables.

688
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:33,019
I'm gonna be back late tonight,
Ma.

689
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,311
Late?

690
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,561
Yeah, I'm going downtown
for dinner.

691
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:40,311
Evelyn,
why can't I meet this man?

692
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:43,228
You can, Ma. You will.

693
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:26,687
Rabbi?

694
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,269
Those who
cannot remember the past...

695
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:31,287
He'll still fund it,
but he doesn't want it...

696
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,520
...are condemned to repeat it.

697
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:38,520
And while there are many
in the ranks of labor...

698
00:45:40,144 --> 00:45:43,687
who think that war is the only
answer to fascism,

699
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:49,603
I stand with those who remember

700
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:53,019
what was said before
the last European conflict...

701
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:57,561
That war only serves

702
00:45:57,645 --> 00:46:00,228
to set working men
from fellow nations

703
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:02,728
against each other...

704
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:06,061
diminishing our ranks
and devaluing our lives

705
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,311
so that
the capitalist profiteers

706
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:11,395
reap the profits!

707
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,603
To be drawn into this fight

708
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,895
is to see
our American working class

709
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:20,770
drawn into another
brutal bloodletting,

710
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:25,687
so as to enrich our modern day
robber barons.

711
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,603
And for what?
Slogans? Patriotism?

712
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:35,436
Our country is not under attack!

713
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:40,812
John I. Lewis,
ladies and gentlemen.

714
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:47,019
I asked our next speaker
backstage

715
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,895
which language
he would give his talk in.

716
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:53,061
I had to ask;
the man speaks ten languages.

717
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,788
Lindbergh!

718
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,120
Let's
give a warm and appreciative welcome

719
00:46:57,144 --> 00:47:01,144
to Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf
of the B'nai Moshe Synagogue

720
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:03,687
- of Newark, New Jersey.
- Yep, they bought him.

721
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,690
They slipped a gold ring
through his big Jew nose

722
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,037
and now
they can lead him anywhere.

723
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,812
Listen to the man,
give him a hearing.

724
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:10,061
It's only fair.

725
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,186
Thank you.

726
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,937
I'm honored
to be here with y'all tonight.

727
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:21,478
Lindbergh!

728
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:25,645
Contrary to the
propaganda disseminated by his critics,

729
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:28,520
Charles Lindbergh,
our candidate,

730
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:32,311
did not once visit Germany
as a sympathizer

731
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:34,186
or supporter of Hitler,

732
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,061
but rather he traveled each
and every time

733
00:47:37,144 --> 00:47:40,687
as a secret adviser
to the US government.

734
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,853
Far from betraying America,
as the misguided

735
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,853
and ill-intentioned
continue to charge,

736
00:47:56,937 --> 00:48:00,311
Colonel Lindbergh has almost
single-handedly served

737
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:03,520
to strengthen America's
military preparedness

738
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:05,728
by doing everything
within his power

739
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:09,019
to advance the cause
of American aviation

740
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:12,228
and expand America's
air defenses.

741
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:14,412
- Jesus, everybody knows what he was doing...
- Hey, hey,

742
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,329
- let the great orator speak.
- I cannot believe they're

743
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:18,033
- trying to get away...
- Well, try.

744
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:21,228
What is happening
in the world today

745
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:24,103
is not America's war.

746
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:28,311
This is Europe's war.

747
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:37,728
I oppose the Nazi hoodlums'
treatment of the European Jews

748
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:41,353
with every ounce of my strength,

749
00:48:41,436 --> 00:48:43,144
and so does Colonel Lindbergh.

750
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:47,144
But how will that situation
be alleviated

751
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,937
by our own country going to war?

752
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:53,353
Tell me, President Roosevelt,
what sort of America

753
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:57,770
will the massive slaughter
of innocent American boys

754
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,561
leave in its wake?

755
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:09,812
Roosevelt for ex-president!

756
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:11,103
And further,

757
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:15,687
I'm here to crush all doubt
of the unadulterated loyalty

758
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,603
of the American Jews
to the United States of America.

759
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:22,603
And so, I offer my support

760
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,269
to the candidacy
of Colonel Lindbergh

761
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:29,228
because the political objectives
and purposes of my people

762
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:32,551
- are identical with his.
- Your people? Who the hell do you think you are, Moses?

763
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:35,353
Our religion is independent

764
00:49:35,436 --> 00:49:40,353
of any piece of land
other than this great country,

765
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,770
to which we commit
our total devotion

766
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:48,812
and allegiance
as the proudest of citizens.

767
00:49:48,895 --> 00:49:53,103
I want Charles Lindbergh
to be my president

768
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:58,978
not in spite of my being a Jew,
but because I am a Jew.

769
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:01,728
An American Jew.

770
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:05,353
Thank you.

771
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:09,728
Thank you. Thank you.

772
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:19,770
Lindbergh!
Lindbergh! Lindbergh!

773
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:29,353
Pompous son of a bitch, huh?

774
00:50:29,436 --> 00:50:32,728
Knows everything. It's a shame
he doesn't know anything else.

775
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,228
What's that mean?

776
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,603
It means the good rabbi's
getting a little too smart

777
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:37,937
for his britches.

778
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,603
Does that idiot think
one single Jew is gonna go out

779
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:43,853
and vote for this anti-Semite

780
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,937
because of that stupid
lying speech?

781
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:48,496
I mean,
what does he think he's doing?

782
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,645
Koshering Lindbergh.

783
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,520
Koshering what?

784
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,162
They didn't get him up there
to talk to Jews.

785
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,937
They didn't buy him off
for that.

786
00:50:58,478 --> 00:50:59,770
Don't you understand?

787
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:04,561
He's up there
talking to the goyim.

788
00:51:06,436 --> 00:51:09,269
He's giving all the good
Christian folks of this country

789
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:12,603
their personal rabbi's
permission to vote for Lindy

790
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:16,144
an... and not to think themselves
Nazis or... or anti-Semites.

791
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,269
Can't you see what they just got
the great Lionel Bengelsdorf to do?

792
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:30,937
Oh, my God.
Evelyn.

793
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:34,311
What?

794
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,645
They won't vote
for a man like that.

795
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,329
- But they don't want four more years of Roosevelt.
- He's a great man.

796
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:50,978
He's done a lot
for this country.

797
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:53,853
But Lindbergh looks the part.

798
00:51:53,937 --> 00:51:55,577
The... The fucking zhlubs
will give him...

799
00:51:55,603 --> 00:51:57,812
- What are you doing?
- In case we get bombed.

800
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:00,603
...are not so stupid
as to fall for this.

801
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:02,978
Look, I believe in democracy,
and on election day,

802
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:05,395
the American people
will make this right.

803
00:52:05,478 --> 00:52:07,770
They will choose the man
fit to be president.

804
00:52:07,853 --> 00:52:09,687
She has to be
a goddamn schlimazel

805
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,895
to send three gray suits
to the cleaners

806
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:13,019
at the same time.

807
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,687
You gotta have air in your head.

808
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,186
But that's who I married.

809
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,978
Did you call Fleischman's
for my cigars?

810
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:19,937
- I did not.
- Well, why the hell not?

811
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,269
You gonna open the door?

812
00:52:21,353 --> 00:52:22,353
No, I am not.

813
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,186
Go fuck yourself, Abe.

814
00:52:46,436 --> 00:52:48,061
Levin residence, this is Philip.

815
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:50,204
You're
Alvin's cousin? I'm Billy Steinheim.

816
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,812
Yes, sir,
Mr. Billy Steinheim.

817
00:52:51,895 --> 00:52:53,853
Tell your dad
Alvin quit on my father.

818
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:57,395
- You remember that?
- Yes, sir, I'll tell my dad.

819
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:58,895
Okay. Bye bye, kid.

820
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:03,853
It's still your move.

821
00:53:03,937 --> 00:53:06,228
Seldon, I have to go,
I can't play anymore.

822
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,395
- It's important.
- Can I come with you?

823
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:09,687
No, I have to go.

824
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:11,853
When can we play again?

825
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:14,937
I don't know,
I'll have to ask my mom.

826
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:17,561
Come on. Bye.

827
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:37,228
- When did he leave?
- This morning.

828
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,395
Mister Levin,
he asked me to give you this.

829
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:18,561
Just one, Rose.

830
00:54:18,645 --> 00:54:20,311
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Herman.

831
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:24,645
This is the latest.

832
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:28,978
They bombed
St. Paul's Cathedral.

833
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:34,371
The most
recent victim of their wave of destruction

834
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:36,770
is St. Paul's Cathedral,
which has stood proudly

835
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:39,895
in the city
for nearly 243 years.

836
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,353
Thankfully, only the high alter
of the church was destroyed...

837
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:46,353
Do you have any good news,
Shepsie?

838
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:56,937
And the bobby
soxers are going crazy for Frank Sinatra,

839
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:59,186
lead singer
of the Tommy Dorsey Band.

840
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:02,520
Taking the stage
for the first time on his own,

841
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:06,436
the singing sensation from
Hoboken kicked off a 17-city tour...

842
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:21,704
This year's
election is already shaping up to be

843
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:23,728
the largest turnout
in US history,

844
00:55:23,812 --> 00:55:25,937
with three million
newly registered voters

845
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:27,645
in the last month alone.

846
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:29,436
Election officials
are anticipating

847
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,520
over five million more citizens
showing up to the polls

848
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:35,537
- this year than did in 1936...
- If England and France had offered a hand

849
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:37,311
to the strong republic
of Germany,

850
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:39,520
there would be no war today.

851
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,061
If the white race is ever
seriously threatened,

852
00:55:42,144 --> 00:55:43,603
it may then be time for us

853
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:45,269
to take our part
in its protection.

854
00:55:45,353 --> 00:55:47,871
Polling
locations prepare for the record numbers.

855
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:50,978
Government officials say
there's no reason for concern.

856
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,770
Democracy will continue
its march unabated.

857
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,395
Uncle Sam made sure...

858
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,162
And here in New York,
due to the tremendous turnout,

859
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:01,520
polls will remain open
until 9:00 p.m.

860
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:03,561
So, those of you
who have not voted yet

861
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:05,770
should make your way
to the ballot box.

862
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,520
...which might
also have been written this afternoon.

863
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:19,687
I said, "In some places
in the world",

864
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,436
the tides are running
against democracy.

865
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,103
But our faith
has not been unsettled.

866
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:29,645
We believe in democracy
because of our traditions...

867
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:31,913
Where are you traveling?

868
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:33,019
Montreal.

869
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:35,436
- For business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

870
00:56:41,937 --> 00:56:44,454
Rhode Island
has already been called for Roosevelt,

871
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:46,812
the first decided state
of the night.

872
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:51,788
The polls
having closed in strategic states...

873
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:53,120
- Come inside.
- ...on the East Coast.

874
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,061
Connecticut, Alabama
and Delaware

875
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:58,228
are tallying up their final
ballots, while Massachusetts

876
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:01,186
and Maryland have both
been called for Roosevelt.

877
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:02,978
And Virginia and Kentucky...

878
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:06,395
...have given
Lindbergh his first states of the evening.

879
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:09,395
Roosevelt has picked up
his home state of New York,

880
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:12,478
while Connecticut and Georgia
are both going to Lindbergh.

881
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:15,687
What was predicted by many
to be an easy third election

882
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,478
for the president
is turning into

883
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:20,228
a suspenseful contest of wills.

884
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,436
And with Monroe County
swinging for Lindy,

885
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,853
Florida is looking
too close to call.

886
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:27,478
So, we must retract
our earlier statement

887
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:30,603
saying returns pointed
to Roosevelt taking the state.

888
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:32,770
With results coming in
from the west,

889
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:34,770
Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona

890
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:37,061
all appear to be going
to Lindbergh.

891
00:57:37,144 --> 00:57:39,937
California
and its 22 electoral votes

892
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:41,269
are still in play.

893
00:57:43,937 --> 00:57:46,186
We shall not look
at this as a defeat,

894
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:47,603
but as a right,

895
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:50,645
the right reserved to us
by our founding fathers.

896
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,829
- A yank, eh?
- The guarantee that allows for

897
00:57:52,853 --> 00:57:54,436
the will of the people
to be heard...

898
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,995
You here to fight
for King and Country?

899
00:57:56,019 --> 00:57:58,228
...to be counted,
to be advanced,

900
00:57:58,311 --> 00:57:59,937
and to be forever protected.

901
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,395
I'm here to kill Nazis.

902
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,037
And there you have it, folks.

903
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:05,812
With President Roosevelt
finally making his concession,

904
00:58:05,895 --> 00:58:08,395
Charles Lindbergh
is the unimpeded winner

905
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:10,019
of this year's
presidential election.

906
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,496
...greeting a
crowd of supporters and well-wishers

907
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,103
gathered before him
late on election night.

908
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:18,103
The 33rd President
of the United States,

909
00:58:18,186 --> 00:58:20,269
Charles Augustus Lindbergh.

910
00:58:21,228 --> 00:58:23,520
Thank you for this campaign.

911
00:58:24,436 --> 00:58:27,186
Tonight,
we have taken back America!

912
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:42,311
The goons came back
to Orange Avenue last night.

913
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:44,853
They left swastikas on whatever
they couldn't knock over.

914
00:59:47,311 --> 00:59:51,478
The president has now offered me
a new and unique opportunity.

915
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:52,853
How does it work?

916
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:56,228
It's designed for city boys
to go spend a summer

917
00:59:56,311 --> 00:59:59,603
with a farm family and integrate
into larger society.

918
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:00,728
You're not going!

919
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:02,728
You're scared of anything
you don't know.

920
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,353
Isn't that something?

921
01:00:04,436 --> 01:00:06,579
To see the American president
shaking hands with Hitler?

922
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,937
It hurts like we're
living on the edge of a knife.

923
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:12,228
My country's gone to hell.
I'm here to settle an old score.

924
01:00:12,311 --> 01:00:14,520
Thinking about leaving
before it's too late.

925
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,937
Maybe it's too early to leave,

926
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:19,228
but it's not too early
to have a back up plan.

927
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,770
This is my country.
Jew haters want a country?

928
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:24,603
They got plenty to choose from.
This one they're not getting.

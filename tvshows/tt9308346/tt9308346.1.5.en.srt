1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:03,961
Master Philip,
Don McCorkle, FBI.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,879
If you wouldn't mind,

3
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,670
I'd like to ask you
a few little questions.

4
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:11,629
So, that shithead was
an FBI agent.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,545
Tells me, "You're a red,
you're a communist.

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:14,629
You're marked."

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,503
We are planning
for the upcoming visit

8
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:18,837
of Herr von Ribbentrop,
the German minister.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,420
We would represent

10
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,712
the U.S. Department of Interior
at the dinner.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,378
We would in no way be endorsing
the Nazi policies

12
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,670
- that affect our communit...
- Can we bring Sandy?

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,462
I'm here for my son.

14
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,211
Herman, Lindbergh wants to meet
our Sandy.

15
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,295
- He's a Nazi.
- Charles Lindbergh is a hero.

16
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,003
You are a coward,

17
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:42,587
and you're dragging everyone
down with you!

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,211
Now, we open the country
to a permanent migration

19
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,295
of Jewish families.

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,545
To be clear, the Homestead Act
involves voluntary participation

21
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,128
- in the program, correct?
- How could it be otherwise?

22
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,128
Boys, your father is home.

23
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,295
You finished
your collections early.

24
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,128
Why are you always
messing with my things?

25
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,587
Sandy,
I didn't touch your things!

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,170
What's the matter?

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,712
Stay on your side.
Stay out of my stuff.

28
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,253
I didn't do it. I didn't!

29
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:37,420
Then how else did this
move over there?

30
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:40,170
- When did you get this?
- Yesterday.

31
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,253
I tried to find out more before
I rattled everyone, but...

32
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,961
it seems to be real.

33
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,253
The company's
already signed off, so...

34
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:52,003
This is my sister...
and the rabbi.

35
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:56,462
I'm no fool,
this is just revenge.

36
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,629
I saw Karl.

37
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:03,378
He said the request
that specified me

38
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:06,003
came straight from
the Newark office of the OAA.

39
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:12,170
I don't know what we can do.

40
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,253
- Hey, Dad.
- Philip, go back upstairs.

41
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,503
Bess.

42
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,837
He has a right to know.

43
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,003
Philip, where's Sandy?

44
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:23,837
In our room.

45
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,712
Sandy!

46
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:27,879
Come down.

47
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,503
I gotta dry off.

48
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,295
Come on, Alvin, let's blow.

49
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:50,670
- Settle, Shush.
- Yeah, settle where?

50
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,378
All the grifts and rackets
in Philly or Camden

51
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,629
or down in Atlantic City,
and my uncle dumps us here

52
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,378
with the spare change
and broken pieces.

53
00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:59,712
Yeah, to start.

54
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,670
He tells us to show up and do
whatever Mr. Schapp needs.

55
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,462
So... we do as we're told.

56
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,712
- Pinball Billy Schapp.
- Uh-huh.

57
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,170
Who gives a goddamn
about this shit?

58
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,629
I need a sit-down
with my uncle...

59
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,021
You had a sit-down
with your uncle,

60
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,295
and he put us here.

61
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,920
We're on the payroll.
We have nowhere to go but up,

62
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:19,670
so sit your own ass down
and show some patience.

63
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,503
Like Mack here.

64
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,879
Hey, Mack, how long you
been hauntin' this warehouse?

65
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,629
- Eleven years.
- See?

66
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,170
That's not so long.

67
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,337
I'll bet Mack gets promoted
any day now.

68
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,128
It's easy for you to make jokes,
Alvin,

69
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,503
but I had a good ride
running numbers for Abie
in Newark.

70
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:36,920
I'd still be there
if not for you.

71
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,629
No, no... if not
for Longy Zwillman, you mean.

72
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,795
Wh... Can I help it
if that asshole throws you over

73
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,003
- just for knowing me?
- It's not like I'm a red.

74
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,295
Yeah, well, me neither, Shush.

75
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,313
But I think that Lindy
and Hitler are both shitbags,

76
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:48,920
and that's close enough,
ain't it?

77
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,211
Sorry, Shush.
You got dragged, too.

78
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,879
Grab the dolly
and bring it around.

79
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,712
Mack, you got a paperclip?

80
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,045
Yeah, look over there.

81
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,170
John Gaver...

82
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,795
Said after last year's
Triple Crown, Eddie knows best.

83
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,337
No, that truck's going
to Delaware.

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,795
Come on, move, guys.

85
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:29,879
Where'd you learn that?

86
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,295
I'm from Jersey.

87
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,712
See these scratches?

88
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,003
I'm not the first
to pop this baby open.

89
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,295
Come on, Shush.

90
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,462
It so happens
that the Levin family

91
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:51,295
has been selected to be
participants in a new program,

92
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:55,211
Homestead 42. Which is...

93
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:02,253
"designed to give us
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

94
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:04,086
to move to a region of America

95
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,337
previously inaccessible
to city dwellers like us."

96
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:10,879
And once there,

97
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,503
chances are good
that we will be able

98
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,629
to afford to buy
a place of our own,

99
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:17,253
where you two will have
separate bedrooms

100
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,170
and a big backyard to play in.

101
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:24,295
On the other hand,
you will be changing schools.

102
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,961
And we will be saying goodbye
to Summit Avenue.

103
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,378
Where are we moving to?

104
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:31,003
Danville, Kentucky.

105
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,920
It's the county seat
of Boyle County.

106
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,587
I know where that is.

107
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,670
It's a town near
where the Mawhinneys live.

108
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,587
It's nice.

109
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,961
It's quite a coincidence.

110
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,670
Of all of the towns
in all of America...

111
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,170
What is the population
of Danville?

112
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:53,211
Uh, it is 6,700.

113
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:56,879
And how many Jews...
in Danville?

114
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,503
Well, they don't provide
that information, but...

115
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,920
you already know, Bess.

116
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:07,253
- Is there even a synagogue?
- A synagogue?

117
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:08,961
I'm sure there isn't a minyan.

118
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,503
- They cannot just...
- Boys.

119
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:15,754
This is a big surprise,

120
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,045
and we're all
a little dumbfounded, so...

121
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,211
Ask whatever's on your mind.

122
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,420
And never mind Evelyn,

123
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:38,170
I cannot believe the company
would do this to you.

124
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,378
With all the work that
you have done for those people,

125
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:44,545
all the hours you put in,
the effort.

126
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,545
It's not the company, Bess.

127
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,378
They're not the ones
that are forcing this.

128
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,670
They aren't?
They picked seven Jews.

129
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,629
The entire government
of the United States

130
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:55,253
is leaning on them.

131
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,545
The administration
of a popular president

132
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,961
is telling them to cooperate

133
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,545
in a new program
of national importance.

134
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,949
You think
a life insurance company

135
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:05,295
can stand up
to Charles A. Lindbergh,

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,170
the big man in a little plane?

137
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,128
We have rights.

138
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,253
Yes, we do. I can quit my job.

139
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:22,837
Short of that, the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company does

140
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,045
what the President
of the United States asks.

141
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:28,837
That's how this happens.
Everyone is afraid.

142
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:42,337
How could she?

143
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,629
I lost my head with your sister
and that goddamn rabbi.

144
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,961
This is all to punish me.

145
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:51,337
You were angry.

146
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:54,003
Your son was being pulled away.

147
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,629
I'll go see her...

148
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:04,795
apologize.

149
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,337
Don't you dare.

150
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,503
You did nothing wrong.

151
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,128
You will not apologize.

152
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,712
Who do people in Kentucky
root for?

153
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:34,211
Excuse me?

154
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:36,045
Dad and Sandy root
for the Yankees.

155
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,879
I like the Dodgers, but we could
also be Giants fans.

156
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:43,503
What's the team in Kentucky?

157
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,378
Seldon, you hungry? Can I
get you something for breakfast?

158
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,462
Oh, I just ate earlier
downstairs.

159
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:53,879
Thank you.
Philip, I'll wait for you

160
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:55,795
- on the stairs, okay?
- Mm.

161
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,795
- Morning, Seldon.
- Good morning.

162
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,295
Dad, who do they root for
in Kentucky?

163
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:05,462
Uh, baseball? Um...
Cubs or Cardinals, probably.

164
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,961
Maybe the White Sox.

165
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,795
They're all in Kentucky?

166
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,670
No, they're all
a couple states away.

167
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,587
It's the best they can do.

168
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:20,253
- What's the Klan?
- Excuse me?

169
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,378
The Cooducks Klan?

170
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,253
Ku Klux Klan.

171
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,879
Yeah. That.

172
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,712
Are they in Kentucky?

173
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,337
- No.
- Yes. They are.

174
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,503
They are in Kentucky and Ohio
and Indiana and Missouri

175
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,754
- and all over that part
of the country.
- Bess.

176
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,378
What are they?

177
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,503
They are a group
that doesn't like Negroes

178
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,712
or Jews or even Catholics.

179
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:47,961
They, uh...

180
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:50,795
They're certified idiots

181
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,295
that you don't need
to worry about, Philip.

182
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,545
But if we move to Kentucky...

183
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,128
Eat your breakfast, Philip.

184
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,003
I don't want to go.

185
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,211
Why can't we stay here?

186
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,837
Because the company
is transferring your father.

187
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,170
Why?
Did you do something wrong?

188
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,961
- No.
- Such a baby.

189
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,420
It's just a part of working
for a big company

190
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,086
like Metropolitan Life.

191
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,170
Well, it's wrong.

192
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:26,893
Yes, because everything right
with America

193
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,420
is right here
in Newark, New Jersey,

194
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,937
and everything wrong
is somewhere else.

195
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,211
Ignore him, Philip.

196
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:33,795
Until your brother learns
to be civil,

197
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,211
we will just continue
to ignore him.

198
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:41,837
Come on!

199
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,629
Okay, stop.

200
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:52,253
No, there he is.
Don't say anything stupid.

201
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,754
You got a minute, Mr. Schapp?

202
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,211
What can I do for ya, kid?

203
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,003
Uh, we're hopin' to do for you.

204
00:12:57,086 --> 00:13:00,754
Uh, Shushy and me, we just went
to six of your bars, um...

205
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:02,961
South Philly, West Philly,
Center City...

206
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,420
And I'm paying you for this?

207
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,670
Uh... maybe.

208
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,337
But that's up to you. Shush?

209
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,587
- I've seen one before.
- Look at the keyhole.

210
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,211
No, look.
You see those little scratches?

211
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:20,253
So what? They're from the key.

212
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:21,961
No, the key doesn't make
marks like that.

213
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,688
Sorry,
Mrs. Lewis isn't available.
May I take a message?

214
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:26,920
I got it.

215
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,003
Come on.

216
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,086
What are you telling me?

217
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,795
You're leakin' silver.

218
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,295
Papa, I found those invoices

219
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,295
- that you need...
- Minna.

220
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,295
Got a phone call for ya!

221
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,795
Meet the smart little macher
from Jersey

222
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,545
who's telling your old man
he's being robbed.

223
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:48,462
Alvin...

224
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,211
- Levin. Uh, sorry.
- Minna.

225
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:53,629
Pleasure.

226
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:55,879
Phone call for you! Phone call.

227
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,837
I apologize.

228
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,754
Bess, you have said nothing
for which you need to apologize.

229
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,712
Herman was understandably angry.

230
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:15,128
He was, but that's
of little moment

231
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,961
to what's happening.

232
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,337
Bess, we haven't gone
to the trouble

233
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,086
of recommending the Levins
for Homestead

234
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,003
because of any dispute
between us.

235
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:29,337
I'm not so petty as that,
and neither is your sister.

236
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,337
Please. Don't do this.

237
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,754
Herman has worked a long time
in New Jersey,

238
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,128
working his way up
at Metropolitan Life,

239
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,295
he knows these neighborhoods,
he has regular clients.

240
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,378
- Bess.
- And our boys are happy
at their school.

241
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:54,462
They've come up year after year
with the same classmates.

242
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:57,045
- Please, Bess...
- And when we are gone,

243
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:58,795
Evelyn will regret this.

244
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:02,211
As angry and hurt as she is now,

245
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,045
she will have sent away
her only sister

246
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:08,670
and her nephews, who she loves
and who love her.

247
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,187
And there will be no way
to repair...

248
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:15,253
Bess, your sister realizes
that this is an opportunity.

249
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,879
You will not be set back
in the slightest.

250
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,378
You'll be given
a government stipend

251
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,378
to cover the cost of the move,

252
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,253
and with Herman's salary intact,

253
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:25,754
the cost of housing
and other living expenses

254
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:30,003
are such in Kentucky that
you will soon be homeowners

255
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,170
and saving off
your every paycheck.

256
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:34,503
We have enough money.

257
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:37,253
And the personal growth inherent
in getting your children

258
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,754
out of the insulated culture
of Weequahic?

259
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:40,961
Insulated?

260
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,754
- We are Jews.
- As am I.

261
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:47,462
We are comfortable living
among other Jews.

262
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:50,920
And I am comfortable living
anywhere in this country

263
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:52,045
with anyone.

264
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,128
And isn't that...

265
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,837
the purpose of this program?

266
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:04,462
In fact, isn't that the essence
of the American experiment?

267
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:09,170
Our family is an experiment
to you, Rabbi?

268
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:11,545
Sit.

269
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,545
Bess...

270
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:21,420
Your family was also selected

271
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,503
because Herman has come to
the attention of law enforcement

272
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,378
for sheltering a young man
who went overseas

273
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:32,045
in violation
of the neutrality laws.

274
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,587
Now, this move...

275
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,629
will do much to mollify the FBI

276
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:42,003
and their current concern
about the Levins.

277
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:47,253
It's true, Bess.

278
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:51,545
In so... many ways,

279
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:56,045
what is happening here
is for your own good.

280
00:16:58,253 --> 00:16:59,920
And in three months...

281
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,754
you will be writing
your sister from Kentucky

282
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:06,754
to thank her for opening
a new world to you.

283
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,253
You will see.

284
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:15,170
Above all, you and your children

285
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:18,670
are always welcome in my home
anytime.

286
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:23,211
In fact, Evelyn and I hope
to see you all at the wedding.

287
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,462
And my husband?

288
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:33,295
I'm sure he and I
will speak again.

289
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,503
I'll meet you
wherever you wanna go...

290
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,253
the place just right
around the corner.

291
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,920
You're gonna need
some form of identification.

292
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:16,378
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

293
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:19,337
Yes, Mr. Elia.

294
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,295
Right, I understand
what you're saying...

295
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,545
because we don't
have enough information.

296
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,920
But we need to
have the documents.

297
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,961
Aunt Evelyn!

298
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:33,754
Oh my God, Philip!
I am so happy to see you.

299
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,086
This is Leroy.
This is my nephew Philip.

300
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,420
Pleased to meet you.

301
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:38,795
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

302
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:43,253
Let me look at you.
You have grown at least an inch.

303
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:46,003
Did you come from school.
Is your mom with you?

304
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,961
I came by myself. On the bus.

305
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,170
All the way downtown?

306
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,420
I'm impressed.

307
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:58,629
Come on. Let me show you
this way into my office.

308
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,128
Got it.

309
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:02,503
In here.

310
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,920
Can you keep a secret?

311
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,378
Oh. Yes!

312
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,211
I went alone
to the Newsreel Theatre

313
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:13,587
to see you at the White House.

314
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,378
What was it like to eat dinner
with the president?

315
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,462
Well...

316
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:21,545
This is the reception line.

317
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,253
On your way to a state dinner,

318
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,420
the guests file past
the president

319
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:26,795
and the first lady,

320
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,795
and when you're introduced,
they photograph you,

321
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,170
and then the White House
sends this to you.

322
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,337
Russ! Line two.

323
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Did the president say anything?

324
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,503
He said, "It's very nice
to have you here."

325
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:40,961
Did you say anything back?

326
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,712
I said, "It's an honor,
Mr. President."

327
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:46,462
I saw you dancing
in the newsreel.

328
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:49,003
Yes, I did dance.

329
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:52,670
Evelyn Finkel of Dewey Street
at the White House.

330
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,795
Isn't it unbelievable?

331
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,295
Sure is.

332
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,420
Aunt Evelyn...

333
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,253
Do you know that we're moving
to Kentucky?

334
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,420
Uh-huh.

335
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:09,795
No thanks.

336
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,462
I don't want to go, Aunt Evelyn.

337
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,795
I wanna stay at my school.

338
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,253
Who sent you here, Philip?

339
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,128
Sent me? Nobody.

340
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,587
You can tell me the truth.

341
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:28,295
Nobody sent me.

342
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:33,128
Can't Seldon and his mother go
instead of us?

343
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:37,211
Seldon? Is that the boy
from downstairs?

344
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,712
His father died.

345
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:42,587
His father also worked
for the Metropolitan Life

346
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,337
until he got sick.

347
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,295
And now,
his mother works there, too.

348
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:50,378
How come we have to go
to Kentucky and they don't?

349
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,795
Did you father send you here,
Philip?

350
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:55,170
Nobody evens knows I'm here.

351
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:59,045
Please send Seldon to Kentucky
and not us.

352
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,337
Philip...

353
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:09,128
You can't go through life

354
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:12,587
being afraid of things
that are unfamiliar to you.

355
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,587
I mean, suppose I'd been afraid
of going to the White House

356
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,128
or of meeting
the foreign minister?

357
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:24,754
Hey. I don't want you to grow up

358
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:27,170
and be frightened
like your parents.

359
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,170
You won't do that, will you?
You promise me you won't?

360
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,545
- Not you, huh, Marty?
- Not me.

361
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,503
And it's not like
I'm foolin' anyone

362
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,295
with the last name of Lefkowitz.

363
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:42,837
So, who did I piss off?

364
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:45,545
Montana?

365
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,795
- You're kidding me.
- Missoula, Montana.

366
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,712
Compared to that,
Kentucky's gonna feel like

367
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,670
you're working
the Manhattan office.

368
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:54,128
This is so fucked up.

369
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,128
How does a government tell
a private company

370
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,920
where to send its employees
based on their religion?

371
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,629
It's no help to Met Life.

372
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,688
Who's gonna do a better job
of selling and collecting

373
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,837
on policies to Jewish families
than you guys?

374
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,295
Or the colored?
You guys do better

375
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:07,646
in the colored neighborhoods
than anyone.

376
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,879
I'm sure the cowboys in Missoula
will love Sy Hershberg

377
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:13,587
making his home
where the buffalo roam.

378
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:18,045
I almost forgot,
I have a treat for you.

379
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,420
It's an after-dinner chocolate,

380
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,879
a chocolate wrapped
in gold paper.

381
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:26,545
And see what's on it?
That's the presidential seal.

382
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,337
It's what's waiting for you
on the tables

383
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,587
at the White House.

384
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,420
When I saw it, I thought,
"Who is the boy I wanna make

385
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:35,587
most happy in the whole world?"
Here.

386
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:46,754
Seldon's last name is Wishnow,
right?

387
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:49,587
- That's right.
- And he's your best friend?

388
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:56,462
- What'd he say?
- He said one more week.

389
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,003
You sure you don't got
the shell shock?

390
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:27,920
My dad got it from the war.

391
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:30,128
Ma said he was never right
in the head again.

392
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,920
Head's fine, Shush.
It's my leg.

393
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:36,378
I don't know, Alvin. I saw ya
eyeballin' that little mouse.

394
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:37,462
- That mouse?
- Yeah.

395
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,063
You're talking
about the boss' daughter.

396
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:41,170
I don't care if she's
Pharaoh's daughter,

397
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,378
she's not for me.

398
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,146
Besides, you already made
a splash with that thing

399
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,295
- about the coinboxes.
- Trust me, Shush.

400
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,879
I know what I'm doin'.

401
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:58,337
Damn!

402
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:01,420
All that walkin' yesterday

403
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,295
broke down
the fucking stump again.

404
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,795
I sure miss Philip.

405
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:12,170
He figured out how to wrap
the bandage so tight.

406
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,503
Better than the Canadian nurses
ever fucking did.

407
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,378
That little pisher.

408
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,295
Please
justify the increased spending

409
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,462
on the considerable resources
it took to move them...

410
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:33,712
Secretary, apologies. The trains
are all delayed this morning,

411
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:36,003
a problem on the tracks
in Baltimore.

412
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,295
Not to worry, Rabbi.

413
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:39,670
We tabled the reports
on Just Folks and Homestead

414
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,045
until you arrived,
and Mr. Stedman here

415
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,795
was just concluding
the quarterly reports

416
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,359
on Park Service
and Fish and Wildlife.

417
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
I'll just conclude
by referring everyone

418
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:48,961
to the quarterly status reports,

419
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:51,211
uh, for licensing and parkgoing,

420
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:52,735
which show us as staying
in the black

421
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,211
through the third quarter.

422
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:56,961
Here, here.

423
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,920
Rabbi, you have the floor.

424
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,503
Well, I won't waste
anyone's time

425
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,879
on what is working well...

426
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,337
because what is working well

427
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,211
requires considerably
less attention,

428
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:11,253
and the Just Folks program
is a national success.

429
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,003
Voluntary participation
now involves

430
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:19,920
more than 8,000 teenage boys
in 34 states,

431
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:22,545
and the numbers are growing.
This summer,

432
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:26,961
we may see increased enrollment
of more than 50 percent.

433
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:30,712
City youth are being connected
to the values

434
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,670
and authenticity
of the heartland.

435
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,920
Cheers.

436
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,170
On the other hand,
I would be remiss

437
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:43,086
if I claimed that Homestead 42,

438
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,337
as the second phase
of the president's initiative

439
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,754
to absorb American Jewry
into the mainstream,

440
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:53,337
has found similar favor.

441
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,587
- There are problems?
- There are.

442
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,503
The fact that the program
is not truly voluntary

443
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:02,378
has led
to some considerable dissent.

444
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:05,587
This was anticipated. We sought
to overcome any skepticism

445
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,462
by ensuring
that the transfers came

446
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,170
with fundamental
economic incentives,

447
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:15,712
but thus far, what Congress
has approved is only a stipend

448
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:17,712
to cover the cost of the moving.

449
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,003
Salary increases
for transferred families

450
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,295
were omitted from the bill...

451
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,712
We can hardly expect
a Republican Congress

452
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:27,086
to pass legislation that has
government mandating raises

453
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,837
for private employees
just because their companies

454
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,462
transfer them
to different posts.

455
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,253
- Right.
- But without that...

456
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:35,128
And speaking as a businessman,

457
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,253
I can hardly expect
private companies

458
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,587
to pay employees more

459
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,920
for doing the same jobs
at new locations.

460
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,712
But Secretary Ford, sir,

461
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:45,961
absent an actual
economic incentive,

462
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:48,712
what we are then asking
of these families

463
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:52,295
is to accept
an involuntary transfer

464
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,128
to another city or town
with no benefit to them.

465
00:26:56,211 --> 00:26:57,629
Involuntary in what sense?

466
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,587
Well, we're moving them
and they get nothing,

467
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,420
save for the fact
that their salaries

468
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:04,295
go a little further
in more rural economies.

469
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:05,670
Well, that's meaningful.

470
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,420
- Secretary, sir, I was told...
- Rabbi.

471
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,086
When I build an auto plant,

472
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,128
- I build it where I want.
- Right.

473
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,003
And if the workers
want those jobs,

474
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:15,378
they come to my plant.

475
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,045
Or they don't.

476
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:20,961
Now, if the Jewish people
want to keep these jobs,

477
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:22,629
they have the opportunity

478
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:25,003
to move to where the jobs
will now be.

479
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:26,879
Or not.

480
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,462
That seems voluntary to me.

481
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,128
I'm telling you,
this guy's right hand...

482
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:41,378
- Go on.
- Hey, Mack.

483
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,295
These?

484
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,879
- Yeah, that's all of 'em.
- Yeah?

485
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:47,128
No, no, no, I got it!

486
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,003
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- What?

487
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,795
- Oh.
- Uh...

488
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,128
- Where's it go?
- To the, uh, the office.

489
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:55,670
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

490
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:57,337
Oh, geez.
Are you okay with that?

491
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,754
I'm fine.
It's just every now and then...

492
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:01,670
I just forget
that I'm a cripple.

493
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:03,837
Oh. I don't think
you're a cripple.

494
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,378
Oh. That's sweet.

495
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:10,837
But, um... when my stump
breaks down, I'm a cripple.

496
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,503
What do you mean it breaks down?

497
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,837
- Uh...
- What... You... you got it?

498
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,337
Yeah, yeah, no, I got it.
Uh...

499
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,003
Every now and then,
if I overdo things,

500
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:21,503
it gets swole, and then the...
prosthetic doesn't fit right,

501
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:23,347
and then it gets more swole,
and it's just...

502
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,503
- 'round and 'round like that.
- Yeah.

503
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:29,503
Yeah. You... You should soak
your stump in Epsom salt.

504
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:31,754
It makes the skin tough.

505
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,503
- Yeah.
- Epsom salt.

506
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,086
I'm gonna go to the power room.

507
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,211
These are a little bit higher.

508
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,045
Boys not home from school yet?

509
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:41,003
School just let out.

510
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,086
My bus must've been early.

511
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:45,086
Bess.

512
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,879
Where exactly is the company
sending you in Kentucky?

513
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,462
- Danville, near Lexington.
- Danville...

514
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:55,837
In today's mail.

515
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,271
Why would they send two of us

516
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:01,961
to the same little town
in Kentucky?

517
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:05,629
Why send me at all?
I'm not a Met Life agent.

518
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:06,795
My husband was.

519
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,754
I'm drawing on his pension
and insurance

520
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:11,795
and working part-time
in the regional office.

521
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,420
Why bother with me at all?

522
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,307
The one thing I can think,
the one blessing,

523
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:22,003
is that Seldon and Philip
will still get to be together.

524
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,337
At least there's that.

525
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:31,086
The first thing will be
to apply for an injunction

526
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,045
in U.S. District Court

527
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:35,170
to see if we can stop
the transfers

528
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,420
while the case is adjudicated.

529
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,420
Because that will take a while.

530
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:40,920
What are our chances?

531
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:43,045
Well, better if we go in
with plaintiffs

532
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:46,378
from a variety
of New Jersey corporations.

533
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:49,086
You three will be suing
for relief from Met Life,

534
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,545
but I'd like to dig up
plaintiffs from Hess Oil,

535
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,378
Prudential,
as many of the other companies

536
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,211
that are cooperating
with the OAA.

537
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,629
How long might that take?

538
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,920
Give me a week before I file.

539
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,712
If we sue, can Met Life
go hard at us?

540
00:30:02,795 --> 00:30:03,961
Could we be fired?

541
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,211
I can't prevent your company
from being punitive

542
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:07,837
if they want to be punitive.

543
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:11,128
In the event that we prevail
in court,

544
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:14,211
they would be liable for damages
if they go that way.

545
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,920
If we prevail.

546
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,961
Any lawyer who claims
a guaranteed outcome

547
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,086
in a civil action
is a liar, Mr. Levin.

548
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,670
I'm out.

549
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:28,670
I'm in.

550
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,253
Fuck Montana.

551
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,545
In.

552
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,795
This is still America,
and I want my day in court.

553
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,629
Glad you're with me, Sy.

554
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:47,378
Levin.

555
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,045
What now?

556
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:54,670
You've failed to contact
the OAA field office

557
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,879
and confirm your transfer plans.

558
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,629
If you want to keep your job
at Met Life,

559
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:02,545
the deadline's this week.
Why wait?

560
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,920
I dunno.
Keeps slipping my mind.

561
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,879
How's your nephew doing?

562
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:11,587
We haven't seen him around
lately.

563
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,920
- Limping right along, I'm sure.
- We done here?

564
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,545
Have a fine evening.

565
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,128
But if I was you...

566
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:24,754
I'd save the time and money
taking things to court,

567
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,670
and I'd report to OAA.

568
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:44,337
Sandy.

569
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:47,712
Is Philip with you?

570
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,712
No, he's outside playing.

571
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:51,961
Good. I wanted to talk to you
alone.

572
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,211
What did I do now?

573
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,587
You knew your aunt
was sending us to Kentucky.

574
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,128
You knew before your father
even opened that letter.

575
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,920
Don't lie to me,
I know you knew.

576
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,337
I'm not lying to you.

577
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,211
Okay.

578
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:10,879
But you did know, right?

579
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,795
Aunt Ev said
it was for own good,

580
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,503
that she was protecting us.

581
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,920
Protecting us from what?

582
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,754
She said we were already
in enough trouble

583
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,003
from the government.

584
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:24,187
Because of Alvin, because of him
coming to live with us

585
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,337
after being in the war.

586
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:28,879
And what did you tell her?

587
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,920
Did you tell her Seldon
is Philip's friend?

588
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:35,961
No, I... I don't think Philip
even likes Seldon all that much.

589
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:39,128
Well, someone said something
because now the company

590
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:41,795
is transferring the Wishnows
to Danville as well.

591
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,629
Mom, it wasn't me.

592
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,211
So...

593
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:05,086
We've started modifying
the coin boxes.

594
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,545
And at some cost.
Meaning I hope you're right,

595
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:10,545
and I hope like hell
I see a profit.

596
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:12,045
I am, and you will.

597
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:14,837
Is that all you're gonna do?

598
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,086
What do you mean, kid?

599
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,462
Well, they've been
robbing you for years.

600
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:21,503
So they should all pay.
Jack up the price.

601
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:23,420
A Lincoln per pinball
and vending machine,

602
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,754
a Hamilton on each slot.

603
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,837
Ain't that easy, kid.

604
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,086
I raise the rent,
and they'll kick up a stink.

605
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,754
Then make an example
of one of them.

606
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:39,503
I'm not into rough stuff.

607
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,420
And if I go to Margulis
and cry help,

608
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:43,712
he'll have to get the okay
from Waxey Gordon.

609
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,920
And then, both of them will take
a bite out of my ass

610
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:48,170
for making it happen.
That's how things work.

611
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:50,086
Just point to the mutt
with the loudest mouth.

612
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,545
Me and Shush'll do the rest.

613
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:55,337
My take goes up, I still gotta
ante up to Margulis and Gordon.

614
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,503
Yeah, but now,
you got the whole pie,

615
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:00,211
so how you slice it
is up to you. Farshteyn?

616
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,920
You don't rattle, kid.

617
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,295
Let me give it a little thought.

618
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:13,795
I see you
sniffin' around my daughter.

619
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:16,462
Is that a problem?

620
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,961
You got intentions?

621
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,961
It's too soon to know.

622
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,879
Well, that's it for now

623
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:27,438
from the editorial room
of the Jergens Journal

624
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,128
and yours truly,
Walter Winchell.

625
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:30,754
That's a month.

626
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:33,170
And not one word
about Homestead 42.

627
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:36,086
God, I hope they haven't
bought him off.

628
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,295
I'm sure they haven't.

629
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:39,086
He still attacked Lindbergh
and Wheeler.

630
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,629
Yeah, I know, but still.

631
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:54,670
What are you doing?

632
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:56,754
I'm gonna write to him.

633
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,712
Tell him we need him
to speak out.

634
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,229
I mean, the government
telling companies

635
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:02,646
where people of this race,
that religion,

636
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,295
where they can and can't work?

637
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:06,503
You let them get away with that,
what's next?

638
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:07,879
That's how fascism works.

639
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:13,795
You're sitting there,
writing to Winchell?

640
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:18,503
- Walter Winchell?
- Yes, I am!

641
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:20,920
And you're predicting

642
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:22,754
that these people
will stop at nothing

643
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:25,128
once they know what they can get
away with,

644
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:26,587
and yet, you don't think

645
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,170
they can do what they want
to the mail?

646
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,837
Come on, Bess, it's one letter.

647
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,211
It's not just one letter.

648
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,086
You're also planning
to sue the government.

649
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,128
As you said, we have rights.

650
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:39,337
How can you see
what these people are

651
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,879
and have so little sense
of what they are capable of?

652
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:46,337
We have already had FBI agents
harassing us,

653
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,712
we have had our children
questioned!

654
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:54,462
Let someone else
write to Winchell.

655
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:55,961
Someone else?

656
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:58,378
- The next guy?
- Yeah.

657
00:35:58,462 --> 00:36:00,253
Let the next guy step up.

658
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,003
And I just sit here on my ass?

659
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:04,545
Keeping quiet,
waiting for the worst to happen?

660
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,879
No. I don't see Shepsie
sitting around

661
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:09,211
writing letters,
waiting for the worst to happen.

662
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:11,795
- Not Canada again.
- Yes, Canada.

663
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,086
This is my country!

664
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,503
Not anymore! It is Lindbergh's.

665
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:19,378
It is the Jew haters'.
It is the America Firsters'.

666
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:23,253
It is the people who chase
children down the street,

667
00:36:23,337 --> 00:36:24,629
asking questions,

668
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:27,462
and then deport
their families to Kentucky.

669
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,545
It's their country.

670
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,128
And if we run? If we quit?

671
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,629
Then they win.
And they do not get to win.

672
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,545
- Herman.
- We have done nothing wrong.

673
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:59,837
Mrs. Lindbergh.

674
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,795
I just wanted
to congratulate you personally,

675
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,503
as the president and I
will regrettably not be there

676
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:05,587
on the day.

677
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,045
Oh, so kind...

678
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:09,187
As it happens, we'll be flying
down to Caracas that week

679
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,670
for
the Pan-American Conferences,

680
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:13,295
but it was kind of you
to favor us with an invitation.

681
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,670
Oh, not at all.

682
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,754
You both have
our very best wishes.

683
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:21,712
Rabbi,
I'm sure we will talk further.

684
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:23,712
I'm sure. Thank you.

685
00:37:23,795 --> 00:37:25,086
Thank you.

686
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:26,920
Thank you.

687
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,045
Well, that was unexpected.

688
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,712
Yes, when she heard
you were outside,

689
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:39,420
she wanted to
give her regrets personally.

690
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:42,086
Oh, so kind. She's so gracious.

691
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,086
- Mm-hmm.
- And did you see the president?

692
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,170
I did not,
but as you can surmise,

693
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:49,045
I had a good bit of time
with the First Lady.

694
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,086
And as I suspected,
the opportunity

695
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,961
to push more funding
through Congress

696
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:57,086
will have to wait until
after the midterm elections.

697
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,337
What would appear to be
salary bonuses

698
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,045
for relocating Jewish citizens
are...

699
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:05,128
for rather obvious reasons,

700
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:08,587
politically untenable
before then.

701
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,503
But the promise I made
to people will be kept.

702
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,420
I am assured.

703
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,462
As you know,
we applied for an injunction

704
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,961
in US District Court.
Unfortunately, we were denied.

705
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,503
But, as we drew
a conservative judge,

706
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:24,503
I saw merit
in immediately appealing

707
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:26,462
to the Third Circuit.

708
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,086
How long will the appeal take?

709
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,045
I will do what I can
to expedite on my end,

710
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:33,503
but the reality is,
at least a year.

711
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:50,128
There's only so much I can bring
on this first trip down.

712
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:51,629
Once you're settled, we can send

713
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:54,128
the things
you don't have room for.

714
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:56,629
Or, when we come, we can bring
some of your things.

715
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,503
I suspect Herman's going to hire
a moving company.

716
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:01,837
Herman's made the decision?

717
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,587
Not yet. But for all his years
at Metropolitan Life,

718
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,128
I don't see him walking away.

719
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:11,420
And you? What do you think?

720
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:13,920
What do I think?

721
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,211
Does it matter what I think?

722
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:20,795
More and more, he yells.
He doesn't talk.

723
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:25,378
If he wants to fight, he fights,

724
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:28,545
and if he wants to quit,
he quits.

725
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:38,211
And the powerful Russian offense

726
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,045
pushes back against
the German assault

727
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,211
on the Crimea.

728
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,086
Finally, the Russians learned
how to fight.

729
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,295
They stopped them outside
of Moscow in December.

730
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,629
- Remember that?
- That was the winter.

731
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,879
Either way...

732
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:53,003
the Russians are the only ones
making it hard on Hitler.

733
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,253
The British, too, in Egypt.

734
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:56,961
It's a sideshow.

735
00:39:57,045 --> 00:40:00,253
That's a couple of divisions
running around the desert.

736
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:02,712
The Russians are making
the bastards bleed. Thank God.

737
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:04,837
And back beyond
the invasion's starting line

738
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
of three years ago.

739
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:08,211
Herman, we gotta get outta here.
All of us.

740
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,545
The Soviet
Separate Coastal Army sweeps in

741
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:12,837
and takes back
the ancient city of Kerch.

742
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,170
You sure you got enough room?

743
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,712
Car's already packed
to the brim.

744
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:20,211
You, Estelle, and the kids
need to fit in there somewhere.

745
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,337
We'll manage.

746
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,420
Oh, Herman. Uh, Benjamin here's
gonna be taking over for me.

747
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,337
Happy to meet ya.
Can I, uh, give you a hand?

748
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,587
No, no, no.
You stay and mind the store.

749
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,086
Marching in this haul here
are Germans and Romanians.

750
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,211
They surrender easily
and completely,

751
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:39,462
with their weapons...

752
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,086
So. Winnipeg.

753
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,961
Yeah, it's quite a trek.

754
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:48,045
Estelle is putting the youngest
in his pajamas

755
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,754
so we can drive
right through the first night,

756
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:53,211
get over the border
before we stop.

757
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:56,045
My brother says Winnipeg's nice.

758
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:57,961
He's an idiot,
but that's what he says.

759
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:01,295
Seriously, though, Herman...

760
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,503
you gotta think about things.
If you go to Kentucky,

761
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,378
you don't know
what you're getting into.

762
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,128
And if you don't go,
if you refuse...

763
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:10,003
Then the Cossacks come for me.

764
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:12,378
They came.

765
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:14,187
When Alvin was staying with you,
didn't they?

766
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:16,629
They questioned you, the kids.

767
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,920
They leaned on your brother
until Alvin was gone.

768
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,712
Yes, Herman, there are Cossacks.

769
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:25,086
There are. They're out there.

770
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:37,837
Travel safe, friend.

771
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,795
Next year, in Jerusalem.

772
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:44,503
- Or Saskatchewan.
- You mean Manitoba.

773
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,086
Nu, there's a difference?

774
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:10,795
Oh.
Can I see?

775
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,128
No, not yet.

776
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,587
You're so serious.

777
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,462
Look.

778
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:39,462
Wow. This is...

779
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,253
It's beautiful.

780
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:57,587
I don't want to go to Kentucky.

781
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:03,587
Do you want to go to Kentucky?

782
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,795
No.

783
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,855
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. America,
and all the ships at sea.

784
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,587
Let's go to press.

785
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,587
Flash. The phony moniker
for phase one

786
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,462
of organized Jewish persecution
in the land of the free

787
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:19,545
is Homestead 42.

788
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:21,146
- Give 'em hell, Walter.
- Aided and abetted

789
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,086
by the most respectable
of America's robber barons.

790
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,003
Item: 225 Jewish families
have been told

791
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:29,211
to vacate their homes
in America's northeast cities

792
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:32,378
in order to be shipped
hundreds of miles
from family and friends.

793
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:35,045
This first shipment has been
kept strategically small

794
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:37,754
so as to escape
national attention. Why?

795
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:40,837
Because it marks the beginning
of second-class citizenship,

796
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,670
if not outright persecution,

797
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:45,587
for the four and a half million
American citizens
of Jewish descent.

798
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,587
That lying prick.
How can you listen to that shit?

799
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,545
- This is the great US of A...
- Not in this house!

800
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,879
Instituting illegal actions
against its natural-born

801
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:57,462
and naturalized citizens.

802
00:43:57,545 --> 00:43:59,378
And who's next,
Mr. and Mrs. America,

803
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:02,420
now that the Bill of Rights is
no longer the law of the land?

804
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:04,420
And who's next
under the Wheeler-Ford plan

805
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:06,170
for government-funded removals?

806
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:09,545
The long-suffering Negroes?
The hard-working Italians?

807
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:11,170
The last of the Mohicans?

808
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:13,211
- Stay with me...
- Good night, Mr. Winchell,

809
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:16,211
and good luck
finding a new career.

810
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:17,920
Why do you say so?

811
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:20,253
Because that guttersnipe
just accused me

812
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:22,462
of persecuting my own people,

813
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:25,420
of making them
second-class citizens.

814
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:27,337
Well, he didn't name you.

815
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,920
He slandered my program.

816
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,879
Well, what are you gonna do?

817
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,629
Well, it's been a while

818
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:37,587
since I've written a sermon
from scratch,

819
00:44:38,587 --> 00:44:40,086
but at this moment...

820
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:42,795
I feel the fire.

821
00:44:44,086 --> 00:44:46,086
A sermon? For Saturday?

822
00:44:47,587 --> 00:44:48,754
For tomorrow.

823
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:52,295
And a newspaper page
is going to be my pulpit.

824
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:57,587
Are you sure, boychik?

825
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:01,754
Yeah. I made up my mind.

826
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,920
Then, geviss.

827
00:45:06,045 --> 00:45:07,086
It's done.

828
00:45:08,253 --> 00:45:11,295
You change your clothes,
be there by nine.

829
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,128
Hey, Monty...

830
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,295
thanks.

831
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:22,503
This is family.

832
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:41,629
They're putting them in for ya.

833
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,295
This one going
to Secaucus or not?

834
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,629
Aw, shit.

835
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:56,587
Soak 'em in Epsom salt.
That'll toughen 'em up.

836
00:45:58,837 --> 00:46:03,211
Saul, my brother's been wearin'
a suit too long. You got soft.

837
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:06,670
Come on. It's my first day,
don't bust balls.

838
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:10,646
- Thanks for taking me on.
- All right. Come on, come on.

839
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,670
You smell like tomatoes.

840
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:14,462
Hey, will you get yourself
some gloves?

841
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:16,629
- This is goodbye.
- All right...

842
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:18,879
- Goodbye, Selma.
- Thank you.

843
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:20,670
Write when you get there.
Please write.

844
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,253
I will write
as soon as I'm settled.

845
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,378
- Drive safely.
- I will.

846
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,170
Seldon. Goodbye. We'll miss you.

847
00:46:32,795 --> 00:46:34,503
Don't forget to stop and eat.

848
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,420
Please take care.

849
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:42,462
- Goodbye.
- Wait!

850
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:43,795
Mom, make them wait.

851
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:46,021
- Philip, what are you doing?
- Wait! Just make them wait!

852
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:48,003
What in the world?
Is he all right?

853
00:47:07,378 --> 00:47:10,128
Philip!
You don't have to do that.

854
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:11,378
Yes. Take it.

855
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:14,003
Take it!

856
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,587
- Thank you, Philip.
- Thank you.

857
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:34,712
All right, c'mon, let's go!

858
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:37,503
Do you just
take the leg off first?

859
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:39,587
What, you want him to go
lopsided on you?

860
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,754
I'm just askin'. I never been
with a one-legged guy before.

861
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:45,045
Hey! I still got two.

862
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,211
I mean, used to be three,
but you know...

863
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,587
- After you.
- Thank you.

864
00:47:57,086 --> 00:47:58,503
You got somethin'
to drink at home?

865
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,337
If you buy me a bottle, I do.

866
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,670
These fucking guys.

867
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,086
Ooh! One ain't enough.

868
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,879
Well, you assholes
can't leave a guy alone

869
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:06,128
for a minute, can you?

870
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:08,961
Are we goin' or what?

871
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:14,837
What's that all about?

872
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:18,086
Fucking G-men.

873
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:21,879
Always lookin'
for another pound of flesh.

874
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:24,754
Mazel tov!

875
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,337
Poor hands.

876
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,462
They'll toughen up.

877
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:20,754
I'm gonna clean up,
hit the sack.

878
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:22,837
You want me to fix you a plate?

879
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,545
No, Bess.
I just need some sleep.

880
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:33,961
Sandy.

881
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:36,003
- How are you?
- Okay.

882
00:49:36,795 --> 00:49:37,837
Good.

883
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:39,754
Wake me up in an hour.

884
00:49:39,837 --> 00:49:41,378
I've decided
I'm gonna go see Winchell.

885
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:46,378
Herman.
Herman, please.

886
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:48,503
Not now, Bess.

887
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:50,920
For my sake.

888
00:50:00,503 --> 00:50:01,629
What's the matter?

889
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,587
Why didn't we just go
to Kentucky?

890
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,754
Because your father felt
it was the wrong place

891
00:50:08,837 --> 00:50:10,545
for you and your brother
to grow up.

892
00:50:10,629 --> 00:50:12,587
That's crazy.
I went to Kentucky.

893
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,837
The Mawhinneys don't hate Jews.

894
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,629
But there are others who do...

895
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:21,420
and this, Sandy, is our home.

896
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:30,187
I wouldn't wanna
have you as my enemy.

897
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:31,587
Me neither.

898
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,313
Not half a day after your piece
in The Times,

899
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:35,503
and Walter Winchell
is out of a job.

900
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:38,587
Can you believe he then had
the unmitigated gall

901
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:43,003
to climb up on a soap box
in Union Square the next night

902
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:45,378
and announce he would run
for president?

903
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:48,337
- What a farce.
- A radio provocateur

904
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,170
- against Charles Lindbergh.
- Lindy's a hero.

905
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:54,420
And two years out
from the election.
- Hmm.

906
00:50:54,503 --> 00:50:55,863
We aren't even
at the midterms yet.

907
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,754
- It's ridiculous.
- Nuts.

908
00:50:57,837 --> 00:50:59,378
Well, here we go!

909
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,837
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

910
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:08,837
Hey!

911
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:10,503
Hey!

912
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:11,961
Hey!

913
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:26,712
Don't do this.

914
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,295
What are you saying, Bess?

915
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,003
I can't stand up
for what I believe?

916
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:33,086
They burned him in effigy
on Long Island last night.

917
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,795
The Bund showed up,
they're making threats.

918
00:51:35,879 --> 00:51:37,503
You want me to run and hide,
Bess?

919
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,045
Rabbi.

920
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:01,462
It's a glorious night.
Mazel tov.

921
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:03,629
Can you spare just a moment?

922
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:05,032
Of course,
there's always a moment

923
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:07,670
for the synagogue officers.
What can I do for you?

924
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:09,295
Oh, nothing tonight, of course.

925
00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:11,545
Tonight belongs to you
and your bride, but...

926
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,545
if it's possible
to meet with you

927
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:15,629
before you return to Washington?

928
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,420
Oh, what's the matter?

929
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:19,503
It's just that the membership...

930
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:21,420
We've been shedding
some families.

931
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:24,378
More than 100
in the last few months.

932
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:26,795
They're been complaints
about your political involvement

933
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:28,754
and a feeling on the part
of some...

934
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:30,837
Gentlemen,
this is my wedding night.

935
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,187
-Yes, of course...
-And whatever problems
you think you have

936
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:35,670
with congregants
who differ in their views,

937
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:39,253
I can assure you that there are
more prospective members

938
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:41,128
who will be joining our shul

939
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,754
as a result of my work
with the government.

940
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:46,961
Now, I will thank you to leave
the rest of the evening

941
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:48,211
to its purposes.

942
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:15,420
Good to see ya, Fred.
Harry. Peter.

943
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:32,003
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. America!

944
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,337
First of all...

945
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,879
First of all, pay no attention

946
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:42,545
to Mr. Hoover's men
over on my left...

947
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:45,045
- with their cameras
and their dark suits

948
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:47,337
and their intimidating tactics.

949
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,837
Because this is not Berlin,
and they are not the Gestapo.

950
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,337
No. This is
Paterson, New Jersey!

951
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:02,545
This is the United States
of America!

952
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:04,629
- This is our right to assemble...
- Fucking Nazis!

953
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:07,545
Easy! Easy.

954
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:10,420
No violence. No violence.

955
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:14,003
Do not give them an excuse.
Don't do it.

956
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:16,295
And second of all,

957
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,420
I want to thank you
for coming out

958
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:20,670
on this, the fourth whistle stop

959
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:25,420
on what I promise will be
a two-year grassroots campaign

960
00:54:25,503 --> 00:54:27,253
to take back America

961
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:30,754
from those who want to turn us
against each other,

962
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:33,670
those who no longer remember

963
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:36,086
what it is
that America stands for,

964
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:39,086
who use the cry
of "America First,"

965
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,754
who promote nationalism
and isolationism

966
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:44,670
to make enemies of hardworking
American citizens

967
00:54:44,754 --> 00:54:46,712
who build and continue
to build...

968
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:55,670
Goddamn Bund!
Get lost,
you fucking Nazis!

969
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:56,879
Reds go home!

970
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,629
We agreed no violence.
No excuses for violence.

971
00:54:59,712 --> 00:55:00,837
Do something!

972
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,086
Who are these guys?

973
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,086
- All right. Easy.
- You don't belong here!

974
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,920
- Please stay calm.
- Fuck you, you commies.

975
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,795
- Hey! Stop!
- Who are they?

976
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:09,795
Officers! Stop that.

977
00:55:09,879 --> 00:55:13,545
Officers... No violence!
Please! Stop!

978
00:55:13,629 --> 00:55:16,295
- Come on!
- Everybody calm down.

979
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:18,503
It does not need
to be like this.

980
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:20,295
Leave us alone!

981
00:55:20,378 --> 00:55:22,003
- Please!
- Get away from us!

982
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:24,128
- No violence.
- Where are the police?

983
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:26,629
Stay calm.

984
00:55:26,712 --> 00:55:29,003
Stay calm! Please!

985
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:32,378
- Stop it!
- Fucking Jew!

986
00:55:45,837 --> 00:55:48,712
- Get outta here!
- Yeah, you little pinko!

987
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:20,670
What began earlier
as a political rally

988
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:23,045
in the downtown section
of Paterson, New Jersey,

989
00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:26,545
has since resulted in
an evening of violence
and rioting.

990
00:56:26,629 --> 00:56:29,503
At ten o'clock,
the controversial
radio personality

991
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:32,128
and presidential hopeful
Walter Winchell

992
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:35,462
took to a makeshift stage
for his fourth campaign speech

993
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:38,378
and repeated the need
to take back America,

994
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:41,378
thus provoking his hundreds
of supporters in attendance

995
00:56:41,462 --> 00:56:43,712
to lash out at the small group
of residents

996
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:47,128
peacefully observing from
the outskirts of the crowd.

997
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:49,128
Dozens from both sides
are injured,

998
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,503
and one man has died
from his injuries.

999
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:54,879
The mayor has enforced
a curfew, which is largely
being ignored,

1000
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:57,045
as reports
of escalating violence,

1001
00:56:57,128 --> 00:56:58,837
rock throwing, window breaking,

1002
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,879
and fires perpetuated
by Winchell's mob

1003
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,545
continue to multiply
within Paterson city limits.

1004
00:57:05,629 --> 00:57:08,545
A downtown hardware store owner
told police earlier today

1005
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:10,837
that several men wearing
Winchell buttons

1006
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,378
bought handsaws,
ice picks, and hammers.

1007
00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:15,670
When another group entered
to make similar purchases,

1008
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:17,920
the owner called the police.

1009
00:57:18,003 --> 00:57:21,086
We return you now
to this hour's program.

1010
00:58:04,879 --> 00:58:06,712
You... You can't do this.

1011
00:58:08,253 --> 00:58:10,420
Not to us. Not to our lives.

1012
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,712
If you do, I will go to Canada.

1013
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:18,211
I will go to Canada,
I will take the children,

1014
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,420
I will leave.

1015
01:00:18,462 --> 01:00:19,462
This just in.

1016
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,420
The Colombian Broadcasting
News Bureau.

1017
01:00:21,503 --> 01:00:24,086
Anti-Jewish disturbances
are now being reported

1018
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,003
by authorities in both Cleveland
and Indianapolis.

1019
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:32,295
Fellow Americans, concerned at
the civil disturbances

1020
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,670
that followed Mr. Winchell's
speaking engagements,

1021
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:38,420
this president will do
all within his power

1022
01:00:38,503 --> 01:00:42,587
to prevent any further harm
from coming to the citizenry.

1023
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:46,045
- We have to get out.
- They've closed the borders.

1024
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:52,187
I thought that Lindbergh
would be good for everyone.

1025
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:53,521
For the Jews, for everybody.
I thought...

1026
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:55,420
The riots are not because
of Lindbergh.

1027
01:00:55,503 --> 01:00:57,337
I believe he is a good man.

1028
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:02,462
Does it bother you at all
what's happened in this country?

1029
01:01:02,545 --> 01:01:03,879
Well, the question seem to be

1030
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,795
whether you're still willing
to act on that?

1031
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:11,295
We only think we're Americans.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Dad!

4
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,187
It should have been me.

5
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:38,438
Find them...

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,344
Find them and kill them.

7
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:56,617
You alright?

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,160
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since Petey died.

9
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,040
- How much do you trust me?
- With my life.

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,265
Then maybe you are ready.

11
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,306
Stay back...

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,852
You touch him, I'll fucking kill you.

13
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,404
He killed Pete, love.

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
He snuck into our house,
ate at our table...

15
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:54,764
He lied to us Anna, he lied to you.

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,040
Exactly what dad did to him.

17
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:58,561
- He's using you, darlin'.
- No, he loves me.

18
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:00,761
Out you come, Simon.

19
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:02,834
- This'll all be over, mate.
- Don't move.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,964
Always go on two...

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,267
Remember.

22
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:09,825
Don't fuck this up.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Jack, Jack, you'll hurt her, Jack.

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
- Five...
- Jack!

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,338
Four, three...

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,439
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna...

27
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:35,077
I don't hate you, Jack.

28
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,361
I love you...

29
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,439
I've always loved you.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,420
I love you too, mate.

31
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:48,593
No, no, no, Whitey...

32
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,258
Whitey.

33
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,625
No, no.

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,039

Pretty cold?

Fuck, shit.

44
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,393
Don't you dare die on her, you bastard.

45
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,470
Don't you dare die on
her, d'you hear me?

46
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:31,664
Where is it?

47
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,990
Oh shit. Fuck.

48
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,790
Don't go to sleep, Jack, Jack!
Don't go to sleep.

49
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,265
Jack, stay awake, don't go to sleep.

50
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,450
I'll stop the bleeding, for yer.

51
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,670
Don't worry, Jack!

52
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:02,829
Anna!

53
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,023
Anna!

54
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,048
Anna, come back!

55
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:10,911
Ah!

56
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,232
Jesus, Jack.

57
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,706
Fuck you, Jack!

58
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:23,833
Fuck you.

59
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,309
God, I love you.

60
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,851
Goodbye, Jack!

61
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:06,362
Anna!

62
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,944
<i>...You're just not mother material.</i>

63
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,900
What do you mean
I'm not mother material?

64
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,380
I pay your mortgage
and the kids' tuition.

65
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
<i>What's your point?</i>

66
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,664
I want them here this summer.

67
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,020
The house is almost ready,
Katie can learn to ride an...

68
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,860
<i>You think Katie wants to learn to ride?</i>

69
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:57,056
<i>My god, Elizabeth, if you spent
any time around your kids...</i>

70
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,223
<i>or even just checked
in once in a while...</i>

71
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,804
<i>you'd know Katie has no interest in...</i>

72
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,482
- I miss them.
- <i>You miss them...</i>

73
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:06,161
<i>Well, I'm here to tell
you, guess what...</i>

74
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:11,540
<i>this isn't about you,
it's about Katie...</i>

75
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,430
<i>That's what you do, Elizabeth...</i>

76
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,820
Can I have two of these.

77
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,646
Elizabeth.

78
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:41,387
- You here for business?
- There you go.

79
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,920
Reinforcements.

80
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:12,554
Say something. Anything?

81
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:20,005
Ten years ago on a cool dark night...

82
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,999
someone was killed,
'neath the town hall light...

83
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:26,788
There were few at the scene
and they all agreed...

84
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,843
that the slayer who ran,
looked a lot like me.

85
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,498
The judge said, son, what is your alibi?

86
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,676
You were somewhere else,
then you won't have to die.

87
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:40,014
I spoke not a word,
though it meant my life.

88
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,901
I'd been in the arms of
my best friend's wife...

89
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,955
Congratulations.

90
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,070
Six Twelve.

91
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:45,894
Fuck! Fuck!

92
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,740
Anna!

93
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,950
Anna!

94
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,109
Anna, come back!

95
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,950
Shit.

96
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,066
Elizabeth Bradshaw?

97
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:13,869
Yes?

98
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,790
I come from downtown.

99
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:29,755
But they just promoted me.
This doesn't make any sense.

100
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:32,435
- You need me to clarify, ma'am?
- What?

101
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,240
Put the legalese in plain English?

102
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,590
You're fired.

103
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,774
Good day to you.

104
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,400
Hey!

105
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,800
Hey!

106
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,199
- Ma'am?
- Who the hell are you?

107
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:53,751
I represent the shareholders.

108
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:55,671
Okay. Well, you clarify this
for the shareholders.

109
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,222
They can go fuck themselves.

110
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,098
You tell them they're fucking
with the wrong woman.

111
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:00,596
How's that for plain English?

112
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,033
Clear, Cowboy?

113
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,285
Crystal.

114
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,511
Fuck.

115
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,720
Fuck it.

116
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,610
Who's on the other end of that?

117
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,450
- Beijing.
- Beijing?

118
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:30,732
New partners.

119
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,339
Ok, Beijing.

120
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,595
Have you ever heard
of corporate manslaughter?

121
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,929
Cause in Canada...

122
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:40,533
an organisation is guilty
of corporate manslaughter

123
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,653
if the way in which its
activities are conducted

124
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,276
causes a person's death.

125
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,329
For example, if a burst pipe
from a carbon storage facility

126
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,014
were to kill innocent children...

127
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,053
We recommend that you retract
any and all allegations...

128
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,857
against this company,
its parent company,

129
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,689
any affiliates or any of its employees.

130
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,087
And refrain from making
any further allegations.

131
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:03,185
- Have we met?
- Or we go to the police.

132
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,084
Oh I think the sooner the authorities
know about this, the better.

133
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,438
- We'll press charges for extortion.
- Extortion?

134
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,961
I'm a bona fide whistle blower.

135
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,556
Everyone who commits extortion

136
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,728
who with intent to obtain anything

137
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,633
by threats, accusations,
menaces or violence...

138
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,807
- I know what extortion is.
- ...induces or attempts to induce

139
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:22,661
any person to do anything
or cause anything to be done.

140
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:25,299
- And I know the law.
- In your case... A promotion.

141
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:32,752
Do you really want to go to court?

142
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,631
Extortion is an indictable offence.
So it is liable to imprisonment.

143
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,667
We'd see to it you served five years.

144
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,903
And what makes you think I'm
not prepared to go to jail?

145
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,218
Those two individuals are detectives.

146
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:53,454
Go one step futher and we'll turn
you over to the federal police.

147
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,739
If you're firing me, I'm entitled
to a severance package.

148
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,816
I'm afraid you relieved us of
any obligation to remunerate you...

149
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:06,492
...when you broke the law.

150
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,030
I'll take two weeks salary.

151
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,209
You'll vacate the premises
immediately, Ms. Bradshaw...

152
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:13,685
...or you will be escorted off of them.

153
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:15,855
- Were you bullied in school?
- Excuse me?

154
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,457
Do you ruin people's lives for a living
because you're hurting inside...

155
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,445
- ...or are you just a heartless cunt?
- Security.

156
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,248
Oh, shit...

157
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:05,686
Anna!

158
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,089
Anna?

159
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,829
Hello?

160
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,926
- <i>We're screwed.</i>
- What?

161
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,515
Northstream Oil called the cops.

162
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:09,107
- <i>What if they know something?</i>
- So what?

163
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:11,705
<i>This is serious.</i>

164
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,902
My daughter's lost.

165
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,271
<i>She could die up here,
I need to get help.</i>

166
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:19,989
Where are you?

167
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,746
On Moose Mountain.

168
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:24,682
<i>Angela, I'm on my way.
Don't call the police yet.</i>

169
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,935
- We'll find her, okay?
- <i>Hurry.</i>

170
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,211
Oh, fuck!

171
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,062
Fuck!

172
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:58,902
Bollocks.

173
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,519
Ah, fucking bollocks.

174
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,190
Come on!

175
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,906
You fucker.

176
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Come on!

177
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,190
Come on then!

178
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,070
Kill me!

179
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:17,172
<i>Severe weather warnings to
much of southern Alberta today.</i>

180
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,540
<i>Blinding blizzard
conditions are expected</i>

181
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:23,544
<i>to pummel most of the far
south west, and the storm</i>

182
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,573
<i>expected to deliver...</i>

183
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:26,660
Hey!

184
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,440
- How are you feeling?
- Peachy.

185
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
What did the surgeon say?

186
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,336
I get to wheel myself around
in that for the rest of my life.

187
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,060
What? I just spoke to the nurse

188
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:40,870
and she didn't say anything
about the rest of your life...

189
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:43,078
She's probably under the
impression you might give a crap.

190
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,587
That's not fair.

191
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,720
Do you love me?

192
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
- Yes.
- Telling pause.

193
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,900
Which direction did
the Chief drive off in?

194
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,708
Swiftly followed by the
mother of all segues.

195
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,864
You were the last person to see him.

196
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,739
I've stared death in the face, Denise.

197
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,575
- I think I can take the truth.
- Hey!

198
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,075
It's over, isn't it?

199
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,776
No.

200
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,540
Look, I don't expect you to date
a cripple for the rest of your life.

201
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:34,838
I don't... I don't even know
if I still have what it takes...

202
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:42,003
to make love to you, Denise.

203
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,409
It was a glancing blow to the kneecap.

204
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,545
He tried to kill me.

205
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:48,247
If the Chief had wanted to
kill you, you would be dead.

206
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:56,946
I'm going to kill him.

207
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,215
- Great.
- Just so you know.

208
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,488
Which way did he go?

209
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,337
She knew this place.

210
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:09,756
I thought maybe she'd come back here.

211
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,000
Why?

212
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:31,621
Hey! Hey.

213
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:34,101
- What happened?
- She fell.

214
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:36,722
- What?
- Down some stairs.

215
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:38,763
- What about you?
- Me? I broke her fall.

216
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,647
Well, you know, tried to.

217
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:42,511
***

218
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,956
My partner says he saw the
chief coming into your bar.

219
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:46,053
Alright listen, sweetheart.

220
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,290
This an interview?

221
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,959
'Cos if it is, I'd
like solicitor, please.

222
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:52,400
- S'cuse me?
- A lawyer.

223
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,351
You'd better get one then.

224
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,390
She could have helped us!

225
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,775
- He should be dead by now.
- What if he isn't, Frank?

226
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,019
I say he is, Randy. I say we
forget about him, OK? I say...

227
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,181
What if he comes back?

228
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:27,086
Back at the cabin... that blood?

229
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:29,198
- I've no idea.
- Really?

230
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:31,437
You sure this isn't the second
house you've burnt down,

231
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,034
there's not another
body buried somewhere?

232
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,423
I found her phone here.

233
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,571
She must have gone to the top.

234
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,120
What, are you going to call the police?

235
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,879
Should have done it in the first place.

236
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,733
You need to start telling me the truth.

237
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,456
Shit I've got no signal.

238
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,970
Anna!

239
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,930
- Anna!
- This is suicide.

240
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,450
I am taking you back down the
mountain if I have to drag you.

241
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,303
You drag me down
this mountain and I'll shoot you.

242
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:23,816
You'll shoot me?

243
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,769
Okay. Fuck you...

244
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:30,725
You want to die up here?

245
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,048
Go ahead. Kill yourself.

246
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,760
Anna!

247
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,474
Anna!

248
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,769
Chico?

249
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:14,006
Pretty cold?

250
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,909
Help!

251
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:07,363
- Where's Anna?
- What?

252
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:12,451
- Where's Anna?
- Who the heck is Anna.

253
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:18,452
***

254
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,028
You need to rest.

255
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,596
- Your muscles are in spasm.
- I need to find Anna.

256
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:24,040
He's hallucinating.

257
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,784
- In here. Yeah.
- This way.

258
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:47,766
Will she die?

259
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:50,102
This the Reserve?

260
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,502
Chief.

261
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:56,362
Cheers.

262
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:01,581
- How'd I get here?
- Hunters found you on the mountain.

263
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,742
- My wife and daughter?
- No.

264
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,101
You got something I could
borrow, a truck or something?

265
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:11,137
Ey hee.

266
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,462
Have you ever ridden one of those?

267
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,442
No problem.

268
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,290
For Fucksake.

269
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:40,302
This was supposed to
be my executive mansion...

270
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:44,610
I'm no longer an executive.

271
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:47,778
So it's falling apart and
the pipes are all frozen.

272
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:50,984
But the bright side is...
we have tons of firewood...

273
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:53,563
and nobody knows we're here.

274
00:37:58,902 --> 00:37:59,902
Thank you.

275
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,671
- Sorry. That's disgusting.
- I've had worse.

276
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:09,357
Who'd you kill up there?

277
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:14,341
Whoever it is, I think your daughter
has something to do with it.

278
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,099
And I'd be surprised
if "Jack" wasn't involved.

279
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,299
Is that your husband's real name?

280
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:21,086
You kept calling it out
in your sleep last night.

281
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:28,051
- What do you want?
- To feel safe.

282
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,249
- What's that got to do with me?
- Self-defence is one thing.

283
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,674
What the hell else have
I become accessory to?

284
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:45,265
- What the fuck?
- I had to call the police.

285
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:47,876
- You did what?
- My daughter's missing.

286
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,899
We found Anna.

287
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:57,342
- Where is she?
- She's at the hospital. She's alive.

288
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:00,724
Oh... thanks be to Jesus.

289
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,358
OK, OK.

290
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:21,268
They said there's no brain damage.

291
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:24,135
Why won't they let me see her?

292
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,231
She has to answer a few questions first.

293
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:27,984
Questions?

294
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,192
Angela, I have to ask you.

295
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,036
Where's the chief?

296
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:40,221
Er, I was going to
ask you the same question.

297
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:46,277
You drove away together.
From the scene of a shooting.

298
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,780
He's a monster.

299
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,566
Denise.

300
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:00,074
That's why Anna did this to herself.

301
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:03,402
She'll do anything to get away from him.

302
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,962
And I don't blame her...

303
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:08,842
Hate this place.

304
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:12,167
Last time I was here, I was told
my son was dead and now...

305
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:14,503
She's going to be okay,
she's going to be okay.

306
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,022
Mrs. Worth?

307
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:39,582
How is Anna?

308
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,521
I'm Sarah.

309
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:46,061
Sarah Nickel.

310
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:49,109
This is my daughter, Rosa.

311
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:50,342
We found her.

312
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:53,855
- You found her?
- Rosa did.

313
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,090
Shall I sit with you?

314
00:41:16,188 --> 00:41:17,188
Whoa.

315
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:23,504
Fucksake.

316
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,260
Woah, bollocks.

317
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,431
Fuck off.

318
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:01,836
What did she ask you?

319
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:04,401
Anna?

320
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:07,442
The cop.

321
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:11,701
We talked about Anna.

322
00:43:15,622 --> 00:43:17,333
Well, what did you tell her?

323
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:20,960
If you're so fucking worried about
the cops, why don't you leave town?

324
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:22,035
What the hell's keeping you here?

325
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,382
You.

326
00:43:30,328 --> 00:43:31,768
I saved your life.

327
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,270
You saved mine.

328
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,310
We're quits. You can fuck
off with a clean conscience.

329
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:39,260
Christ, if I were you
I'd be in Acapulco by now.

330
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,016
While you make a deal with the Feds?

331
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,573
- What?
- Look, I know how this works.

332
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:47,493
I'm a career criminal
but I'm not an idiot.

333
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,997
If they back you in a
corner, you're gonna snitch.

334
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:56,076
Go fuck yourself.

335
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,217
D'you know what they do
to snitches where I come from?

336
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:01,094
I don't know anything about you.

337
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,631
She murdered him, didn't she?

338
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:11,393
Anna.

339
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:14,687
Then tried to kill herself.

340
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,897
You can trust me, Angela.

341
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:26,104
You have to trust me.
We have to trust each other.

342
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,067
Why?

343
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:33,467
Because I am an accessory,
to a murder that you committed.

344
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:56,356
You want to know what happened?

345
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,150
He taped us to these.

346
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:19,786
Then he er, hit me on the head

347
00:45:19,822 --> 00:45:22,067
with his sock full of billiard balls.

348
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:27,124
And he stabbed my girlfriend
in the thigh with a broken bottle.

349
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:35,880
Why?

350
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,897
Well, I hate to disappoint
you, sweetheart...

351
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:40,784
But he's not just a drunk,
he's a psychopath.

352
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,435
He came in here wasted, for starters.

353
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:46,132
Made some bizarre claims
about men from his past.

354
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:48,368
I seemed to fit the bill,
you know... being British.

355
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:52,166
I told him I... I had no idea
what he was on about so...

356
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,289
so he...

357
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,667
I'll be alright in a minute.

358
00:46:01,985 --> 00:46:04,453
It's probably just a touch of PTSD.

359
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:07,937
- Mr. Jackson.
- Yes.

360
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:10,306
Do I look like a
douche bag in this uniform?

361
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:11,334
What?

362
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:15,259
- Do I look like a douche bag?
- No.

363
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:17,921
Then tell me the truth. Did
you come here to kill the chief?

364
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:19,473
Don't be so daft.

365
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:27,268
You leave him and his family alone.

366
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:43,091
Does it still hurt?

367
00:46:51,022 --> 00:46:52,022
Thanks.

368
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:58,357
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

369
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,997
This is pretty.

370
00:47:09,422 --> 00:47:10,650
Oh, have it.

371
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,277
Oh, no, er.

372
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:17,299
- Thanks.
- My mum gave it to me.

373
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:21,142
I don't want it anymore.

374
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:29,375
I often think about escaping.

375
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:37,087
Maybe I should be apologising to you.

376
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:45,916
That would be weird.

377
00:47:55,882 --> 00:47:57,663
Can you make her go away?

378
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,656
How is she?

379
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:09,762
Mrs. Worth.

380
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:14,122
I bought some ice cream for
her throat, and some new clothes.

381
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:21,335
She's, er... she's
too tired for visitors.

382
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:30,480
Last time I did this, she'd
just had her tonsils out.

383
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:35,373
Did she, er, tell you
she didn't want to see me?

384
00:48:37,822 --> 00:48:38,862
Yes.

385
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:46,221
Rosa? Thank you.

386
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:49,390
For being a friend.

387
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,804
Can you... d'you wanna help me here?

388
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:28,000
- Nick!
- Yes.

389
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:36,683
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...

390
00:49:37,112 --> 00:49:38,887
Why are you doing this?

391
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,820
It was an accident!

392
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:42,878
Taking me in.

393
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
Your place has stairs.

394
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,217
Guilt.

395
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,990
What?

396
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,563
You feel guilty...

397
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:58,045
because the Lone Ranger
you're playing Tonto to

398
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,906
shot me at close range and
you haven't even suspended him.

399
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:02,795
I have to find him first.

400
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,717
They're making you chief
on account of my injury.

401
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,647
And because you're
First Nations. And female.

402
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,963
Come on, Denise. You know
it's a political statement.

403
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,450
D'you want something to eat?

404
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:18,431
What I want's best served cold!

405
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:24,891
I'll get it.

406
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:33,232
Alright?

407
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:34,688
What?

408
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:36,493
Denise about?

409
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:38,596
What?

410
00:50:39,092 --> 00:50:40,724
Your girlfriend. She
lives here, doesn't she?

411
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,774
Yes.

412
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,779
- What's the matter with you?
- You shot me.

413
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:48,333
- Where?
- Outside Randy's.

414
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:50,784
Well, not in the head then?

415
00:50:50,987 --> 00:50:52,403
I must have been fucking plastered.

416
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:55,235
- Oh, great. You're alive!
- Where's my fucking family?

417
00:50:55,271 --> 00:50:57,671
- Where the hell have you been?
- What happened to my fucking house?

418
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,491
What the hell are you
doing with our new truck?

419
00:51:00,742 --> 00:51:02,002
Can we talk outside?

420
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,143
Cheer up. I've been shot in the
leg, you don't see me complaining.

421
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,790
No, no, no, that is not yours,
that is Police property.

422
00:51:09,826 --> 00:51:11,325
Well, you're not driving it, are you?

423
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,661
- When you going to chuck him?
- What happened to you?

424
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,419
I dunno, I was hoping you'd tell me.

425
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,552
Me? I can barely keep up with you.

426
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:28,054
- I've covered up a murder for you...
- Did ya?

427
00:51:28,303 --> 00:51:29,947
I can't carry on like this.

428
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:31,970
At the very least I'm going
to have to suspend you.

429
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,006
Which one?

430
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,614
- Which what?
- Which murder.

431
00:51:36,477 --> 00:51:38,663
Oh, my God, are you telling me
there's been more than one?

432
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
Hang on.

433
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:43,148
Oh, you mean Elaine.

434
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,986
He stole my fucking gloves.

435
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:47,771
Big black fella, come here to kill me.

436
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:55,823
I trusted you.

437
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:57,599
I hid evidence for you!

438
00:51:57,807 --> 00:52:00,404
- That's good police work, that is.
- Not where I come from!

439
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:03,054
- What kind of man are you?
- I don't know.

440
00:52:04,306 --> 00:52:05,735
So whatever followed you here,

441
00:52:05,771 --> 00:52:08,344
whatever you needed to do
to protect your family, I get it.

442
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:10,492
But I need to know that it's over.

443
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,262
Well, I'm not going to know
that till I find 'em, am I?

444
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,553
- So they're still alive then, are they?
- Yes!

445
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:20,654
- They're safe?
- From you.

446
00:52:21,396 --> 00:52:23,166
- Do you want to do the right thing?
- Always.

447
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:24,631
Just leave.

448
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,233
- Is this cause I shot your boyfriend?
- No.

449
00:52:32,086 --> 00:52:35,325
- So, er, where are they then?
- I don't know.

450
00:52:35,854 --> 00:52:37,828
- In town?
- I don't know.

451
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,234
At the Hotel?

452
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:41,082
- I don't know.
- Hospital?

453
00:52:42,435 --> 00:52:43,832
- I don't know.
- Hospital.

454
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:45,436
What the fuck happened?

455
00:52:46,514 --> 00:52:48,234
So are you staying,
are you coming or what?

456
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:56,506
Fuck!

457
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,439
Did you bring my clothes I asked for?

458
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:02,314
Love, you can't just discharge
yourself. You're not well enough.

459
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,230
I told you, I'm not
sticking around here, Frank.

460
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:05,460
- Hey, hey.
- I'm scared.

461
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:07,178
Don't underestimate my nephew.

462
00:53:07,576 --> 00:53:10,482
You're never going to see that
kid again, Frank, and you know it.

463
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:13,904
So stop bullshitting us
both and face the facts.

464
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,620
Sooner... not later...

465
00:53:15,808 --> 00:53:17,805
the man that stuck me
with a broken bottle

466
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:19,102
is going to come around looking for us

467
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:20,809
and I don't want to
be here when he does.

468
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,406
Worth? Anna? Angela?

469
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:38,092
- And you are?
- Tired.

470
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:40,162
Anna's in the last
room on the right, Chief.

471
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,342
Thanks.

472
00:54:19,442 --> 00:54:21,861
<i>I left him there to die.</i>

473
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:23,922
<i>For Anna.</i>

474
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,596
Somebody had to stop him.

475
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,881
He destroyed our family.

476
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,522
He destroyed everything he touched.

477
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:45,701
I murdered my husband.

478
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:50,722
You asked me what
happened on that mountain.

479
00:54:52,442 --> 00:54:53,542
That's the truth.

480
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,130
No, no...

481
00:55:31,902 --> 00:55:33,944
Get off me.

482
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:05,417
Get off me.

483
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:06,640
What have I done?

484
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:08,090
Get off.

485
00:56:40,503 --> 00:56:41,503
Anna?

486
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:50,068
Where were you going?

487
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:54,887
Anna, I know this is hard.

488
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,474
First...

489
00:56:57,452 --> 00:56:59,151
your brother and now your dad.

490
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:03,647
But you still have me.

491
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:05,110
You did this.

492
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:08,368
You set him off.

493
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:11,774
And then...

494
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:14,424
you just stood there...

495
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:16,640
and did nothing.

496
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,262
While he pointed a gun at me
and pulled the trigger.

497
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:23,364
- You let him do it.
- Anna.

498
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,182
I'm bad.

499
00:57:32,402 --> 00:57:33,702
I know I'm bad...

500
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:41,062
but I'm so, so sorry
I'm not who you thought I was.

501
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:46,365
But I can be who you want me to be.

502
00:57:47,362 --> 00:57:48,562
From now on.

503
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,970
It's over between me and Jack.

504
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:55,126
I'm better now.

505
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:59,938
We are both better off without him.

506
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:04,353
Oh, my God, you still don't know.

507
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:05,517
Know what?

508
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,392
He's alive.

509
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,204
- What?
- Mum.

510
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:14,650
He's in the fucking building.

511
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:22,273
What?

512
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:27,634
Here!

513
00:58:35,629 --> 00:58:36,629
Anna?

514
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,484
- This one.
- Okay.

515
00:58:54,442 --> 00:58:55,481
Let's go!

516
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:32,407
Fuck.

517
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:04,517
Will he find you?

518
01:00:05,695 --> 01:00:06,695
Yep.

519
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:10,141
Jack!

520
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,769
Will he hurt you?

521
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:16,602
Not like you think.

522
01:00:17,062 --> 01:00:18,302
So what are you afraid of?

523
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:20,442
Me.

524
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,181
What I'll do to him.

525
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:25,642
To punish him.

526
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:24,895
Angela?

527
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:50,321
Angela?

528
01:02:30,922 --> 01:02:32,022
Angela?

529
01:02:45,158 --> 01:02:46,405
Where is she?

530
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:50,204
I'm right here, you bastard.

531
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:54,174
- Thank fuck for that.
- Shut up.

532
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:56,894
- Sorry.
- Don't say a fucking word.

533
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:03,830
Go outside. Look in his truck.
You'll find a pair of handcuffs.

534
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:06,287
Get them. Call the police.

535
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:08,608
- Call the police?
- Yeah!

536
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:24,031
You have no idea, do you?

537
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,542
No memory at all of what you did.

538
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,380
She tried to...

539
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,510
hang herself, Jim.

540
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:42,001
Because of what you did.

541
01:03:42,658 --> 01:03:43,969
Because of Jack.

542
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:48,432
There is no undoing what you've done.

543
01:03:48,468 --> 01:03:50,389
There is no going back. There is no...

544
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,321
way that our...

545
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:58,356
little wee family...

546
01:04:00,514 --> 01:04:03,334
can ever be together again after this.

547
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:05,178
Why?

548
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:07,318
Why not?

549
01:04:11,421 --> 01:04:12,742
Because Anna...

550
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:15,146
was the one who shot you.

551
01:04:20,742 --> 01:04:22,401
She wants you dead.

552
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:30,722
So do I.

553
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:06,507

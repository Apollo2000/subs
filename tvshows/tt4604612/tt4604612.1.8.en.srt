1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,465
Scalped.

2
00:00:01,894 --> 00:00:05,112
I saw something similar when
I was ranching in the Dakotas.

3
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:08,375
Look for any mention of patients
with a connection to the West.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,386
"Dirtier than a Red Injun."

5
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:13,121
It's in the letter he wrote
to Mrs. Santorelli.

6
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,057
He's witnessed these things
probably as a child.

7
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,770
Here's another one...
Of the patients who match

8
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:18,860
our description that have
spent time in the West...

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,041
These four were sent to
St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington.

10
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:22,798
I think he may have been
a soldier.

11
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,733
- Have you told Kreizler?
- You'll have to tell him.

12
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,069
Come on. We'll go together.

13
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:30,205
No. Has something
happened between you?

14
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:37,413
- You're in well over your head.
- You don't scare me, Connor.

15
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,747
I'd very much like if you would
join me for dinner.

16
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:24,792
Wonder what's gotten into her?

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,207
I'm curious how you
propose to gain access

18
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,143
to Bunzl's records.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,413
Laszlo?

20
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:47,683
Yes, John?

21
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,017
Your attention certainly seems

22
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:51,419
to be drawn elsewhere
this morning.

23
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,267
If you're referring to the fact I've not
asked about what happened to your face,

24
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,159
it's only because I wanted to
spare you the embarrassment.

25
00:01:57,227 --> 00:02:02,030
What if I told you I'd met
an old friend for a drink?

26
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,100
That resulted in two black eyes?

27
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,770
Sometimes, Laszlo, there are
words spoken between people

28
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,906
that are to be left private.

29
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,510
What about Julia Pratt?

30
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:16,578
Julia Pratt?

31
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,714
Your former fiancée.

32
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:20,315
She lives in Washington,
doesn't she?

33
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:22,317
Will you not take the time
to see her?

34
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:25,053
Why should I take the time
to see Julia Pratt?

35
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,122
Because you were
in love with her.

36
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:32,460
I rarely think about
that time in my life.

37
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,462
I've decided it's much better
to look to the future

38
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,664
than dwell in the past.

39
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:43,939
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

40
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,007
There's a French alienist
named Broca I came across

41
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:48,410
when I researched
Mary's aphasia.

42
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,991
He believes there's a certain section
of the brain responsible for speech,

43
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,882
another for empathy,
even one for love.

44
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,483
Love resides in the heart.

45
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,085
Nonsense.
The heart is simply a muscle.

46
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:59,287
Love isn't a mystery
any more than cholera.

47
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,800
- Cholera is a disease.
- The point is,

48
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,290
each part of our brain
has a function,

49
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:06,762
and that function
is developed or impaired...

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,059
== Synced & corrected by MaxPayne ==.

51
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:43,465
They may as well
blame me personally

52
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,066
for these murders.

53
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,815
I'll soon find myself
tarred and feathered,

54
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,071
and it won't be
metaphorically, either.

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,585
Dr. Kreizler is on his way
to Washington,

56
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,809
if it's some consolation.

57
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:56,078
Your Indians proved
illuminating, sir.

58
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:57,706
He believes there may be
some connection

59
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,347
between our killer and the West.

60
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,817
Go on.

61
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:06,688
I believe I should have gone
to Washington myself.

62
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,157
But that's not why you're upset.

63
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,692
I'm not entirely insensitive

64
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:13,962
to the hidden currents
between people.

65
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,364
Dr. Kreizler may need
your assistance

66
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:20,102
to gain entry into certain
Federal institutions.

67
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,705
I have a friend there.
He knows everyone in town.

68
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:29,244
- Hooker's Division.
- How's that?

69
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:30,624
I was referring to
the neighborhood.

70
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:33,248
During the war,
General Hooker and his men

71
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:35,028
used to frequently enjoy
the hospitality offered here

72
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:36,718
in their offduty hours.

73
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:39,121
Your finest whiskey, darling.

74
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,190
And bring yourself back here
as soon as possible.

75
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:45,393
- No.
- Make it two.

76
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:50,398
Mind if I ask
what the other fellow looks like?

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,667
I'm sorry. The other fellow?

78
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,339
Commissioner Roosevelt said

79
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:59,074
you work at
the Bureau of Indian Affairs?

80
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,542
Commissioner.

81
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,011
Theodore certainly has
a way of falling up.

82
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:06,614
Falling up? Yes, well, there are
some men who have a way about them

83
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:09,217
that even when they fail,
they succeed.

84
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,419
My friend Moore here
is hoping to examine records

85
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,823
of unsolved massacres that
took place out West. Unsolved?

86
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,692
Not many of them,
I can tell you.

87
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,160
We'd like to have a look anyway.

88
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,096
Would you care to dance, Mister?

89
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:25,567
I'm afraid I have two left feet.
I would only embarrass myself.

90
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:29,104
You look like the kind of man...
Thank you, but, no, thank you.

91
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,707
You got a taker here, sweet pea.

92
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,376
Come by my office
in the morning.

93
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,062
You're Dr. Kreizler.

94
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:56,732
I heard a rumor
you were on the premises.

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,070
I saw you speak at Johns Hopkins
some years ago.

96
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,607
Dr. Ignatius Blunt.

97
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,544
It truly is an honor.

98
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,479
May I ask the... the purpose
of your visit?

99
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:15,017
I'm looking for someone who was
once a patient here.

100
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:17,553
- His name?
- Rudolf Bunzl.

101
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,088
Yes. He was a soldier.

102
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,758
Served in the Army of the West,
if I recall.

103
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:25,293
Tall, early 30s.

104
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:28,764
I believe he suffers from
some sort of facial deformity,

105
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:32,034
something congenital
or acquired in his youth.

106
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:35,904
No, in that case,
I'm not sure he's your man.

107
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,641
There was someone else
released years ago.

108
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,777
I don't recall his name.

109
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:45,781
He had a most, um...
horrific tic.

110
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,450
A tic?

111
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:50,586
Yes, intermittent
and violent contraction

112
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,654
of the ocular and facial muscles.

113
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:53,989
What happened to him?

114
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:56,191
Iggy?

115
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,660
What have I told you about
bothering our visitors?

116
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,930
I was just speaking with
Dr. Kreizler about a patient.

117
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,933
You know we never discuss patients.

118
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:06,734
But he's a doctor.

119
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:16,745
Iggy?

120
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:19,581
It was a honor to meet you,
Dr. Kreizler.

121
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,355
Army surgeon.

122
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,358
Hacked off a few too many limbs
at Gettysburg.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,893
Never quite the same.

124
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:35,964
I'm afraid I've some bad news,
Dr. Kreizler.

125
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,500
The patient you were
inquiring after is dead.

126
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,248
Our records indicate that
Rudolf Bunzl died

127
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,237
and was buried at Arlington...

128
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:45,573
let's see, four months ago.

129
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,375
I'm, sorry to disappoint you.

130
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:54,382
Dr. Dillman, was there
a patient here some time back

131
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,985
who suffered from a facial tic,
one with intermittent

132
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:59,254
and violent contractions
around the eyes?

133
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:02,724
Doesn't ring a bell,
but then, I'm fairly new here.

134
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,593
Do you mind if I have a look
at the records?

135
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:09,665
Dr. Kreizler, I was instructed
to offer you assistance.

136
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,533
I believe I've done
what was asked of me.

137
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,269
I'll be searching within a very
narrow range of indicators.

138
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,271
We have over 10,000 records
stored here.

139
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,408
I've all afternoon.

140
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,344
The type of mutilations

141
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,346
tells you which tribe
is responsible.

142
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:28,484
These were... Well, it's hard
to tell from a photograph.

143
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:32,220
What's that in his mouth?

144
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:35,491
That, my good man, is what
every fella thinks with,

145
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,360
and I'm not talking
about his brains.

146
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,028
We were the same,

147
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,964
took our fair share of peckers
and ears along the way.

148
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,301
Boys will be boys.

149
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,703
Chops?

150
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,405
Shh!

151
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,974
- Chops?
- Lunch.

152
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,243
There's a splendid place
on the Hill that serves them.

153
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,179
Good beer, too.

154
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,047
I think I'll poke
through the rest of these.

155
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,583
Just leave them on the table
when you're done.

156
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:14,796
Teething. I'm sure that's what it is.
She's at that age.

157
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,999
Well, is there anything I can do?
Clove oil.

158
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:20,802
Dab a bit on your finger and
rub it into your baby's gums.

159
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,271
- It acts as a mild analgesic.
- How much?

160
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,073
Don't worry.
It's only a bit of clove oil.

161
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,876
I want to pay for it, Mr. Freewater.

162
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:31,079
I can take care of my
daughter alone. Here.

163
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:41,489
I'll take this one. Here.

164
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,163
I can tell by the expression
on your face

165
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,566
you were as successful as I was.

166
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,369
- How successful were you?
- I found nothing.

167
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,903
Every unsolved massacre

168
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:58,106
was inevitably attributed
to marauding Indians.

169
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:01,643
They seem to have become a symbol
for all forms of savagery.

170
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,111
What did you find?

171
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,181
The man we came to inquire after
is dead.

172
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,783
- Dead?
- As a hobnail.

173
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,185
Upon further investigation,
I found another soldier,

174
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:12,854
one who fit our circumstances,

175
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,323
but had never served
further west than Chicago.

176
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,502
And I found a murder
that fit our circumstances

177
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:19,194
but took place
in upstate New York.

178
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,863
The local constabulary
investigated

179
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,799
and attributed it
to marauding Indians,

180
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:27,069
supposedly seeking revenge
on a minister and his wife.

181
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:30,806
Where? What town?

182
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,074
New Paltz.

183
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:35,811
What is it?

184
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,015
Look at this. The other soldier
that drew my attention...

185
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,483
Corporal John Beecham.

186
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:44,219
Suffered from
a most noticeable facial tic.

187
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:47,623
Look at his place of birth.

188
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:49,291
New Paltz.

189
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,693
Coincidence?

190
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:54,496
I need to see the official
records, of course.

191
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:56,164
In the meantime,
ring Miss Howard.

192
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,635
- Let her know what we've found.
- Me? Why don't you tell me

193
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:01,637
what happened between
the two of you?

194
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:05,907
She's to use her authority to find out more
about this massacre from local officials.

195
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,856
Miss Howard? Telephone.

196
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:23,325
- Police headquarters.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:24,993
This is Miss Howard.

198
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:28,997
Sara? Listen to me.
We've found something.

199
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,932
There was a massacre
in New Paltz.

200
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,803
It's possible it was committed
by a man named Beecham.

201
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:36,271
John Beecham.

202
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,740
Go on.

203
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,409
16 years ago,
a minister and his wife,

204
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:44,279
savagely murdered,
supposedly by Indians.

205
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:47,949
They had a son that survived, and
he lives not far from Boston.

206
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:50,819
Kreizler and I intend to go
speak with him.

207
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:53,689
- His name's Adam Dury.
- Shall I meet you?

208
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,292
No, no. Kreizler feels you'll
be more useful where you are.

209
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,339
He'd like you to contact
the authorities in New Paltz

210
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:03,365
and see if they have any more
information on the murders.

211
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,501
But I can't just stay here.

212
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,103
Why isn't he calling me himself?

213
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,637
What?

214
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:10,772
Sara?

215
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,842
- I'm here.
- There's one more thing.

216
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:15,310
You're to inform the Isaacsons

217
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,978
they're to be
on the first train west

218
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:20,315
to rendezvous with John
Beecham's former commander.

219
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:22,784
I'll let them know.

220
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,424
- Sara?
- Yes?

221
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,793
Be careful.

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,922
Do you think we'll
see any buffalo in North Dakota?

223
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:01,124
If they haven't all been killed.

224
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,194
What about Indians?

225
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,997
If they haven't all been killed.

226
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:16,006
You know, why should I care
if that's Esther's baby?

227
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:20,077
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Believe what?

228
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,479
That I don't have feelings
for Esther.

229
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:26,950
I came into this world
two minutes before you did.

230
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,285
I know you better than anyone.

231
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,955
I know you better
than you know yourself.

232
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,890
You're in love with Esther.

233
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,970
Do you regret
not visiting Julia?

234
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,972
We hardly had time.

235
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,707
One makes time
when one wants to.

236
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,843
Then there's your answer.

237
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,914
I can't believe
we're bypassing New York

238
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:59,716
and going straightaway
to Godknowswhere.

239
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,386
Newton, Massachusetts.

240
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:08,125
May I ask, why are you
so interested?

241
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,727
Adam Dury lives there.

242
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,929
I meant in my seeing Julia.

243
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:16,934
I remember
when you first met Julia.

244
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,669
Your company was rather dull

245
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:21,238
because you could think
of nothing else.

246
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:28,279
What does it feel like when
you're in the first throes?

247
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:35,686
Restlessness, above all.

248
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:38,255
Your mind is never still.

249
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,028
You wait at a street corner in
case she happens to pass by...

250
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,764
attend a party
that you'd otherwise dread

251
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,067
in hopes she's been invited.

252
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:59,710
And you try to bring
every conversation back to love.

253
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,021
Are you Miss Howard?

254
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,156
- Yes.
- I'm Eliza.

255
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,158
Mrs. Kirkpatrick sent me
to fetch you.

256
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:53,897
From the boarding house?
Yes, Miss. Let me take your bag.

257
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,498
It'll be dark soon.

258
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,168
Mrs. Kirkpatrick said
I should take you

259
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,303
over to the old Dury place
in the morning.

260
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:02,505
What do you sell?

261
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,107
What do I sell?

262
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:07,110
Most of the boarders
we get are salesmen.

263
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,846
I work for
the New York Police Department.

264
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,850
I never heard of a lady working
for the police,

265
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,853
especially in New York City.

266
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,623
I'm the first.

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,666
Excuse me?
What are those mountains?

268
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:33,404
You mean the Gunks?

269
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:35,606
The Gunks?

270
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:39,610
Shawangunks. Locals call 'em
"Gunks" for short.

271
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,878
Do people climb them?

272
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,546
Yes. I climb them myself.

273
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:44,948
You?

274
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:49,086
Why shouldn't I?

275
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,228
Newton, Massachusetts.

276
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,875
I believe there's a factory
there that makes a biscuit

277
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,632
my grandmother is very fond of.

278
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,503
- Your grandmother?
- Yes, made with figs.

279
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:08,239
Ghastly sounding,
but she swears by them.

280
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,441
I think it best
we stay the night

281
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,175
and attempt to speak
to Mr. Dury tomorrow.

282
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,578
And no mention of
the Dury name to anyone.

283
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,647
You think there might be trouble?

284
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:20,484
Let's just say, I'd rather
he wasn't expecting us.

285
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:26,523
It's not respecting the dead.

286
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:29,592
- What isn't?
- This. You're sightseeing,

287
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:32,596
acting like a ghoulish tourist
visiting a gravesite.

288
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:36,533
People visit the pyramids.
They're gravesites.

289
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,669
That's different.
This is Sitting Bull.

290
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:42,540
Battle of Little Big Horn.
Custer's Last Stand.

291
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,677
Are you the men waiting to see
Captain Miller?

292
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:48,323
Yes. I'm Detective Sergeant
Marcus Isaacson,

293
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,147
and this is my brother...

294
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:13,837
You've come all this way to
inquire about Corporal Beecham?

295
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,507
- You remember him?
- Remember him?

296
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,643
It's been 10 years, and I can't
get him out of my head.

297
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,445
His army records state
that he was sent

298
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,047
to the Government Hospital
for the Insane

299
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,449
after being found unfit
for service.

300
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:32,255
It says you were the officer
who relieved him of his duty.

301
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:35,859
It was the Regimental Surgeon
who declared him unfit to serve

302
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:38,662
and sent him back east.

303
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,931
Would you say he was
a good soldier?

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,265
At first. He was disciplined,

305
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,868
attentive to detail, efficient.

306
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,337
Didn't get on with the other men,

307
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,849
but I put that down to him
being religious

308
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:51,808
and disapproving of
their whoring and drinking.

309
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:58,882
I've seen men driven to
bloodlust out here in the West.

310
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,619
Never in a place like Chicago and certainly
not in the course of a labor riot.

311
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:05,488
You're talking about the Haymarket riots?
That's right.

312
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,490
We were called in
to keep the peace,

313
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,026
but the violence got ugly.

314
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:12,229
A bomb thrown amongst police,
rioters shot and killed.

315
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:18,501
I mean, you must be halfcrazy
to do what he did that day.

316
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,971
What exactly did he do?

317
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:32,849
I came across him
sitting astride a dead striker,

318
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:39,723
Young man... boy, really...
İn a back alley.

319
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:45,929
He was stabbing at the body
with a knife, over and over.

320
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,865
That wasn't the worst of it.

321
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,202
He was naked.

322
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,936
Naked?

323
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:58,342
From head to foot,
drenched in blood.

324
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,213
Down there, between his legs,

325
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,016
he was stiff as a flagpole.

326
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:18,538
Jesus!
That child ever stop bawling?!

327
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:21,808
Well, it'd have helped if
her father took her for once.

328
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,276
That's enough from you, woman.

329
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:26,279
Let her suck on some candy.

330
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,681
Thank you, Mr. Byrnes,
but she's got no teeth.

331
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:30,883
Why don't you give it to
your namesake then?

332
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:35,688
Here you
go, young Thomas. You take it.

333
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,491
Got a tongue in your head,
haven't you? What you say?

334
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,627
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, young man.

335
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,964
Go on, git.

336
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,698
All o' ya.

337
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:53,506
They was two days
snooping around Washington,

338
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:56,509
in and out of various buildings
and such.

339
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,311
Do you know what
they were looking for?

340
00:20:58,313 --> 00:21:00,981
Cowboys and Indians, it seems.

341
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,116
Whoever does solve
these murders,

342
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,653
one thing's for certain...

343
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,188
İt's not going to be...

344
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:12,124
- That alienist?
- I'm not going to let him throw

345
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,728
30 bloody years of police work
out the window.

346
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,798
Do you understand me?

347
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:23,203
I'll let the Swede know
of your concerns.

348
00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:43,155
You knew them?

349
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,825
The Dury Family?

350
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:49,029
I knew them.
The whole town knew them.

351
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,897
The reverend and his wife,

352
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,165
Adam, their oldest.

353
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,767
My brother went to school
with the youngest.

354
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,302
Japheth.

355
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:01,374
He was the one
kidnapped by Indians.

356
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:07,380
That's what the papers
said at the time.

357
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:10,150
Whoa.

358
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:17,991
Can't keep the Sheriff waiting.

359
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:23,129
House is this way,
what's left of it.

360
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:26,599
You the gal from the city?

361
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:30,270
I'm Miss Howard of
the New York Police Department.

362
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:39,946
Well, I can't say Mr. Roosevelt
is a popular man in these parts.

363
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:42,949
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

364
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:45,252
My pleasure.

365
00:22:57,432 --> 00:23:03,770
Sheriff Early, are you familiar
with what happened here?

366
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,172
I was a deputy at the time.

367
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:08,475
I seen what was done to 'em.

368
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:12,379
And what was done to them?

369
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:17,717
Butchered.

370
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:20,320
Like hogs.

371
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,682
This here's
the Adam Dury farm, gentlemen.

372
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:52,619
Ho, now. Ho. Thattaboy.

373
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:32,192
Hello?

374
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,462
Mr. Dury?

375
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,066
Anybody here?

376
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:46,739
Mr. Dury, we only want to talk.

377
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:03,890
Don't suppose you know
where your master might be?

378
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,341
Good morning, Mr. Dury.

379
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:31,183
Mr. Dury, my name is
John Schuyler Moore,

380
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,920
and I work for
"The New York Times."

381
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:37,323
We've only come to talk.

382
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:40,060
We know you'd already left home...

383
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:42,529
when the event occurred.

384
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:44,464
"Home."

385
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:48,201
That's a poor description of it.

386
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,475
You ask me, old Reverend Dury

387
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:58,411
couldn't save anyone's soul
with his hellfire and damnation,

388
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:01,414
let alone redskins.

389
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:02,993
He weren't a missionary
very long 'fore he was

390
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:06,419
driven off the Plains
and back to civilization.

391
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,821
And when he come back here,

392
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,757
he brought pictures with him

393
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:14,226
of dead white folks...
Folks he'd seen mutilated

394
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,897
in the Minnesota Massacre of '62.

395
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:19,832
Pictures?

396
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,501
Photographs.

397
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,205
Awful, they were.

398
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:29,375
Used to show 'em
to the town children,

399
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:30,911
tell 'em that's what would happen

400
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:34,581
if you're not Godfearing.

401
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:37,250
Nobody liked him much...

402
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:39,051
or his wife.

403
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,653
And nobody blamed them Injuns

404
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,122
for coming all the way back here,

405
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,524
stealing their boy Japheth
and getting revenge on 'em

406
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,593
for whatever they done out West.

407
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:49,329
You really think it was Indians
that killed them?

408
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:51,397
That's what the record say
happened 16 years ago,

409
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:55,401
and that's what I say
happened 16 years ago.

410
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,805
So if you have no more questions,
I'll be on my way.

411
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:09,081
Don't believe a word he says.

412
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:16,556
Mr. Dury, we were hoping
to ask you some questions.

413
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:21,628
I don't speak ill of the dead...

414
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:24,897
even if they deserve it.

415
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:30,170
That is why you're here,
isn't it?

416
00:27:30,238 --> 00:27:34,106
We've no intention of disparaging
your parents, Mr. Dury.

417
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:36,309
It's the police investigation
of their deaths

418
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,311
that we believe was flawed.

419
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,583
Perhaps you'd care to talk about
a different aspect of the case.

420
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:46,319
Tell us about your brother.

421
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,190
Japheth?

422
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:56,196
What do you want to know
about him?

423
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:59,131
He'd be in town sometimes
after school,

424
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,533
fetching something
for his mother

425
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:04,671
or running errands
for his father.

426
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,808
He didn't have any friends,
not with that condition of his.

427
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,676
What condition was that?

428
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,679
His face was always twitching,

429
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:15,748
like he was in terrible pain.

430
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:25,692
Adam Dury didn't want
his parents' house. Nobody did.

431
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,429
I don't blame 'em.
It's full of ghosts.

432
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:53,253
I taught him
how to hunt with snares,

433
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:56,122
skin animals.

434
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:00,793
Thought it would do
some good, but...

435
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:04,064
but even then, he couldn't
escape her shadow.

436
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,733
"Her shadow"?

437
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:14,407
My mother. She was a...

438
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:22,014
A woman with no heart.

439
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,956
With me, it was mostly indifference,
but, with Japheth...

440
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:33,760
with Japheth, she was
at him all the time.

441
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:38,431
Telling him that he wasn't hers...

442
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:45,371
İt was maneating savages
left him on our doorstep.

443
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:52,546
She said that he was the bastard
child of the Red Injun.

444
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:56,849
And the only time
my poor brother's soul

445
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,721
knew any peace was when he was
in those mountains, climbing.

446
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,056
The spasms in his face
would stop,

447
00:30:04,126 --> 00:30:07,059
and it'd be still as a pond.

448
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,663
He stuck to the rock face
like a lizard.

449
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:12,799
I never seen anyone like
Japheth Dury.

450
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:15,067
You said he had no friends.
Did he climb alone then?

451
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,737
Mostly, though there was a time
someone else climbed with him.

452
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:21,341
Another fellow, a farmhand.

453
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,145
Older. Took a liking to Japheth.

454
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,413
I trusted him
to look after my brother.

455
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:32,953
He betrayed that trust.

456
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:39,626
Mr. Dury, what do you think
happened to your brother?

457
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:46,432
Japheth came home one night.
He was upset.

458
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,036
Sobbing, cursing...

459
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,775
Bleeding... down there.

460
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:05,852
I'd have ripped that man's throat out
myself, I'd ever gotten the chance.

461
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,921
This man... İs he still around?

462
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:11,123
In a manner of speaking.

463
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:14,961
- What manner is that?
- In a manner not of this Earth.

464
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:21,133
He died up in the Gunks.
Fell off a thousandfoot cliff.

465
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:23,736
That was right around the time
the Durys were killed.

466
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:26,006
Do you think it was an accident?

467
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:30,143
An accident?
His throat was cut from ear to ear.

468
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:31,611
His eyes were missing.

469
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,747
Do you remember his name?

470
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:39,085
I won't never forget it.

471
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:42,154
Beecham.

472
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,490
George Beecham.

473
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,497
Extra! Extra!

474
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,300
Come and get your newspapers!

475
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:55,569
Theodore.

476
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:58,839
I recently had a meeting
with Chief Byrnes.

477
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:02,109
ExChief Byrnes.

478
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:07,514
Excuse me. Could you box
that up for me, please?

479
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,982
Certainly.

480
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,521
Look, there's
no reason for you and Byrnes

481
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,524
to butt heads over
this child killer.

482
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:18,859
People aren't ready

483
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:22,863
for this new highfalutin
form of investigation.

484
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,933
They just want
this son of bitch caught.

485
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:28,669
It'd scare the people
if they were to find out

486
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,472
that an alienist could figure out
who the killer was

487
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,674
before their
police department could.

488
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:38,279
Why are you telling me this?

489
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:42,483
Because faith is a terrible thing

490
00:32:42,551 --> 00:32:44,818
to take away from a man, Theodore.

491
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:48,756
It's like
taking away his future.

492
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,228
You can't stop the future.

493
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,770
The facial spasms,

494
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:06,239
the hunting, the climbing...
İt has to be him.

495
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:08,775
I don't know why, but...

496
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,844
I almost feel sorry for him.

497
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:13,246
The better angels of our nature.

498
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,411
Laszlo, are you all right?

499
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,748
I don't believe it's hit bone.

500
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:52,085
You need to tie it off.

501
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,755
Why do you think we've been
followed all the way up here?

502
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:56,289
Because we know too much.

503
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,094
John, if I don't get away
and you do,

504
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,096
I need you to give someone
a message.

505
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:06,700
You'll have to deliver
that message yourself,

506
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:09,904
as I have no intention
of either of us dying today.

507
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:23,250
Laszlo, we must hurry.

508
00:34:23,318 --> 00:34:26,519
I think it's best
if we stick to the woods.

509
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:45,206
Is the pain better or worse?

510
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:47,140
Hard to tell.

511
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:51,678
I think my brain has
already habituated to it.

512
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:54,882
What did you want to tell me?

513
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,018
Your message.

514
00:34:58,087 --> 00:34:59,286
It's nothing.

515
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:02,956
I'm not a fool, Laszlo.

516
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:06,760
I've been in love enough times
to recognize that look.

517
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:12,900
"Dull," I think you called it.

518
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,139
Does she know how you feel?

519
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,576
Not the extent of it.

520
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:25,712
And is it reciprocated?

521
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:28,315
Yes.

522
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:34,187
Of course, I...

523
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,426
I suspected it all along, but
to actually hear you say it...

524
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,600
She's wonderful.

525
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:50,871
She'll make you very happy.

526
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,276
Look after her, Laszlo.

527
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:58,379
I shall do my best.

528
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:08,088
Well, I suppose I can brag that
I introduced the two of you.

529
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:19,133
I'm not speaking of Sara.

530
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,603
Who then?

531
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:27,842
Mary.

532
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:33,514
Mary?

533
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:38,652
I know it's hard to comprehend.

534
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:42,055
I've questioned my own feelings
many times.

535
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:46,193
I told myself it's concern
and duty on my part,

536
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,460
dependence on hers.

537
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:53,200
And naturally, I realize
how inappropriate it is, but...

538
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:57,871
there are certain things
a man cannot control.

539
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:04,077
I told you,
love resides in the heart.

540
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:07,614
Nonsense. It's still physiology.

541
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:14,555
My brain reacts to qualities
in her that I lack in myself...

542
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,290
Kindness,

543
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,292
warmth,

544
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,494
courage.

545
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:22,696
Humility.

546
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,165
That, too.

547
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:35,709
No one deserves it more.

548
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:48,655
You were jealous.

549
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,257
Come on.

550
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:29,582
Thank you, Mary.
If I didn't know better,

551
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,784
I would think that you never
wanted your room back.

552
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,727
Must be the Doctor.

553
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:59,344
Good evening, Miss. Um...

554
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:02,614
Pardon us
for letting ourselves in.

555
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:08,954
Is, the good Doctor home?

556
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:15,127
I mean, certainly,
he must be home by now.

557
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,699
We'll just have a look around.

558
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:26,104
Dr. Kreizler?

559
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:32,811
Where is he?

560
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,585
Where is he?

561
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:57,135
Upstairs?

562
00:39:57,204 --> 00:40:01,006
I'm sure you've spent many
a fine evening up there.

563
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:04,476
Cat got your tongue, has it?

564
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:07,012
Fine.

565
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,548
I'll have a look for meself,
so...

566
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:20,759
What do you think you're doing?

567
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:24,296
Answer me.

568
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:29,501
Run, Mary! Run!

569
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:30,836
Run!

570
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:37,309
Kreizler!

571
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:45,250
Kreizler! Where in the name
of God is he?

572
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,320
It's like that, is it?

573
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:55,927
Come here, you filthy shag!

574
00:40:58,532 --> 00:40:59,731
Me Leg!

575
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Aah!

576
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:07,072
Come here. Aah!

577
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:11,677
Give me that. Aah!

578
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,486
Aah!

1
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,189
Just a moment.

2
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,594
What is it, Mary?

3
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,043
- What's happened?
- Up on the new bridge,

4
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,811
he said something bad happened.

5
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:03,232
I found him down on the Bowery.

6
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,884
All right.

7
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,786
There you go.

8
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,624
My name is Dr. Kreizler.

9
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,895
Can you tell me what you saw?

10
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:32,052
It's all right.

11
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,413
Why was he wearin' a dress?

12
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:39,714
Sorry?

13
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,649
The dead kid.

14
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:44,189
He was dressed up like a girl.

15
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:48,360
Somebody cut him to pieces.

16
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,807
Are you sure it was a boy?

17
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,213
That's what the cops said.

18
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,684
Stevie? Ready the calash.

19
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,454
I need you to fetch Mr. Moore
and bring him to the bridge.

20
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,723
Tell Moore to bring his drawing kit.

21
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,937
And tell him I need details!

22
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,762
Where were you this evening?

23
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:02,463
At Mrs. Astor's.

24
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,399
Was Jack there?

25
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:14,242
I don't recall.

26
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:24,786
What is it?

27
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,722
Forgive me, John.

28
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,065
I love him.

29
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,394
For God's sake!

30
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,830
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Moore,

31
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:39,000
but there is a young lad here to see you.

32
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,669
He says it's very important.

33
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:45,506
What? Flora, dégage! J'ai
besion de la chambre.

34
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,788
Good evening, sir.

35
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:02,690
What can't possibly wait, Stevie?!

36
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,325
He said he needs you.

37
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:07,929
Hyah!

38
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:15,570
Where on earth are we going?

39
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:19,073
The cops is there, so he said
he wanted you to go take a look.

40
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,975
- Get out the way!
- Hyah! Move!

41
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,210
Take a look at what?!

42
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:23,878
No!

43
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:26,314
- My God!
- Hey, watch it!

44
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,484
Hang on!

45
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,285
Roosevelt's there.

46
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,154
You're gonna have to talk your way up!

47
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,356
For God's sake, Stevie, up where?!

48
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:02,583
No further.

49
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,619
And who might you be?

50
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,488
John Moore.
I'm with the "New York Times."

51
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,923
No reporters.

52
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,293
I'm not a reporter. I'm an illustrator.

53
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,794
Well, then, there's two good reasons

54
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,429
for you not to be going up there.

55
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:18,086
Commissioner Roosevelt sent for me.

56
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,776
Well... we sure wouldn't want
to be disappointin'

57
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:30,332
the commissioner.

58
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,609
Moore? What the hell are you doing here?

59
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:02,977
Theodore.

60
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,112
I gave strict instructions
not to allow anyone up.

61
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,275
He said you sent for him, Mr. Roosevelt.

62
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,617
Kreizler sent me.

63
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,363
I'm to capture an image.
I know nothing more.

64
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,487
Then he's got no business
being here, sir.

65
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:16,023
Especially if he's been sent
by that quacksalver doctor.

66
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,025
Dr. Kreizler would not
have made the request

67
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:20,027
had it not been important.

68
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,925
Very well, Moore,
if you think you can stomach it.

69
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,071
Git on, then.

70
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,983
Where are her eyes?

71
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,587
'Twas birds got 'em or rats.

72
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,990
Somebody's done you up good,
young Giorgio.

73
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,988
You're a hell of a mess.

74
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,561
You know this child?

75
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:28,700
I do.

76
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,077
Giorgio Santorelli.

77
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,664
He's a boywhore,
worked out of Paresis Hall.

78
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,004
'Twas was known as Gloria there, though.

79
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,472
Why must you call him "it"?

80
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,075
What else you call
a degenerate who dresses himself

81
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,688
as a girl for the pleasure of grown men?

82
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:45,479
Enough! You say the boy worked
out of Paresis Hall?

83
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,848
Who is the proprietor?

84
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:50,484
That'd be Biff Ellison
and Paul Kelly what own it, sir.

85
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,557
I want them in my office tomorrow.

86
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,600
But beggin' your pardon, Commissioner,

87
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,957
but summonin' a man like Paul Kelly

88
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,971
just because some little piece
of dago trash has been found...

89
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:02,730
My office tomorrow or your badge
on my desk, Captain Connor.

90
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,989
As you command, Mr. Roosevelt.

91
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,959
What kind of devil could do such a thing?

92
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:20,286
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

93
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:26,080
Fire setting in children
is often a sign of loneliness,

94
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,569
not malice.

95
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,518
Then there's the bedwetting.

96
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,887
The medical term is enuresis.

97
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:35,744
Bedwetting has connotations of shame.

98
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:38,159
That is unhelpful to a child.

99
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:42,751
The people who recommended you
said you treat adults, too.

100
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,299
That is correct.

101
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,602
But I've always found children's
minds to be more interesting.

102
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,404
What we'd like to know, Doctor,

103
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,239
is if you can cure Ezra.

104
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,675
Before we end up in a heap of ash.

105
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,678
As an alienist, I treat mental
and emotional disorders

106
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:00,782
in my patients, and I try
to alleviate their condition.

107
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:03,104
I do not presume to cure them.

108
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:13,027
The exercise room is over here.

109
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:15,830
One, two, three, four.

110
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:20,367
Good, children. One, two, three, four.

111
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:21,569
One, two, three, four.

112
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,625
The music room is down the hall.

113
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,472
The dormitories are upstairs,

114
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:27,708
and you may have seen the playground.

115
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,760
You look as if you like playing outdoors.

116
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,014
The man's a fraud.

117
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,003
It's good to see you.

118
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,326
You've caused me
a sleepless night, Laszlo.

119
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,841
The first of many, I suspect.

120
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,943
Forgive me, but I had no choice.

121
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,311
Roosevelt and his officers

122
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:05,858
would have never
allowed me on that bridge

123
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,148
and I thought they might be
better disposed to you.

124
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,617
Did you know the child?

125
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,924
Not this one.

126
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,656
Do you have the drawings?

127
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,213
Here.

128
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,555
Thank you.

129
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,341
Tell me what you saw.

130
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,760
Tell you?

131
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,101
It's all right there.
I've drawn it for you.

132
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,473
You've idealized it.

133
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,645
This looks like a martyred saint
in a Renaissance painting,

134
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:10,010
not a mutilated child.

135
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,318
It's no use to me.

136
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,783
Well, if that's what
you think of my work,

137
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:19,086
why did you drag me away
from a perfectly good evening

138
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,488
to witness a sight that
will probably stay with me

139
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,023
for the rest of my life?

140
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,081
Because I need to see what you saw.

141
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,669
I need your help in this matter, John.

142
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:37,717
I saw a boy,

143
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:40,274
dressed suggestively in girl's clothing,

144
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,476
who had been...

145
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,360
It was as if an animal
had torn him apart.

146
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:48,339
More specific. Deep wounds or shallow?

147
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,341
Precisely executed or haphazard?

148
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,810
Were the viscera exposed?
The guts, Moore.

149
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:55,346
I know what viscera are.

150
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,701
The boy's throat
had been cut to the bone.

151
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,122
His right hand was severed.

152
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,530
His chest and abdomen ripped open,

153
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,399
and the innards were left by his feet...

154
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:19,592
a kidney and a lung, I think.

155
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,513
And his genitalia had been removed,

156
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:29,185
and birds plucked out his eyes.

157
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:32,271
And his dress?

158
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,191
A white dress.

159
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,245
The same as any little girl might wear.

160
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:55,706
You still haven't told me
what this is about.

161
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,175
Are you supposed to interview
the suspect?

162
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,887
What suspect?

163
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,475
I'm sorry, Dr. Kreizler.

164
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:18,122
I wasn't told you were
consulting on these murders.

165
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,279
Please don't concern yourself,
Dr. Fuller.

166
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,215
I only just found out myself.

167
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,383
And how did Mr. Wolff come to be here?

168
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,019
He was discovered hiding in a
warehouse down by the new bridge.

169
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:28,295
The police had been looking

170
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,789
for him for a different murder.

171
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:30,845
And do they know who?

172
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,970
Another male prostitute like himself.

173
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,548
The police claimed he stabbed his friend

174
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,572
to death with a knife.

175
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:36,739
Then, crazed by blood lust,

176
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,052
went looking for his next victim.

177
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:41,210
No, no, no, no!

178
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,827
Has anyone questioned him,

179
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:43,890
aside from the police?

180
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:47,083
One of the wardens tried, but
Wolff almost gauged his eyes out.

181
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:51,487
Accompany them.

182
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:52,935
Thank you, Dr. Fuller.

183
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,387
Settle down.

184
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:20,416
May I ask what you're hoping
to achieve with this exercise,

185
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:21,751
Mr. Wolff?

186
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,636
The police have the lion's share.

187
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,938
My name is Dr. Kreizler.

188
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,936
I sometimes work as an alienist
for the courts.

189
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:44,403
Tell me, Doctor...

190
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,076
can you cure this?

191
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,036
There's no cure for advanced syphilis.

192
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:04,227
You have been charged with
the murders of Edwin Band and...

193
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:05,967
Edwin deserved it!

194
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:09,198
I'd kill him again if I could.

195
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,446
And the boy?

196
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:13,870
You're accused of cutting him to pieces.

197
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:19,147
Yes.

198
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:24,145
Police said you knew him
from Paresis Hall.

199
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,243
Do I look like a boy to you?

200
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,926
I wouldn't step foot in that molly house

201
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,833
full of rich pansies.

202
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,731
What are you looking at?

203
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,969
Do I stimulate you?

204
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,205
Does he remind you of Edwin?

205
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,603
Guard, please, open the door.

206
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,817
Open the door!

207
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:02,885
- Back up!
- Laszlo.

208
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,655
What are you doing?

209
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,069
Laszlo.

210
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:26,005
How do you know I won't hurt you?

211
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,566
You stabbed Edwin 20 times.

212
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,189
He must have hurt you deeply.

213
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,664
What color were Edwin's eyes?

214
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,252
Green.

215
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:11,220
The color of envy. He found someone else.

216
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,363
What color were Giorgio's eyes?

217
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,039
You did not kill that boy, did you?

218
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,791
No, I didn't.

219
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,502
Doctor?

220
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,352
What'll take me first...

221
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,314
the gallows or the pox?

222
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,246
I'm afraid in New York State,
it'll be the electric chair.

223
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:14,780
Either way...
your pain will be gone soon.

224
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,566
Captain Connor?

225
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,202
Did he do it? Was there a confession?

226
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,504
Let's just say, Linc,
we gave him a little bit

227
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,107
of the third degree,
and he melted like butter.

228
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,010
Chief Byrnes?

229
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:43,646
You have anything to do with
apprehending this Wolff fellow?

230
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,747
No.

231
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,260
I was just passing by to congratulate.

232
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,650
Captain Connor here.

233
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:50,186
I'm retired, as you know,
but I take great pride

234
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:51,887
in the achievement of my boys.

235
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:53,422
I'm Sergeant Doyle.

236
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,002
What do you think of the new
commissioner's policies

237
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,492
on department reform?

238
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:59,862
I say we give Mr. Roosevelt
all the rope he wants.

239
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,608
We'll see if he doesn't soon
hang himself with it.

240
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:03,532
AAnd a quote, sir?

241
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:05,112
WWhat have you been doing with your time

242
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:07,236
now that you're no longer
chief of police?

243
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,293
Speculating on Wall Street.

244
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,307
Mr. Morgan and some of his associates

245
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,242
have been most generous
with their advice.

246
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:14,910
- There's Kreizler.
- Dr. Kreizler!

247
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,912
Dr. Kreizler, a moment of your time.

248
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:22,752
As an alienist, have you been
asked to get another madman...

249
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:33,496
Dr. Kreizler!

250
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:34,897
Dr. Kreizler!

251
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,344
Dr. Kreizler.

252
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:52,014
That's him. I've heard about him.

253
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:19,738
Miss?

254
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,280
John Moore.

255
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,849
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

256
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:30,119
I've, um... WWe've come
to see the commissioner.

257
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,221
- Sara and I...
- I am Miss Howard,

258
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:34,223
an employee of the New York
Police Department.

259
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:35,825
You will please accord me the respect

260
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,660
that my position demands.

261
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,885
Our families have long been acquainted.

262
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:43,732
Miss Howard is the first woman
to hold a position

263
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,935
- with the police department.
- Excellent.

264
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,404
Perhaps Miss Howard can help
arrange an impromptu meeting

265
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,622
with the commissioner?

266
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,807
And how should I help do that?

267
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:56,545
With my "especially rosy mouth"
or my "sparkling blue eyes"?

268
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,569
- Sara, I did not...
- Miss Howard.

269
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,251
Certainly, Miss Howard,
it was a society feature,

270
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,491
and I only drew the illustration.

271
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,522
You don't have an appointment.

272
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,871
Let me introduce you
to Dr. Laszlo Kreizler.

273
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,560
Dr. Kreizler.

274
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,418
I've read your work.

275
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,735
I found it fascinating. Most of it.

276
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,304
Laszlo and I attended Harvard together,

277
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,606
along with the commissioner.

278
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:25,241
We're all old friends, you see,

279
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,543
which is why a surprise is in order.

280
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:30,112
No, but you can't
just go in there without...

281
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,942
Hello, my friend.

282
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,528
Moore. I might have suspected
you were behind this ambush.

283
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:47,040
I told them they needed an appointment.

284
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:48,742
Laszlo has something important
he would like to s...

285
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:51,200
The man being held for the
murder of the Santorelli boy

286
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:53,008
is quite innocent of the charge.

287
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,876
And just how would you know that?

288
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,778
Because I interviewed him.

289
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,337
On whose authority?

290
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:00,148
My own.

291
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:02,984
As usual, you've overstepped your bounds.

292
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:05,286
Stabbing a grown man in a heated argument

293
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:07,188
and the methodical disemboweling
of a young boy

294
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:09,190
are very different things.

295
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:11,392
I'm well aware of your theories,
Kreizler.

296
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:14,770
But at this juncture,
your expertise is not required.

297
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,499
I took it upon myself
to interview your suspect

298
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:21,694
because of an unsolved case
three years ago.

299
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,658
The Zweig twins... Benjamin and Sofia.

300
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:29,811
The boy was a patient of mine.

301
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:31,112
His parents brought him in

302
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,348
because he wished to dress as his sister.

303
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:34,882
And one day, they both disappeared

304
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:36,584
while outside playing.

305
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,264
At first, it was thought
they had run away,

306
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:41,589
but then their bodies were found
in a rooftop water tank.

307
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:43,691
The body of the girl was unremarkable.

308
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:47,161
However, the boy was cut
from sternum to pubis,

309
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:49,263
his innards displayed.

310
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,348
What are you suggesting?

311
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:53,735
That the Zweig murders
and the present one

312
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,003
are works of theater,

313
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,138
inspired by the same imagination.

314
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:01,676
One person committed both crimes?

315
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,378
Yes.

316
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:08,407
Gentlemen, I think this may
be a little indelicate.

317
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,455
Miss Howard.

318
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,596
And what is it you want from me?

319
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,998
I shall need to look at the
postmortem of the Zweig case

320
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:27,068
to see if there's a connection,
if one indeed exists.

321
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:29,904
I cannot allow that.
It is neither legal nor ethical.

322
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:33,608
Murderers like this exist
whether you accept it or not.

323
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:35,943
If I'm correct,
your men will be illequipped

324
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,456
to fathom the motives of a perpetrator

325
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,547
with an impulse to butcher young boys.

326
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:42,450
Furthermore, I should like access
to additional police records

327
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:44,719
to see if there are other
victims that you have missed.

328
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:46,699
I should have known when
I let Moore up on that bridge,

329
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:49,090
I'd be inviting this sort of incursion.

330
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,225
I cannot permit you
nor any other outsider

331
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,528
access to privileged information.

332
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,597
Just because you live by
your own set of rules, Kreizler,

333
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,899
does not mean I do.

334
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:00,167
Wolff did not kill that boy.

335
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:02,170
And that won't change,

336
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:04,872
no matter how many times
your men put a boot to him.

337
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,789
My God, Laszlo, sometimes you can be

338
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,558
as subtle as a blowtorch.

339
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,860
How long have you known Miss Howard?

340
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,046
No.

341
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,848
Long enough to ask her a favor?

342
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,249
I won't do it.

343
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,917
I will not ask Miss Howard

344
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:37,704
to get you the Zweig file.

345
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,755
Well...

346
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,960
someone has to illustrate
the society pages, I suppose.

347
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:09,820
Excuse me.

348
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,220
No, no, ccome right in, Miss Howard.

349
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,090
We've nothing to hide here?

350
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,025
The commissioner would like a word.

351
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,861
Miss Howard? Mind yer petticoat.

352
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:21,727
There's a sizable, hairless rat

353
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,765
been spotted about the station house.

354
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,669
Funny, Captain Connor.

355
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:30,572
I see only a little pink mouse.

356
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:34,643
I like her even more now.

357
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:43,786
Miss Howard.

358
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,754
Now what?

359
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,689
I have something to ask you.

360
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:48,734
Yes?

361
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:51,193
May I address you as Sara?

362
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:54,296
You may, but exclusive
of my official duties.

363
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:56,765
Sara, I would very much like to ask you

364
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,835
to get me the file on the Zweig case.

365
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,370
Have you lost your mind,
John Moore? I mean, honestly.

366
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:04,039
It would only be to borrow it.

367
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:05,774
It will be returned
with no one the wiser.

368
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,960
I'll be the wiser.

369
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:08,977
Kreizler needs the file.

370
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,646
Did he send you?

371
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,548
No.

372
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,852
Regardless, I will not betray the trust

373
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:18,198
the commissioner has shown in me.

374
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:20,555
Not for Dr. Kreizler,
nor for anyone else.

375
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,267
Sara, please.

376
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,103
We need your help.

377
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:46,875
Our graft... paid for
this building, Commissioner.

378
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:49,718
And lined the pockets of your men.

379
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,953
And now you drags us in here

380
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:53,622
like a couple of twobit sneak thieves

381
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:57,459
when you already got
your throat slitter behind bars.

382
00:28:57,494 --> 00:28:59,461
Now, where's the decency?

383
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:01,463
Might you have a pen, Mr. Ellison?

384
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,563
Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

385
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:10,138
I think what Mr. Ellison
is trying to say here,

386
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:12,693
Commissioner, is that we are businessmen.

387
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,510
In fact, we have enjoyed an understanding

388
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,823
with the police over the years.

389
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:21,183
And after all the profit
from your pandering, gambling,

390
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,661
and intimidation,

391
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:25,998
how much do you make
from this understanding?

392
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,166
A great deal.

393
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,931
Well, here's something else
for you to understand.

394
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,265
A child is dead.

395
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:39,701
A child exploited by you
and your brothel.

396
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,404
No more. I want Paresis Hall shut down.

397
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:45,747
- Shut down?
- You have until 6:00 today.

398
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,787
You can't do that.

399
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:48,770
I think the commissioner is right.

400
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:50,979
Best we close our doors on account

401
00:29:51,014 --> 00:29:53,048
of this sad turn of events.

402
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:00,789
- Here you go.
- Watch yourself!

403
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,194
Get the hell out of here!

404
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,965
Look out!

405
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:15,704
Move your fannies now, girls.

406
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,672
We open for business
in less than an hour.

407
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,909
And Jesus died on the cross
for your sins!

408
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,211
Never seen a girl before?

409
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:35,757
- Step right up!
- Come on, put your backs into it!

410
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,126
I took out a tenspot
to cover the inconvenience

411
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,628
of closin' down.

412
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:42,931
But you're only shiftin' 'em
across the street.

413
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:29,761
Will that be all, miss?

414
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,971
I can't decide whether
they abhor our shape

415
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,739
or crave another.

416
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:50,786
They believe us to be
delicate creatures, miss.

417
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,206
Then to hell with them.

418
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,218
Miss Howard.

419
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,774
How did you find me?

420
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,356
Your grandmother didn't
know where you were,

421
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,809
so I asked one
of your sporting companions.

422
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,221
He told me you were particularly
fond of this house

423
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,245
and could be found
slumming it here most nights.

424
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:05,817
This is an unsavory
neighborhood for a young lady.

425
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:07,719
I'm not here on savory business,

426
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,122
and every panderer, mawk, lush,
and billy noodle in the city

427
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:11,868
pass through the doors
of the police department,

428
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:13,932
not to mention the mutton
shunters that I work with.

429
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,561
So please don't concern yourself
with my blushes.

430
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,431
I've come to return your work.

431
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,546
And to give you the file
Dr. Kreizler asked for.

432
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,642
I don't know how to thank you.

433
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,255
If Dr. Kreizler finds
anything of interest

434
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,056
in these particular documents,
I should like to be told.

435
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,916
That is the only thanks I require.

436
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,405
I have it!

437
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:57,021
Laszlo!

438
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,373
I've got the Zweig file.

439
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:06,017
I do hope you thanked Miss Howard.

440
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,939
Well, what have you found?

441
00:35:33,974 --> 00:35:36,826
There's nothing here.

442
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:39,825
No details as to the kind of wounds,

443
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,480
no sense of how they were inflicted.

444
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,543
I... I need evidence.

445
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:09,753
Ma'am?

446
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:14,105
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.

447
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:44,913
I can only imagine
how you must be feeling, but...

448
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,773
let me assure you that the
disinterment was unfortunate,

449
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,608
but necessary, Mrs. Zweig.

450
00:37:56,717 --> 00:37:59,117
I read about the boy on the bridge.

451
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,933
About what he was wearing.

452
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,227
Your son's desire to wear
the same clothing as his sister

453
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:11,896
has little in common
with the boy on the bridge.

454
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:14,933
You said there was no need for concern.

455
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,449
You said our acceptance of
Benjamin was what mattered most.

456
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,789
And we believed you.

457
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,000
We trusted you.

458
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:36,354
Giorgio Santorelli dressed as he did

459
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,341
because he was a prostitute.

460
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,393
Benjamin was only following his nature.

461
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,727
Mrs. Zweig...

462
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:54,305
your son was the victim
of a very disturbed mind.

463
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,030
My Benjamin is dead.

464
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:07,685
Both my children are dead.

465
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:12,792
Because of you.

466
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:50,304
Gentlemen, this is John
Moore, friend and colleague.

467
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:52,884
Hello, Mr. Moore. I'm Detective
Sergeant Marcus Isaacson.

468
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,173
This is my brother, Lucius.

469
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:56,502
Detective Sergeant Lucius Isaacson.

470
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,545
Theodore didn't trust
the coroner's office

471
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,090
to keep silent about
revisiting the Zweig case.

472
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:04,017
It was good of Commissioner
Roosevelt to lend you to us.

473
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,686
May I ask how long we have
the benefit of your expertise?

474
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,306
As long as you like, Doctor.

475
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:10,801
I doubt my brother and I will be
missed at the police department.

476
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,528
I imagine your modern methods
don't make you very popular.

477
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:16,429
That and the fact we're Jews.

478
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,465
Has the commissioner told you
what this is about?

479
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,367
Only that we're to perform an autopsy

480
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:23,703
and keep the results
strictly confidential.

481
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:28,007
Benjamin and Sofia Zweig.
Their bodies were discovered...

482
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,143
Three years ago in a water tower
on Suffolk Street.

483
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,378
- We read the file.
- The injuries to the boy

484
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,781
are what interests me the most.

485
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:43,065
You've heard about the
Santorelli murder, I assume?

486
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,342
Of course.

487
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,914
If you're looking for similarities,

488
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:49,271
there's only so much we can tell
from a body in this state.

489
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:52,058
I want you to look at what remains...

490
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:56,020
each bone, each fragment
for every detail, every mark...

491
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,356
no matter how insignificant.

492
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:03,018
Anything that may connect Benjamin Zweig

493
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:04,487
to the Santorelli boy.

494
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:06,789
We will do our best, Doctor.

495
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,873
Get the "Tribune"! Get the "Tribune"!

496
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,034
Get the "Tribune"! Get the "Tribune"!

497
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,270
They won't be finished
for quite some time.

498
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:23,706
I thought we might get
an early dinner somewhere.

499
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,674
How can you think of eating now?

500
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,310
I don't recall you being so delicate.

501
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:30,246
I'm afraid once seen, those images

502
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,640
will remain forever in my head.

503
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,561
That's what I admire about you, John.

504
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:39,455
You represent the good that people want

505
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,490
to believe is in all of us.

506
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:43,901
It's why people like you more
than they do me.

507
00:42:02,295 --> 00:42:03,612
Thank you, Cyrus.

508
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:19,795
Get the "Tribune"! Get the "Tribune"!

509
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:28,637
Come!

510
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,842
- Cyrus!
- Sir?

511
00:42:33,878 --> 00:42:35,447
Were you away from the carriage
at any point?

512
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:36,704
No, sir.

513
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:40,198
What? Do you see something?

514
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,013
There.

515
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:57,800
Laszlo!

516
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:05,708
Laszlo!

517
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,544
Laszlo!

518
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:46,709
Laszlo!

519
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:35,657
Laszlo!

520
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:43,866
Where did he go?

521
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:04,219
Did you see the Santorelli boy's mouth?

522
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,469
I'm certain coldblooded
killers walk among us.

523
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:26,851
They're out there now, hidden,

524
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:29,444
yet their motives are understandable,

525
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,564
but this one is different.

526
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:36,694
His acts are so wretched, so evil that...

527
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,822
only if I become him,

528
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:44,243
if I cut the child's throat myself...

529
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:47,496
if I run my knife
through the helpless body

530
00:46:47,531 --> 00:46:50,708
and pluck innocent eyes
from a horrified face,

531
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:55,137
only then will I come
to truly understand what I am.

532
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,806
Only then will I recognize
that what drives me

533
00:46:57,842 --> 00:47:00,217
is not an absence of emotion at all.

534
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:02,970
Rather, a torrent of feeling.

535
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:05,147
The kind that gives meaning and purpose

536
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:06,915
to my own blackened soul.

537
00:47:08,686 --> 00:47:11,354
I must see life as he sees it.

538
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,982
Feel pain as he feels it.

539
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,444
Take the same path he takes.

540
00:47:19,363 --> 00:47:20,863
Yes.

541
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:23,198
I must follow this wherever it goes.

542
00:47:24,702 --> 00:47:27,787
Even if it leads me
to the darkest pit of Hell.

543
00:47:35,346 --> 00:47:36,945
What's wrong, child?

544
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:44,972

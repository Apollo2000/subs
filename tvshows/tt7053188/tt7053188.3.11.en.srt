- our relationship to Dixon...
- Mm.

162
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,958
...and then I will request
a transfer to another battalion.

163
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,039
Mm.

164
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:55,430
What?
Another battalion?

165
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:56,422
Yeah,
we talked about that.

166
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,554
- When?
- Months ago.

167
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,022
- You were yelling at me...
- That was way before...

168
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,101
- No, that was before you...
- Okay, we...

169
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,520
- we'll... we'll figure it out.
- Okay. Yeah.

170
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:04,452
Um, we will do
whatever we need to do

171
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:06,220
- to be together.
- Be together.

172
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,203
Just like you and mami.

173
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,719
Wait a minute, now.
That's different.

174
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,510
- How?
- We were in training,

175
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,679
and I was never
her authority.

176
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,010
I guess you made sure of that
by knocking her up.

177
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,924
For the last time, Andrea,

178
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,585
I did not force your mother
out of the academy.

179
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,607
- It was her choice.
- What choice?

180
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,889
What was she gonna do?

181
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,827
Carry 80 pounds of gear
up the stairs

182
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:26,060
while nine months pregnant?

183
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,220
Hi, there.

184
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,390
Do we know what we want?

185
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,850
Yeah...

186
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,250
Um...

187
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:33,758
- Um...
- I think we might need another minute.

188
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:34,882
Yeah.

189

192
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,758
Uh, it says here
colic can be soothed

193
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:46,712
by putting a warm bottle
on her belly.

194
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:47,969
Uh, Alexa,

195
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,211
can you add
a hot water bottle

196
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:53,047
and, uh, diapers
to my shopping list, please?

197
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:55,071
<i>I added
hot water bottle and diapers.</i>

198
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,211
- Why do you say "please" to her?
- Because I have manners!

199
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,597
O-kay.

200
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,626
Alexa,
turn off the music.

201
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,767
Please!

202
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:03,967
- Please?
- Hey.

203
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,601
Hey. Shh.

204
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,057
Whoa.

205
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,602
You guys look not good.

206
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,563
I need a bath
and I need an omelette

207
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,695
and I need a triple latte.

208
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:14,869
Did I say bath already?

209
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:16,200
I need so many things.

210
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,741
- Yeah.
- But first...

211
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,422
Here, and first,
you're taking this.

212
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,517
- No, no, no.
- Take her.

213
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,637
You know me and babies
are not...

214
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,375
Take the baby.

215
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,523
We've been getting more sleep
on duty than off duty, buddy.

216
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,929
Oh. Good.

217
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:33,297
Whoa. Hey.

218
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:34,548
Look at that.

219
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,207
She stopped crying.

220
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,515
I think she likes me.

221
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,597
Yep.

222
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,177
I'm in love.

223
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,517
How do I take
this thing off?

224
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,093
My brain isn't connected
to my hands.

225
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:46,251
How did you do that?

226
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,017
I guess she was tired.

227
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,227
Nighty night, chubs.

228
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,517
If I could move,
I would kill him.

229
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,927
What... What... What...
What are you even doing here?

230
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,469
It's your day off.
Go.

231
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:58,133
Be free and childless.

232
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,097
No, I was...
I was bored.

233
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,767
You were bored?

234
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,727
I see that.
I see that.

235
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,307
You know, they have these
in the military.

236
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:07,887
- Did you know that?
- I did.

237
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,057
And that was actually
part of how we came...

238
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,227
You know, when I was doing
trauma in Iraq,

239
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:11,967
I would have loved one of these.

240
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,137
I'm kind of surprised
that Bailey signed off on this

241
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:15,467
without a trauma surgeon
running it.

242
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:17,727
Hold on.
You've only got 10 chest tubes?

243
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,133
Well, we can only have
one patient

244
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,290
- in here at once, so...
- In Iraq,

245
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,752
we needed to be ready
for everything.

246
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,846
You know, we had to work on
multiple patients at once,

247
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,557
for over 24 hours
sometimes.

248
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,927
I mean,
it was a war, after all.

249
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,789
Well, the PRT is ready
for anything.

250
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,140
- I mean, I am ready for anything.
- Except a massive trauma.

251
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,765
What if there was
a city-crumbling earthquake

252
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,096
or a ferry-boat crash

253
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,677
or, you know,
the Seahawks stadium collapses?

254
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,427
Why would that ever happen?

255
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:40,307
You'd need more than
10 chest tubes if it did.

256
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:42,227
You know, I gotta tell you, man,

257
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,320
this is all good,
but

258
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,312
I kind of feel like

259
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,822
you're way off
being field-ready, here.

260
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,653
Hmm! Okay. Well, uh,
I've already been in the field.

261
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,966
I've cross-clamped an aorta,
alright?

262
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,492
I've placed a REBOA in
a traumatic bowel evisceration

263
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:56,056
and still got the patient
safely to the OR.

264
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,307
Hmm.

265
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,109
Well...

266
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:02,064
great job, then.

267
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:08,375
What?

268
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,118
Why have you only got...

269
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,328
- What... Where...
- Okay.

270
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,846
Alright, that's my stuff.
No, you got the wrong one.

271
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,079
It's supposed to be sterile.

272
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,847
<i>Back the hell up!</i>

273
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,307
<i>You stand right there.
You stand right there!</i>

274
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,847
I'll teach you to ignore
my orders.

275
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,137
I'll teach you
to waste my food!

276
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,141
I'm sorry, Dominic.
I just went to get the garlic.

277
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,391
Did I ask you to get
the garlic,

278
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,953
or did I ask you
to watch the steak?!

279
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,266
Sir, there... there's a fire
over there on your, uh...

280
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,453
Hey, ICE?

281
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,556
Yeah, I'd like to report
a lazy sack

282
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,790
of illegal crap
in my kitchen

283
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,637
at Domenico's
on Garden Sumpter Square.

284
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:38,967
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

285
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:39,968
What are you doing?! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

286
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,557
Man, what the hell?!
You're ruining my food!

287
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,137
- It was a grease fire.
- It would have burned itself out.

288
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,539
See, that's not a chance
you should be taking

289
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:46,620
so you can abuse your employees
while you cook.

290
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,145
Yeah, what are you, a cop?

291
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,183
I'm a Battalion Chief with
the Seattle Fire Department.

292
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,466
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

293
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,557
Who called
the fire department?

294
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,097
Did you really call ICE?

295
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,597
Or was it just a show?

296
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:58,427
Alright, come on, guys.
Someone clean up the grill!

297
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,637
If you placed that call,
I suggest you call them back.

298
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,307
See, if they come here,
you'll face penalties

299
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,807
for hiring
undocumented workers,

300
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,461
in addition to the many fire
hazard citations I will issue.

301
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,596
Just at first glance,
I can see enough hazards in here

302
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,967
I could shut you down
for a couple weeks... at least.

303
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,719
He was two years
ahead of me in college.

304
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,368
We were in
some art history class.

305
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,361
What was it?

306
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,363
Oh, uh, Modern Perspectives
in the Visual Arts, I think.

307
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,244
Yes!
Ugh, it was so boring!

308
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:32,760
I would just stare

309
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,500
at the back
of Emmett's head all class

310
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:35,556
to pass the time.

311
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,578
What? You did?

312
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:37,967
I told you that!

313
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,137
Dixon.

314
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,347
Yeah.

315
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:42,967
It's the mayor.

316
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,017
Um, but Emmett helped me
study for that class

317
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,132
and prepare
for the final,

318
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:48,927
but he was constantly
being chased after

319
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,137
by all the girls on campus.

320
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,637
I didn't think
I had a chance.

321
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:54,307
- That's not true.
- Don't listen to him.

322
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,307
Oh, I never do.

323
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:59,637
<i>Requesting additional
units to 2914 Fulham Road.</i>

324
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,137
That's the same address
as before.

325
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,058
It's two alarms.

326
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:03,347
That's bad, right?

327
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,057
It's not great.

328
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,767
Well,
then after graduation,

329
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,677
I saw him at the museum downtown
one day.

330
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,807
He was sketching
one of the paintings.

331
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:15,467
And I couldn't bring myself
to say hi.

332
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,851
And then...
This is so embarrassing...

333
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,137
I bought a damn membership
to the museum,

334
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,427
and I kept going back.

335
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,597
The next time I saw him
with his sketch book,

336
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,887
I sat down next to him
and I said, "Hi, Emmett.

337
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,181
It's been a long time."

338
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,137
He didn't remember me!
I did remember you.

339
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,597
- No!
- I did!

340
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:35,387
It's just, it... it...
It took me a second to remember,

341
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:37,347
- then I did.
- Oh, my God, you are such a dude.

342
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,137
As his supervising officer,

343
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:42,335
can you train him
to be less of a dude?

344
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,347
Every time I think that you've
learned your lesson, it's...

345
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:50,874
Uh, what?
I'm... I'm happy, Dad.

346
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,391
Why can't you just be
happy for me?

347
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,137
Happiness isn't everything!

348
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,597
Responsibilities,

349
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,057
being smart
about how your choices

350
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:58,807
affect your future and the
people around you... Mm.

351
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,280
Those matter just as much
as momentary...

352
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,388
<i>Both speaking in Spanish..</i>

353
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,367
Oh.

354
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,100
And he speaks Spanish.

355
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,513
You okay?
Where'd you go?

356
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,210
A little fire
in the kitchen.

357
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,134
What?
What happened?

358
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,117
The chef was berating
the line cook

359
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,427
and threatened
to call ICE,

360
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:29,177
ignoring the steak
on the grill.

361
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,057
He threatened to call ICE?

362
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,493
-  Well, that's low.
- Yeah.

363
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:34,017
Is the line cook
here illegally?

364
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,177
The word is
"undocumented," Dad.

365
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,467
I know what the word is,
Andrea,

366
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,227
but there are ways
to become a citizen.

367
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,531
- There are laws for a reason.
- Are you serious?

368
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,966
ICE didn't even exist
until 2003.

369
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,887
I don't need a lecture on ICE
from you, son.

370
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:49,267
I've had friends, legal friends,
detained, deported...

371
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,637
And you think that's okay?

372
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,927
I think sometimes
maybe they go too far,

373
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,677
but they are government
employees, like firefighters,

374
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,335
and for the most part,
they're doing their jobs.

375
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,876
- Right.
- Like Nazis did their jobs.

376
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:05,297
You're gonna let him get
away with that? Ryan was a cop.

377
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,625
He's not talking
about cops.

378
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,137
He's talking about ICE.

379
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,557
Either way, "Nazis"
is a false equivalence,

380
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,137
and it minimizes
the atrocities of World War II.

381
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,177
Well, yes,
it's a false equivalent.

382
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,453
You're right, sir,
but there are similarities.

383
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,188
And I have strong feelings
about all this

384
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:21,967
because my grandfather
was one.

385
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,141
Was one what?

386
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:24,843
Was undocumented?

387
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,017
Was a Nazi.

388
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:40,440
Thank you for making me
come outside.

389
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:42,939
Thank you for coming outside.

390
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,021
But, Maya,
you're very white.

391
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,772
Don't you think
you maybe should cover up?

392
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,733
Shut up!

393
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,921
Hey, ladies.

394
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,531
Name's Todd.

395
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:54,727
Hi, Todd.

396
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,017
Uh, bye, Todd.

397
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,467
Aw, man! You're gonna go
and break my heart like that?

398
00:13:58,551 --> 00:13:59,218
Mm-hmm.

399
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,558
Naw, see, we were just
stopping by

400
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:01,926
to see if we could
buy y'all some drinks.

401
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,218
We have our own drinks.
Thanks.

402
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,349
Oh, cool.
So, you two on a girls trip?

403
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,227
Something like that.

404
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,398
Sweet. Just blowing off
a little steam, huh?

405
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,266
Look, man, we're just trying to
have a nice time,

406
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,023
so would you mind?

407
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,044
Oh, you having a nice time
is all I want.

408
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,129
Oh.

409
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,843
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

410
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,137
Spanish?
I took Spanish!

411
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,467
Hola. Cómo está?

412
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,887
Okay, Todd,
you want to have some fun?

413
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,347
Hell yeah.

414
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,177
Okay, if you can do
more push-ups than me,

415
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,597
you can buy us drinks,

416
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,017
but if I can do
more push-ups than you,

417
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:33,427
you buy us drinks

418
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:34,597
and then you leave us
the hell alone.

419
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,813
I like a feisty woman.

420

You made a face.

449

- Yeah, I-I didn't make a...
- Yeah, just a little.

with Pierce.

453
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:59,707
So, you're telling me
you miss trauma?

454
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,011
Uh, hearts
are my greatest love.

455
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:04,508
And you know, my baby girl
Allison is a close second.

456
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,386
I thought I was gonna miss
trauma, but I got to tell you,

457
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,461
motherhood
is traumatic enough.

458
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:12,137
I mean,
every day, she changes,

459
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,637
and every day,
I grieve that change.

460
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,017
I mean, she grew this
new little tooth,

461
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,927
and I miss
those toothless gums.

462
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,977
And she learned how to crawl,
and, you know,

463
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:22,664
I miss holding this little lump
in my arms.

464
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,517
And I cry like 10 times
more often

465
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:25,807
than I did
before she was born.

466
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,517
And I thought at first
it was hormones.

467
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,664
I'm... I'm so sorry.

468
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,952
No. No.

469
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,193
No, Ben, I'm...
I'm really sorry. I forgot.

470
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,966
Teddy,
you are allowed to talk

471
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:40,304
about how much you love
your baby girl, as long as

472
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,249
I'm allowed to think
about how much I miss mine.

473
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,250
Yeah.

474
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,042
As exciting as the notion
of doing a sternotomy

475
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,713
in an OR on wheels is...

476
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,174
Mm, come on.

477
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,635
...motherhood is profoundly
sleep-depriving.

478
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,201
And I just...

479
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,155
I can't add
overnight shifts.

480
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,048
This is one
of my favorite pieces.

481
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,137
That's extraordinary.

482
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:12,952
Isn't it?

483
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:14,833
Emmett refuses
to finish it for me.

484
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:18,034
Okay, babe, I think Travis has
seen enough of my so-called art.

485
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:21,032
Emmett, seriously, some of this
stuff is remarkable.

486
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,778
It's like a cross
between Kiefer and...

487
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,159
Yes! Kiefer and...

488
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,320
- Um, someone.
- ...someone.

489
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:27,781
Exactly.

490
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,912
You have to come to
the museum with us one day.

491
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,233
We'd have so much fun.

492
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,773
Mm, Alicia, Travis has
a life of his own, you know?

493
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:37,296
I know, I just want him to be
part of ours, too.

494
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,366
Alright,
enough with the art talk.

495
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:42,331
Montgomery, how's Emmett
shaping up on the job?

496
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,622
Is he gonna make lieutenant
on his own,

497
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,289
or am I gonna have to
pull some strings?

498
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,386
- Dad.
- Relax, Emmett. You have ime.

499
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:49,687
I don't need you to be
wearing bars on your uniform

500
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,390
for another six months.

501
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,137
That would be fast.

502
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,847
Not if his training officer
wants to keep his job.

503
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:58,468
Chief Dixon, there's a lot to
learn on this job,

504
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:01,466
and you got to learn most of it
while running through an inferno

505
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:03,391
or keeping someone
from bleeding out.

506
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,491
You think he has the grit
for that?

507
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,241
A few decades on the job,
we'll toughen him up.

508
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,056
Yo. Yo!

509
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,718
No. Those are expensive.

510
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,097
Aren't you, like,
a prince or something?

511
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:29,097
Yeah, well, I was.

512
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:30,679
That was
before they cut me off.

513
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,937
Like, actually?

514
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:36,156
Like, not a single text.
Accounts closed.

515
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,507
Dude.

516
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah, I mean, it's... it's all good.

517
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:40,727
Lord knows
I should have been cut off

518
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,250
a long time ago.

519
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:45,677
I just wish I stashed, like,
some cash away in a boot.

520
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:48,767
The Crabby Granny Nanny agency
is getting expensive.

521
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,468
Want me to
kick anyone's ass?

522
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,257
You're offering to
kick my mom's ass?

523
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,819
Yeah.

524
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:54,977
- No?
- No.

525
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,516
Your dad, maybe? No?

526
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:00,234
Okay, well, at least
you have Pru and Hughes.

527
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,922
You guys are kind of like
a family.

528
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,253
That's my child,
and Huey just lives here.

529
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:05,727
Wow.
That's nice, Miller.

530
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,387
What?
Would you put some clothes on?

531
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,872
We have company.

532
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:10,481
What company?
It's Gibson.

533
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,182
Yeah, I see her in a towel
all the time, dude.

534
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,813
See?
No one cares.

535
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,619
No, I care, and I don't want to
confuse Pru, so...

536
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:18,324
Oh, my towel's
what's gonna confuse her?

537
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,347
Okay.

538
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,115
I'll change.

539
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,653
Sorry.

540
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:30,123
That therapist
get in your head at all?

541
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,373
- Nah.
- Yeah. Me, neither.

542
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,435
My grandfather... Opa...

543
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,726
He, uh, lived with us
when I was a kid.

544
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,232
He never really
learned English.

545
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:47,494
So we spoke German at home
for him.

546
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:51,017
My parents were doctors,
always working.

547
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,557
<i>Speaks German...</i>

548
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:56,357
He taught me how to ride a bike,
taught me how to fish.

549
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,849
You know
Melita Maschmann?

550
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,888
She wrote a war memoir,
right?

551
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,818
Yeah.

552
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,677
I know things.

553
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:09,017
She was a Nazi propagandist
in the war.

554
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,767
In the '60s,
she wrote an autobiography

555
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:13,099
explaining why she became
a Nazi.

556
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:16,954
And I was 12 years old,
had to do a book report,

557
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,925
come across this book
in the library

558
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,006
and figure, "Hey, I can read
this in the original German.

559
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,677
That's got to be good
for extra credit, right?"

560
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,638
So I come home from school,
Opa is there with my lunch,

561
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,418
and he sees me put the book down
on the table

562
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:37,013
and just goes... dead white.

563
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:40,857
I ask him what's wrong,
and he starts to cry.

564
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:47,115
And he says, "Today is the day
where you start to hate me."

565
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:50,517
He... He was a soldier
in the war?

566
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:54,029
No, he was a Nazi.
Believed.

567
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,574
But I mean, obviously,
your dad...

568
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,482
What?
Married a black woman?

569
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:01,388
Yeah,
prejudice is stupid.

570
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,084
It doesn't have to
make sense.

571
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:06,427
But he cried.
So he had regrets.

572
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,256
He regretted
my finding out.

573
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,017
He knew I would never
understand.

574
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,056
And here I am looking
at pictures of people

575
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,131
who've been
starved to death in camps,

576
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:20,084
piled them in mass graves.

577
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:24,056
I mean, I was 12 years old.
I knew history.

578
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,177
I knew about all the evil things
that happened in this country

579
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,943
to the people
that look like me.

580
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,107
But now there was someone
in my family, someone I loved,

581
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,607
who did
those kind of things?

582
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,967
And he tried to
explain to me.

583
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:43,520
He said, uh
"Sometimes a nation in crisis

584
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:46,374
needs the patriot
who does the unspeakable."

585
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,017
Mm.

586
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,548
No, he was right.

587
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:57,091
That day,
I started to hate him.

588
00:21:57,873 --> 00:22:00,154
Six more years
I lived in that house.

589
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,177
I never spoke to him again.

590
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,637
See, the Gestapo,
the Geheime Staatspolzei,

591
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,818
the secret state police,

592
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,578
were legitimate law enforcement
for Nazis.

593
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,045
They were
government employees,

594
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,512
storming into homes,
into schools, into restaurants,

595
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,103
ripping parents
from their children,

596
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:20,684
ripping husbands
from their wives

597
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:24,037
and then shipping them off
to detention centers.

598
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,451
People think what happened in
Germany could never happen here.

599
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:31,428
There have been multiple reports
of sexual abuse

600
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,186
on women and children
by guards

601
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:35,670
in our detention centers
right here.

602
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,809
And we just scroll
through those reports

603
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:43,496
and shake our heads
and do nothing.

604
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:47,286
If we do nothing when we see
our fellow human beings,

605
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,967
our neighbors,

606
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:52,277
being abused,
detained...

607
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,996
...what happens next?

608
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:06,791
Yeah, you're gonna have to
finish lunch without me.

609
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:08,610
Wha...

610
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,526
Andrea. Andrea.
Don't get involved.

611
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,402
Andrea!

612
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:18,728
Hey, Travis.

613
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:19,807
- Oh!
- Hi.

614
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,017
- Hi. Hi.
- Sorry.

615
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,097
Can I ask you
a question?

616
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:24,807
Yes.

617
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:27,347
Do guys
ever tell each other stuff,

618
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,051
like, relationship stuff?

619
00:23:30,136 --> 00:23:33,449
Well, I-I don't know
what straight guys do...

620
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,639
Wait, are you gay?

621
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:35,780
Yeah.

622
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,636
Oh, my God.
You seem so straight.

623
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:38,753
That's not...

624
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:40,285
Sorry, uh,
that came out wrong.

625
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,016
I j... I just meant
I didn't realize.

626
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,762
Oh, I've always wanted
a gay friend.

627
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,677
- Alicia.
- Right. Sorry.

628
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:49,517
Uh, so, Emmett and I

629
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,597
have been together
for like six years

630
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,796
which is longer than
some of my friends' marriages,

631
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,177
and I really want to
get married,

632
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,460
but he hasn't proposed.

633
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:00,121
And I'm thinking
I should just do it myself,

634
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,390
but that's weird,
isn't it?

635
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,931
I mean,
I guess it's modern.

636
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:07,137
I don't know.
It... Is it desperate?

637
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,137
Alicia. You're young.

638
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:11,227
You're in absolutely
no rush...

639
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,387
I know, I know, I know.

640
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,485
My mom says that to me
all the time.

641
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,083
But...

642
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,551
I just love him so much,

643
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:21,472
and I want to be there

644
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:24,153
to take care of him
when he's old.

645
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,817
That's a wonderful way
to feel about someone.

646
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,795
But, um, and I'm saying this
as your new gay bestie...

647
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,645
...firefighters don't always
get to grow old.

648
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,051
It's a dangerous job.

649
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,472
Yeah, but they don't make
the new guys

650
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:41,767
do the dangerous stuff,
right?

651
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,442
He won't always be new.

652
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,981
He'll have to do
the hard stuff.

653
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:49,192
In this job,
we lose people all the time.

654
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:50,404
Important people.

655
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,641
People... we love.

656
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,511
Who did you lose?

657
00:24:58,821 --> 00:24:59,886
My husband.

658
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:03,715
I'm so sorry.

659
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,114
Look,
all I'm saying is...

660
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,825
if you marry Emmett,

661
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:14,528
you are signing up for
a lifetime of heartbreak, okay?

662
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,247
I promise you.

663
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,255
Will you look out for him?

664
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,958
So I don't lose him?

665
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:26,934
Yeah.

666
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,090
Yeah, I'll... I'll...
I'll look out for him.

667
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,839
♪ Pru's the silliest girl
I know ♪

668
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,050
♪ Girl I know, girl I know ♪

669
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,901
♪ Pru's the cleverest girl
I know ♪

670
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:43,778
Made-up songs
disturb my sleep.

671
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:45,237
Sing a real song or zip it.

672
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,541
Hey, don't be jealous

673
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:49,026
'cause Uncle Jack's
got her sleeping like a rock.

674
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:53,269
An adorable
chipmunk-cheek shaped rock.

675
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:55,667
And now she's laughing in her sleep.

676
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,183
Do you hear that gurgle?

677
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:58,698
That is a laugh.

678
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:02,677
See, babies
really value me.

679
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,387
Mnh-mnh. Babies don't laugh
at that age.

680
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,573
If she did, it's gas.

681
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,191
You're making my daughter fart
in her sleep.

682
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:14,987
You know,
I miss living here.

683
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:19,059
Moved in with Andy,
and she's never home.

684
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,310
I may as well live alone.

685
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,957
Why is she never home?

686
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,445
Mm.

687
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,969
She's seeing someone.

688
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,828
Okay.
Give me the gossip.

689
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:31,079
Don't hold back.

690
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:33,625
Don't know who.
She won't tell me.

691
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:35,610
You want to trade?

692
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:38,055
You live here
with Huey and Pruey,

693
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,926
I stay at your place,
get some sleep?

694
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:43,291
Hear that?
Laughter.

695
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:45,969
Believe what you need to.

696
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:48,235
I am going back to sleep.

697
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,107
Officers, I swear I had no idea
this man was undocumented, okay?

698
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,888
He must have faked his ID.
The moment I realized, I tr...

699
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,929
No, no, no, I'm... I'm...
I'm sure you had no idea.

700
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:01,100
I'm gonna need you to step out
of the kitchen for me, sir.

701
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,761
- This is my kitchen.
- Right now it's mine.

702
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,222
And the same way
I'm gonna have to decide

703
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:06,886
whether to arrest this man for
being in this country illegally,

704
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:08,530
I'm gonna have to
decide whether to write you up

705
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:09,557
for employing illegals.

706
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,420
You getting in my way
of doing my job

707
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,471
is gonna make writing you up
a lot more fun.

708
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:19,399
Seattle Fire Department.

709
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,060
Somebody called in
a kitchen fire.

710
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:22,107
There's no fire here.

711
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,488
SFD?
Where's your uniform?

712
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,733
Off duty, in the area, picked up
the call on the radio.

713
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:32,967
All kitchen staff
over there.

714
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,307
She's a firefighter,
and she's with me.

715
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:35,387
There's no fire here.

716
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,427
Smells like
there was one, though.

717
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:37,560
Was there a fire here, sir?

718
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:40,021
- On the grill.
- And, uh, are you injured, sir?

719
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:41,835
Y-Yes.

720
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,427
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

721
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,967
Herrera,
check him for injuries.

722
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,927
Okay, hold up.
Alright, this is my scene.

723
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,084
Everybody
just stay where you are.

724
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,016
No, sir, this is my scene.
Somebody called in a fire.

725
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,137
There are injuries
and possibly smoke inhalation,

726
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:55,227
which gives me
the command of the scene.

727
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:58,771
I see a second-degree burn here.
Chief, call it in.

728
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:00,576
Ma'am, you need to step away
from the illegal alien.

729
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,209
He has
a second-degree burn.

730
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:03,443
If it doesn't get treated,

731
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:04,991
it can get infected
or even gangrenous.

732
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,185
- Alright, let me see it.
- I can't.

733
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,016
Exposure to air is very bad
for this type of wound.

734
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,521
You know, we will get him medical
attention at the detention center.

735
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,560
- Come on.
- What, uh, crime

736
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:13,443
are you charging him with?

737
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:14,615
His boss called
and reported him.

738
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,099
For burning a steak?

739
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,560
Is that really what you're gonna
arrest him for?

740
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,248
- He's illegal.
- How do you know that?

741
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:23,409
Alright, everybody,
IDs out now!

742
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,154
I'm gonna show you how I know.
Mm-hmm.

743
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:27,388
Um, a fire was called in.

744
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,230
This is my scene.

745
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,248
Chief Sullivan, you need, uh...
Need some extra hands?

746
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,607
Yes, thank you.

747
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:46,474
Captain Herrera, could you
please check these folks

748
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,271
for signs of smoke inhalation?

749
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,936
Captain Herrera, Station 19.

750
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,596
Nice to meet you all.

751
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,521
Can I put my hands
on your back?

752
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:55,529
I need to check your lungs.

753
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,256
Yeah, this is Battalion Chief
Robert Sullivan.

754
00:28:57,341 --> 00:28:59,701
I need an aid car for a patient
with second-degree burns

755
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:02,560
at 924 Sumpter Garden Square.

756
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:03,923
Take a deep breath for me,
please.

757
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,240
Well, then, send the PRT.
Yes, that's right.

758
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:06,896
Listen, all of you,
pull out your IDs.

759
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,076
We will check them

760
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,527
while the old man
checks if you're breathing.

761
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,834
What cause do you have for them
to show you their papers?

762
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,404
You need to settle down,
Chief.

763
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,735
You're out of your lane.

764
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,279
Officer, this is America.

765
00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:19,974
In America, we have rights.

766
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,146
Now, these people have given you
no cause to show you anything.

767
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:25,420
Now, if they wanted to run
right now, without a warrant,

768
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,287
you would have no basis
to chase them.

769
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,013
- Oh, my God!
- Enough!

770
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,844
The floor
is really slippery.

771
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,724
Sorry about that, guys.
You guys okay?

772
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,248
- Alright.
- Alright, I can arrest each and every one of you

773
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,750
for obstructing justice,

774
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:47,411
for conspiracy
to obstruct justice,

775
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,373
and for aiding and abetting
an illegal in my custody!

776
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,381
He wasn't aiding anyone.
He slipped on a wet floor.

777
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,677
I'm a witness to that.

778
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:54,848
And nobody
was in custody, either.

779
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,679
Now, I'm sorry
for the fall, guys.

780
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,060
Now, if anybody's hurt,
paramedics will check you out.

781
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,178
Oh, you have a CO2
laser scalpel?

782
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:12,927
Yep!

783
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:15,256
You planning on doing
plastic surgery in this thing?

784
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,757
Of course not,
but, you know,

785
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:19,599
you never know when a guy's face
will get chewed off by a bear.

786
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,521
And don't worry, man,
we got a traditional Bovie here

787
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,709
ready to go
for all things trauma.

788
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:28,287
And, uh, look, I-I know
trauma's not your thing,

789
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:31,628
usually, but look,
I've seen you in the pit, right?

790
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,669
In a crisis, you get calmer,

791
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:35,080
and that's what I need in a partner.

792
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,451
<i>PRT 19 requested
to 924 Sumpter Garden Square.</i>

793
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:40,123
- What, is that us?
<i>- Severe burn.</i>

794
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,552
Oh, that's us.
Uh, and don't worry.

795
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,433
It's normal to get, uh,
excited about injured people.

796
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,605
Get changed on the way.

797
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,037
Now?

798
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:49,828
- Oh, can I go down the pole?
- We'll talk about it.

799
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,943
- And can I do... cut a...
- We'll talk about it.

800
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,216
If he's so badly hurt, how come
you're not treating his burn?

801
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,592
I already told you.

802
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,849
We can't expose
this type of burn to air

803
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,365
if we hope to
preserve the skin.

804
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,474
I've never heard
of anything like that.

805
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,065
Well, when you've trained
as a paramedic,

806
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,576
come back and share your
expertise on wound care with me.

807
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:07,978
You just throw
some butter on it or something.

808
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:11,574
That is literally the worst
thing you can do for a burn.

809
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:13,683
Where are you from?

810
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,314
Seattle.

811
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,685
What's your ethnicity?

812
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,209
I'm an American citizen.

813
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,529
You got identification
to prove that?

814
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:20,771
You know,
he really doesn't have to be

815
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:22,612
- speaking to you right now.
- Alright, that's enough.

816
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:24,321
You're not gonna show me
a burn,

817
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:25,732
there is no evidence
of an injury,

818
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,709
and that makes this
my jurisdiction.

819
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,482
Remove your hands from my
suspect, lady, now.

820
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:31,677
- Officer.
- Okay.

821
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:34,838
Respectfully,
that's a mistake.

822
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,935
The last thing you fellas need
is a bunch of bad PR.

823
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,159
The bleeding hearts
are just looking for reasons

824
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,818
to talk crap about you
in the papers.

825
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:44,269
"ICE denies necessary
medical treatment

826
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,893
in front of
Seattle Fire Department"?

827
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:47,865
That's some nightmare PR.

828
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,209
And, sir,
that paramedic is my child.

829
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,826
You point a gun at her,

830
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,295
I'll be the first
to go to the press.

831
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,775
...been to the mall since.

832
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,547
I, uh... I should get going.

833
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,457
Yeah. Dixon.

834
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,917
Alright, I'm on my way.

835
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:12,708
Fire at the recycling plant's
up to three alarms.

836
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:14,973
The Chief has to make
an appearance.

837
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:16,895
- Good to see you, Lish.
-  You too.

838
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:18,286
Well, three alarms.

839
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,466
Shouldn't we
be responding to it?

840
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,481
You worry about it
when it gets to five, hmm?

841
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:39,191
What do we have here?

842
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:41,692
Second-degree burns.
Scalding injury.

843
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,419
Warren,
we already told the agent here

844
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,790
that exposure to air
can increase

845
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,919
the danger of infection
with this sort of wound,

846
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:48,300
and it needs to be treated
at a hospital.

847
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,325
I'll ride with you.

848
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,184
Our patient doesn't actually
need to speak to you guys

849
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,225
without an attorney present,

850
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,158
so no need
for you to ride with us.

851
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:56,449
You can meet us
at Grey-Sloan, if you want.

852
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:04,488
- Four-alarm fire.
- It's gonna be five.

853
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:05,833
Let's go.

854
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,424
What if I came to
your fire

855
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:08,755
and got in the way
of you doing your job?

856
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,723
Well, I'd probably
turn the fire hose on you.

857
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:16,192
Damn.
I miss fighting fires.

858
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,192
No, no.

859
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:27,630
Don't do that!

860
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,921
Ohh.

861
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,661
Four alarms?

862
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,731
Anything you can help with
from a thousand miles away?

863
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,192
It's a four-alarm fire.

864
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:37,893
Th-They're expecting it
to get to five.

865
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,854
They're calling everyone in.

866
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,735
They will call
everyone else.

867
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,696
They... They are
gonna put out the fire.

868
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,552
It's... Okay, I'm...

869
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:50,501
I'm... I'm...

870
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:51,911
I'm the captain.

871
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,322
I should be there.

872
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,453
A f... A five-alarm fire is,
um...

873
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:57,911
- Maya.
- I should be... I should be with them.

874
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,442
I've never been this far away.
Maya.

875
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:02,669
- And now I'm too... I'm too far away.
- Maya.

876
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,130
Maya, cal... Okay, Maya,
you're having a panic attack.

877
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,520
It's okay. It's okay.
I've got you.

878
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:08,130
They are gonna put out
the fire.

879
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,942
- But what if...
- What if somebody gets hurt?

880
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,794
There are emergencies in every
state and in every country

881
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,434
during every hour in every
minute of every single day.

882
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,036
And they all get solved and
fixed, even without you there.

883
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,169
It will be okay.
They will be okay.

884
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,450
It's... But, um...

885
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:23,599
Okay. Okay.
O-Okay. Look... Look at me.

886
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,060
Look at me.

887
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,181
Yeah, y-yeah, look at me.

888
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,472
Your eyes
only need to be on me.

889
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:29,143
No, no, no, no, no,
eyes forward.

890
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,560
No, eyes forward.
Eyes only on me.

891
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,391
Good. Breathe.

892
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:38,468
Good.

893
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:39,825
Just pull up
right out front.

894
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,827
<i>Got it.</i>

895
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,575
I didn't break any laws.

896
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,505
Sir, it... it doesn't matter
to us what...

897
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,068
It matters to me!

898
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:48,689
I work hard.

899
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:50,529
My wife works hard.

900
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:54,216
In my country,
I was a teacher until the war.

901
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:57,904
And then we had to flee f-for
our lives with our children.

902
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:00,540
I am not a criminal.

903
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,956
I work hard.

904
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,263
I'm so tired.

905
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,372
I get so tired.

906
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,536
I didn't break any laws.

907
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,224
Okay.

908
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,540
Okay, sir.

909
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:17,935
We... We believe you.

910
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,935
Do you know how rare it is

911
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:28,310
to have someone
who does not look like me

912
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,381
or talk like me

913
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,708
look me in the eye?

914
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,005
Let's not take him
to the ambulance bay.

915
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,115
Alright, Beto,
there's a side door

916
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,247
in the parking structure,
okay?

917
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,332
All exits there
lead to the street.

918
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:54,599
We're doctors, Warren.
We're not cops.

919
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:56,388
If someone jumps out and runs,

920
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:57,933
there's not really much
we can do.

921
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:04,411
Nurse Carson.
Change of plans.

922
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:13,360
Uh, well,
enjoy your day off.

923
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:14,919
It was great meeting you,
Alicia.

924
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,677
You have to come have dinner
with us one night.

925
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:17,833
It'll be so fun.

926
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:19,630
Yeah.
That would be fun.

927
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,029
<i>Five alarms</i>

928
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,115
<i>at 2914 Fulham Road.</i>

929
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,381
<i>Recalling all units.</i>

930
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,240
Okay.

931
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:26,615
Okay.

932
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:33,786
Wow!
I heard about this thing.

933
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:36,207
You guys really do surgery
in a truck?

934
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,306
Well, this truck

935
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:38,927
is a half-million dollar OR
on wheels.

936
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,138
So have a little respect.

937
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,344
But, uh, if you ever want to
take a shift, let me know.

938
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:44,925
Sweet.

939
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:47,028
Dr. Avery.
Cool suit.

940
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,618
Thanks.

941
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:50,159
So, uh, how's his arm?

942
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,595
What's that?

943
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,821
Our patient.

944
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,204
I-I need to put something
in the record.

945
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,048
Uh, yes.

946
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,118
Uh, well, he was able to
keep his arm.

947
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,095
Mm-hmm.

948
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,423
And he was able to

- Are you kidding?

952

to be injuries.

compartment syndrome.

for Ripley to ask Hughes
to marry him.

Yep.

993
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,920

994
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:41,413
if they had gotten the chance
to get married.

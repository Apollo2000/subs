1
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:11,896
Turn off the computer.

2
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:13,706
- He's dating her.
- You don't need him.

3
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:14,756
- Say it.
- I don't need him.

4
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,840
- You're better off without him.
- I'm better without him.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,407
- You fall hard and...
- And too fast.

6
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,576
And what I need is to be myself.

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,377
On my own.

8
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,413
By stepping away from the computer.

9
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:27,683
Well, are you stepping?

10
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,198
- I hate you.
- Good girl.

11
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,363
Now hang up so I can go back to sleep.

12
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,744
You ever tried going down a fire pole?

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,880
It's not easy.

14
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,281
There's no perfect way to get down.

15
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:54,249
But there's definitely a wrong way.

16
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,352
Hold on too tight, and you won't slide...

17
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:59,121
you'll just hang there, dangling.

18
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:00,690
Stuck.

19
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,224
Nobody wants to get stuck.

20
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,961
That's why I decided a long time ago

21
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:06,562
just to use the damn stairs.

22
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:15,166
I know you all know this,
but I'm still gonna say it...

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,165
contain the flame and get the hell out!

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,668
Laminar smoke flow,
small chance of flashover.

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,935
My guess is the back of the house.

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,136
Hey, Gibson, you in a hurry?

27
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,769
I haven't even given the plan yet.

28
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,162
Just ready to get in there, sir.

29
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:26,366
- Miller, partner with Gibson.
- You got it.

30
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:28,666
Andy, you and Bishop
handle search and rescue.

31
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:31,669
And let's get somebody
up on that roof to vent!

32
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:35,172
Entryway's clear. Left wall... check.

33
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,449
Right wall... check.

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,921
Living room... clear.

35
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:48,451
Kitchen and dining room... clear!

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,656
We got somebody!

37
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,958
We got a conscious victim inside...
gonna need medics standing by out front.

38
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:55,993
Thank God.

39
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:56,960
Ma'am, can you walk?

40
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:58,489
- We need to get you out of here.
- Hang on.

41
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:00,399
- Did she really just say, "Hang on"?
- Okay, no.

42
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,998
No, no, no, no, no.

43
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:08,170
Charge the line!

44
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,348
Okay, you got it!

45
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,475
The wet stuff on the red stuff!

46
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,355
Check her vitals. Watch her ABCs.

47
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,694
- BP's 80/60.
- Can you tell me your name?

48
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,743
Tiffany.

49
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,062
Tiffany, this is very important.

50
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,164
Was there anyone else inside with you?

51
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,827
Charlie.

52
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,665
Hold on the pipe!

53
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,041
Fire's out.

54
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,408
Another possible victim inside, guys.

55
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,873
Name's Charlie. Repeat... Charlie.

56
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,511
Damn. If he's in there,
he's already toast.

57
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,596
- Shut up.
- What?

58
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,847
The whole place is charcoal.

59
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,749
Dean. Enough.

60
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,384
You think anybody would
survive this kind of burnout?

61
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,719
Shut up!

62
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,054
You guys hear that?

63
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,290
Oh, my God. It's a kid.

64
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,511
- Charlie!
- Charlie?

65
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,259
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

66
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,310
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

67
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,290
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

68
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,095
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

69
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,030
Wait, guys, guys, stop.

70
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,033
There.

71
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,245
Dibs on the puppy.

72
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:31,415
You can't call dibs on the puppy.

73
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,641
I just did.

74
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,752
Dibs on that puppy.

75
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,135
Charlie!

76
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,236
Oh, my gosh!

77
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:54,671
Oh, thank you, thank you!

78
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,239
Yeah, of course.

79
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:57,741
- Oh!
- I'm here to serve.

80
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,141
Do you think he practices?

81
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,409
Like, does he go to dog parks
on his days off?

82
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:02,945
Yeah, cradle puppies under one arm,

83
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,913
- wipe away pretend soot with the other.
- He must.

84
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,314
I mean, look at him.

85
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,417
You notice we're the ones
who saved her life,

86
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:10,825
but he's the one she's thanking?

87
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,975
That stuff's not gonna fly
when we're running this place.

88
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,323
Next time, we save the puppy.

90
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,838
New Guy!

91
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:31,906
Yo.

92
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,508
Gonna need you to decon
the rest of these hand lines.

93
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,144
Yeah, um.

94
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,519
You... You know I'm not exactly new.

95
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:41,048
I've been working here full time
for a couple weeks now.

96
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,760
I chose to stop being a surgeon.

97
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,551
I mean, I've... I've held
actual beating hearts

98
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,319
in my hands.

99
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:49,355
Look, all I'm saying is that
I'm not some clueless kid

100
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,323
who doesn't understand
hard work and discipline.

101
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,225
I can do more than just clean hoses.

102
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,326
Yeah.

103
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,016
Sure thing, New Guy. Follow me.

104
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,698
Also, I have a name.

105
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,500
Do these, as well.

106
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,766
Clean 'em. Hang 'em.

107
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,070
Oh, and one of them has a hole,

108
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,504
so you'll need to patch that up.

109
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,405
Um, which one has the hole?

110
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,242
You're not new?

111
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,476
Figure it out.

112
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,348
Fast containment today, sir.

113
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,599
No casualties.

114
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,719
Think that means today
might be a Pole Day?

115
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,021
- You saved a puppy.
- And a Tiffany.

116
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,690
Puppies and Tiffanys
do not equal pole days.

117
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,892
Then what does? 'Cause in the
two years I've been here,

118
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,893
not once have...

119
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,162
Gibson, I enjoy your joy. I do.

120
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,564
But I will know the perfect Pole Day
when I see the perfect Pole Day.

121
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,334
Trust me... today's not it.

122
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,570
It's so tall and shiny.

123
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:45,174
Just staring down at us and mocking.

124
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,743
I can feel it mocking.

125
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,510
What's the point of having a fire pole

126
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:50,179
if nobody ever gets to use it?

127
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,283
It's like they think
the only thing on my mind

128
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,451
is the damn pole.

129
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:56,886
Yep. Sign this.

130
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,253
And how many times do I have to say it?

131
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,779
Don't "cross country" when we vent...

132
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,422
Stick to a beam or stay off the roof.

133
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,630
It's how people get hurt.

134
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,459
- Drink.
- We have got to remember

135
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,616
to watch the perimeter more Clo...

136
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,298
This isn't water.

137
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,532
It's a protein kale smoothie.

138
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:12,700
You've been skipping meals.

139
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:14,236
Keeping tabs on my food intake now?

140
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,270
Someone needs to. I also
filed your incident reports,

141
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:18,038
put the calendar out for approval,

142
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:19,774
arranged maintenance checks on each...

143
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,524
- You're lucky you're my daughter.
- So are you.

144
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,461
All I'm saying is,

145
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:45,165
the whole point of a meat loaf
is the meat.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
I don't mind the veggie kind,
especially when Travis makes it.

147
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,779
- Yeah, it's pretty good.
- Ah. Thank you.

148
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,728
- It's my husband's recipe.
- What's the matter, Dean?

149
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:54,006
Trying to bulk up to rescue
more itty-bitty puppies?

150
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,573
You gonna tell me that you
trained for the Olympics

151
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,509
eating spaghetti made from squash?

152
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,179
Consuming a plant-based
meal even once a week

153
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:01,479
has quantifiable health benefits.

154
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,315
That's true, actually.

155
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,449
I've witnessed it firsthand,
in, you know, in the OR.

156
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:05,684
Oh, of course you did.

157
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:06,951
Yeah, I saw everything...

158
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:08,445
the clogged arteries, the fatty tissue.

159
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,790
You... You know,
I used to open people up...

160
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,406
Okay. Okay, we got that.

161
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:14,258
It takes guts to cut somebody open.

162
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,427
I like guts.

163
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,376
I expect everyone on my team
to have guts.

164
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,532
Okay. Um, but how...
how do you mean, exactly?

165
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,571
- Oh, God.
- Now you did it.

166
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,534
- Here we go.
- There he goes.

167
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,770
9/11, when I went to go help
with the Towers...

168
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,472
Mm-hmm.

169
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,641
...it was the worst thing
I ever saw in my life...

170
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:32,843
It still is...

171
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:34,811
and it got to me, all of it.

172
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:37,113
And Andrea... she came out there.

173
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,449
She hopped on a plane by herself,

174
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:40,449
she came to New York,

175
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,319
and she ordered me to come home.

176
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,117
Saved my life.

177
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,986
She was 12.

178
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,690
And she hauled my ass back.

179
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:55,825
My daughter's got guts.

180
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:56,960
She's a force.

181
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:59,316
She needs no one. She's Baby Rambo.

182
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,996
And Baby Rambo says,

183
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,831
let's talk about something else.

184
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,554
I will talk about something else... Dean.

185
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,642
- What the hell I do now?
- How about you

186
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,703
stop throwing your dress blues

187
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,871
in with my wash?

188
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,005
Ah, please.

189
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,175
I'm not your rookie anymore.
Do your own damn laundry.

190
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,809
Hang on. That's not
really a thing, is it?

191
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,010
- The rookies have to do the laundry?
- Actually, yes.

192
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,579
Yes, it is.

193
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,817
Ohh, I hate that story.

194
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,819
I've always hated that story.

195
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,221
Yeah. He thinks it's cute.

196
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,855
It wasn't cute... it was messed up.

197
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,123
- Forget about it.
- I can't.

198
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,692
I... Mm.

199
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,832
- Distracted yet?
- I'm Getting there.

200
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,702
This is bold. Even for you.

201
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:43,637
Say the word. I'll stop.

202
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,884
Um...

203
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,613
No, wait.

204
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:01,821
I...

205
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:05,890
Uh.

206
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,759
No, we're not doing that right now.

207
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,160
Hand it back.

208
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:10,662
It's not...

209
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:12,331
- You weren't supposed to see that yet.
- Okay.

210
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:13,898
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

211
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,531
I mean, I guess I thought...

212
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,456
You... You don't seem happy about this.

213
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,004
Yeah, no, it's not... I mean...

214
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,073
Oh, God. I-I-I don't know...

215
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:23,741
I... don't know what to say here.

216
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,376
Do you just not want to get married?

217
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,805
Or... do you not want
to get married to me?

218
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,415
 Ladder, Engine,

219
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,718
Aid Car 19, respond...

220
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,085
apartment fire.

221
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,831
What happened?

222
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:00,667
Something bad?

223
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,811
With Jack?

224
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,112
How bad?

225
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:05,414
What?

226
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,651
He proposed!

227
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:09,851
Andy, that's...

228
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:13,488
Oh, we are not happy.

229
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,657
Wait. How... Why... Why would we be?

230
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:16,891
I mean, what was he thinking?

231
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,293
He's a monster.

232
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:20,094
You don't want to settle.
You're focused on work.

233
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,062
You know, and the fun

234
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,024
is in having secret sex, not...

235
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,193
Hey, what're we talking about?

236
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:26,668
- Nothing, New Guy.
- Nothing, New Guy.

237
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,975
Hey, we've got a problem...
blocked hydrant.

238
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,544
Oh, hell no.

239
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:39,413
Everything is under control.

240
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,646
Let's go. Thank you.

241
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,015
Tanner speaking.

242
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,917
Red zone applies to everyone.

243
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,986
Crap.

244
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,856
It goes... little old ladies,
cops, bomb squad, FBI...

245
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,858
- Stop. Wait! I'm on my way!
- ...CIA, Homeland Security...

246
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:55,027
...Fire Department,
anyone escaping the apocalypse,

247
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,863
and then God. Are you God?
Because if not...

248
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,207
- Really?
- Well, I needed the hydrant.

249
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,809
- You weren't around.
- I was around,

250
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,728
literally down the street,
evacuating people.

251
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:13,878
But your car was blocking

252
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,113
the water source we need
to fight the fire.

253
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,615
I can't just ignore a call to help.

254
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,951
I don't expect you to ignore it. I
expect you to watch where you're parking

255
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,985
- when you answer it.
- You gave me no time.

256
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,053
- I called.
- To gloat!

257
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:24,054
- To tell you!
- Too late.

258
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,223
- You can't just ram my car!
- You can't just block my hydrant!

259
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,437
This isn't... You...

260
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:29,059
I'm telling my boss.

261
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:30,361
Great! And I'm telling mine!

262
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,963
She, uh... She always talk
to cops like that?

263
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,367
Only the ones she went to prom with.

264
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,469
Pair up. No freelancers.

265
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:40,903
Nobody goes off on their own.

266
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:41,904
Understood?

267
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,078
Fire's in there... we're out here.

268
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:50,155
What's our next move?

269
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:51,647
Think faster. What's our move?

270
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,983
Uh, uh. Break the glass,
create a point of access?

271
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,048
All right, good. Watch out.

272
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,388
All right. Door open or shut?

273
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:00,989
- Shut?
- Is that a question?

274
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,024
Shut! Uh, maintain a protective barrier

275
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,025
between us and the flames.

276
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,894
Good. We'll hit her from here.

277
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,039
Now we go in?

278
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:20,040
Now we go in.

279
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:29,082
Careful. Watch for active flame.

280
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,017
Low visibility.

281
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,919
It'll be slow going. Stay close.

282
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,421
Copy that.

283
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,069
Found a kid's room. Gonna double-check...

284
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,738
make sure no one's hiding.

285
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,407
Hello?

286
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,776
Anyone in here?

287
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,646
We're clear in here, Captain.

288
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,980
Coming out to rejoin you.

289
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,214
How's your sweep?

290
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,284
Captain?

291
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,355
Captain?

292
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,293
Herrera, you there?

293
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,662
Go ahead. What do you need?

294
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,129
- I lost him.
- What?

295
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,164
I lost him, Andy.
I can't find him anywhere.

296
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,766
I lost your dad.

297
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,016
How the hell did you get separated?!

298
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,042
- He said not to go off on your own.
- I know.

299
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,009
Where have you looked already?

300
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,232
Kid's room, kitchen, and I
doubled back through here.

301
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:35,489
All right, let's case each room again,

302
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:36,824
inch by inch.

303
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,999
Maya;

304
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,167
Ow!

305
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,438
Maya, what?

306
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:49,836
Get over here!

307
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,843
Hey! Come on.

308
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,778
Grab his tank.
We'll get him into the hallway.

309
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,280
Grab it!

310
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,148
We'll manage him down the stairs
from there.

311
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:03,450
Stop!

312
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:05,803
No, we don't have time. We don't
know how long he's been down for.

313
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,319
- He's not breathing.
- We don't know that yet.

314
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,820
That's why we need to get him
out of here quickly.

315
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,457
Not him... it.
Look up... look at the smoke.

316
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:14,860
It's swirling down.

317
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,049
It's choking.

318
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,329
The fire's not breathing.

319
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:18,697
We're at flashpoint.

320
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,499
- Damn it, come on.
- We gotta move!

321
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,667
Go, go, go!

322
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,111
We got about 5 or 6 minutes
before that door's gone

323
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,780
and this room ignites, too.

324
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,682
We gotta get out of here!

325
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:38,992
No way out but the window.

326
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,317
- Window won't work.
- Guys.

327
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,852
As soon as we open it and introduce
oxygen into this room...

328
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:44,278
- Boom.
- Guys!

329
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:45,822
The Captain doesn't have a pulse.

330
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:49,673
Help me get his turnout gear open!

331
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,695
Andy, if we do that
and this place explodes...

332
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,997
Then he's dead, anyway.
Help me get it off!

333
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,632
- Take the tank off.
- We got to get the button.

334
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,066
Ohh.

335
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,572
Fire's at the door.

336
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:04,807
We got, I don't know,
2 minutes, maybe less.

337
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:06,269
This building has fire escapes.

338
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,787
- If we could get to them...
- Can't make the jump from this angle,

339
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,062
especially not carrying the Captain.

340
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,213
Mayday. Ladder 19.

341
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,081
We need a jumper, Charlie-Delta side.

342
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,716
I repeat... Mayday.

343
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,115
Anybody copy?

344
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:18,085
One way or another,
we're getting out of here.

345
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:19,793
I'm making an anchor point.

346
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,556
- Gibson...
- I'll start the harness.

347
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,609
Flames at the door.

348
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,936
We gotta go now!

349
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,103
Harness or not. Andy!

350
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,438
- No.
- Andy.

351
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,374
Nobody leaves until he has a pulse!

352
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,021
- Pulse! I've got a pulse!
- Let's go!

353
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,293
1, 2, 3.

354
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,263
- Get him up. Get him up.
- We've got it.

355
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,431
The fire's starved for air.

356
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,367
As soon as we break the glass,
it'll light up.

357
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,435
So we jump. Fast as we can.

358
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:15,871
Fly or fry.

359
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,168
No helmets.

360
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:19,741
We gotta be exact.

361
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:22,376
No margin of error down there.

362
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:23,508
Time's up, you guys.

363
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,880
- We'll make it!
- We better.

364
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:27,014
Guys. Are we doing this?

365
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,310
I can't believe that worked.

366
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,332
Are you okay?

367
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,968
Oh, he lost his pulse.
He's in danger of clotting.

368
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,536
We need to start a drip line,
get him on heparin.

369
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,671
No. We need to get him on O2
and O2 only, all right?

370
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,773
Let's go. Let's go right now.

371
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,514
You all right?

372
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,566
Breathe, Andrea.

373
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,401
You're outside. You got him out.

374
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:00,502
You can breathe now.

375
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,472
Just breathe, okay?

376
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:09,177
Breathe.

377
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,079
- Okay.

378
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,511
You're all right.

379
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:22,555
- Okay.

380
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,592
Let's get him to the hospital,

381
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:27,494
right damn now!

382
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,898
BP's 80/50... that's low.

383
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,532
Does he have a history
of cardiac distress?

384
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,700
You coulda killed him.

385
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:40,861
Excuse me?

386
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,803
You can't start a patient
on blood thinners

387
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:43,905
in the field.

388
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,439
You don't know his history

389
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,107
or if he suffered any underlying trauma.

390
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,166
And if he has?

391
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,110
You're looking at internal hemorrhages,

392
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,978
cranial bleeding...

393
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,447
we can't treat a brain bleed on this rig.

394
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:56,649
You would've killed him

395
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:57,951
right in front of his daughter.

396
00:18:58,662 --> 00:19:00,387
What we can treat on this rig

397
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,654
and what you do in the OR

398
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,222
are two very different things.

399
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,794
We're here.

400
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,116
62-year-old male,

401
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:28,779
found unconscious at the scene of a fire,

402
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:31,015
possible smoke inhalation.

403
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,650
He collapsed while on duty,

404
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,252
arrested and resuscitated on the scene.

405
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,120
Okay.

406
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,121
On my count... 3.

407
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:41,024
And 1... 2... 3.

408
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,660
We need an EKG.

409
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,509
Okay, I'm gonna need
a portable ultrasound.

410
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:07,850
- You should get some O2.
- I'm fine.

411
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:09,352
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

412
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:11,293
- Okay, you're right. I'm really not.
- You're mad.

413
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,489
- Me too. I'm mad at myself.
- No, you...

414
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:16,024
you shouldn't have split off on your own.

415
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,025
You should've been paying more attention.

416
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
I was paying attention.
I saw a kid's room.

417
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,628
- You know how kids hide.
- You... You do this.

418
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,063
You... You jump into things

419
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:23,898
without thinking them through,

420
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,733
- without consulting anybody first.
- Don't do that.

421
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,135
Don't mix it all up.

422
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,302
I'm not mixing up anything.

423
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,803
You were careless and reckless.

424
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,538
You're mad about before.

425
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:32,806
And the ring.

426
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,376
- And now you're scared about your dad.
- Are you kidding me?

427
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:37,311
You think I care even a little

428
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,846
about a stupid engagement ring right now

429
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:42,049
- when my dad may not wake up?!
- No, that's not...

430
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:44,318
You left him in the middle of a fire!

431
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:45,851
I know! I know!

432
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,833
Herrera?

433
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,600
Hi.

434
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,369
I heard your dad was down here.

435
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,837
I just wanted to check in.

436
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:08,106
Bailey's taking him up for an ex-lap,

437
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,841
and I thought I would join.

438
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,109
You okay?

439
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,950
Let's go.

440
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:05,060
Okay, that's enough.

441
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,564
Put your game face on.

442
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,065
We got your dad.
Now you go be brave for him.

443
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:12,066
Okay?

444
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:14,102
- Okay.

445
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:42,996
He did great.

446
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,163
Thank you so much.

447
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,258
- That's great.
- Thank you.

448
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,033
Andy, I need to speak with you alone

449
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,560
for a minute.

450
00:22:58,513 --> 00:23:00,779
How long was I out?

451
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,289
Peritoneal mesothelioma.

452
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,325
Tumors in your abdomen... bleeding.

453
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,161
I know because I wrote it all down.

454
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:18,922
It's why you passed out.

455
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,965
You have cancer, Dad.

456
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,900
- Stage 2.
- Andrea.

457
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,370
Symptoms include,
in order of escalation...

458
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,005
stomach pain, fatigue,

459
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,241
loss of appetite, irritability,

460
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,043
cardiac arrest.

461
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,746
How many of these have you been having?

462
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,048
Were you ignoring them

463
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,749
or just neglecting to tell me?

464
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:42,985
I have to step down as Captain,

465
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,086
effective immediately.

466
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,321
Did you already know about this?

467
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:48,658
There's no time to be angry, m'ija.

468
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,359
I don't have that time.

469
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,194
We don't.

470
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,929
The Department will take a while

471
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:57,265
to fill the post, of course...

472
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,234
they always do.

473
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:00,320
Gibson'll...

474
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,171
will have to run the place till they do.

475
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,073
You're leaving Jack in charge?

476
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,908
He's my Lieutenant.

477
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:09,376
Now, go on.

478
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:11,204
Let me sleep.

479
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,949
Dad.

480
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:17,050
Dad.

481
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,648
- What are you doing here?
- I have lived next door

482
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,236
for pretty much our entire lives.

483
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:54,885
No, your parents live there.

484
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,519
You moved away years ago.

485
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,119
And... I moved back in. Last week.

486
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:00,823
Well, yesterday, technically,
is when I moved all my stuff,

487
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:02,858
but it's only temporary,
and none of that matters.

488
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,526
At all, because...

489
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:06,996
How's your dad?

490
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,064
Is he okay?

491
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,566
- How are you?
- Oh, I am fine, actually.

492
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:11,667
Today's been great.

493
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:12,936
I'm fantastic.

494
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,870
Uh, I turned down a marriage proposal,

495
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:16,738
my dad came this close
to getting killed...

496
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,773
so did I, for that
matter... but who cares?

497
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,842
'Cause it turns out
my dad's filled with cancer

498
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:22,711
and promoting my would-be fiancé
to be my new boss.

499
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:25,680
Everyone's making decisions
about my life without me,

500
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,315
so, yeah, my world's falling apart,

501
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,651
I'm on my third load of laundry
and as many beers.

502
00:25:29,686 --> 00:25:32,854
Things are great. Today's... great.

503
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,656
Come on in.

504
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:37,658
Your dad's stepping down?

505
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:39,927
- Cancer, Ryan. Keep up.
- Yeah, okay, about...

506
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:41,729
I mean, Jack will just take over.

507
00:25:41,764 --> 00:25:45,165
Never mind that he's impulsive and rash.

508
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,534
I mean, half that job is filing reports.

509
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:48,836
He's never filed a report.

510
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:50,070
You wanna know how I know?

511
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,738
'Cause I file them.

512
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,606
- So you do it.
- What?

513
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,608
You should take over for your dad.

514
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,209
- Right.
- Why not?

515
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,445
You're about as badass as they come.

516
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,213
You've literally been training
your entire life.

517
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,381
It doesn't work like that.

518
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,951
- Jack made Lieutenant before me.
- And who decides on that?

519
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:06,185
Your dad?

520
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,886
What are you saying?

521
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,711
Look...

522
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,757
I love your dad, and I always have.

523
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,347
You know that.

524
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,128
But he loves having you around
to take care of things,

525
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:19,765
which is different than...
letting you lead them.

526
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,943
Mm.

527
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:31,642
Doctors think he's probably been
sick for a while.

528
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:34,879
- Has he had any symptoms?
- I don't know.

529
00:26:34,914 --> 00:26:36,411
He didn't tell me.

530
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,282
I live with him.

531
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:39,917
I clean up after him.

532
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,185
I do his damn laundry.

533
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,426
He didn't tell you about
something like this?

534
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:43,610
- Apparently not.
- What the hell?

535
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,954
Exactly! It pisses me off!

536
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,122
- Me too! For you!
- Thank you!

537
00:26:46,158 --> 00:26:47,123
You're welcome!

538
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,130
For real, though.

539
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,224
I'm sorry.

540
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:10,278
I can't do it again, Ryan.

541
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,855
I can't bury another parent.

542
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:18,829
It'll be different this time.

543
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:20,747
Before...

544
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,317
You were 9.

545
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,475
We were 9.

546
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,037
Andy, you've been drinking and...

547
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,940
Well, we're not
in high school anymore, Ryan,

548
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,108
and I'm not drunk.

549
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:43,877
I'm not.

550
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,311
Come on. Try me.

551
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,347
Give me a Breathalyzer if you want.

552
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:48,615
Go on.

553
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,049
Mm? See?

554
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,152
I know what I'm doing.

555
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:26,617
So, this is it?

556
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:28,119
This is it.

557
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:29,316
Pretty impressive.

558
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:32,389
What's that look?

559
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:36,526
Hey, I just gave
your new home away from home

560
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:38,294
an unsolicited compliment.

561
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,529
Yeah, I know. I just...

562
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,999
I thought I'd be better at this.

563
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,333
I aced my training.

564
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,302
I know trauma medicine.

565
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:49,305
I figured "I got this,"

566
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,641
but... then, last night...

567
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,044
...I messed up, Miranda.

568
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,313
I mean, it could've been really bad.

569
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:01,183
I wanted to show everybody
how good I was at this,

570
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,384
but, instead, I just...

571
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:03,752
That's your problem right there.

572
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:05,353
Stop showing off.

573
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,390
The only way to prove
that you're any good

574
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:09,892
is to just be good.

575
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,656
Look, if anyone can do it, it's you.

576
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:24,438
- Just be good.
- Just be good.

577
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,873
You make it sound so easy.

578
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:28,408
For some of us, it is.

579
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:35,304
Hey, is Andy with you?

580
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,951
An hour before shift
starts to go running?

581
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,986
Funny. You're funny.

582
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,290
Did she tell you about the ring?

583
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,257
- Oh, yeah.
- Did she tell you

584
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:46,425
I wasn't even trying
to give it to her yet?

585
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,893
And she just freaks out,

586
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:50,429
like it's the stupidest idea
in the world.

587
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,433
You know, I think she was also

588
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:56,902
kind of freaking out about her dad.

589
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:58,370
It's not that crazy.

590
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,139
You know, my parents
got married after six months.

591
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,406
They were happy.

592
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:03,374
And Andy and I are pretty great together.

593
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:05,076
You know, I'm not a terrible choice.

594
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,410
You're right.

595
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,213
You are so hot.

596
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:09,380
You can get all the ladies.

597
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:10,581
That's not...

598
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,552
I don't want that.

599
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:16,321
I just...

600
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,453
I love her,

601
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:19,289
and if she doesn't feel it, then...

602
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:21,391
what the hell? just tell me.

603
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,298
You slept with Ryan?!

604
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,000
And kicked him out
and came to find you and...

605
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,401
Police Officer Ryan?

606
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:32,484
"Best friends since diapers" Ryan?

607
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,137
Okay, really, it's hard to talk to you

608
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:35,405
when you're constantly moving.

609
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,438
Hell, yes.

610
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:38,007
I mean, go after that. He's hot.

611
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,575
Except, there's Jack.

612
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,244
Your jumped your ex
the night your dad almost died.

613
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,811
Been there, seen it naked before.

614
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,613
- It's basically just recycling.
- Is it, though?

615
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:45,883
I don't know. I mean...

616
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,784
He wants me to tell him
if I don't have feelings,

617
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,619
but I do... I feel things,

618
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:51,921
just maybe not marrying things.

619
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,521
Okay, okay. No, no. Stop.

620
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,423
You're spinning. Hey, we don't spin.

621
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,359
Not over something like guys.

622
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:59,127
We are way too awesome for that.

623
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:00,128
Maya, I'm awful.

624
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:01,496
No. You feel awful.

625
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,428
There's a difference.

626
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:05,700
- What's my rule?
- This isn't...

627
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,802
What's my rule?

628
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,214
Embrace the pain.

629
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:11,805
- But this isn't a workout or anything.
- Embrace the pain.

630
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,141
Go ahead... feel awful for a minute.

631
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,842
Then use it.

632
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:17,644
That's how I won my medal.

633
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,513
Forget about the boys for now.

634
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:21,448
Ignore the distractions.

635
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:24,718
Find your medal and go after it.

636
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:26,820
The rest will fall into place from there.

637
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:33,559
- You're very sweaty and wet.
- Mm. I am.

638
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:35,428
Gross.

639
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:44,502
What?

640
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,264
Something's different.

641
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,410
Your energy, your whole look.

642
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,214
Something happened.

643
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,383
Something last night.

644
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:01,419
You got laid!

645
00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:03,254
You have sex swagger!

646
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,454
My energy told you all that?

647
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,024
No, your phone's blowing up,
and I'm nosy.

648
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,128
- What've we got?
- This way.

649
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,429
I've secured the perimeter.

650
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,866
College senior, awake, a little
disoriented... name's Becca.

651
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,633
Some students heard her calling out.

652
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:53,901
Hi, by the way.

653
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:55,123
Hi.

654
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,873
Help.

655
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:09,582
Uh, that... that thing
that happened at my house...

656
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:12,452
we don't have to talk about that.

657
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:13,920
Yeah, of course.

658
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,623
Nothing to talk about, anyway.

659
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:17,896
We're all good.

660
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:21,094
"We're all good"?

661
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,296
Wait... what do you mean we're all good?

662
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:29,101
Becca, my name's Andy.

663
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,403
I'm here to help.

664
00:33:30,438 --> 00:33:32,071
I thought this was a shortcut.

665
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,306
It looked like a shortcut last night,

666
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:35,141
in the dark.

667
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:37,176
You've been here since last night?

668
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:39,111
You know how, when you're drunk,

669
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:40,246
stupid happens?

670
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,680
I do.

671
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,281
I tried to push myself out of here.

672
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:45,616
I thought I could make it,
but the more I tried...

673
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:46,851
No, don't... don't do that.

674
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,653
You've sustained crush injuries.

675
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:50,688
Every time you move, you could
be hurting yourself more.

676
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:53,124
Just... squeeze my finger, Becca.

677
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,321
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:55,693
Can you gimmie a squeeze?

679
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,296
- Hey. How's it going?
- Fine.

680
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:00,197
What's wrong? What's going on?

681
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:01,963
- It's okay.
- I can't breathe! I c...

682
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,633
- Becca.
- The walls are crushing me!

683
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:04,801
- No.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

684
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,437
Becca, no, no. Don't move.

685
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:07,490
- Just...
- Oh, God!

686
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:09,706
- Just stay calm.
- This is it, isn't it?!

687
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,276
This is how I die... freezing and stuck

688
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,378
between two stupid walls
'cause I was too dumb...

689
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,979
- Becca.
- ...to realize they were crushing me!

690
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,313
No, you're okay.

691
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,714
- You can breathe. Just...
- I can't.

692
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:20,450
- Just try to breathe.
- I can't.

693
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:21,984
Becca, you're spinning. Stop it.

694
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,688
Take a deep breath.

695
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,824
And then another.

696
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,626
And then, you just have to decide

697
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,695
that you can do this.

698
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,796
You can figure this out... trust me.

699
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:35,910
Trust yourself.

700
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,532
You can do this, Becca. You can.

701
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:41,336
Just relax and let go.

702
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,145
Ohh.

703
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,146
Aah!

704
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,247
That's it.

705
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:54,881
It's okay. I got you.

706
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,383
Okay, Jack, go, go!

707
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:57,485
Go, go, go, go!

708
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,586
That's it. That's it.

709
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,754
Yes!

710
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,229
You were great.

711
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:12,999
You're so good at this.

712
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:16,636
I am, aren't I?

713
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:26,608
I know sometimes
you get overlooked by your dad.

714
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,615
For the record...

715
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,362
I notice.

716
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,186
I've always noticed.

717
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:37,422
And I dunno what's going on
with him and his recovery,

718
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:41,793
but if I have to... step up,

719
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,661
take over at the station...

720
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:47,698
...I won't overlook you.

721
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,067
For what it's worth.

722
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,378
Oh, good. It's you.

723
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,046
I swear, if another damn intern
comes in...

724
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:05,021
I want to be considered, too.

725
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,750
For the Captain position.

726
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:10,153
If you have to step down...

727
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,321
I want to step up.

728
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:13,590
Andrea, you have to be a Lieutenant.

729
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,957
You can't just jump ranks.

730
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:16,792
- Then promote me.
- Just like that?

731
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:18,661
You've never even applied for Lieutenant.

732
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,829
I've had to focus on other things...

733
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,598
like you.

734
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:23,965
Me?

735
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,100
Andrea.

736
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,436
It's Ground Zero over and over.

737
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:29,572
I take care of you,

738
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:32,741
chase you down, watch your back.

739
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,677
I've been pulling you
out of the rubble my whole life.

740
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,778
But now...

741
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,783
I know I can lead.

742
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:46,588
I have the skills, I have the experience,

743
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,556
and I want this, Papi.

744
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,069
This is my medal.

745
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,129
I'm putting my hat in the ring.

746
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,639
Gonna swing by the hospital after lunch,

747
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:06,707
visit the captain.

748
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:09,174
I, uh, need your keys.

749
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:12,678
- Yeah.
- No lights. No sirens.

750
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,747
Oh, I'm totally doing the sirens.

751
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,884
Oh. New Guy, 10 o'clock.

752
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:24,723
Okay, uh, listen.

753
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:27,726
Uh, I don't think
I'm better than anybody else.

754
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:28,826
I'm here to learn.

755
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,695
And, yes, I-I'm a surgeon.

756
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:33,798
And basically all surgeons do
is talk about surgery.

757
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm a surgery nerd.

758
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:37,636
And, uh... And you guys are...

759
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,170
are fire nerds, right?

760
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:43,206
And I-I don't speak Fire Nerd yet.

761
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:46,042
But I want to.

762
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:51,181
Yeah, that sounded a lot better
in my... in my head.

763
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,007
Hey.

764
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,854
You can start by cleaning.

765
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,490
Warren. Heads up.

766
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:08,615
- Did, um, Did you just call me by my...
- Just start polishing.

767
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,115
- Shut up and scrub.
- Okay?

768
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:13,403
Most stations don't even
have fire poles anymore.

769
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:16,037
They're considered too risky.

770
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:18,039
Better off to just... play it safe.

771
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:19,874
You're not coming back?

772
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,778
I've got cancer, Jack.

773
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,446
Looking at chemo, radiation.

774
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:27,916
It's just the way
things work out sometimes.

775
00:38:27,951 --> 00:38:29,884
So, I will be counting on

776
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,787
my two highest-ranking officers

777
00:38:31,822 --> 00:38:32,920
to run the station

778
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:34,622
until the department appoints

779
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:36,390
a new permanent Captain.

780
00:38:36,426 --> 00:38:37,958
Two officers, sir?

781
00:38:37,993 --> 00:38:40,260
I'm promoting Andrea
to Lieutenant, as well.

782
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,085
Screw safe.

783
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,934
The two of you will be
in running for Captain.

784
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:50,937
Try not to burn the place down.

785
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:01,381
Oh, that's a Lotta meat.

786
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,882
It was a gift for us.

787
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,917
From a friend.

788
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:07,386
As a thank you for all of our hard work.

789
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,587
Friend?

790
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:09,888
Dirty dirty texting friend?

791
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:10,956
Puppy Lady.

792
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,160
- I... I sort of invited her over.
- No!

793
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,795
Dean, you know better than that.

794
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:18,597
Don't invite the rescues in.

795
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:19,931
She didn't leave yet, did she?

796
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:21,144
Is she at your house right now?

797
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:22,668
- Her house burned down.
- Oh, my God.

798
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:23,968
- What?
- She had nowhere else to go.

799
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,937
Guys...

800
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,205
we have some news.

801
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:30,808
My dad is not coming back.

802
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,845
Safe paralyzes you.

803
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,980
He collapsed because
he was bleeding internally...

804
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:37,948
Safe makes you hold on too tight.

805
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,083
...pretty badly.

806
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:42,853
For now, we'll be filling
my dad's position in-house...

807
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,788
That's how you get stuck.

808
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,122
Congrats, man.

809
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:48,992
...by both Jack and myself.

810
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,928
Oh. Okay.

811
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:57,000
Also, congrats... man.

812
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,673
Look.

813
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:04,507
My dad's always run things
a certain way around here.

814
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:08,043
He likes us to chase a rabbit on a track,

815
00:40:08,078 --> 00:40:11,881
but it's just a stupid trick
to keep us all running,

816
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,783
just a stupid prize,

817
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:15,182
the Pole Day.

818
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,854
I'm done chasing the rabbit.

819
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:23,057
I am the rabbit.

820
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:25,627
The rabbit runs because she loves it.

821
00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:29,063
I do this job because I love it.

822
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:30,263
I don't need a prize.

823
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:34,367
Every day here is the prize.

824
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,169
Every life saved.

825
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:39,172
Every fire put out.

826
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,744
We're Seattle firefighters.

827
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:46,079
Station 19 is where we choose to be.

828
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:48,381
And that pole belongs to us.

829
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,223
We earned it...

830
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:52,718
one fire at a time.

831
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,353
Which means

832
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:56,355
forget how things are usually done...

833
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,159
every day is a damn Pole Day.

834
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,462
Starting right now.

835
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:07,031
Let's go.

836
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:09,668
Wait. Really?

837
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,870
Really.

838
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,146
The trick is to breathe in...

839
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,089
...and loosen your grip.

840
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,227
You can't overthink it.

841
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,097
We both know we're in trouble

842
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,275
Gotta grab on.

843
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,937
Come on!

844
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:53,776
Take the next step...

845
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,478
Oh, no. Your turn.

846
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,046
You can't declare a Pole Day
and not go, too.

847
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:02,384
Trust yourself...

848
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,682
...and...

849
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,898
let go.

850
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:17,958
Whoo!

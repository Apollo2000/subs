1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on Station 19.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,673
Captains have to balance what's
moral and what's practical.

3
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:07,272
And while I would never want
to squash another woman to win, I will

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,844
You punched the wrong code
into the security system,

5
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:10,479
and it automatically shut all the doors.

6
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:11,813
I don't know what got you so distracted

7
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:12,781
that you made a mistake like that,

8
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:14,549
- but next time...
- There won't be a next time.

9
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,952
If we're gonna try this,
I need to go slow.

10
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:18,119
I think I'm scared of fire.

11
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:19,221
I stop. I freeze up.

12
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:20,856
- Okay. I can get to it.
- Maya...

13
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,023
Maya!

14
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,225
Why did you do that?

15
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,226
Huh?

16
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,393
I didn't support you

17
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,796
or Jack for the Captain position.

18
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,802
<i>People call us heroes.</i>

19
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,173
But if you ask any firefighter,

20
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:41,409
<i>we're the first to say,
"No, we're not heroes.</i>

21
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:45,247
<i>We're not superhuman.
We're just regular people.</i>

22
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,883
<i>We have flaws. We have fears.</i>

23
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:52,888
<i>We just show up every day
and do our job. That's it."</i>

24
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,656
<i>It doesn't make us heroes.</i>

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,658
Andy, it's too much.
You can't make it to her.

26
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,560
- The hell I can't.
- Andy, no!

27
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:04,566
<i>Somebody has to.</i>

28
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,107
- Ohh. Mnh.
- You are a terrible influence.

29
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,302
I told you,

30
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,080
- I don't usually sleep over.
- Mnh.

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,679
Dearborn?

32
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:18,880
Was she there when we got in last night?

33
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,448
Why are you with her?

34
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,684
It was Wednesday. I treat myself
to self-care on Wednesdays,

35
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,686
usually in the form of a one-night stand.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Has anyone seen my pants?

37
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,256
Why her? Dearborn, Station 12.

38
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,058
Yeah, we weren't really focused on names.

39
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:33,028
What she means is I kicked
her ass in the Incinerator.

40
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:34,095
Big day today, Herr.

41
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,097
Of course, it's probably bigger
for you than me.

42
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,266
You got a lot more to make up
for in your Ripley sit-down.

43
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,869
For me, it's kind of just
a matter of red tape

44
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:41,937
since he loves me.

45
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,706
I'm very lovable.

46
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,943
Especially when I do that one
thing with my other thing...

47
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,645
Okay, Wednesday, it's Thursday now.

48
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,547
Time to go.

49
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,425
Okay. Yep.

50
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,295
I swear, I had no idea.

51
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,997
Good, 'cause, otherwise,
you might have just ruined

52
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,298
my last day as captain.

53
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,667
Your last day officially
not getting the title.

54
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:15,236
Which we both know
that probably won't happen

55
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,005
with what my dad said to Ripley.

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,774
What do you need right now?
A pep talk? No talk?

57
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:20,775
I'm here for either. You tell me.

58
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,812
I just want to enjoy what I have
while I have it.

59
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:24,946
Dearborn-free.

60
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:28,416
See, I don't think you get
an opinion on who I bring home

61
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:30,752
when you're crashing on my couch.

62
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,864
Hey, why is Ripley holding
all the interviews

63
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,699
with the captain wannabes here?

64
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:46,368
I don't like the idea
of all the other candidates

65
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,803
being in our space,
all up in our business.

66
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:49,804
Me either.

67
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,840
You didn't seem to mind
too much last night.

68
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,109
I told you, I didn't know who she was!

69
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,710
Wait. Hang on. Did I just miss something?

70
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:56,778
What did I just miss?

71
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,246
Okay. What are you gonna say
in your meeting today,

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,714
if you've decided
you've already lost this thing?

73
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,850
What? No!

74
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:03,852
No, no, no. Wrong attitude.
Don't think that.

75
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,488
I'm just gonna
be true to myself, all right?

76
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,656
- That's all I can do.
- Okay, hey.

77
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,159
I am sensing some resignation
here, and I don't like it.

78
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,961
The Incinerator may have been bad,

79
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,163
but that doesn't mean you're
completely out of the running.

80
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:16,289
Why would you think that way?

81
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,200
You know, just a hunch, I guess.

82
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:23,338
Well, we might've bought the whole store.

83
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,672
That's what I get for going shopping

84
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:25,874
with a professional chef.

85
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,243
Grant, did you wake up at his place?

86
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:29,377
'Cause, if so, that is huge.

87
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,412
He never lets anybody sleep over.

88
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:32,814
- Okay, this was on his way to work...
- I... Oh.

89
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,717
...and I needed the extra hands,
and that's it.

90
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,185
Okay, that's it?

91
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,753
That's it.

92
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,722
Loving this view.

93
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,724
Listen, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about

94
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,159
- when you get a minute.
- Like what?

95
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:47,695
Well, I think it's great.
And I am anxiously waiting

96
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,098
for my invitation to come be
a third wheel

97
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,600
at any one of your gourmet-cooked meals.

98
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,069
Are we still on for next week?

99
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,071
Next week? What's next week?

100
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,773
Maya's trying to convince me
and Vic to try aerial yoga.

101
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:01,776
- Ugh.
- You and... oh, okay.

102
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,112
You guys are making plans. That's cool.

103
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,881
That's, uh, totally
not weird and strange.

104
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,785
Okay, time to go. I will walk you out.

105
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,821
Ah, okay.

106
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:14,889
Bye.

107
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:17,792
You just got weird.

108
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:18,927
What? No.

109
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:21,196
Do you not want me talking to
your friends or something?

110
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,031
I ju... I...

111
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:26,234
I guess I didn't realize that
you already <i>were</i> talking to them

112
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,136
and making plans with them.

113
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,737
Is that a problem?

114
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,806
I told you, if you need things
to go more slowly,

115
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,041
all you have to do is say it.

116
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,409
Yeah, no, I-I know.

117
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:36,644
I don't want to play games.
Just be honest.

118
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,779
I'd respect that.

119
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:41,316
What I don't respect is you
not actually talking to me.

120
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,318
I'm looking for something real.

121
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:45,987
And it's fine if
you're not that guy, really.

122
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:49,272
I'm not expecting everything all at once.

123
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:52,192
But I do expect respect.

124
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:54,596
Hey. Hey, Grant...

125
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,930
I'll see myself out.

126
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,067
- ...and me.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,902
Hey. Hey. How you doing, man?

128
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:03,805
The thing is, they asked me
to bring breakfast tacos

129
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,939
from Madre's.

130
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,008
If I walk in there empty-handed,
I'll never live it down.

131
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,743
Well, they can't expect you
to move mountains

132
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,645
if the mountains are closed
for renovations.

133
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,747
Look, I am the rookie.

134
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:14,482
It's my job to do this stuff.

135
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,651
Okay, you may be the rookie,

136
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:21,456
but you are also a genuine,
certified, accomplished surgeon

137
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,924
who already paid his dues.

138
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,492
And they should appreciate that,

139
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,995
not waste your time sending you
on impossible errands.

140
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,931
You are very sexy when
you're defending my honor.

141
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:32,300
Oh, I'm sexy all the damn time.

142
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,969
And not too afraid to go tell your boss

143
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,205
nobody treats my husband like this.

144
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,341
N-No. N-No. No, Miranda!

145
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,075
Herrera!

146
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,312
He's all yours.

147
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,514
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

148
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,449
I wasn't able to get
the tacos that you wanted.

149
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:49,817
Yeah, we know.

150
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:51,553
That place has been closed for a month.

151
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:54,956
We just wanted to make sure
that you were late.

152
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:00,995
Oh.

153
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,797
Okay, what's happening?

154
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:07,468
As of last week, you have
officially run into 50 fires.

155
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:12,173
And you have run out of 50 fires
not dead, so congrats.

156
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,474
I, for sure, thought that you'd be back

157
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,910
at your cushy little surgery gig by now.

158
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:21,316
Well, either that or crispy fried.

159
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,383
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,352
50 fires is a big rite of passage.

161
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,553
Congratulations, Warren.

162
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:28,690
I mean, I'd seen, like, 50 fires
in probably half the time.

163
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:30,957
Well, open it already!

164
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,048
Keys to the Aid Car.
You get to drive it now.

165
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,102
I get to drive?

166
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,503
<i>I</i> get to drive.

167
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:43,738
- Boom!
- Whoa.

168
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,573
No, see, rookies don't get to drive.

169
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,609
- New guys don't drive.
- You...

170
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:50,011
I drive now. Me.

171
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,045
And I eat.

172
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:56,584
Will look pretty good behind
the wheel, don't you think?

173
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,786
Uh, right now,
you're acting like a grown man

174
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,422
excited about a big toy.

175
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,957
No speeding.

176
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,959
I'm so proud of you.

177
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,462
Whoa!

178
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,098
And I wish I could stay, but,
uh, I got to go cut people open.

179
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,569
Oh, uh, am I gonna see you
for your appointment later?

180
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,870
It's just the... the usual stuff,

181
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:16,930
shouldn't take too long.

182
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,380
I'll be there.

183
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:22,277
Okay, how did you all even know
that I passed my driving test?

184
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,612
We're family. We keep track
of stuff like that.

185
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,782
Also, Vic might've figured out

186
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:29,584
how to crack your e-mail password.

187
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,486
It's "Hot Hot Miranda,"
if anyone's curious.

188
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,455
I'll be changing that today.

189
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,924
Can you pass the bacon?

190
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,092
All right.

191
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,599
Andrea?

192
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,501
Andrea.

193
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,669
Andrea, we need to talk.

194
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:48,736
I'm not ready yet.

195
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,738
I'll wind up saying something
I don't mean to say.

196
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:51,773
But I hope you understand I'm...

197
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,907
I wasn't trying to hurt you
by talking to Ripley.

198
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,777
You know, you're entitled
to your opinion about me.

199
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,246
But the fact that you tanked Jack, too...

200
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,983
you'd leave the entire station
open for an outsider

201
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,085
- to come in and take over...
- It could be a good thing.

202
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,488
...instead of having
a little faith in our team...

203
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:08,856
the team <i>you</i> built...

204
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,693
and some trust that
we could make it work.

205
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:16,197
I expected you to believe
in us as our captain.

206
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:19,867
And as my dad...

207
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,805
I guess I just thought that...

208
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,620
I'd hoped you had faith in me, too.

209
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:34,148
I'm sorry, Andrea. I know you're angry.

210
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,683
You have every right to be.

211
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,353
Yeah, but you're not sorry
about what you said to Ripley.

212
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:42,824
- Andrea...
- That's what I thought.

213
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:07,749
Can't believe the captain's race
is almost over.

214
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:10,084
It's kind of crazy.

215
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,354
Not even sure of what I'll say
to Ripley when I'm in there.

216
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,189
I think I stood a better chance
with Frankel.

217
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,166
Skyscraper fire downtown.

218
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,401
Sweet!

219
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,035
Oh, hey, Herrera.

220
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,637
Don't be nervous. Warmed him up for you.

221
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,407
Sir?

222
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,608
Panel interviews are postponed

223
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:34,666
until further notice.

224
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,210
I'm needed at this skyscraper fire.

225
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:37,078
Sorry, guys.

226
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,813
- Yes, sir.
- Of course.

227
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:41,856
Andy.

228
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,585
So you know, if I don't get captain,

229
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,953
I'm putting in for a transfer.

230
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,589
A transfer? What? Why?

231
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,558
I mean, it's pretty simple.

232
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:51,832
I got some regrets about things

233
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,394
- that have happened and...
- Regrets?

234
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,563
...and I'd rather start fresh...

235
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,915
...somewhere else.

236
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:02,236
You know, I think
it'd be better all around.

237

238
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,147
- Hey.
- What's up?

239
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,616
Can't believe we haven't been
called on that skyscraper yet.

240
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,851
I hate the waiting.

241
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:28,220
Yeah, while we're waiting, um...

242
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,122
This is weirdly hard.

243
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:31,957
It's the worst.

244
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:34,226
We have to sit here waiting
until Ripley pulls the trigger.

245
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,194
We should just
get it over with, you know?

246
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:39,698
You're my guy. Or you used to be my guy.

247
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,733
And then we sort of stopped hanging out.

248
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,335
And then, we stopped talking.

249
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,237
And I-I just figured
that you were too busy,

250
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,205
and you <i>were</i> too busy with Herrera.

251
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,474
And now... it's weird.

252
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,742
And talking to you is weird.

253
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,744
And... And it never used to be weird.

254
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:53,612
Talk to me about what?

255
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:56,948
Hey. Group meeting in the barn, guys.

256
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:00,310
It's fine. It can wait.

257
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,088
Let's do this thing!

258
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,056
Two additional units requested.

259
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:06,725
<i>Partial evacuation currently in progress.</i>

260
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,427
All right, check these carefully.

261
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,262
It's been a while since we
needed to pull this many hoses.

262
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,897
Radios are tuned in. Alerts are on.

263
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,231
Only a matter of time
till they call us in.

264
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:16,501
<i>Looks like the structural fire
originated on the 24th floor.</i>

265
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:19,404
25th is currently 0% contained. <i>Over.</i>

266
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,739
0%? Still?

267
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:21,873
Why aren't they calling us in now?

268
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:22,941
I wish they would.

269
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,509
I am ready to get in there
and tackle this monster.

270
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:25,544
Switch it up!

271
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,280
You know, it's good to get
in there later, too.

272
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,081
A lot of other units
in there already, so...

273
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,117
Warren, what makes a high-rise
like this different

274
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,251
from other structure fires?

275
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,287
The roof can't be vented.

276
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,456
Internal containment's
the name of the game.

277
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,426
Using fire doors, concentrated wet-downs,

278
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,094
just trying to keep the blaze
as small as we can,

279
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,463
contain it to the floor.

280
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,431
We'll all need to remember,
conserve energy.

281
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,201
In a building this tall, you can
usually use the elevators

282
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,269
if you don't jump the fire line.

283
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,637
Fire in the elevator shaft

284
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,739
opens us up to
a whole new world of problems.

285
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:56,374
- Great.
- Any of us drop in there,

286
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:59,444
you know the rules...
we save firefighter lives first.

287
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,746
All right, so take breaks
if you need them

288
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,449
or you might contribute to the
problem instead of the solution.

289
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:06,418
Nobody likes a hero. Understood?

290
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,652
- Got it.
- Understood!

291
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,654
<i>Chief's calling Station 71 in, copy.</i>

292
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,057
Oh, I just want to get in there!

293
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:13,892
<i>The firefighters are
currently battling the fire</i>

294
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:17,162
<i>- on floors 24...
- I just want to get in there!</i>

295
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,763
Well, maybe they won't need us.

296
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,298
I mean, if we never get called in,

297
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,967
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

298
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:22,968
It's worse than the worst.

299
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,403
That would kill my soul.

300
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,105
<i>We have four companies responding</i>

301
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:28,507
<i>and ready to call in more
if we need them.</i>

302
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,308
<i>And I can report there have
been no deaths.</i>

303
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:33,178
Jack said if he doesn't make
captain, he's transferring.

304
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,779
- By choice?
- Why would anyone leave 19?

305
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:36,748
He thinks it'll be easier.

306
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:40,185
He says he has regrets.

307
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,920
He'll regret starting over from scratch

308
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,788
at some lame, brand-new station

309
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,023
with lame, brand-new people.

310
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,626
And guess who's not lame? Us.

311
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:53,164
I never wanted any of this.
To make him leave?

312
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,643
I mean, I can't even imagine
this place without him.

313
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,469
I-I don't really want to.

314
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,274
If he leaves, can I have his locker?

315
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:03,441
His boots are super stinky.

316
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,217
Well, we should go get a power nap.

317
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,819
Rest while we can before they call us in.

318
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:17,355
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

319
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,124
It's so hard to look away, though.

320
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,325
Can we come over here <i>real quick</i>

321
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,459
<i>- and ask a few questions?
- Yes.</i>

322
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:23,361
- Five more minutes.
- Yes. Thank you.

323
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,567
You realize it doesn't
have racing stripes?

324
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,869
Oh, I bet you were just as excited

325
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,404
when you got your first turn.

326
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,838
I don't know if I was <i>this</i> excited.

327
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:37,842
You know, the last time
I remember feeling like this

328
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,412
was my first solo surgery.

329
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:41,786
I mean, it was a routine tonsillectomy,

330
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,583
but it was a sign that
I was doing something right.

331
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,484
I was moving forward.

332
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,019
No turning back after that.

333
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,191
Oh, I can't wait to drive my
first patient to the hospital.

334
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:57,262
Miranda watching me pull up
into the breezeway

335
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,264
with my patient that I drove.

336
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:01,666
I just hope it's something good,

337
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,101
you know, like a... like a triple-A.

338
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,604
Something that she could...
she'd really enjoy.

339
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,838
You're lucky...

340
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:09,841
having that person to share things with.

341
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,543
Even if the things you're sharing

342
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,178
are emergent abdominal surgeries.

343
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,879
You've got that person. You've got Grant.

344
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,514
Yeah, I think I'm messing that up.

345
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,286
He kind of snapped at me earlier,

346
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,690
and he was right.

347
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,456
I was acting weird.

348
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,224
I don't know, man. It's hard for me.

349
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,760
It's complicated.

350
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,530
Look, it... it doesn't have to be.

351
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,466
Look, e-either he's the guy

352
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,534
that you want to share everything with,

353
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:37,860
or he's not.

354
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:41,706
Doesn't have to be
any more complicated than that.

355
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,079
I think it's complicated
for me because...

356
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:52,283
I haven't felt the way he makes me feel

357
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:53,585
in a long time.

358
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:56,921
Oh.

359
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:58,623
So tell him.

360
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,992
- Just like that.
- Yes, just like that.

361
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:04,396
W-We go to this call,
I drive this damn rig,

362
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,565
we have a good freaking day,
and then you tell him.

363
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,303
It does sound like a pretty good day.

364
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,606
Oh, it is a very good day, Montgomery.

365
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,607
We are claiming it!

366
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,477
<i>Station 19, response.</i>

367
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:21,613
Oh! <i>Structural fire.</i>

368
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,181
<i>Full response needed.</i>

369
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,191
This is it. It's time.

370
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,959
Is it time?

371
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,661
Let's go have our very good day.

372
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:39,698
This is a damn good day!

373
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,592
Okay, here's what we know.

374
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,608
Chief Ripley's operating from Base Camp

375
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,277
three floors below the fire.

376
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,312
Multiple companies have already
been hitting this thing

377
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,681
since morning...
it's still only 10% contained.

378
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,516
Get in there. Fight smart and fight safe.

379
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,519
But, mostly, let's just fight
this damn thing.

380
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,730
Ryan, what are you doing here?

381
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,698
You guys were overwhelmed
with evacuations.

382
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,900
Some of us decided to come down,
pitch in where we can.

383
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:18,970
Which we appreciate. But you're
almost tagged out, all right?

384
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:20,872
Listen up! I don't want anyone exposed

385
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:21,941
to this smoke and debris

386
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,408
- for too long, understood?
- Okay?

387
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,377
Station 19, excellent response time.

388
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:28,680
Now, containment's up to 15%,
but it's slow going.

389
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:31,216
I need most of you
on the active fire, Floor 25,

390
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,684
to relieve Company 7.

391
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,152
We could use your Aid Car team
down here on triage.

392
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:35,286
- No problem.
- You got it.

393
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,422
And I need two of you
on crowd control on Floor 28.

394
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,724
We're still holding about 100 civilians.

395
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,526
As you know, it's safer to keep
them above the fire line.

396
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,527
Hughes and I will take 28.

397
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,162
- Thank you.
- What? Really?

398
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,697
You've been waiting all day
to go after this thing.

399
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:47,265
Nah, go shine for Ripley.

400
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,900
Hughes and I can handle the civies.

401
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,936
All right, 19.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

402
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,671
Thank you. Hey, right behind you.

403
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:55,740
Wait up. Ooh, you look beat.

404
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,041
Don't you want to take a break?

405
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,576
And let you have all the fun?

406
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,678
The chief watching? Not a chance.

407
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:01,746
Race ya!

408
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,584
Told ya. Tons of fun. Whoo-hoo!

409
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,553
Easy, Dearborn. It's not a drill.

410
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:09,687
Digging her energy.

411
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:10,855
I could do without it.

412
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,056
Station 7, we're relieving you.

413
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:15,393
Copy that. Careful in here.
Debris is falling pretty bad.

414
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:17,629
All right, let's keep it
slow and steady, guys.

415
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,697
I have been there...
like, all day, been there.

416
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:20,765
Slow and steady's all we've been doing.

417
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,467
- Do you think we should get in there?
- I mean, I...

418
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,470
Yeah, and make some headway.
Go big or go home, right?

419
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,638
There's a break in the fire.

420
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,322
- Yeah, I see it.
- It's not very big.

421
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,403
Big enough.

422
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:30,441
If I can get to a fire door,

423
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,811
that may give us a better handle
over this part of the fire.

424
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,712
Closing the fire door would
probably help, but...

425
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:36,281
Then we're agreed! But it's too risky!

426
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:37,949
Damn it, Dearborn!

427
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,287
Whoa-oh! She made it!

428
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,722
Aah!

429
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,491
Dearborn, are you okay?

430
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:50,895
Dearborn, repeat. Confirm you're okay.

431
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,230
The steel from the building

432
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:53,298
could be interfering with the radios.

433
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:54,465
She may not be able to hear you.

434
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,633
She might be hurt. I got to go in.

435
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,669
Let me hook up our hose lines first.

436
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,737
Andy, it's too much.
You can't make it to her.

437
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:07,779
The hell I can't.

438
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,280
Andy, no!

439
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,898
I almost closed the fire door.

440
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,667
Stupid vent got in the way.

441
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,335
Don't worry, I got you.

442
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,074
Oh, you need more hands, better leverage.

443
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,539
Hang on.

444
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,712
Fire's getting closer.

445
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:43,750
What the hell is that?

446
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:47,454
It's an extinguisher sphere,
filled with CO2.

447
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:49,623
Whoa.

448
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,397
Herrera, you okay?

449
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:58,788
Over here!

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,167
Help me lift this thing
so I can pull her out.

451
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,387
That smoke ball thingy...
oh, it's awesome!

452
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,776
So was that throw, Herrera!

453
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,812
When I'm running 19,

454
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,248
I am making you pitcher
of the softball team.

455
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:16,223
Yeah, a simple "thank you" would be fine.

456
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,421
It looks like that sphere gave
us a major hold on the fire.

457
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,723
There's still fire
in the ceiling, though.

458
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:23,690
Could be spreading out.

459
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,626
Then you and Miller
should go check on 26.

460
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:29,830
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You can't put weight on it.

461
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:32,399
- It's okay to step out.
- Oh, no. No way.

462
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,234
I'm not stepping out
with Ripley downstairs

463
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:35,335
weighing my every move.

464
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,937
I told you...

465
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,842
This is Herrera. I've got
an injured firefighter on 25.

466
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,944
We're coming down.
Send two more to replace us.

467
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,012
<i>Copy that, Herrera.</i>

468
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:46,680
You are so loving this.

469
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:47,848
A little bit.

470
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,685
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hi.

471
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,753
Um, I'm Molly.

472
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:55,355
I'm the fire evacuation
coordinator for my office.

473
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,192
Station 19. Um...

474
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,928
Ooh, you guys are way outside
of the district.

475
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,763
So this must be a pretty big fire then

476
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,164
if they had to call you guys in.

477
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,666
Molly, I know it feels counterintuitive

478
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,201
to stay up here right now.

479
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,803
"Panic stampede running past
floors of fire and smoke

480
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:11,705
is likely to cause
more injuries than good.

481
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:14,841
If instructed, gather your floor
in a common space

482
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,741
until the fire department
gives the all-clear."

483
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:22,216
Oh, see, it's in Section 3
of my coordinator manual.

484
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,183
She's a mini Herrera.

485
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,184
Oh, shoot!

486
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,621
Last names "G" through "M,"

487
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,837
it's time for your restroom break.

488
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,793
I-I've got a list
of everyone on this floor.

489
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,895
And I also have a first aid kit.

490
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,029
Whatever you need, I'm... I'm here.

491
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,231
Okay. Well, we need to do
a sweep and check for smoke.

492
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:40,801
So you think you can cover
the stairwell for a little bit?

493
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,869
Yes. On it.

494
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,272
Make sure you get this X-rayed.

495
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:50,744
Tell me what's going on.

496
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:52,512
I was on the floor when the fire started.

497
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:55,142
Ohh. Tried to make a run for it
before I got trapped.

498
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:57,251
You got a partial thickness burn.

499
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:58,218
I'll give you something for the pain,

500
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,254
and I'll get you
on the next trip down, okay?

501
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,922
I was supposed to pick my kid up early.

502
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,591
But I got pulled onto this work
thing tonight, so I canceled.

503
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,860
Oh, she was so upset. I felt awful.

504
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:08,562
I should've just gone. Why didn't I go?

505
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:10,597
Sure, okay, you got trapped
for a minute by some fire,

506
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:11,865
and you got out.

507
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,433
These burns will get better.

508
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,669
You will get to go home
to your kid tonight.

509
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,739
That makes today a very good day.

510
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,080
See, Montgomery and I here,

511
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,775
- we already decided.
- Yes, we did!

512
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,910
We decided today may be scary,

513
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:25,879
but it's not bad... it's good.

514
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:27,214
You're getting out of here.

515
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:29,850
Today's a good day, okay?

516
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,779
No smoke.

517
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,276
No smoke.

518
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:36,356
Thank you, by the way,

519
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:39,059
for volunteering us
for the floor with no fire.

520
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,961
Are any of the drills helping?

521
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,429
I think I see an improvement,

522
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:45,365
but maybe that's just wishful thinking.

523
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,935
You know, that thing
with Jack leaving the station,

524
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,405
if I don't get over my fear soon,

525
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,639
that'll be me, too.

526
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:53,807
I'll have to quit.

527
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,208
You'll get over your fear.

528
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:56,176
Haven't yet.

529
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,145
Why does it feel like
the band is breaking up?

530
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,247
Well, at least you're not
the one leaving the band.

531
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,482
Andy will still be here,
even if she's not in charge.

532
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:05,118
I always pictured Andy and me
running this place together,

533
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,788
not me and somebody else.

534
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:09,589
But you...

535
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:14,661
I'm getting out of here right now.

536
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:15,996
Mr. Sorensen, I've told you,

537
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,397
I can't let anyone leave this floor

538
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:18,799
as fire evacuation captain.

539
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,634
The building is on fire!

540
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:24,104
And you and your stupid vest
cannot keep me here!

541
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:25,906
She can, actually.

542
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
See, right now, the fire department

543
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:27,874
is in charge of this building.

544
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,477
And we put Molly in charge of this door.

545
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,145
Would you like to sit somewhere?

546
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,680
Maybe get a bag to breathe into?

547
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:36,483
Yeah?

548
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:41,021
Let's check the rest of these
vents along the floor,

549
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,690
make sure they're not hiding
any more flare-ups.

550
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:45,158
Did you need to ask me something earlier?

551
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,494
I guess there's never
a perfect time. Yeah.

552
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:52,599
It was about that garage fire last shift.

553
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,868
I'm the reason why you were trapped.

554
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,323
The panel wasn't faulty.

555
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:58,772
I... I entered the numbers incorrectly.

556
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,307
It was a high-pressure situation.

557
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,441
Could have happened to any of us.

558
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,877
But it happened to me because
my head was kind of fuzzy.

559
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,479
I was...

560
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:08,382
I was tired because
I was out all night with JJ.

561
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:11,936
- Okay.
- I... I thought

562
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,121
I had my radio synched
with everybody else's.

563
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,723
It turns out I-I was
on the wrong channel and...

564
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:18,859
Look, that's why you were trapped...

565
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:21,495
because I wasn't paying enough attention.

566
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,631
It was my fault.

567
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:30,303
- We almost died in there.
- I know.

568
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,375
And that's all I can think about.

569
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,211
That's why I had to tell you,
because you're my guy!

570
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:42,048
And I couldn't live
with myself if... if...

571
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,185
Oh, no.

572
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:47,654
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

573
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,190
Gibson here.

574
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:53,493
We've got a massive load
of combustible materials on 26.

575
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:54,928
Paint sealant, you name it.

576
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:57,030
Fire's coming through the floor.

577
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:58,665
If it hits this stuff, it'll blow.

578
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,268
And there's enough to bring
the whole building down.

579
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,502
This place needs to be

580
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,204
completely evacuated immediately.

581
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,976
We've gotta wrap things up here, people.

582
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,478
Move everyone downstairs.

583
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:18,214
Hey, I got about 100 civilians
on the top floor.

584
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,549
- We need evac.
- What can we do?

585
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,484
I can't send the elevator
past the fire line,

586
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:22,818
and the stairwells are
full of black smoke,

587
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:25,221
but there's a PPV fan on Floor 27.

588
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,270
It'll draw all the smoke
out of the stairs

589
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:27,290
so we can get those people down.

590
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:28,534
Copy that.

591
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,960
Tanner speaking.

592
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:32,428
<i>Tanner, I need your help.</i>

593
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,897
Listen, I, uh

594
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,732
Don't want to pull an Aid Car
from the scene,

595
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,335
but my breathing is shallow.

596
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,003
<i>I think I need to see a doctor.</i>

597
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:42,305
Don't think I should drive.

598
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,440
Are you around to come pick me up?

599
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,409
I can come get you.
I'm being tagged out, anyway.

600
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,477
- But Andy...
<i>- Doesn't need to be bothered.</i>

601
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:51,280
I've gotten in her way enough.
Never mind.

602
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:55,751
It's fine. Just... I'm fine.

603
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,691
She needs a splint and ice packs!

604
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:03,694
Report in. Do you you copy?

605
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,428
Damn it.

606
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,529
What's wrong?

607
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:07,730
Radios are spotty.

608
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:10,366
Trying to tell our team on 28
to be ready to evac civilians

609
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,446
once the stairwells are clear.

610
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,102
Team 28, report in. Do you copy?

611
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,804
I'll go. I can get them up to speed

612
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:16,505
and hustle back down to help here.

613
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Good.

614
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:19,508
Glad I'm getting to see you
in action, Herrera.

615
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:21,177
- Keep it up.
- Thanks, Chief.

616
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,514
You need to get out of here.

617
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,483
You don't have any protection. No mask.

618
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:28,551
You can't be breathing all this in.

619
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:29,418
I know. I-I just...

620
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:32,221
Just... I want you to be careful, okay?

621
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:33,556
I gotta go.

622
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,458
- Andy.
- Yeah?

623
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,330
You be careful, too. Yeah, of course.

624
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,409
I'll just hold my breath,
or hold a wet rag over my face!

625
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,677
It can't be worse than burning to death!

626
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:57,013
We've been trying to get someone
on radio, but it's just static.

627
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,048
No, Ripley's ordering everyone
out of the building.

628
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,549
You need to get these people
ready for an evac

629
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:03,152
- once the stairs are clear.
- You need to sit back down!

630
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,520
You can't stop me!

631
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:07,556
Okay, that's enough!

632
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,992
You'd suffocate before
getting down five flights.

633
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,428
These firefighters are trying
to save your life!

634
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,430
You make coffee and copies.

635
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:16,599
We gave you the floor captain job

636
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,900
because no one else wanted it.

637
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,402
Now, get out of my way!

638
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:20,812
No!

639
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:22,872
You may think that I'm a joke

640
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:25,007
or... or that this job is a joke.

641
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,676
But... But I don't care, okay?

642
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,377
I take it seriously.

643
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,579
And it is my job to keep you safe.

644
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:32,415
And letting you go down
those stairs is not safe,

645
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:35,885
so you need to shut up and stay put!

646
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,089
You may be my boss,
but you are not going anywhere.

647
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:46,862
And that should be
the vent control box, right?

648
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,631
Go for it.

649
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:00,910
Listen up! I need everybody
to divide up into groups of 10!

650
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:03,879
But, remember, walk briskly... don't run.

651
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,448
It's not a race.

652
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:09,218
I can't believe I did that.
That's my boss.

653
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,721
I just yelled at my boss.

654
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,223
I'm trapped inside a burning inferno,

655
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,958
and that was kind of the scariest thing

656
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:17,226
that happened all day.

657
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,194
What if I get fired?

658
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:20,296
If there's one thing
I'm starting to realize,

659
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,399
it's that impressing your boss
isn't everything.

660
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,735
Don't rely on anybody else
to have faith in you.

661
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,170
You did what's right.
That's what matters.

662
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:30,903
All right, give it a few.

663
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:32,641
See if the smoke has started to clear.

664
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:33,844
It shouldn't be long.

665
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:36,579
Molly, you should head down
with group one, okay?

666
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,180
No. No, no, no.

667
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:41,250
I-I should...
I-I should stay and help. I...

668
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,284
Okay, that's our job.

669
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,019
Your job is to lead
the others down to safety.

670
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,354
Can you do that for us?

671
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:48,424
Really? Because, um...

672
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,025
I know my mom's outside the building,

673
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,594
and she's in the crowd somewhere.

674
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,829
And she's been texting me
to make sure I'm okay.

675
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:54,830
And, honestly, I wouldn't mind

676
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,867
seeing my mom right now.

677
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:02,204
Listen up, group one, you're
gonna go down with Molly, okay?!

678
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,439
Let's go!

679
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:08,878
Slowly. Slow.

680
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:10,546
Please take your time.

681
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:13,849
We need you in this group.

682
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,636
Okay, one.

683
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,556
Bishop, do you hear something?

684
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,625
Maya, do you hear that?

685
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,859
Yeah, you're next.

686
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:24,860
Maya!

687
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,529
Chief, how much longer
till that evac's complete?

688
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,531
We can't hold this floor forever.

689
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,668
Do you hear something?

690
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:36,739
The fire's jumping floors!

691
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,707
It's moving through the space
between the window panes!

692
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:41,510
The fire's jumping floors!

693
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,045
- Aah!
- Ohh!

694
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,015
Maya, get away from the window!

695
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:55,858
Ohh, geez.

696
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:58,386
Montgomery, you okay?

697
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:00,663
Hey, Travis.

698
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:27,459
Wait! No, no, no, no! Not all at once!

699
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:29,561
Go!

700
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,639
Vic.

701
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:41,840
Vic.

702
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:44,576
Get everyone out safe.

703
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:45,911
I'll hook a hose to the pipe

704
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,546
and knock a path out to the stairwell.

705
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,682
- Are you sure?
- More than sure. I'm good.

706
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:52,518
I'm freaking great, actually. I got this.

707
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,564
Status report, Warren? Right now.

708
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,733
Penetrating wound, extensive bleeding,

709
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,835
partially subdued by the glass.

710
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,104
Mayday. Repeat. Mayday.

711
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,440
Firefighter down.
Need immediate assistance.

712
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:16,341
No point if the radio's not working.

713
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:20,512
We're gonna get you down to triage.

714
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:21,680
All right, they have clamps and sutures.

715
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:22,748
That's all we got to do.

716
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:25,584
It's just a few floors down.

717
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:27,853
If the glass nicked my pulmonary artery,

718
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:29,621
I'll bleed out before we even get there.

719
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:32,624
I don't think it did.
Pretty sure it didn't.

720
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:35,294
Well, I guess we'll find out
in a couple of minutes.

721
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:51,710
Ooooh, oohoohh

722
00:30:51,744 --> 00:30:54,146
A lot of chiefs would be
downstairs already,

723
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,481
safe in the lobby.

724
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,883
It's just not how I like to do things.

725
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:59,424
I hear that.

726
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:02,754
Seeing how you like to do things
tonight, too, Herrera.

727
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,057
Feel like I'm learning a lot about you.

728
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:06,124
Good things.

729
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,178
Glad to hear it, sir.

730
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:09,628
All right.

731
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:25,867
Hello?

732
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:27,619
Pruitt?

733
00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:30,916
Mr. Herrera, I'm here.

734
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,786
Captain Herrera... have you seen him?

735
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,622
Uh, no. I'm looking for him, too.

736
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:39,324
Pushed a doctor's appointment
he had with me until late,

737
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,493
but he never showed up.

738
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:44,296
I waited, called. Never answered.

739
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,098
I got worried.

740
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:47,766
Captain?

741
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:53,205
Hello?

742
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,845
Anybody here?

743
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,114
I'm gonna go check...

744
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:03,482
Oh, no.

745
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:06,485
Oh, no.

746
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,654
Oh, my God.

747
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,193
Pruitt!

748
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,500
Yeah, he's unresponsive.

749
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,803
Oh, barely breathing.

750
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:27,573
And no pulse.

751
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,474
Beginning CPR.

752
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,582
The flare-ups are increasing.

753
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,884
We need to secure this floor and go.

754
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:41,653
Yeah, I'll start by closing
the fire doors.

755
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:44,423
Best way to contain the explosion.

756
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:47,726
Hey, what's that?

757
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:50,195
Do you hear that?

758
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,697
I think somebody's in there!

759
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:59,071
I thought this was the exit.

760
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:02,841
He's inhaled a lot of smoke.

761
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,344
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

762
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:06,745
Hey, hey, stay with me, all right?

763
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,747
Stay with me.

764
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:12,117
We got an incapacitated victim
on the 26th floor.

765
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:15,854
Stairs aren't passable.
We need an elevator evac now!

766
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:16,855
Negative, Gibson.

767
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,757
We can't send the elevator
past the fire line.

768
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:19,958
<i>We have no other choice, sir.</i>

769
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:21,693
We've already evacuated Base Camp.

770
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,095
Save who you can. Get yourselves out.

771
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:24,429
You know the protocol.

772
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:26,098
<i>There's a block. Elevator's our only way.</i>

773
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:28,934
Protocol? You're gonna abandon
them because of protocol?

774
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:30,202
If fire breaches the elevator,

775
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:31,536
this whole building could be compromised.

776
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:32,938
The building's already compromised.

777
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:35,140
I'm the Chief. My word is final.

778
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:36,742
As much as I hate it,

779
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:38,910
I'm prepared to gamble one life
in order to save hundreds.

780
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:40,312
It's a terrible decision to make,

781
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:42,147
but that's the job... the job you want.

782
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:45,784
Gibson, the elevator's on its way.

783
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,043
You know what I...
You know what I can't wait for?

784
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,412
Tomorrow.

785
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:03,682
Because tomorrow,
we are gonna laugh and laugh

786
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,418
about me pulling you down
all these damn stairs.

787
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:12,291
Hey, hey, Montgomery.

788
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:15,394
You stay awake.
You stay awake. You hear me?

789
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,129
I'm laughing already.

790
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,533
Hello?

791
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,602
Somebody there?

792
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,237
Could be a sweep.

793
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,806
Hey! Hey, we're up here!

794
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,642
Help. Oh, help. Oh, my God.

795
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,946
Help. Please help. Please help.

796
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,547
Please help.

797
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:36,582
They wouldn't stop.

798
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,384
They just kept going,
and they wouldn't stop.

799
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:40,705
They wouldn't stop.

800
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,421
They ran right over you,
from the looks of it.

801
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,989
Okay, careful, careful. Don't move.

802
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:46,128
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Shh.

803
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,995
How are her breath sounds?

804
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,096
They're shallow.

805
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,135
Yeah, I hear crepitus.
It's a pneumothorax.

806
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,005
I need to re-inflate
her lungs with the...

807
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,777
I don't know with what.

808
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,141
Ben.

809
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:12,084
Yeah, it's bleeding more.

810
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:13,845
The glass must have shifted.

811
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,022
She's gonna die
if you don't get her downstairs.

812
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:21,280
So will you if I don't keep
holding pressure on this.

813
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:24,963
I once told you what we do
and what you do,

814
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,200
you know, are two very different things.

815
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:32,104
You are a surgeon.
Save the life you can save.

816
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,825
We both know that's not mine.

817
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:42,547
- Montgomery...
- Hey.

818
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:48,120
This was gonna be such a good day.

819
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:58,330
Stairway's still pretty dark,
but the smoke's lifting.

820
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,032
Hey, what happened back there?

821
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,333
Didn't you hear me yelling for you?

822
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:04,703
Why didn't you move out the way?

823
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:08,540
I guess I just missed it.

824
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:31,697
You didn't have to tell me
about the garage.

825
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,764
- Yeah.
- But you did.

826
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,032
Of course, man.

827
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,500
You <i>are</i> my guy.

828
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:37,069
I know. Come on, man.

829
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,236
We gotta go.

830
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,708
You gotta watch his vitals.

831
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,676
His pulse is thready.

832
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,246
Get him on concentrated O2 immediately.

833
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,915
Yeah, I know.

834
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:52,517
Only a matter of minutes
before this entire floor blows.

835
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:57,289
We didn't finish closing the fire doors.

836
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,193
No. Jack, what are you doing?!

837
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:03,195
Jack, no!

838
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,535
No.

839
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,571
Okay, we got to go.

840
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,307
We got to get to Grey-Sloan,
and we got to get there now.

841
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:16,808
- My car has sirens.
- Okay.

842
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,436
I need my key back.

843
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:40,399
<i>Elevator's a go.</i>

844
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:41,566
<i>They're on their way down.</i>

845
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:43,602
They? Who's "they," Jack?

846
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:46,471
Jack, where are you?

847
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:51,169
Stay back. Got to get the rest
of these fire doors closed.

848
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,445
<i>Jack, no, you can't.</i>

849
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,582
Talk to me.

850
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:04,432
There's no time.

851
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:06,525
Yes, there is time.

852
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,978
Talk to me right now, face-to-face.

853
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:27,546
Figure out a way to get to the stairs.

854
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,281
Rappel down this shaft, something!

855
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:31,149
Just get off that floor!

856
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,285
I can't. Stairs are blocked.

857
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:35,153
I don't have the right gear or the O2.

858
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,489
I can help the most right here.

859
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,792
Try to secure these doors,
save the building.

860
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:42,360
You know, I didn't send you that elevator

861
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:43,495
for you to not take it.

862
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,232
Don't... Don't do this.

863
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:54,306
Don't be a hero, Jack.
Just... Just be alive, okay?

864
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,074
- You can find a way to...
- Save myself?

865
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,111
Maybe.

866
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:01,913
But what about everybody else?

867
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,849
Hughes and Bishop...
aren't they still upstairs?

868
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,518
Montgomery, Warren...
have you heard from them?

869
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,687
Miller's still riding down
in the elevator right now.

870
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,323
Our entire team's still in this building.

871
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,227
You're just a couple floors beneath me.

872
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:20,699
I won't sacrifice losing
any of you to save me.

873
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:24,069
<i>It's not about being a hero.</i>

874
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,539
<i>It's about facing fears.</i>

875
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:33,078
<i>It's about finding strength.</i>

876
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,047
Stay.

877
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:42,454
<i>It's about going where you're needed.</i>

878
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,919
<i>It's about making
the hardest decisions...</i>

879
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,542
<i>...in the worst of circumstances.</i>

880
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:08,747
I gotta go.

881
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,282
There are still more doors to close.

882
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,122
You need to run... down
as many floors as you can, okay?

883
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:18,123
Jack.

884
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,407
Andy.

885
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:23,261
I lied before...

886
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,332
...about having regrets.

887
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:28,767
I don't.

888
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,571
Not with you.

889
00:40:36,342 --> 00:40:37,442
I won.

890
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:43,299
Stay on the radio with me, okay?

891
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:46,719
Okay.

892
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,420
Okay, I will.

893
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:53,158
Okay.

894
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:14,622
<i>It's about seeing the whole picture.</i>

895
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,450
<i>It's about knowing
how to follow and how to lead.</i>

896
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:21,152
<i>It's not about us.</i>

897
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,381
<i>I told you.</i>

898
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,549
Keep talking to me.

899
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,892
<i>I know. I am.</i>

900
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:29,694
I mean it. I want to hear
you're still there.

901
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:31,696
<i>I am. I'm here.</i>

902
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:34,232
I'm heading for the stairs now.
You still there?

903
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:35,700
- Yep, I'm here.
- Okay.

904
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:37,102
I'm heading down now, okay?

905
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,543
Jack, I said, "I'm heading down."

906
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,952
Jack, talk to me!

907
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:01,326
Jack!

908
00:42:02,475 --> 00:42:04,329
<i>We're just doing what has to be done.</i>

909
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:13,138
<i>Somebody has to.</i>

910
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:24,103

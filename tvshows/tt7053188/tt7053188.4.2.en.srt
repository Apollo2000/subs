2
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,149
Hi! Hi!
Over here!

3
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,369
Hey, Andy!

4
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:25,677
Oh. Whoa! What do we got?
Pinchos on the grill?

5
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,636
Ay, before she even says hello
to anyone.

6
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,290
Some things never change.

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,075
Ah! Six feet, right?

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,772
Ay, stupid social distancing!

9
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,470
First, not stupid.
It's a pandemic.

10
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,559
Ay, still as bossy as ever, prima hermana.

11
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,126
You know it.
Second, look at you.

12
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,258
You are gorgeous, girl.

13
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,086
I would killto hug you to death.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,348
Me too!

15
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,112
Which, funnily enough, is why we can't hug.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,180
Look at you, kid!
It's been too long!

17
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,269
Mira nomás.

18
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:53,488
I know. I know.

19
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,229
Aah!

20
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,969
Did we just invent
a new corona-hug?

21
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,362
I think so.

22
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,644
I think I just earned
those pinchos.

23
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,452
Por supuesto.Hey.

24
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:02,714
Ah!

25
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,326
Hey!

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,023
This is my song!

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,852
Hey! Michelle!

28
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,245
Yes. You ready?

29
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,898
Three, two, one. Three, two, one.

30
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,944
Whoo!
Mi amor.

31
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,339
Ready?
Three...

32
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,515
Two, one!...two, one.

33
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:22,604
Whoo!

34
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,215
This is so wild.

35
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,826
It's... Everything's exactly
like when we were kids.

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,393
Why change a good thing, right?

37
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,352
I love it.
Thank you so much. I...

38
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,094
But really, you didn't have to
go through all this trouble.

39
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,057
Ah, mira. Princesathinks
we did this all for her.

40
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,663
Honey, we do this every weekend.

41
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,709
But now you're gonna have to
join us.

42
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,643
Now they're gonna make you,
even when you don't want to.

43
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,452
Of course you all never stopped
doing this.

44
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:46,758
You just stopped
inviting... me.

45
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,937
Nana... that wasa strange situation.

46
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,723
Yeah, but we're your family,
and we love you.

47
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,464
That never changed.

48
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,857
Andy, I knowwhat that face means.

49
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,469
No. It's fine.
It's... It's... Whatever.

50
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,602
No. It wasn't fine.
And it's not "whatever."

51
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,169
And now we have you back.

52
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:09,868
Now, that's
the better face!
Yes!

53
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:11,174
And now we drink.

54
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,263
Okay. And now I cook.

55
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,510
You got to tell them the
most important thing of all...

56
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:24,990
That just because you are young
and healthy

57
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,600
doesn't mean you can't be
an asymptomatic carrier.

58
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:29,018
Yeah, we know.
Thank you, Dad.

59
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,107
Okay. See,
that... that's not gonna become a thing.

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,978
Pops, it already has.

61
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,981
You're standing too close
to me, Hughes.

62
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,345
That is one demerit for
you.Oh. If only we lived together.

63
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,223
Hey, where's Herrera?
Bishop gave her the day off.

64
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,726
She's with her family. Her family?

65
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,076
Like her mom? I thought we
hatedMom. Do we not hate Mom?

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,880
No, we hate Mom.
She's with Auntie and cousins.

67
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,210
We like them.
Oh.
Hey.

68
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,821
Inara just dropped these
off. Homemade energy bars.

69
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,736
That's... so sweet.

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,043
How are her and Marcus
doing? Yeah. They're okay.

71
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,132
She's Jack's new boo.Oh. Wow.

72
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,742
No. Yeah.No. We're just friends.

73
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,546
Well, because you can't hang out
without the masks,

74
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,331
see, I would think
that would add a little kink.

75
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,747
A little romance.Ooh. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,793
I was gonna say romance.

77
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,988
"Hey. I'm Jack Gibson."
Yeah. No. None of the above.

78
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,971
Yeah.
"I rescue damsels in distress,

79
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,234
and I play with their kids
and I bring them groceries.

80
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:12,820
I can't help it
if they fall in love with me.

81
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:13,865
How you doing?"Yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,282
We're just friends, okay?

83
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,892
She made you energy bars,
though.

84
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,609
Yeah. They're the universal
symbol for love.

85
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,069
Or constipation.

86
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,158
In that case, I'll keep my bars to myself

87
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,768
because my friendmade them
for me.

88
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,856
Okay.
That's fine.

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,554
But if you break
that woman's heart,

90
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,599
none of us are ever speaking
to you again.

91
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,340
Oh. Hey.
Miller.

92
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:31,907
Sorry to hear about you
and Sasha, man.

93
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,083
Don't worry.
We will still speak to you.

94
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,476
What happened
with you and Sasha?

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,391
Was that not clear?
He broke her heart.

96
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,784
No, I did notdo that.
We just broke up.

97
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:40,785
You did?
Yeah.

98
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,004
You knew they broke up?

99
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,614
I... Why didn't I know?

100
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,660
I-I didn't put an ad out
in the paper?

101
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,620
Aid car requested
at 2221 Pat Court.

102
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,970
That's right around the corner.

103
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,542
And what if I did that?

104
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,241
You are a very mean
fire captain.

105
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,633
You know that, right?

106
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,394
I mean, you could come in
and visit me at work.

107
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,810
I mean, it's not safe.

108
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,204
Think about all the
peoplewe're both interacting with.

109
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,163
Okay. Well, this is torture.
It's been three weeks now.

110
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,905
I know,
but if my bossis not seeing her husband,

111
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,864
I'm not gonna see my girlfriend.

112
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,692
What about just a super-short
little visit?

113
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,780
No kissing on the mouth.

114
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:22,827
Not safe and, I suspect, imposible.

115
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,221
I mean, aren't you just
a little curious?

116
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,398
Crap.

117
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,488
I have to go do my job now.
My otherjob.

118
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,273
Okay.

119
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,449
It is a littlewronghow happy you make me

120
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:39,017
when I'm at work, in a hospital,
in the middle of a pandemic.

121
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,323
You're welcome.

122
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:44,066
I'm grateful to see
all of you people,

123
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,111
and I'm happy to be sober.

124
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:48,113
Thank you, Jerry.

125
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,332
Who's next?

126
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,768
How about Robert?

127
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,292
Care to share?

128
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,468
Hey. Hi. Uh...

129
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:58,036
I'm Robert.
And I'm an addict.

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,405
Hi, Robert. Hi, Robert. Hi, Robert.

131
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,692
Hey.

132
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,521
Uh... um, yeah.

133
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,524
Uh...

134
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:08,743
Sorry.

135
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,354
This is the first time...

136
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,095
for me doing this online,

137
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:18,318
and I'm pretty new to all this
anyway, so, um...

138
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:22,409
uh, I'm... I'm grateful
to be clean and sober today,

139
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,280
and, um...

140
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:30,112
Yep. That's, uh... that's all from me.

141
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,071
Thank you, Robert.

142
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,116
Thanks.

143
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,683
Who's next?

144
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,902
Everyone loved them.

145
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,546
I just tried one,
so I know you're lying.

146
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,072
This room is for exercising.
Maybe you should try it.

147
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,171
So, what are you guysup to today?

148
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,043
Marcus has a quiz on fractions,

149
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,698
so I'm... learning
how to do fractions.

150
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,901
Well, maybe you can teach me.

151
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,400
I got to go. Uh, I'll see you tomorrow?

152
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,446
If you have time.'Course.

153
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,406
So, those are Inara Energy Bars?

154
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,801
Yeah. You, uh, you like them?

155
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:07,932
So good.

156
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,108
You're weird.

157
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,415
So, what's going on there?

158
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,808
We're hanging out.

159
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,117
Okay, why is everyonein
this fire station obsessed

160
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,467
with who I spend time with?

161
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,425
Because who you
"spend time with"

162
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,514
usually has catastrophic
resultsfor the rest of us.

163
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,951
Like with you?
Exactly.

164
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,127
Spending time with her how?

165
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,216
I mean, I bring her groceries.

166
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,829
And Marcus talks my face
offabout his video games.

167
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,353
Not exactly the torrid
affairthat you're imagining.

168
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,026
Ah, but knowing you,
it's only a matter of time.

169
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,008
Nah.

170
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:43,141
She feels more like, um...

171
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,229
a sister.

172
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:45,709
But she's nota sister.

173
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,537
She's a young, hot,
straight woman,

174
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,321
and you need to not pretend
that she isn't.

175
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,932
Why?
Because otherwise,

176
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,997
you might accidentally slip
and fall and land on her bed.

177
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,457
I'm pretty sure

178
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,130
my captain's not supposed
to betalking to me like that.

179
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,547
It's safety advice.
That's all.

180
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,114
Oh. Okay.

181
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,684
I'm trying to do
thingsdifferently with her, okay?

182
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:04,989
She's been through a lot,

183
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,514
and I don't need to
addmy baggage to the list.

184
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,863
Good.

185
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,169
Now leave.
You're ruining my workout.

186
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,563
And per my very jealous
Italian girlfriend,

187
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,127
I am not supposed to be
alone with you.

188
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,612
Oh, you're serious?
Okay.

189
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:19,613
Bye.

190
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:20,570
Yeah, bye.

191
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:21,634
Don't eatall the energy bars!

192
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:22,877
Okay.

193
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,883
Who's that?

194
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,493
My dad.

195
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,625
I don't...

196
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,496
My actualdad.

197
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,063
Oh.

198
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,412
Your folks local?

199
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,109
Ish.
Out in Bellevue.

200
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,503
Huh.
You close to them?

201
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,679
What, are you taking a survey, Warren?

202
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:46,857
Just being polite, which is
obviously incredibly rude.

203
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,425
I'm sorry. I... Warren, I'm sorry.

204
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,340
I, uh...

205
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,211
No, I'm not close with them.

206
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,915
In here!
She's in here!

207
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,058
Ma'am, we're fromthe fire department.

208
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,582
We're here to help you.

209
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,520
Hey, what's your name? Can
youtell us what happened, ma'am?

210
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,328
Her name's Yvonne Boyd.

211
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,113
I deliver packages here
every week.

212
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,464
Oh, get out!
Get off my property!

213
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,292
Ma'am, were you attacked?

214
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,791
Can you tell me
if you lost consciousness?

215
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,469
No.

216
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,298
Okay. I feel crepitus.
Could be a possible fracture.

217
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,735
Are you on anything,
medicationsor otherwise, Yvonne?

218
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,215
No. No.

219
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,453
She was screaming for Lorelei.

220
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,020
Lorelei? Who's that? Is that your daughter?

221
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,089
No. It's no one.
I'm fine!

222
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,222
Please just leave!
I'm okay.

223
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,416
I'm gonna go check the house. No!

224
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,487
No! Don't!
There's nobody here!

225
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,576
Lorelei?!

226
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,970
Hello?

227
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,625
Lorelei, are you hurt?

228
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:01,671
Is anybody here?

229
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,804
What the hell?

230
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,437
Ma'am,
do you keepan exotic animal in your home?

231
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,786
A what?

232
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,049
Raw meat? The pen you have set up outside?

233
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,008
Gashes up and down your arms?

234
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,618
All right, Yvonne, look,

235
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,117
if you have a wild animal inthis house,
you have to tell us.

236
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,969
I don't have to tell you
anything!

237
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,623
Okay. Fine.
Then we'll call PD.

238
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,146
No! Don't!

239
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,777
She's a tiger.

240
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,281
A what?

241
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,935
A Bengal tiger.

242
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,632
She got out.

243
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,896
The delivery man scared her.
She didn't mean to hurt me.

244
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,681
She just gets confused.

245
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:55,769
But she got out?

246
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,640
It's Lorelei!

247
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,165
She's just a baby!

248
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,391
Dispatch, Aid 19.
We have a tiger on the loose.

249
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,612
Requesting Animal Control,
Seattle PD, and...

250
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,743
two companies.

251
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,060
Your chest hurts? Are
you gonna find Lorelei?

252
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,583
We're here to help you.

253
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,672
You can help me
by finding Lorelei.

254
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,456
That's Animal Control's job.

255
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,676
What? No!
No, you can't let...

256
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,157
Okay.
You know what?

257
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,202
We're gonna give yousome
morphine for the pain.

258
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,639
They'll kill her!

259
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,250
I know how to talk to her,
how to work with her.

260
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,382
Then why was she trying to
eat you?

261
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,906
She hasn't had breakfast.

262
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,082
With the meat shortage
at the grocery stores,

263
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,561
we've been skipping meals.

264
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,781
A hungry tiger.
That's just great.

265
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,522
And what does she weigh?

266
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,829
350.

267
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,058
Brenda is an attorney
in Michigan now,

268
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,147
and Sergio is in Florida.

269
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,734
Yes, and he can't decide
if he wants to be

270
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,542
a dental hygienist,
a flight attendant,

271
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,326
or a rolfer...
Whatever that is. Get out!

272
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,720
Hey, mi amor, Rowlf was that Muppet bear.

273
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,982
The comedian bear?
What?!

274
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,288
You girls loved those Muppets!

275
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,290
The comedian bear?
Yes.

276
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,119
Papi,
Rowlf was the dogwho played the piano.

277
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,511
The musician dog, you might say.

278
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,838
Johnny, they're making fun
of you.

279
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,646
I know, and I like it.

280
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:33,736
Your tio.

281
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,176
Tia, tell me something
about her.

282
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,743
Something good.

283
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,136
Really?
Yeah.

284
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,008
I'm... I'm sick of being angry.

285
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,099
She was a dreamer,
just like you.

286
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,841
She was passionate, just like you.

287
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,278
She was impulsive,
just like you.

288
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,629
But she doesn't have...

289
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,936
she doesn't have your grit,

290
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,635
your courage, your commitment,
your heart.

291
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,856
Bendito, that's my sister,
and I love her,

292
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,771
so I can say that.

293
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,906
You have her good stuff.

294
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:17,127
Luckily... Luckily,
the rest comes from your papi.

295
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,305
Oh.Ay!
La máscara.

296
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,613
Social distancing.

297
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,791
Keep talking.
Keep talking.

298
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,794
Well, you know, meetings on
thecomputer are just not the same.

299
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,144
Oh, no, they're better, 'cause
you can go in your pajamas.

300
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,689
You know, Robert, you would get
a lot more out of it

301
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,367
if you'd actually share.

302
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,630
I miss my wife.

303
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:45,416
Do you really think this...
separation thing is necessary?

304
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,725
I'm not sure of anything.

305
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
But I know that if
the relationship is strong,

306
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,990
it can survive
a temporary separation

307
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,949
in service of your sobriety.

308
00:12:55,992 --> 00:13:00,257
And I know that if you are
staying sober foryour wife...

309
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,606
the first time you have a fight,

310
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,217
you'll have an excuse
to use drugs.

311
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,263
So the point of the separation

312
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,918
is for you to learn
to stay sober for yourself.

313
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,354
Yeah.

314
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,096
So, let's take a look
at that incision.

315
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,794
I think it looks good.

316
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,101
Good.

317
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,060
Okay.
How's the range of motion?

318
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,062
It's great.

319
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,846
See?
Nice.

320
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,501
And pain level, from 1 to 10?

321
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,503
Oh, well, apart from the occasional spike,

322
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:31,506
2, 3 most days.

323
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:32,899
I'll take it.
Yeah.

324
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,771
All right.
You're healing up nicely.Mm-hmm.

325
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,470
Keep doing the PT, and, uh,
call me if anything changes.

326
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,472
And, Robert, listen.

327
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:44,606
The sooner you get a sponsor
and work the steps,

328
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,521
the better you will feel.

329
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,933
Another sponsor? What
are you talking about?

330
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,350
Oh, I'm not your sponsor.

331
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,134
Wait. Is that what you
thought this was?

332
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,877
W-What about the 90-days thing?

333
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,247
Yeah, that's just a suggestion
from someone who's been there.

334
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,926
No, I'm your doctor.
I can't sponsor you.

335
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,493
Ideally, you should get
a malesponsor.

336
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,974
Well, how do I find
a male sponsor?

337
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,193
Mm.

338
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,759
If only there were a place

339
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:11,633
addicts went to be together
and talk about their problems.

340
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,070
You know what?

341
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,550
Bye.

342
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,177
Just gonna leave the brass
backwards like that?

343
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,733
Yep. What
difference does it make?

344
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,909
Okay.

345
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,215
Hughes, what's the issue?

346
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,564
Nothing.
There isno issue.

347
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,044
Kinda seems like
there's an issue.

348
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,916
All right.
You kicked me out for her.

349
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,720
You made me homeless
in the middle of a pandemic.

350
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,877
The pandemic hadn't started yet,
and the reason

351
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,531
why I asked you to leave has
has nothing to do with Sasha.

352
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,335
"Confusing for Sasha."
Those were your exact words.

353
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,361
And also confusing for Pru.Okay.

354
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,122
So you evicted me for some
womanyou didn't even keep around?

355
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,539
How is that less confusing
for Pru?

356
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,020
Don't... Don't you enjoyliving with Travis?

357
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,955
Why are we re-litigating
this? Because we're friends.

358
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,899
Because I helped you
with your daughter. Becau...

359
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,983
Yeah,
and I'm g... I'm... I'm grateful for that,

360
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,159
but how I raise my daughter
and who I date,

361
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,378
it's... it's my business.

362
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,602
Well, who's taking care
of her now?

363
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:10,126
Some other stranger?

364
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,086
It's my sister, Vic.

365
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,392
Her firm shut downbecause of the plague,

366
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,655
so now she's working part time
from Seattle, okay?

367
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,266
Yeah. Great.

368
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,659
You know, I do... I know Pru,
and I know her routine.

369
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:24,488
I know she can't have
orange food after dark.

370
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,249
It isher aunt, Hughes. Okay,
you know what, Gibson?

371
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,424
You didn't actually change
that baby's diaper

372
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,928
five time a day for months,

373
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,557
and you didn't get all the poo
under your fingernails,

374
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,844
so you don't actually get
an opinion.

375
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,934
Thanks for the imagery.

376
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,849
You just replaced me,
first with some random chick,

377
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,697
and then, yeah, okay,
with your sister, but
you still replaced me.

378
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,637
Ladder 19, Engine 19 requested

379
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,421
for assist
with wild animal escape.

380
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,640
Wild animal?

381
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,859
Thank you, Jesus.

382
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,503
Come on, come on, come on. We got to go.

383
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,306
I feel fine now.
Really good.

384
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,003
Can you just drop me off?

385
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,091
That's just the morphine.

386
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,373
We need to get you
to the hospital

387
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,094
'cause your BP's dropping
a little bit.

388
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,792
You're not cops.
You can't detain me.

389
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,881
I got to go find her.

390
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,405
Get off me!

391
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,860
Are you sure you... Get me out of here!

392
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,244
Are you sureyou're breathing okay?

393
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,105
I raised her from a cub.

394
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,760
I rescued her
from a roadside zoo.

395
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,850
You call chaining up
a wild animal in your
backyard "rescuing"?

396
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,199
Not helping, Montgomery.

397
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,853
It's better than where she was!

398
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,222
Okay. Yvonne... Yvonne, listen to me.

399
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,899
I need you to calm down.

400
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,423
Just breathe, okay?

401
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,165
I got to go find her.
They're gonna kill her!

402
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,210
Yvonne, she tried to kill you!

403
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,256
No! She didn't mean to! Okay. Look.

404
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,084
We have a whole teamout looking for her.

405
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,476
Just calm down and breathe.

406
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,652
Nice and slow.

407
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,788
So, what do we do if we spot it?

408
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,661
I'm thinking we stayin the truck,

409
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,838
try to keep eyes on it,
and wait for Animal Control.

410
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,144
Oh, so chicken out?

411
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,494
You got a better idea?

412
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,148
Honestly, I am so mad,

413
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,996
I feel like I couldfight
a tiger right now, so...

414
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,630
Yeah. I'd pay good money to see that.

415
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:06,373
I-I thought Miller and I were...
like, ride-or-die,

416
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,157
give-you-my-kidney-anytime
kind of friends,

417
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:11,160
but we're just...

418
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,814
I don't know.
I guess we're not.

419
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,748
Disagree. I think he'd give
youa kidney if you asked.

420
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:17,079
Don't side with him.

421
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,168
Fine. But I'dgive you a kidney
if you asked.

422
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,086
That's nice.

423
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,957
I probably won't, though.

424
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,046
Fair enough.

425
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,416
Good morning, Seattle.

426
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,268
This is your friendlyfire department

427
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:35,663
asking you to stay insideand
lock all doors and windows.

428
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,317
There's a tiger on the loose.

429
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,233
Don't panic, though.

430
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,539
Attention, residents. Animal at large.

431
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,714
Stay inside.

432
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,760
Secure all your doorsand windows.

433
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,372
I miss Carina.

434
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,027
I mean, we had justreached
a good place,

435
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,768
and then the pandemic hit.

436
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:56,249
And I get that we're being... responsible

437
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,946
by not seeing each other,

438
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,991
but it seems kind of extreme, right?

439
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,430
But the alternativeis
quarantining together,

440
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,129
which is basically moving in
together, which...

441
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:12,221
also s-seems extreme, right?

442
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,614
Uh, it depends.

443
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,876
On what?

444
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,879
On your intentions.

445
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,098
I let Hughie move in.

446
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,461
I wasn't clear
with my intentions,

447
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,970
and look where that got us.

448
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,625
But you weren't dating Hughes.
It's a little different.

449
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,889
I wasn't clear with how longl
wanted her to stay with us,

450
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,673
and thenHughes fell in love.

451
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,761
With Pru.

452
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,721
And... And the houseboat,
and I...

453
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:36,158
She wasn't ready to leave,
I kicked her out,

454
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,768
and now she feels abandoned.

455
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,988
So... be clear.

456
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,081
Hmm.
Mm.

457
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,343
Is this cola champagne?

458
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,867
Ooh! It's so sweet!
Was it always this sweet?

459
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,782
Yes.

460
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,175
Mira.

461
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,351
Mami already likes
youmore than she likes me.

462
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,483
Shut up.

463
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,398
They are soin love.

464
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,964
You see so in love.

465
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,837
I see them aggressively
modelinga heteronormative lifestyle

466
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,231
in the hopesthat I will come back to it.

467
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,928
Huh.

468
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,670
How did they take it
when you came out?

469
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:10,845
Not well.

470
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,542
Is it better now?

471
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,023
I mean, they've had some time
to get used to it,

472
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:18,069
but Papi still refers to
my girlfriend as "your friend."

473
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,463
Sorry.

474
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:23,118
I wish I'd had you around
back then.

475
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,816
You were my sister-cousin,
and I missed you so much.

476
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,383
Well, you could havereached out.

477
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,777
So many times,
you could have reached...

478
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,127
Why... Why didn't anyone
tell me the truth?

479
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,739
Andy. I tried to.

480
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,177
That's... whywe never saw you again.

481
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,138
Oh! Andy!

482
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,835
It's still going!

483
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,750
You're teaching her really well.

484
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,012
Ah. Good job.

485
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,362
I cannot wait to show Papi.

486
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,233
Your braid looks cool.

487
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,669
I love itwhen Tia braids my hair.

488
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,759
It reminds me of Mami.

489
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,108
We saw your mom last week.

490
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:01,852
But my mom died.

491
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:02,940
She's not dead.

492
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,551
I saw her.

493
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,595
Pruitt, please, wait.

494
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,075
She's just a kid.

495
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,164
Mija. We're leaving. Come on.

496
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,253
Hermano, please, don't go away.

497
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,647
But it's true!
We saw Tia Elena!

498
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,952
Michelle, please!

499
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,868
Why are they leaving?

500
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,219
Papi.

501
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,351
Papi, what's going on?

502
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,787
Not now.

503
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,749
Okay, Yvonne,
tell me if your chest hurts.

504
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,273
Minutes away!

505
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,232
She's gotmuffled heart sounds, JVD.

506
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,669
She's becoming hypotensive.
Can you drive any faster?

507
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,061
What's happening?

508
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,282
She has cardiac tamponade.

509
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,849
Probably bleeding
around her heart.

510
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,285
Is she breathing?

511
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,460
No pulse.

512
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,722
Starting CPR.

513
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:51,008
There's no way she'sgonna make
it to Grey-Sloanwithout an airway.

514
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,468
I need extra hands!

515
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,687
Copy that.
Pulling over.

516
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:02,217
I'm talking seconds here,
Montgomery, not minutes!

517
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,261
She's in full arrest!

518
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,612
No. No.

519
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,397
Dispatch, Aid 19.

520
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,659
We have stopped at...

521
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,618
2196 Walden to intubate.

522
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,315
Patient is in full arrest.

523
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,361
Send nearest available company
to assist.

524
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,580
Also, the tiger
has been spotted.

525
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,060
I repeat...

526
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:23,499
The tiger has been spotted
at 2196 Walden.

527
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,543
What?

528
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,204
We don't abide by lying
in this family.

529
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,337
We are about honor and respect.
You should know that.

530
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,252
Prui
I am doing everything I can...

531
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,733
Everything I can to clean up
the mess your sister made.

532
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,301
Pruitt, h-hermano,
take it easy, okay?

533
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,867
You spend a day in my shoes

534
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,652
and thentell me to take it easy.

535
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:48,481
I knew this was a mistake. No more.

536
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah.

537
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,325
What? No.
More food?

538
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,283
Tres leches. Your favorite.

539
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,763
Cruel woman!

540
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:10,894
Yes! Please!

541
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,548
Give it to me.Okay.

542
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,550
Well, first,
I have to say something.

543
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,205
Our mother, Margarita,
used to always tell us...

544
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,772
Honrar a la familia.

545
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,990
Mm.
Honor them.

546
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,862
Do right by them.

547
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:22,906
Feed them cake!

548
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,213
Yes.

549
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,303
Andy, we weren't there for you
when you needed us,

550
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,306
and... I'm sorry for that.

551
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,135
We didn't agree
with how Pruitt chose to handle

552
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,920
my sister's horrible decisions,

553
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,270
but we had to respect
his wishes.

554
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,012
Don't worry.

555
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,450
You were always a topic of
conversation at Sunday dinners.

556
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,123
We never
stoppedlooking out for you.

557
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,062
We saw you win State Salsa.

558
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,344
What? You were there?
At the SunDome?

559
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,499
You were there? Yes.

560
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,042
And when you graduated
the fire academy.

561
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,808
My... My dad wasn't even there.

562
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:57,419
Oh, you had stalkers,
if not an extended family.

563
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,463
Yeah.

564
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:02,642
So, when can we meet
this husband of yours? Ma!

565
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,818
No, it's fine, Michelle.

566
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:06,254
We're separated.

567
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,821
For now.

568
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,736
We... We got marriedright before Dad died.

569
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:11,477
It happened so fast,

570
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,524
and we both need some
timeto work on ourselves,

571
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:19,223
separately,
so that we can... come back together.

572
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,487
Oh, this is a little too modern
for me, but...

573
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,923
Hey.

574
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,013
We've been separated for
so long, and look at us now.

575
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,362
Love wins.

576
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,713
You're, uh,
stuck with us now, kid.

577
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,565
She's bleeding outinternally.

578
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,764
How can you tell?

579
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,219
The veins in her neckhave collapsed.

580
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,594
Pericardium's opened
uplike a popped balloon.

581
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,812
Any sign of Lorelei?

582
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,728
Am I screaming for my life?
Then no.

583
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:46,686
Pulseless V-tach.

584
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,775
Okay. We need to shock her.

585
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,647
Dispatch, Aid 19.
Where's that company?

586
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,388
Engine 82 is five minutes away.

587
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,563
I can be there in two.

588
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:55,825
Drive.

589
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,001
Clear.

590
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,918
V-fib.

591
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,485
Pushing more epi.

592
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,836
Someone reported

593
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,708
a tiger spotting
over near Douglas Bridge.

594
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,511
That's all the way
on the other side of town.

595
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:13,060
Lorelei's a fast little girl.

596
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:16,063
Come on, Yvonne.
Come on.

597
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,543
Let's turn it around.

598
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,589
Asystole.

599
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,509
Her heart's bone dry.

600
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:28,510
Damn it!

601
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,294
What?
What happened?

602
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:32,209
Her pump's completely empty. No!

603
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,907
What... So is that it?

604
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,126
Her sternum must have
backed upinto her heart,

605
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,867
cut through it like a knife.

606
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,174
Blood just poured outinto her chest.

607
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,524
Come on!
I... Just a minute ago...

608
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,048
Her lungs were clear,
yeah, but now they're...

609
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,485
Now they're filled with fluid.

610
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,182
Blood poured out of her heart.

611
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,187
You think that tiger did it
on purpose?

612
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,799
You know, pretended to love her,

613
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,933
but secretly was just waiting
for her moment all these years?

614
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,329
Dispatch, Aid 19.

615
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,767
Cancel Engine 82.

616
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,945
Hey, guys.

617
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:15,252
Looks like the tiger...
crossed the bridge.

618
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,951
There was a sighting in Adams
and a mauling incident...

619
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:20,431
They can run up to 40 milesper
hour. She could be anywhere.

620
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,172
Just lock it all downjust in case.
Yeah.

621
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,960
Behind you, Hughes.

622
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,720
I don't need you to narrate
your movements for me.

623
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:29,789
I'm not a child.

624
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,399
Well, you throw tantrumslike a child.

625
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,096
Okay. You know,
this isn't a tantrum.

626
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,099
This is a natural human reactionto
you dismissing my feelings

627
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,512
and cutting me out
of your daughter's life

628
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,643
and abandoning our friendship.

629
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,929
I just... I thought...

630
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,341
You know, I thought
we were more than that.

631
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,429
Well, what did you thinkwe were?

632
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,151
Well, I thought we were family.

633
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,544
But I guess I was wrong.

634
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:49,069
No, no, no.
Six feet, man.

635
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,784
Time of death...
1:37 p.m.

636
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,133
Heart wall rupture?

637
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:12,092
Hope it was worth it, Yvonne!

638
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,789
Are we allowed to yell
at dead people?

639
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,574
As a rule, no.

640
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,970
Aah!

641
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,627
I lost another mom.

642
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,239
That's three in the past month.

643
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:31,043
That's three more than I've
everlost in my entire career

644
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:31,851
until thisyear.

645
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,548
Porca miseria.

646
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,637
I-I got into O.B. to bring
new life into this world,

647
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,205
not to call time of death
on mothers and... and babies.

648
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,773
I... I...

649
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,387
No, it's okay.

651
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,215
N-No.

652
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,956
It's not okay.

653
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,959
It's just... It's not.

654
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,743
She was 19.

655
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,354
She had placenta previa.

656
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:59,661
She was skipping
her hospital checkups

657
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,532
because she was afraid.

658
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:04,623
So she got here too late,
and her mom...

659
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,235
Because of COVID protocols,

660
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,455
her mom couldn't come in
with her, so...

661
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,022
she died alone.

662
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,024
And her baby died alone.

663
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,985
And now I have to go
and tell her parents.

664
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,685
And after that,
I'm gonna be alone.

665
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,861
Oh, I hate this.

666
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,297
I-I hate this disease.

667
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,996
I hate... this year.

668
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,998
I h... I h...
I hate being alone. I...

669
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:32,999
Wait, wait, w...

670
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,305
Why can't you and Mayabe together?

671
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,438
Because you and Chief Bailey,
you quarantine apart.

672
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,111
I don't...
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

673
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,703
You're staying apart becauseMiranda
and I are staying apart?

674
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:42,704
Yeah.

675
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,097
Oh, Carina. Look.

676
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,838
If it were only up to me,

677
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,101
my wife and I would
bebraving this thing together,

678
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:52,758
'cause I miss her so bad... my body aches.

679
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,151
I mean, literally. I mean,
my... my chest gets tight,

680
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:56,762
and my... my breathing gets heavy.

681
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,155
And thenl think I got COVID-19,
but, you know, hey,

682
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,028
if I get sick,
I can goto the hospital and see my wife.

683
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,727
But you and Bishop,
you... you don't have kids, all right?

684
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,687
Or... Or a heart condition. Or OCD.

685
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,732
You shouldbe together.

686
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,754
I mean, God knowsit's a
messed-up timein all of our lives,

687
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,476
but what the hell is the
pointof finding your person

688
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,087
if you don't get to
weatherthe storms together?

689
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,874
Go get your girl.

690
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,006
Thank you.

691
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:31,405
This is Aid 19.
Heading home from Grey-Sloan.

692
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,799
Copy that, Aid 19.

693
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,368
You know, um...

694
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,806
the things we love most
in this world...

695
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,025
are often the things
that cause us the most pain.

696
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,942
I'm just saying, you know, that, uh...

697
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,640
that tiger was the only thing
between Yvonne

698
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,730
and a loneliness so big,
it aches.

699
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,559
And then she held it captiveand starved it,

700
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:57,126
and now that "friend"

701
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,520
is probably out thereeating
a whole nother human,

702
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,783
so I take issue with the
whole "right or wrong" thing.

703
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,393
This was wrong.

704
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,719
Okay, you can't just give me
a moment of compassion here?

705
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,831
I mean, the woman's dead.

706
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,136
She kept a tiger in her house.

707
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,269
I mean, who the hell does that?

708
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:12,228
It's cruel. It's dangerous.
It's irresponsible.

709
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,840
You shouldn't try to forcea
beautiful wild creature

710
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,190
into being somethingit
was never supposed to be.

711
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,280
Why? Why do people do that?

712
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,866
We're not talking about
the tiger anymore, are we?

713
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,825
It is never about the actualtiger with me,
Warren.

714
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,720
That's rule number one.

715
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,641
I saw my dadon a gay dating app.

716
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,472
Yep. Living in the closet
all these years.

717
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,561
Self-loathing...

718
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,997
terrified to let his...

719
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,782
Tiger roar?

720
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,610
Sorry.

721
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,327
I wa... I was gonna saylet his family know.

722
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,397
Terrified to let
his family know.

723
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:53,182
I mean, yours is better.

724
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm sorry, man.

725
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:57,664
Thanks.

726
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,105
You just standing there?

727
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,454
Sor... Sorry, man.

728
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,761
Yeah.

729
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:10,765
D... I couldn't keep livingwith her, man.

730
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,201
There was no way.

731
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,570
Okay. So you're not
gonna help. Okay.

732
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,988
A-And I can't tell herwhy
I asked her to leave

733
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,554
or why I broke up with Sasha,

734
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:20,514
so she just thinks I'm an ass,
which is like...

735
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:21,883
I guess I'm just supposed tolive with that?

736
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,343
What's the alternative?

737
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,389
The alternative istell her the truth,
I guess.

738
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,217
But that would just ruin
our friendship.

739
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,132
It would ruin...
Stop.

740
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,700
Things at work,
it'd make everything weird.

741
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,528
No. Shut up. Youshut up, man.

742
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,617
No. Shhhhh!
What?!

743
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,923
Shh, shh.

744
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,274
What?

745
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,667
Tiger.

746
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:44,711
Tiger?

747
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,237
How did it get in?

748
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,109
Oh, this is happening.Oh. Okay.

749
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:51,260
I'm gonna do the still alarm.

750
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:53,068
Still alarm.
Okay.

751
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,896
Oh... Oh. Hughes.

752
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,158
Hughes! Hughes!

753
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:57,768
Stay out of the barn! Stay over there!

754
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,553
Make sure no one goesin the barn!

755
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,251
I am right here!

756
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,079
What is he saying,
and why is he screaming?

757
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,994
Why is Miller yelling at me now?

758
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,605
No, Hughes, stop! Tiger! What's going on?!

759
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,061
What the hell, Miller?! Whoa! Whoa,
whoa! Vic! Stop!

760
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,652
Stop what?
Tiger!

761
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:17,787
Oh, my God.

762
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,584
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

763
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,412
Okay. O-Okay. Don't... Don't move.

764
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,980
Just don't move. No,
you should probably move.

765
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,720
Okay. Come... Come towards me.

766
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,461
Slowly.

767
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,855
So, do I not move or do I...

768
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,684
do I do whatever you guys
are telling me to do?

769
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,120
I want to live.

770
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,252
I love my life.

771
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:47,775
Hey! Hey, hey! I love my life.

772
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,603
Over here! Over here!

773
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,692
Here. Here, tiger.
Here you go.

774
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,041
Here, kitty!
Here, kitty.

775
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,885
This way, this way.
Come on. Look at me. Come.

776
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,350
Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:58,960
Look at that.
Look at all of that.

778
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,309
That's right.
That's right.

779
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,267
Right here.

780
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,442
It's working!

781
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,314
Okay.

782
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,186
Over here. Over here! Okay. Okay.

783
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,318
Here, kitty, kitty!
Come this way!

784
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,322
Hoo!

785
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:16,021
Shoot!

786
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,679
Oh, that was close.

787
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,301
Uh... six feet?

788
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:36,955
No.
Yep.

789
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,568
I got you, Hughie.

790
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:42,699
I got you.

791
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,353
Animal Control.

792
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:28,919
Hey!

793
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,636
All right. All right.

794
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,488
Thank you, guys. Appreciate it, y'all.

795
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,664
Go get that tiger.

796
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,231
Hello?
Captain Bishop.

797
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,842
No, she must have snuck in
before we locked it all down.

798
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes, sir.
Animal Control just arrived.

799
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,387
They're going to
humanely remove the animal

800
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,979
and transport it
to, uh, the zoo.

801
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:49,722
Bye.

802
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:58,558
Are you r-really here,
or am I just really tired?

803
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,429
Uh, both, I'm guessing.

804
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:01,778
What?

805
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,215
I missed you.

806
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,391
And I brought you something.

807
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:08,785
Okay, I'm walking...
away from you now,

808
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:11,353
before I start breaking
all the rules.

809
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,051
Good.

810
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,880
Move in with me.

811
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,491
What?

812
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,755
Quarantining is basically
just moving in together.

813
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,800
But I don't want...

814
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:27,108
to just basically
do anything with you.

815
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:30,503
I want to do everything...
for real.

816
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:33,419
And I know that...
That we have barely...

817
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:36,552
spent three days together
since I broke your trust.

818
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:39,686
But I'm hoping that...

819
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,211
me asking you to move in with me

820
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,170
is a sign that I am
all the way in.

821
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:46,954
Actually, um...

822
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:51,350
I came here to ask
youthe exact same thing.

823
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,572
I'll do yours if you do mine.

824
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:02,143
How do you make
even nasal swabbing sound sexy?

825
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,772
Robert. It's Richard Webber.

826
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,732
Sir, it's an honor.Dr.
Shepherd sings your praises.

827
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,996
Well, she told methat you're,
um, a hot mess.

828
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:34,393
Yeah. Um... uh,
I guess that's about right.

829
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,308
Tell me more.

830
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,180
Well, I'm...
I'm quarantining by myself,

831
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:42,227
so if I were to take drugs,

832
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,446
uh, I guess nobody would know.

833
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,579
But youwould know.

834
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:51,932
How would you like to
worksome steps together?

835
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,413
Yeah, you know,
I-I like to be good at things.

836
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,850
And, uh, doing these steps

837
00:35:56,893 --> 00:36:00,332
seems, uh, a lot of talk
about feelings,

838
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,204
and, uh, that's not something
I'm good at.

839
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,424
Well, the steps are simplerthan you think.

840
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,121
It's not all really
about feelings...

841
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,731
At leastnot in the beginning.

842
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,516
You start with a list.

843
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,215
List me all of the timesthat
your drug and alcohol use

844
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,217
made your life unmanageable.

845
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,567
I mean, just... just tell the truth.

846
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:23,137
I'll start with my story first
to make it easier.

847
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,138
Really?

848
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,705
Sure.

849
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,013
You want to hear about the
timel walked into the O.R. drunk?

850
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,755
Wow. Um...

851
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,583
Yes, sir. I do.

852
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,240
You gave her the p... Wait.
You gave her the pumpkin one?

853
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,807
She can't have orange foods
after dark.

854
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,112
She'll puke all night.

855
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:45,159
Green foods only
after dark. Dude!

856
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,727
I-I don't know why.
It's... I-It works. Trust me.

857
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,512
Biological clock going off?

858
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:51,556
Ew. No.

859
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:58,259
I judged a dead woman today.

860
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:58,999
Mm.

861
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,697
Yvonne the Tiger Mom.

862
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:03,351
I yelled at herwhile she was alive,

863
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:07,225
and then I judged
hereven after she was dead.

864
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,096
Because I'm angry with my dad.

865
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:13,970
And that just can't begood firefighting.

866
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,798
Eh, probably not.
Mm.

867
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:18,410
But in fairness to you,
what she did was...

868
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,759
incredibly stupid.

869
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,195
Right?!

870
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,892
You do know
stuffing down all that anger

871
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:25,155
is not healthy, right?

872
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:28,985
I mean, I, for one,
prefer to air my grievances

873
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,378
while they're still fresh.

874
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:33,120
Even if it gets you mauledby a tiger.

875
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:35,078
Almost.
I was almost...

876
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,231
almost mauled
by a tiger. I heard it was this close.

877
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,348
Mm.
This is so weird.

878
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:44,610
What?

879
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:45,653
How notweird this is.

880
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,792
I remember that day.

881
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:55,098
The last day I saw you.

882
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,144
What you said...
That you had seen my mom.

883
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,625
Then my dad got upset,

884
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,149
and we just got in the car
and drove away.

885
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,673
We never spoke about it again.
We never spoke to you again.

886
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:08,590
And I just... forgot.

887
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:09,896
All of it.

888
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,899
All of you.

889
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,292
Psych 101.

890
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,425
The brain tries to protect usfrom trauma.

891
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,645
Yeah. I could have used you
a couple months ago.

892
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,737
You may have blocked us out, but...

893
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,435
you were never
not in our family.

894
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,829
I just missed a few barbecues.

895
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,265
Yeah.

896
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:35,922
Niñas! Enough talking!
Vente.

897
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,925
Come on. Let's seeif you
still know how to move.

898
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,143
Hey!
No! No!

899
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,058
No! Hey!

900
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,799
Andele. Hey!
Hey!

901
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:46,062
Whoo!

902
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:49,327
Come on.

903
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,293
Hey, why the long face?

904
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,687
Your dad's on call.
He'll be back soon.

905
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,434
Is this about your mom?

906
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,653
You miss her?

907
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,525
I'm fine, Uncle Snuffy.

908
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,483
I just miss my cousin Michelleand my tia.

909
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:25,580
Your dad said that you were
an amazing dancer.

910
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,981
You look ridiculous.

911
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,070
Oh, you think you can do better
than this?

912
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,419
I knowl can.

913
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,116
Come on.

914
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,253
Whew!

915
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,342
Whoa! Watch out, now.

916
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,221
You're not bad!

917
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,267
I'm better than you.

918
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,443
Andy, come on!

919
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,793
Andy! iVente!

920
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,585
IMira, Andy!

921
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,325
Hey!
Hey!

922
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:18,154
You still got the moves, girl!

923
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,034
Hey! Remember?

924
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:29,035
Ohhhhh!

925
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,993
All right!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,955
<i>Previously on "Station 19"...</i>

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,059
- Stay focused, ready...
- I said I've got it!

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:04,953
You don't have to coach me.

4
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,202
I can handle things with Jack myself.

5
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:07,329
Do you just not want to get married?

6
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:08,799
Do you not want to get married to me?

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,044
I've never gotten that close before,

8
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,602
knowing it could all be over.

9
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,604
Prolonged smoke exposure,
so the airway's burning.

10
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,838
Keep an eye on his lungs.

11
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:16,139
- JJ. Are you okay?
- Seth died.

12
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:17,207
I fought my way up,

13
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:19,567
and I didn't have anything
handed to me by my daddy.

14
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,188
She should've made
lead lieutenant years ago.

15
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,247
Andy has earned her spot.

16
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,985
<i>It doesn't actually take
that much to start a fire.</i>

17
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,119
<i>You need three things.</i>

18
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,688
<i>Heat, oxygen, and fuel.</i>

19
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>Lots of fuel.</i>

20
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,331
We open tomorrow.

21
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,098
Are you just gonna sit there
and drink wine

22
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,128
and let me do all the work?

23
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:41,135
I thought when your divorce was finalized

24
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,570
and you said, "Sue, let's open up"

25
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:44,705
this cute, little bed & breakfast,"

26
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,141
there'd be a lot more bed
and a lot more breakfast.

27
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,878
Would it kill you to help me
put this wine away in the racks?

28
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:52,480
<i>And after that fire's started once...</i>

29
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,448
In a minute.
I want to open another bottle.

30
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:55,916
No. No. You're not!

31
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:57,584
You are going to stock this wine,

32
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,852
and I am going to bake
more welcome cookies

33
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,441
for the B&B which you seem
to think will run itself.

34
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,558
I swear, you are the worst sister.

35
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:08,010
Literally the worst!

36
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:11,197
<i>It needs even less
to catch fire again.</i>

37
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,693
<i>Most people don't realize
that fire can reignite itself.</i>

38
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,197
<i>All it takes is a fuel source.</i>

39
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:29,039
<i>The teeny, tiniest flame, and, poof!</i>

40
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:32,042
<i>The whole world can explode in your face.</i>

41
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,647
You really did.

42
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,218
I can't believe they would do that.

43
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,806
Why is it every time I start my shift,

44
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,132
I get slammed with a mountain
of surprises?

45
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,407
- What surprises?
- New boots?

46
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,068
You approved new boots?

47
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,671
We needed some. Everybody wanted them.

48
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:57,340
With midsole support
that decreases foot fatigue

49
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,775
and a side zipper.

50
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:01,290
It's...

51
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:02,496
It's a big expense, Jack.

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,015
The kind of decision
cocaptains might discuss

53
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,276
and eventually cosign,

54
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,559
unless one of the captains thought

55
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,201
they no longer had to discuss
decisions with the other captain

56
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:13,456
because he felt he was
somehow already captain.

57
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:16,164
Just boots, Herrera. Just boots.

58
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,733
I don't like to talk...

59
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,278
You think we won't get the new boots now?

60
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:20,936
No, new boots are not worth this.

61
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,270
They've been bickering all week.

62
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:24,072
Bishop, you speak "Herrera."

63
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,455
Go make it stop.

64
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,534
Well, she is tired of me interfering.

65
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,311
She told me to back off. You were there.

66
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:32,139
- I'm backing.
- No, don't back.

67
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,294
- This is Bishop.
- Don't back. Backing is bad.

68
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,005
No, I'm not getting in
the middle of that.

69
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,998
Nah, I'm good. Mnhmnh.

70
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,231
And not to mention the steak
dinner you served last shift.

71
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,680
I now have to restock the pantry,

72
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:42,936
probably with powdered milk.

73
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,023
The team needed a pickmeup.

74
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,921
- You're making this a whole deal.
- No deal.

75
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,491
I just don't appreciate you
pulling these "Fun Dad" moves

76
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,826
with the steaks and the boots
when we both know

77
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,261
I have a bigger hill to climb here.

78
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:55,863
- What hill?
- With Frankel!

79
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:58,272
- I heard what she said to you, Jack.
- You did?

80
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,605
She made it pretty clear
this was your race to lose.

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,656
- I'm not going down without a fight.
- Did you hear me tell Frankel

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,709
- that you'd make an excellent captain?
- You bet your ass I would.

83
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,379
Or that you should have made
lieutenant a long time ago?

84
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,515
I don't need you propping me up.

85
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,484
I'm not propping you up, Andy. It's true.

86
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:12,852
I can fight my own battles.

87
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,654
- We all know that, Andy.
- Good!

88
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,322
- I definitely know that.
- Okay.

89
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:17,824
- Can you stop?
- Stop what?

90
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:18,825
- Fighting!
- Yes.

91
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,159
- Stop fighting.
- Yes.

92
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,160
- You sure?
- Can you?

93
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,296
- I can.
- I can, too.

94
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:51,842

www.addic7ed.com.

95
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:57,687
For a moment, I thought
I'd be upgrading these.

96
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:01,014
A fleeting, beautiful moment.

97
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,472
I need an opinion.

98
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,498
And even when I polish them,
they're still so dull.

99
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,343
Look at these.
Definitely seen better days.

100
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,544
So, II got this friend

101
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,513
who's sort of interested in somebody.

102
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,058
But she just broke up with somebody else.

103
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,226
Now, my friend wants to know...

104
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,517
By "friend," do you mean you?

105
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,113
And by "someone," do you mean JJ?

106
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,689
Maybe.

107
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,524
So, by "broke up," you mean died?

108
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,726
What's the appropriate
waiting period on that?

109
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,481
Do you think she needs time to...

110
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,153
to get over her... you know.

111
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:28,632
Her bangbuddy.

112
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,834
- Her booty cutie.
- Never mind.

113
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,369
- Sex amigo!
- Forget I asked.

114
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,004
Asked what?

115
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,152
I know many things
about many things, Miller.

116
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,711
Hazmat indicators,
disaster response team,

117
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:41,945
containment initiatives...

118
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,183
a wealth of knowledge sitting
at reception all day, every day.

119
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,185
So, how can I help?
What did you want to know?

120
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,255
Basically, he wants to get laid.

121
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,866
SSir?

122
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,880
So, the trick is to find the center point

123
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:07,915
and hang the lines so they dry
evenly and don't mildew.

124
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,373
You think that once we finish here,

125
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,843
we could take a break and, go try

126
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:13,844
the VR Fire Simulation Goggles

127
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,034
that Jack got?

128
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:16,613
This is not an amusement park, Warren.

129
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,415
You're training here. Stay on task.

130
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,894
It could also be part of my training.

131
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,752
The... The graphics
are supposed to be so real

132
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,353
that it feels like physical heat.

133
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,132
Are you asking me
to run extra drills with you,

134
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:27,558
voluntarily, in a video game?

135
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:31,028
More like a completely
immersive training experience,

136
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,464
but, um, yeah.

137
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,966
Absolutely not.

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,302
This is exactly the opposite

139
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,037
of how I thought today was gonna go.

140
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,705
You and me both.

141
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:42,739
Not complaining.

142
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,408
And it beats fighting.

143
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,586
Finally, something we can agree on.

144
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,544
Maybe we should... talk about this?

145
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,545
Absolutely.

146
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,623
- Maybe later?
- Not right now.

147
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,582
- Okay.
- You leave first

148
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,585
and, um, just slam the door
like you're mad.

149
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,153
Copy.

150
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,164
Warren. Think fast!

151
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:09,566
Hughes! Comin' your way!

152
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,834
Okay.

153
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,803
Okay, what happened?

154
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:15,239
You were not this earlier.

155
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,641
This morning, you were all and.

156
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,206
And now...

157
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,645
Was it Jack?

158
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,756
Did he do this to you?

159
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,581
What?

160
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,283
No.

161
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,252
Did he mess up the captain race?

162
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,319
Did he piss Frankel off?

163
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,831
Come on. I want to hear all about it.

164
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,590
- Deets. Go.
- Look, Corn on sale.

165
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:38,028
Now, II believe
it's my turn to cook today,

166
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,831
in which case,
I vote we splurge on these.

167
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:42,766
I make a mean truffle risotto.

168
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,767
Can't splurge.

169
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:44,991
- Not after Gibson...
- No. No.

170
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,004
Went big on steaks
during his last shift.

171
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,039
We're dipping into reserves.

172
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:52,075
- Put it back.
- Less risotto, more RiceARoni.

173
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,623
This morning, you were ripping
Jack a new one about spending.

174
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:56,713
Now you don't say a word.

175
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:58,682
Vic's right. Something's up.

176
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:00,517
What gives?

177
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:02,948
Right. Not my race.

178
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:04,788
Stay in my lane.

179
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,957
- Forget I brought it up.
- No, Maya, it's not what...

180
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,697
We have full response needed.
479 Sunken Meadow Road.

181
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:22,025
Hey, we're coming back for those!

182
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,820
All right. Grab an extra fold of hose.

183
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:39,690
Enough to make some curves and
avoid getting kinks in the line.

184
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,758
It's Gibson. We're here.

185
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,055
Who actually stays at a place like this?

186
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,016
I honeymooned in a place like this.

187
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,868
You would.

188
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,847
Clear!

189
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,716
Don't overcrank that coupling there.

190
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,686
Ready when you are, 19.

191
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:05,822
So, the oven lit up?

192
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,056
Huge flames shot out,

193
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,191
and my mitt caught on fire.

194
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,692
And then you threw the mitt,

195
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,412
which made the flames even crazier,

196
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,747
instead of putting the mitt in the sink

197
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,923
like a normal person would.

198
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:16,596
It's a normal reaction to giant
flames shooting at my face.

199
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,131
Giant flames. Okay. Is anyone inside?

200
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,233
No, no. Our first guests arrive tomorrow.

201
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:21,635
It's the grand opening.

202
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,336
Everything we have is in there.

203
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:25,215
Let's get eyes on this. Looks
like a working structure fire.

204
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,307
Structure fire. My God,
it's a structure fire!

205
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,489
Montgomery, Miller,
run a hose line inside.

206
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,478
- Got it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

207
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,509
Sir, we just completed our renovation,

208
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,511
and every dime we have is in this place.

209
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:38,980
Could you please avoid
using axes... and water?

210
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:42,817
You want us to avoid
using water on a fire.

211
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:44,447
Yes.

212
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,755
Gibson, secure the lines.
We'll see you inside.

213
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,367
Line's secure.

214
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,443
Damn it, damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it, damn it!

215
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,813
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

216
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:02,745
Don't! Don't!

217
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,474
Do you not see your
neighbor's house is on fire?!

218
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,335
Charge it up!

219
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,529
- Did they hear us?
- We're losing time.

220
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,930
Hughes, Warren, do you copy?

221
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,766
Copy. The line's been compromised.

222
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,240
We need to run a new line right now.

223
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,936
Team in there's dry.

224
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,682
We've still got a water can
and an extinguisher.

225
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,740
We'll use those. Be careful in there!

226
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,386
We have limited resources,
so don't get sprayhappy.

227
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:30,154
If flames are too big,
we don't grandstand.

228
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,189
We get out.

229
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,905
I've seen campfires that were bigger.

230
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,668
Flag on that hose line, guys. Fire's out.

231
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,712
They're lucky it was a fire

232
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:55,985
we could put out in one blast, Gibson.

233
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,362
- So are you.
- Excuse me?

234
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,141
I told you to secure the line.

235
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:01,673
That was your job. You were
on truck to protect the hose.

236
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,567
You're saying a popped line is my fault?

237
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,553
I'm saying you thought
it was handled, and it wasn't.

238
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:08,259
Don't blame me for something
I can't control.

239
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,367
You think they bought it?

240
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,859
You were very convincing.

241
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:16,238
Well, II guess I've had
a little practice lately.

242
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:17,273
We both have.

243
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:19,786
Think they're still out there listening?

244
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,388
Probably.

245
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,024
Being captain doesn't
always make you right!

246
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,225
How was that?

247
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,393
That's pretty good.

248
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:29,363
It's not about being right.
It's about doing what's right!

249
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,364
Nice.

250
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:33,500
I promise you I'll do
what needs to be done.

251
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,569
Really?

252
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,070
Yeah.

253
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:39,006
Really?! You think so?

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,407
I know so.

255
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,728
I miss the sneaking around.

256
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,997
It was fun.

257
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,999
Simpler times.

258
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,344
We were living our life in a bubble.

259
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:08,437
A secret, little, sexy bubble.

260
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:10,929
We can go back to that.

261
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,389
Sure, okay.

262
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:13,782
Let's think about it.

263
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,536
Once this race is over
and one of us wins,

264
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:18,872
it'll be different between us.

265
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:20,107
No matter what.

266
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,942
You mean we have an expiration date?

267
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,610
These are our last days on Earth.

268
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:24,845
How do you want to spend them?

269
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,846
Fighting, or...

270
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,296
Or in a sexy bubble?

271
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:34,115
<i>Aid 19, victim in
distress, Hazelton Place.</i>

272
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,056
Aid car. Not us.

273
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:47,584
Edith.

274
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,463
Same shoulder as last time?

275
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,843
Yep.

276
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,793
I'm ready. Pop it back in.

277
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,928
I am worried
about why this keeps happening.

278
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,097
It's the fourth fall
you've had in the last month.

279
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,733
I'm a dizzy dame.

280
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,961
Did you go to the doctor, like
we discussed, about your tremor?

281
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,902
It's a tic, not a tremor.

282
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,327
And I'm perfectly fine.

283
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:12,920
So, are you gonna do this,

284
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,736
or do I have to call
some different paramedics?

285
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,136
We should take you to the
hospital for something like this.

286
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,938
No way, honey.

287
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,273
People my age who go to the hospital...

288
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,108
They go in, they never come out.

289
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,176
I'm staying put.

290
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,886
Can't we at least give
you something for the pain?

291
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,023
No, doesn't help. Makes me queasy.

292
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,015
Let's just get to it, okay?

293
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,798
I would like to state,

294
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,729
for the record, that I am
advising you against this.

295
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:38,989
Montgomery, they have
Parcheesi in the lounge

296
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,715
in 20 minutes, okay?

297
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,534
On three. One, two...

298
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,826
Aah!

299
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,441
Good God, holy hell!

300
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:55,854
Well, I guess that'll wake you up.

301
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,417
Okay. You're a badass.

302
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,376
She's a badass.

303
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,367
Sure.

304
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,747
She gives me a hard time,

305
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,473
then she goes
and tries it out for herself.

306
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,255
You okay?

307
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,792
Yeah, of course. It's just a game.

308
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,791
It must be pretty intense. I mean,
you want some water or some...

309
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,028
Yeah, no, I told you I'm fine.

310
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,243
All right, if you need some help,

311
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,490
I know some tricks to bring that BP down.

312
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,804
No, I'm not your patient, Warren!

313
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,702
You're my rookie. I don't need your help.

314
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,552
Miller.

315
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:00,620
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

316
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:03,089
I would never use my status as
a firefighter to my advantage.

317
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,481
Heavens. No.

318
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:06,640
- I'm not just trying to get laid.
- Okay.

319
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,510
But you do know things.

320
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,546
You've lived... a lot longer
than anyone else here.

321
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,550
Actually, longer than any of us
here expect to live.

322
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,286
Thank you, Miller, for pointing
out my impending mortality.

323
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,421
Always appreciated.

324
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,423
I respect your advice.

325
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:25,259
And the other guys, they make
a joke, but I'm serious.

326
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,594
II want to stay
respectful to this person

327
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:28,258
and also let her know

328
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,359
that I want to take her out on a date.

329
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:32,628
And I usually don't have this trouble.

330
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:36,031
You know, II save a cat
or a dog or a laptop,

331
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,735
and... the rest is like
a selfcleaning oven.

332
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,805
You know, it just takes care of itself.

333
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:45,841
Okay.

334
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,288
Look, this... this...
this is different, sir.

335
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,923
Th... This is new for me.

336
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:50,957
Miller.

337
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:53,860
Have you and I ever spoken
about your private life?

338
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,729
No. Not... Not really.

339
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:58,265
Has it ever been my business
where you put your business?

340
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,100
No.

341
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,003
Let's not start now.

342
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,708
You need to wear the sling
for 12 more days.

343
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:09,904
No heavy lifting,

344
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,106
and watch out for swelling, okay?

345
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,508
And where are we with the new bed

346
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,510
that your grandson was gonna get you?

347
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:17,845
He's too busy to worry
about waiting on me.

348
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,195
He didn't order it for you, did he?

349
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:24,485
You need a bed that adjusts.

350
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,098
The next time you fall, you could
fall on your head or your hip.

351
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,599
He's the one taking care of you.

352
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,074
He needs to be on top of this stuff.

353
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,068
Please.

354
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:32,169
Edith.

355
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:34,572
I understand he's your grandson.

356
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,907
I have concerns, okay?

357
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,509
He can't just neglect your needs.

358
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,478
I'll speak to the facilities manager.

359
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,280
For God's sake, Montgomery,

360
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:43,876
I didn't tell him about the bed,

361
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,778
and I didn't tell him about my symptoms.

362
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,381
If he cares about you,
he'll want to know.

363
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,850
Listen, he's finally working.

364
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,686
He comes to visit, sits in that chair,

365
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,689
and tells me how happy he is.

366
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,925
Now, I don't want him worrying about me.

367
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,762
And I will not have him
scrapping his future

368
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,497
to prolong mine.

369
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,216
No, thank you.

370
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:11,414
My husband died of Parkinson's.

371
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,583
We tried everything, and it took years.

372
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:17,720
Now, I know what's happening to me,

373
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:19,733
and I don't need to draw it out.

374
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,575
He's your family. You should tell him.

375
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,060
You should mind your damn business.

376
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,765
Nice meeting you today, dear.

377
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,778
You can leave now.

378
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:37,752
It's nice in the bubble.

379
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,208
It is.

380
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,815
We can't fall asleep.

381
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,819
Two more minutes, and then you go.

382
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,753
Unless I stayed?

383
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:46,854
You can't do that.

384
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,622
Then people would know.

385
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,258
Is that the worst thing?

386
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:53,694
Yes. You know it's against the rules.

387
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,262
Your dad's rules.

388
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:58,766
And your dad's not captain anymore.

389
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,202
Technically, we should
be making our own rules...

390
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:03,103
Well, it's definitely frowned upon.

391
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,229
Frankel would flip.

392
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,931
The station... God.

393
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:08,099
What would everyone think?

394
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,034
No. Nobody can find out.

395
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,969
I kind of assumed Maya already knew.

396
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:14,372
About before. Not about today.

397
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,973
And I don't know.

398
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:17,942
If... If we keep it to ourselves,

399
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,998
nobody gets to have an opinion.

400
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,379
No one can judge.

401
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:25,149
Plus, if people find out,
then my dad'll find out, and...

402
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:26,739
Yeah, okay, all right.

403
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,822
You're right.

404
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:29,889
You're right.

405
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,317
Two minutes. I'm gone.

406
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,262
I kind of liked that
Bed & Breakfast place today.

407
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,509
Maybe we could go there sometime.

408
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:47,066
Take our bubble on the road.

409
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,039
Once they fix the kitchen.

410
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:54,610
- Obviously.
- That's not really my style.

411
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:56,312
- No?
- Mnhmnh.

412
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,647
- What is?
- I don't know.

413
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,479
Never given it much thought.

414
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,686
I think about it all the time...

415
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,359
what I want my home to be one day.

416
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,311
Which is strange, I know,

417
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:14,739
considering I also know how
quickly it can all burn down.

418
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:23,669
What's gonna happen, Andy? With us?

419
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:28,304
And once Frankel chooses a captain,

420
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,344
if one of us is really in charge
and the other isn't...

421
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,965
will we be okay with that?

422
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,660
Or... do you think
it has to burn us down?

423
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:55,939
I know we can't tell her grandson,

424
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:57,898
but I wish we could find a way.

425
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,167
Her symptoms are advancing quickly.
The tremors?

426
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,802
And if her pharynx stops working,

427
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:03,671
she could lose control of her esophagus.

428
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,116
One bad swallow, we're not being called

429
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,774
for dislocated shoulder, okay?

430
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:10,216
She'll be choking to death,
and we'll be too late.

431
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,774
Okay, you've been on your phone
the entire ride.

432
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,465
Have you heard a single word I've said?

433
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,468
Yup. Granny. Secrets. Bad.
Couldn't agree more.

434
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,303
No, really. I agree.

435
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,439
When you are going
through something this big

436
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,784
and you have people around you who care,

437
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:24,709
you should be able to let them in.

438
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,551
Exactly.

439
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,791
- Ooh!
- I mean, we had skills labs for surgery,

440
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,584
but nothing as realistic as this.

441
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:51,052
Great for you.

442
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,253
Whoo! You like that?!

443
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,588
- Yeah!
- So, you...

444
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:55,133
you really feel.
Like you're inside the fire?

445
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,357
Yeah. Superreal.

446
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:58,603
When you were using this thing
earlier, you were feeling it.

447
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,595
- You were sweating.
- Really?

448
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:01,529
Warren, quit distracting me. All right?

449
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,631
I just can't wait
to try this baby out

450
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:06,067
and feel all that damn fire on my face!

451
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:09,637
Whoo! Deano wins!

452
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:11,172
Have any of you seen Andy?

453
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:12,338
I thought she was with you.

454
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,952
Yeah, she, She was
in the office doing paperwork.

455
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:15,228
I have to head out real quick.

456
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:16,615
I just wanted to let her know.

457
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,444
Is everything okay?

458
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:22,781
Yeah, totally. Back soon.

459
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:29,588
It's me. I can't stay long.

460
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,214
I'm on my way.

461
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,823
Maya Bishop's here.

462
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,704
I wanted to get here sooner,
but I'm on call,

463
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,806
and we're not supposed
to leave during shift.

464
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,951
Just take your time.

465
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,794
That's him. That's... definitely him.

466
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,588
I saw his name,
and he looks just like you.

467
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,733
So I tracked down your number and called.

468
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:35,088
I hope I wasn't overstepping.

469
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:36,923
If it were my family, I'd want to know.

470
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:38,958
He's thinner. Did he ask for me?

471
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,693
He's been sleeping it off.

472
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:42,729
And he was shoplifting for food, or...?

473
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,697
Actually, no. Art supplies.

474
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,916
He had about 20 tubes of paint
stuffed in his pants.

475
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:50,280
The owner's not pressing charges.
Figured I'd hold him here tonight,

476
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:51,902
- let him go in the morning.
- You'd do that?

477
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,065
He wasn't hurting anybody.

478
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,726
I recognize him from my patrols.
He lives on the street.

479
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,295
No.

480
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,365
No, he's...

481
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,868
My brother likes
to keep to himself, sure.

482
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:06,470
He, he hasn't made
the best choices.

483
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:08,227
He's fine. He's not homeless.

484
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,672
Well, when's the last time
you spoke to him?

485
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,896
A year. Maybe more.

486
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,865
A lot can happen in a year.

487
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,825
I need to... II... He can live with me.

488
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,046
- I can help him.
- Not when he's like this.

489
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,848
You won't even be able
to hold a conversation.

490
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:21,007
- Ryan, it's my brother.
- He's safe for now.

491
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,685
I know you need
to get back to the station.

492
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,383
I just...

493
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,152
I just thought you should know.

494
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:27,453
All right.

495
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:32,458
Thank you.

496
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:25,096
<i>Station 19, response.</i>

497
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,230
<i>Fire alarm.</i>

498
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:27,640
Okay.

499
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,609
<i>- Station 19, response.
- Okay.</i>

500
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:31,277
- Okay, okay, okay.
<i>- Fire alarm.</i>

501
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,810
I tried to find you last night.

502
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:54,978
You weren't anywhere.

503
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,045
Guess you crashed early?

504
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,046
Yeah.

505
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,481
Well, that's not like you.

506
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:01,328
Anything you want to talk about there?

507
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,586
Why were you trying to find me?

508
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,395
Just had to take off for a bit.

509
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,396
During shift?

510
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:09,666
Anything <i>you</i> want to talk about there?

511
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,401
Are you asking as my friend or my boss?

512
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:13,952
I'm just... asking.

513
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,789
Nothing to talk about.

514
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,271
Ladies, please.
Let's get out of the street.

515
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,181
Okay, guys, we've been here before.

516
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:39,183
Smoke's centered in the rear Delta side.

517
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:41,294
That's where the kitchen is.
Any sign of the sisters?

518
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:42,819
- No sign.
- It's early.

519
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:44,498
They were probably sound asleep
when the fire broke out.

520
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:45,422
They may have no idea.

521
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,002
Between the smoke and the carbon
monoxide, they may be unconscious.

522
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,793
Okay, Hughes, Warren. Search and rescue.

523
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:50,994
Get in there and find them.

524
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,563
The rest of us are hitting
this thing from the inside out.

525
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:54,398
Let's run two lines...
primary and secondary.

526
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:55,266
Montgomery, be ready.

527
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,368
No telling how long they've been down.

528
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,303
Guy, guys, get to the door.

529
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,437
There's one of the sisters.

530
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,439
Help.

531
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:04,208
Get a gurney over here!

532
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:07,311
Wait!

533
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,446
Sue, Sue, do you know
where your sister is?

534
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:10,447
Is she still inside?

535
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:13,031
I was looking for her.
There's so much smoke.

536
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:14,185
She's not in her bed!

537
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:16,086
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

538
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,454
Go!

539
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:25,392
Clear!

540
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:27,828
Clear! No sign of her yet.

541
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:40,932
We can't see anybody from here.

542
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,066
Maybe behind that island.

543
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:47,071
We're not gonna get anyone out of
here until we've put this fire out.

544
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,673
Upstairs is clear.

545
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:50,308
Deborah's not up here.

546
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,572
All right, hustle down,
and continue primary search.

547
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,784
We've got to knock down this kitchen fire

548
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,319
before it extends to the second floor.

549
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:56,877
Copy that. On the move.

550
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,747
Hit it!

551
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:08,655
Stubborn one.

552
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,590
It ain't no ovenmitt fire.

553
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,793
Come on. Come on.

554
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:23,230
Fire's out.

555
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,444
Come on, Warren. I know
she's in here somewhere.

556
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:34,173
Listen carefully. Listen for a cry.

557
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:36,099
It's hard to hear over everything!

558
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:43,329
- Deborah!
- Deborah!

559
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:45,388
Deborah! Maybe she's in here.

560
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,840
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa. What the hell?!

561
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:52,233
We got a reignition in here!

562
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,880
Hughes?

563
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:59,573
Vic!

564
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:02,035
Vic!

565
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,261
Recharge the line!

566
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,254
Get some more water pumping in here!

567
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,775
We're gonna get out of here!
We're off bottle!

568
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,567
- Hit it again. Hit it again.
- Aah!

569
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:37,765
What happened? Is she okay?

570
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,040
I don't know. Fire just
started up again out of nowhere.

571
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,576
I may have burned my ear a little.

572
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,977
Yeah, it's a little red.

573
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,212
Let's get some ointment on it.

574
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,390
Warren, what about you? You okay?

575
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,181
Fine. Yeah, just fine.

576
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:48,816
Have they found my sister yet?

577
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,695
Sue, please keep breathing
into your mask, okay?

578
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,086
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

579
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,721
My sister is in there!

580
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,356
Why haven't they found her?!

581
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,825
What was that?!

582
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,993
What the hell was that?

583
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,362
Something's exploding.

584
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,331
She's behind those doors.
Deborah! Don't move!

585
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,332
We'll come get you!

586
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,000
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

587
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,266
You saw that fire came back.
Something's still fueling it.

588
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,227
So it'll keep coming back
until we cut the source.

589
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,071
We have to risk it.
We've got to get to her.

590
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,109
Aah!

591
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,468
Aah! Aah! Aah!

592
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:23,770
The heat's making the bottles...

593
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:24,947
do that.

594
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,974
I'm gonna die!
Get me out of here, please!

595
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,009
It's like an entire wall of dirty bombs

596
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,644
between me and our rescue.

597
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,846
Glass at that force,
it'll cut through your turnout.

598
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,182
It has to be the gas line
to the stove that's still open.

599
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,250
We got to find it.

600
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,584
I'll go knock out the valve.

601
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,027
All right. I'll go in there and get her.

602
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,734
Miller, follow him with that line

603
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:43,427
in case the fire comes back.

604
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:45,539
Maya... I'll cover you. The
fire could easily come back.

605
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:46,797
You go. I got this.

606
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:49,633
Deborah, I'm coming in!

607
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:00,888
Okay, I need you to stick close
and do as I say, you got it?

608
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:03,257
Okay, okay, it's gonna be
a little slow going, though.

609
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:19,697
- All right. We're gonna go.
- Thank you.

610
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:23,447
- And up and at 'em!
- Aah! Aah!!

611
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:25,916
Bishop, we're coming your way!

612
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:45,860
Gas is off.

613
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,757
No. She inhaled some glass!

614
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,325
Go, go, go, go!

615
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,927
Guys, get ready! We're coming out hot!

616
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:01,330
We need a med kit right now!

617
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,633
- Deborah!
- Pull her up. One, two, three.

618
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:06,168
Deborah!

619
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,705
She needs an airway. Intubating now.

620
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,923
God! She has to be okay.

621
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:13,258
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

622
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,926
She's losing a lot of blood on the leg.

623
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:18,573
There was glass flying everywhere.

624
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:19,764
We think she inhaled a piece.

625
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,343
Maya, how long's she been down?
You got to get in there.

626
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,751
I know. There's an obstruction.

627
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,711
You think it's stuck?

628
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:31,135
Deb, say something!

629
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:34,372
Yell at me! Tell I'm the worst sister!

630
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:36,007
I am! I'm the worst!

631
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,757
She's turning blue.
I need to bypass the blockage.

632
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,078
Get a crike kit!

633
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:44,423
We have to step back, okay?

634
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:45,991
Give them some space. Come on.

635
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,159
- Okay.
- Show me where.

636
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,760
- Right there. Right there.
- Got it.

637
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:49,761
Okay.

638
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:50,896
Nice and steady.

639
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:54,232
Please don't die!

640
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:57,260
Okay.

641
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:00,572
Still no pulse. I'm starting CPR.

642
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:06,052
It has to work. It has to work.

643
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:09,188
Get ready for transport.

644
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,524
Deborah! Please!

645
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:13,326
She has to be okay. Please tell me.

646
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,461
She has to be okay!

647
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:18,297
No. No.

648
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:21,100
Don't give up, Deb!

649
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:29,792
Okay, we've got a chest rise!

650
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:31,277
She's breathing!

651
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,351
- She's good.
- Okay.

652
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:49,307
You almost left me.
You almost left me alone.

653
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,306
You're my sister. I need you.

654
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,044
Maya, that was... incredible.

655
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,244
Is it because of the coaching thing?

656
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,511
Are you upset about that?

657
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,936
Nope.

658
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,872
You can't help people who don't want it.

659
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,250
And even though I always try,
I should know better.

660
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:33,975
It was an offhanded comment.

661
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:35,309
I was tired and frustrated.

662
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:38,530
I wasn't trying to...
pull rank or anything.

663
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,009
But you've been out of sorts all day.

664
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,633
And you've been out of pocket.

665
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,269
Is it something I did or I-I said or...?

666
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:46,138
You know, not everything is about you.

667
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,216
Then tell me. Talk to me.

668
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,352
What's going on?

669
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,754
My dad spent
all of his time and his money

670
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,123
on me and my training.

671
00:32:58,034 --> 00:32:59,668
The winning and the medals,

672
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:04,039
they were like... a drug.

673
00:33:04,073 --> 00:33:06,551
And Mason, he just...

674
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:10,652
He got left behind.

675
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,888
And he tried.

676
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:16,645
He stopped running,
started trying other things.

677
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,856
He got into art school,

678
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:22,987
but my parents wouldn't pay for it.

679
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:25,237
He wasn't the prospect.

680
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:29,284
And I could see he was in pain,

681
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:31,820
but we grew up embracing the pain.

682
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:35,539
I guess I thought it would
make him stronger like me.

683
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:42,697
I won an Olympic gold medal,

684
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,383
and the day I won

685
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,636
was the first time that Mason OD'd.

686
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,682
And no one even knew about it because...

687
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:58,517
he was home alone, and I was
abroad with my parents.

688
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:10,624
I feel like it's all my fault.

689
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:18,125
He's... my fault.

690
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,791
I can keep an eye on him.

691
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:23,628
When I'm on patrol. If you'd like.

692
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:38,105
I was captain for a lot of years.

693
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,032
And I'm... I'm not used to this,

694
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:44,525
being part of the group,
part of the conversation.

695
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,185
I-I've gotten used to being
outside the conversation,

696
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,044
looking in at a distance.

697
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:53,301
Sir, you don't have
to explain yourself to me.

698
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:55,394
You have to have that distance to lead.

699
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:58,655
But I don't want to be someone
people don't come to.

700
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,648
I don't want to shut people out.

701
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:03,742
And leading, it's not what I do anymore.

702
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,869
It's... So my advice is

703
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:10,842
if you like the nice,
young woman, just go to her.

704
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,470
Bring her a new incident report

705
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,730
since the old one was damaged.

706
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:18,089
See how that goes.

707
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,382
Sir, her incident report wasn't damaged.

708
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:22,864
I...

709
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:25,843
think it was.

710
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:30,466
Ha.

711
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:34,841
All right.

712
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:45,695
You know, um, when someone experiences

713
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,122
something like, you know, Blue Fire,

714
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,316
I'm sure it's not unusual
for it to rattle you.

715
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:53,342
Excuse me?

716
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,835
I'm just saying, you know,
the way the VR got to you,

717
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,928
yyour reaction at the fire today...

718
00:35:57,946 --> 00:35:59,577
I'm sure you can work through it, but
if I can help in any way, I would...

719
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,928
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

720
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,407
I do not have some fear of fire.

721
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,819
Don't be ridiculous.

722
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,402
You know, that is...
that is not the kind of thing

723
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,794
a person works through.

724
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:10,752
That's the kind of problem

725
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,821
that turns a firefighter
into a postal worker.

726
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,612
So let's be clear.

727
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,405
It is not a problem I have.

728
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,910
Okay.

729
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:23,068
You know, I was... I was the
rookie like five minutes ago.

730
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,676
I'm still building my reputation,

731
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,262
and there is no coming back
from something like that,

732
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,453
not in the eyes of the team.

733
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:28,591
- I didn't mean...
- And unlike you,

734
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:31,105
I do not have a medical degree
to fall back on.

735
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,438
So I do not have a problem.

736
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:36,780
Understood?

737
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,249
Hey. I was just down the hall.

738
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:48,206
Gary Shilabi fell
off the piano bench again.

739
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:50,548
And I wanted to check in
on your shoulder.

740
00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:53,908
Yeah. I know why you're really here.

741
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:56,534
And the answer is still no.

742
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,836
Edith, I understand your hesitation,

743
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:00,361
and I know that you think

744
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,754
that you need to spare your grandson.

745
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:03,612
Spare me from what?

746
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,389
They were all out of strawberry,

747
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:15,026
so... I brought orange and green flavors.

748
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,666
Well, Montgomery, pick up
your jaw and say hello.

749
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,929
He's a looker, isn't he?

750
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,323
Love when she talks about me
like I'm not here.

751
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,825
Hi. I'm Grant.

752
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,326
- Travis.
- Hi.

753
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,495
- Hi. Hey.
- Hello.

754
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,399
So, what was she neglecting to tell me?

755
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,271
I, It's...

756
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,173
It's not really my place.

757
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,375
Gran, what's going on?

758
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Well, go on, Montgomery.

759
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:50,208
You say it better than I do.

760
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:52,877
Now you're making me nervous.

761
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:56,915
<i>All it takes is a single
spark to restart a fire.</i>

762
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:03,721
Your grandmother needs
to see a physician very soon.

763
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:07,352
I've noticed over the past few months...

764
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:10,368
she's exhibited some symptoms.

765
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:12,727
<i>Sadly, reignition usually starts</i>

766
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:15,520
<i>at the most inconvenient moments.</i>

767
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:18,066
<i>It catches. It takes hold.</i>

768
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:20,006
Your sister came to see you,
and I think you should

769
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,510
take a couple minutes to talk to her.

770
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,038
<i>And if we aren't careful,</i>

771
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:30,997
<i>it'll burn everything in its path.</i>

772
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,727
<i>Because the fire has been here before.</i>

773
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:44,214
God, after that call and, this day

774
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,509
and Maya being weird, this...

775
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,607
- Thank God we found this again.
- Andy.

776
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:52,485
The fire knows what it's doing.

777
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,510
No.

778
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,102
You... You say my name like that,

779
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,461
and I feel aa pin in your hand
about to pop the bubble.

780
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:58,619
Don't... Don't pop it.

781
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:00,239
I don't think this is enough for me.

782
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:03,099
<i>The fire knows its way,
where to go, how to move.</i>

783
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:06,089
Stop. Let's just stop with the talking.

784
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,243
This is bubble time.

785
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,211
And it's incredible, but...

786
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,779
No, no, no, no, no, no.

787
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,015
But it's delaying the inevitable.

788
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,351
Thought that was the point.

789
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,764
I've been going along with this.

790
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:17,599
It's been fun.

791
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:19,734
It definitely beats fighting.

792
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:20,902
And it makes you happy.

793
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:22,748
<i>It's already taking
the path of least resistance.</i>

794
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:25,255
But it doesn't make <i>me</i> happy.

795
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:28,458
And I-I can stand here
and pretend it's something else,

796
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,627
but I-I had a ring,

797
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:31,928
and I wanted more.

798
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:33,430
And I still do.

799
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:34,608
Why are we talking about that?

800
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,266
'Cause we haven't.

801
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,168
- Yeah, I know.
- So let's talk.

802
00:39:38,202 --> 00:39:39,503
- I don't want to.
- Why?

803
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:41,438
Because I don't want more, Jack.

804
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:43,640
I don't.

805
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:45,960
Not... Not yet.

806
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,663
Not with you. Not with anyone.

807
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,097
I mean, maybe ever.

808
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,632
I mean, you think about the home

809
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,877
you'll build with someone someday.

810
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,035
You imagine it.

811
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,902
I-I have my home.

812
00:39:58,903 --> 00:39:59,970
I found it already.

813
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,938
Here. With these people.

814
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:05,509
At this station. I don't
want something separate.

815
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:06,843
This is the home I know.

816
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,812
I'm... I'm here.
I'm not looking for more.

817
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:12,015
We were so good this morning.
What... What changed?

818
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:13,717
Those sisters.

819
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,462
Seeing how one couldn't live
without the other.

820
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:18,054
All I could think was,
"I feel that for Andy."

821
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:19,290
But she doesn't feel that way for me.

822
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,401
What, you think I don't care about you?

823
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:23,127
- No, I did not say that.
- Of... Of course I care, Jack.

824
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:25,029
God, you... know I do.

825
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:30,468
I j... But I just... I can't waste
time not being true to myself.

826
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:31,879
Yeah, well,
I can't waste time in a bubble.

827
00:40:31,903 --> 00:40:34,206
But that's who we are.

828
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:35,808
We met in a bubble.

829
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:38,243
We fell for each other that way.

830
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:41,180
We work great in a bubble.

831
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:45,284
We are so good at taking off clothes

832
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,119
and having fun

833
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,088
and grabbing those moments
whenever we can.

834
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:52,225
Can't we just be this?

835
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,626
Us?

836
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:57,252
In our incredible,
happy, sexy, naked bubble?

837
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,578
Sorry, just needed
some more requisition forms.

838
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:04,130
<i>The fire's hotter this time.</i>

839
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,872
<i>Bigger. Stronger.</i>

840
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:08,974
<i>More powerful.</i>

841
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,212
<i>And so much more dangerous.</i>

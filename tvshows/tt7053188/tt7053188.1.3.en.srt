1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,015
Previously on "Station 19"...

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,339
I chose to stop being a surgeon,

3
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,707
but I'm not some clueless kid.

4
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,242
Do you just not want to get married?

5
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:08,984
Or do you not want to get married to me?

6
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,742
You have cancer, Dad.

7
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,911
Were you neglecting to tell me?

8
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,746
I'm promoting Andrea to Lieutenant.

9
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,715
The two of you will be
in running for Captain.

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,817
Congratulations on your
recent promotion, Herrera.

11
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,123
- Thank you.
- I remember what it took

12
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,267
to earn my brass.

13
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,770
There was nobody helping me out,
that's for sure.

14
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:24,521
- I'm ready.
- No, you're not.

15
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,725
- For what?
- For me. To crush you.

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,093
We did face death.

17
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,362
Yeah.

18
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,898
I've never gotten that close before.

19
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,673
This suits you... running things.

20
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,595
I just changed the batteries yesterday.

21
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,562
I was wondering if
you might be able to help me.

22
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,466
We got to get out of here. Right now!

23
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,072
There's a thing we do in firefighting

24
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,707
called "reading smoke."

25
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:52,143
You watch the smoke billow in and out,

26
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,719
dance around and study
every puff, every wisp.

27
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,249
This ice cream is gonna look
deadass cool at the party.

28
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,529
Mom and Dad said we can't have
anybody over while they're gone.

29
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,386
You want to impress Sydney B., right?

30
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:04,121
And the rest of the Science Club?

31
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:05,856
Freezing with nitro will do that.

32
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,859
Trust your big sis. We'll be fine.

33
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:12,596
You have to understand
how the smoke moves

34
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:15,166
if you want to contain
the fire beneath it.

35
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,436
Because a lack of containment
in our line of work...

36
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,539
is a recipe for disaster.

37
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:24,808
819 to Dispatch,
requesting additional units.

38
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,243
Okay, put me down.

39
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:28,245
I wasn't ready to leave yet.

40
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,691
I don't think you understand
the significance

41
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,493
of all my earthly possessions
going up in flames.

42
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,095
You've been injured, you
need medical attention,

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,485
and it's just stuff.

44
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,986
Stuff can be replaced.

45
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,667
My original "Purple Rain" album signed
by Prince himself is not stuff.

46
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,024
It is everything.

47
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,249
And you're not the boss
of me. I can go back in.

48
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,527
Hey. You're not risking suffocation.

49
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,828
Not even for Prince.

50
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:47,398
Smoke that intense, do you think
it's spread to the walls yet?

51
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,499
Not if we're lucky.

52
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,100
Get on the radio. Let's call this in.

53
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,107
Ladder, Station 19,
respond, structural fire.

54
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:58,842
You think you will crush me?

55
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,244
I know I will.

56
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,357
Well, let me know when it starts
the whole crushing me thing.

57
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,692
I know it didn't start at blue fire,

58
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:06,016
since I was clearly the one
doing the crushing there.

59
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:08,385
Listen to that smacktalk.
I'm like a proud mama.

60
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,865
I haven't had my turn yet
as acting captain yet.

61
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,055
Just wait.

62
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,324
Yeah, and I've still got
an hour left on my shift.

63
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,226
You wait...
for me to crush you some more.

64
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,795
Miller says he's starting
a topfloor evacuation.

65
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,857
Copy that.

66
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:20,209
- I can take your dad home.
- Thank you.

67
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,543
Grab some extra tanks
for Miller and Warren.

68
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,833
Already packed, sir.

69
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,846
And I'm right next door
if you need help with anything.

70
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,004
- Just pick up the phone.
- Is that how phones work?

71
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,472
Only if you use 'em.

72
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,040
Excuse me.

73
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:32,543
- Got to get through.
- Captain?

74
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,478
Yes. Yeah.

75
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,880
Ready to roll.

76
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,484
Dad, go home.

77
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:45,623
Guess it's just you and me now, sir.

78
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:47,918
Don't remind me.

79
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,828
So, that stuff back there with Jack,

80
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,998
was that a "we just got it on
in the turnout room" smack talk?

81
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,232
Or "we almost got it on"

82
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,101
"but got interrupted
by the alarm" smack talk?

83
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,737
Or "we're really confused
because we're in competition"

84
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,850
but just drove through
blue fire which was really hot,

85
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,785
but we still haven't talked
about that engagement ring

86
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,376
"hanging over our heads yet" sma...

87
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,511
Yes. That's the one.

88
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:10,581
See, you can keep Jack
a secret from the station,

89
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,350
but you can't keep secrets from me.

90
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,753
Don't even try.

91
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,357
Miller, fill me in.

92
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,459
Evidence there's still alarm
on the top floor.

93
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,395
Smoke was visible on ceiling inspection.

94
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,974
I think the origin
is somewhere in the attic.

95
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,164
Looks to be pretty bythebook.

96
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,300
Let's do a full evac on the building!

97
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,335
Better vent.

98
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,613
Warren, you want to head up the sounding?

99
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,871
- Absolutely.
- All right. Nice and easy, guys.

100
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:36,006
No big swings today. Let's go!

101
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,554
So you're the guy who runs back in
when everyone else is running out.

102
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,645
- I am.
- That's terrifying.

103
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,847
Why on earth would you
choose a job like that?

104
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,550
Didn't have much choice after
flunking out of mime school.

105
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,211
Stupid invisible box.

106
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,255
Got to head back in.
Don't go wandering around.

107
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,556
You fell pretty hard.

108
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,303
If you happen to grab
my signed "Purple Rain" album,

109
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,259
I won't be mad.

110
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,894
Nope.

111
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,262
Spoke to the building manager.

112
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,497
He says plumbers
were fusing pipes in the attic.

113
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,433
I inspected this building
a couple weeks back.

114
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,867
It's got some ratty insulation.

115
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,781
- Could've been smoldering for days.
- Good to know.

116
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,105
Just a taste there... my crushing.

117
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,708
Okay. See?
That's what you think that was?

118
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,178
Morning, Chief.

119
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,612
Primary search is in progress,

120
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,114
hoses heading inside.

121
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,428
Need a pressure release upstairs.
Heading up to the roof right now.

122
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,697
I heard about the bluefire tanker
this morning. Hell of a first shift.

123
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,885
Shift's not over yet.

124
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,588
Still have time to knock one more out.

125
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,557
Kissing up to the chief?

126
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,826
I don't have to kiss up.

127
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,662
My crushing speaks for itself.

128
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,535
Warren, tell me why we vent
the roof of structure fires.

129
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,615
Ventilation pulls the fire
up and out of the building,

130
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,006
preventing air
from fueling the fire inside.

131
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,109
That means less spread, less damage.

132
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,844
It's pretty genius, actually.

133
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,579
Okay, your enthusiasm's
at a 10 right now.

134
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:50,158
I need you to bring it back down to a 5.

135
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,482
Of course I'm at a 10.

136
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,385
Look, I just survived a ring
of invisible blue fire, okay?

137
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,220
And now, this! It's... It's a rush.

138
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,655
It's like, It's like
every time I step into the O.R.,

139
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,757
I got to do a Whipple.

140
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,425
I have no idea what that means,

141
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,738
but yes, this job can be a rush,

142
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,039
but you can't live in it all the time.

143
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:05,829
Dial it back. Recalibrate a little.

144
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,368
He clearly didn't hear
anything you just said.

145
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:14,171
That tanker fire just happened
a few hours ago.

146
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,484
That's a lot for anyone to take in,

147
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:16,640
especially a probie.

148
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:25,716
A building that big should make the news.

149
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,118
Show me some chopper coverage.

150
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,531
I figured I'd swing by the pharmacy

151
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,588
to grab your postop meds.

152
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,928
You're still here. Why?

153
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,293
You need anything else while I'm out?

154
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,996
Does Seattle P.D. know
that you used to hotwire cars?

155
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,232
You can't still be holding onto that.
I was 12.

156
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,001
And for the record, it was Andy's idea.

157
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:47,137
Was it also Andy's idea
that you break my garage window?

158
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,239
Okay. I'm an adult now.

159
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,541
That's ancient history.

160
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:54,211
I'm an excellent neighbor,
I protect, II serve,

161
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:56,013
I help little old ladies
cross the street.

162
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,148
That's your job.
They pay you for that, yes?

163
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:01,885
Look, you just had surgery
and I'm trying to be neighborly,

164
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:05,289
because believe it or not,
I care if you live or die.

165
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,357
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

166
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:10,994
But buttering me up won't
get you in my daughter's pants.

167
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:14,164
- What?
- You heard me.

168
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,667
No. I'm sorry, sir,
but that's... insulting.

169
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,001
And I'm just trying to help.

170
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,214
Your help is not a thing I need.

171
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,737
So...

172
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:24,308
19 to 108, with
opposition equally split...

173
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,501
Welcome to your first
roof ventilation, Warren.

174
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,079
What do we do when we sound?

175
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,169
We move from one side
of the roof to the other,

176
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,704
tapping the roof as we go

177
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,606
with, with these babies.

178
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,608
What are we looking for?

179
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:58,842
The fire's location.

180
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,511
Hard roof, it's cool underneath.

181
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,180
Spongy roof, it's trouble below.

182
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,315
Hey, easy, Warren!
Don't step just anywhere!

183
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,828
Stick to the beams
or you could fall through!

184
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:08,418
Copy that.

185
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:18,028
Fire department! This is an evacuation.

186
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,066
Fire department! You need to evacuate!

187
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,106
Smack talk Jack again.
I can't get enough.

188
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,408
You know I can hear you, right?

189
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,277
I think that's the point!

190
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,913
Actually, the point is,
we're here to vent the building.

191
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,882
Shoot! My hook is stuck.

192
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,962
Hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy,
easy! Don't lean out too far.

193
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:43,153
Or it'll go down
and you'll go down with it.

194
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,891
Here you go. I'll get you out.

195
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,094
A little more.

196
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:06,404
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

197
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:08,977
Warren, you okay?

198
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,868
I'm more than okay. That was unreal!

199
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,756
Yeah. Unreal.

200
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,483
Take it easy up here. You've had
enough surprises for one shift.

201
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:16,718
That flareup means

202
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:18,653
the fire's more aggressive
than we anticipated.

203
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,488
Warren, see those pipes?

204
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,990
Pipes? Yeah, yeah, I see them.

205
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,750
- Good. Keep doing that.
- Keep seeing them?

206
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,348
Report any changes to me.

207
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,796
Changes? Am I being hazed?

208
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,381
Chief, fire's hungry on the Delta side.

209
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,601
We had a flareup.

210
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,688
Then crank it up, Herrera.

211
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,356
All right, time to make a heat hole.

212
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,458
Alpha, Bravo corner.
Bishop, start cutting.

213
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:40,694
On it! Hughes, let's cut this baby open,

214
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,162
see what we're working with!

215
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,715
Okay, let's do that.

216
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,465
Heat hole's gonna cost us time!

217
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,001
Jack and I know this building!
The attic's one big open space!

218
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,441
A fire could tear through it fast!

219
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,175
I'm trying to avoid that, Montgomery.

220
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,077
I say we cut straight to cutting strips,

221
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:54,211
draw the fire to it,

222
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,946
and that'll stop the blaze in its tracks.

223
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,114
There are steps...

224
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,383
actual, very clear steps to follow here.

225
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,218
I'm not skipping half of them
on your whim.

226
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,887
- So, do you want us to start cutting?
- Yes, yeah, start cutting!

227
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,689
Look, if the heat hole works on its own,

228
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,235
it'll preserve way more structure overall

229
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,403
than jumping right to the strips.

230
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:09,727
We're gonna end up there anyway.

231
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,295
If we wait too long,

232
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,741
we're gonna lose our shot at it, Andy.

233
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,898
It's Captain... today.

234
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,800
And this is my call. No strip.

235
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,569
Not yet. Yes, Captain.

236
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,119
Keep cutting.

237
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:24,242
Hey.

238
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,587
Need another breathing treatment.

239
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,251
We got some minor lacerations
on his hand.

240
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,913
Hey, how are you? Is your head okay?

241
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,116
- Any dizziness?
- A little.

242
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,967
Sorry, I was just checking
to see if my friend got my text.

243
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,257
- Yeah.
- He's at work right now,

244
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,254
but he lives down the hall
from me... or lived.

245
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:39,823
- God, is there gonna be anything left?
- She means Seth.

246
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,159
I don't know his last name,
but that's her boyfriend.

247
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:44,261
Not boyfriendboyfriend.

248
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,730
More like aa hookup friend...

249
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:47,931
who lives close.

250
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,667
Yeah, he's a giver more than a keeper.

251
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,912
Yeah, I'll stop talking about him now.

252
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,803
Any luck on finding "Purple Rain"?

253
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:54,616
Just pay attention if
your dizziness gets any worse.

254
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,907
You're not checking me out much.

255
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,610
Company 19, is the primary
evacuation complete?

256
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,812
I need every civilian
out of this building.

257
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,947
Someone will look after you.

258
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,916
- Got to head back in.
- Now!

259
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,923
Come on, lady! Show me your face!

260
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,591
Heat hole's almost complete, Chief.

261
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,460
Interior team should stand by with hoses,

262
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:17,495
ready for attack.

263
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,296
Pruitt would've let you do the strip!

264
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:20,397
Yep.

265
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,965
How are those pipes, Warren?

266
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,500
Still piping.

267
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,636
Definitely being hazed.

268
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,438
Let's just start your strip!

269
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,206
I know you want to
slice and dice, Gibson.

270
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,841
I get it. We all get it.

271
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:33,444
Captain, report your status.

272
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,846
Come on.

273
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,649
Herrera, report in! Do you copy?

274
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,617
Yes, Chief, I copy. I'm here.

275
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:45,956
And what is your status?

276
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,162
Show me what you're made of!

277
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,499
Herrera!

278
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,336
Whoo! There she is!

279
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,171
Heat hole's completed, Chief!

280
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,006
Ready for waterworks inside!

281
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,509
We're hitting it from the inside.

282
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,144
Come on, now. That's enough now.

283
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,747
- Heat hole isn't working!
- Give it a minute!

284
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,282
The release will start to work
and the fire will die down.

285
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:18,655
Captain! Permission to rip a strip?!

286
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,557
Not yet!

287
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,660
Herrera, we are hitting it
from the inside.

288
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:26,196
What's the status on top?

289
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,267
Herrera!

290
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,342
The fire is still going
too strong. It's not enough.

291
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,476
Cut the strip, Gibson!

292
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,712
Hughes, Bishop, bring up the rear!

293
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,588
Seattle fire department!

294
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,991
If anyone is in there, call out!

295
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:57,361
Here! In here!

296
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,328
Aah!

297
00:11:58,364 --> 00:11:59,830
All right, we're coming in!

298
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,834
Call out!

299
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:06,003
- Here!
- Where are you? Call out again!

300
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:08,272
I'm in here! The door's blocked!

301
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,674
One, two, three!

302
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,975
Over here!

303
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,278
We're coming! We're coming!

304
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:16,580
Down the hall.

305
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:17,714
My friend's a deep sleeper.

306
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,283
Her smoke alarm's broken.

307
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,696
- You have to get to her.
- The floor's all clear, all right?

308
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,053
You're the last one out. Come on.

309
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,058
God! All right, we got to move!

310
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,893
We got to move now. Come on.

311
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,363
Come on!

312
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,801
You know, II also have
a chainsaw, Captain.

313
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:38,802
I could jump...

314
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,398
You could talk to me about those pipes!

315
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,472
Nothing to talk about.

316
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:43,640
Just how I like it.

317
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,176
Yeah. Me, too.

318
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,316
Here we go on three.
One, two, three. Open up!

319
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:04,828
Nothing's happening.

320
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:05,929
Wait for it.

321
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,364
Come on, come on, come on.

322
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,408
Yeah!

323
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,244
Love a good strip!

324
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,578
Chief, we've cut the fire off.

325
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,579
Copy that.

326
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,482
Go on. Gloat if you want to gloat.

327
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:28,151
No need. Strip speaks for itself.

328
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,021
- Are we wrapping up here, Captain?
- Yeah.

329
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,522
You got somewhere to be, probie?

330
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,102
Well, it would appear
that my good friends,

331
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,459
the pipes here, are growing.

332
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:37,027
Either that or this roof is sinking.

333
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:38,840
They've grown several inches
in the last few seconds.

334
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,431
You heard him, guys!
Let's get boots on the ground!

335
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,867
Roof's losing its integrity.
We're headed down.

336
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,602
Time to wrap up the evac inside!

337
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:47,771
How much longer
you think this roof's got?

338
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,373
Pipes grew what, six inches?

339
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,874
Yeah, yeah, about that.

340
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,144
I'd say it'll be nearly
a full collapse in 30 seconds,

341
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,212
give or take.

342
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,161
Everyone's down?

343
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,730
- Yes, ma'am. Everybody's out?
- No, not everybody.

344
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,510
Dean's still in there.
Shouldn't he be out by now?

345
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,087
How long ago did he go in?

346
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,525
He and his team are doing a final sweep.

347
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:19,861
No, that roof's not stable.

348
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,171
I told you to get them all out.

349
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,773
I updated him on the roof's status.

350
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:23,978
He knows what he's dealing with.

351
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:27,277
You have to pull him out. He won't
leave without a direct order.

352
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,779
He'll just keep looking for tenants.

353
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,881
Herrera, I know how to run a scene.

354
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,983
I am looking out for my people.

355
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:34,685
We don't risk sacrificing lives.

356
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,119
We save and protect them.

357
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:37,688
Pull him out.

358
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:38,952
Got him!

359
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,223
Let's go, let's go!

360
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,858
Give me a hand!

361
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:45,028
Here. Watch his head.

362
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,330
We got him.

363
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,598
I didn't think I'd see you again.

364
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,434
- That was so scary.
- Hey, baby.

365
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,969
Seth?

366
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,737
Wait. Wait, you weren't at work?

367
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,605
Where... Are you okay?

368
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:56,641
Are you okay?

369
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:58,442
All right, let's go.

370
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,079
I'm so glad you're okay.

371
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,146
Yeah, me, too.

372
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,115
'Cause that was a topfloor rescue.

373
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,921
Hey.

374
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,770
And the roof just collapsed.

375
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,099
Possible fractured rightside tibia,

376
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:20,070
prolonged smoke exposure,
so the airway's burning.

377
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:21,160
Keep an eye on his lungs.

378
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:22,728
Seth! God, are you okay?

379
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:26,145
What Seth is trying to say is no.

380
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,367
He's not okay until the hospital says so.

381
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:30,136
Also that in the future,

382
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,205
he'll be bolting large pieces
of furniture to the wall.

383
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,883
II'm gonna go to the hospital with him.

384
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,141
You know, 'cause it's, you know,

385
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,569
the right thing to do, as a human.

386
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,194
- Correct.
- Not as a girlfriend human, though.

387
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,218
Just a human human, so we're clear.

388
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,396
You and your fireflies. She's not.

389
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,799
Fireflies follow us around.

390
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,669
The universe sent me to her.

391
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:06,138
Hererererererer.

392
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,946
Postincident eval... walk me through.

393
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:10,109
We started with a heat hole.

394
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,712
- But I recommended a strip.
- And I took your recommendation.

395
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,680
Not right away.
I told you I know this building.

396
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,960
- We could've skipped that.
- I don't skip steps when we...

397
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:18,050
Enough.

398
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,163
On the ground,
this call sounded like chaos.

399
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,713
Listening to you now, it's worse.

400
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,390
Gibson, I hear arguing.

401
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,843
You don't argue with your chief

402
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,359
and you don't argue with your captain.

403
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:27,071
That's how calls go sideways
and people get hurt.

404
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,475
Yes, Chief.

405
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,769
Herrera, your lieutenant
had relevant experience

406
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:33,371
with this structure...
experience that you ignored

407
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,740
when you could have
used it to your advantage.

408
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,742
Captains lead by utilizing their teams

409
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,177
to the best of their ability,

410
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,678
especially their lieutenants.

411
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,747
And lieutenants need to listen
and follow commands.

412
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:44,082
Yes, Chief.

413
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,162
- Of course, Chief.
- I'm not a kindergarten teacher.

414
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,786
Do better!

415
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:50,221
Figure out how to run
this station together

416
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,829
or, believe me, I will find
someone else who can.

417
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,627
Let's go.

418
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,432
You know, it's kind of weird,

419
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:03,735
being in the middle
of somebody's stuff like this.

420
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,904
In the O.R., everyone's draped,

421
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,605
there's no stuff with anybody.

422
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,275
Here, you get to know things
about a person.

423
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,143
It's like, like...

424
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,612
like how the woman who lived here was...

425
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:17,549
was, reading
"Living the Vegan Life" while...

426
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,851
while snacking on beef jerky.

427
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:23,354
It's, I don't know... it's personal.

428
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,190
It's, intimate.

429
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,459
Yeah, you know, it's just,
overhaul, Warren.

430
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,094
You don't need to write a poem about it.

431
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:32,430
No. I mean, I like how personal it feels.

432
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,699
Look, man, here's a word of advice.

433
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:35,867
You're new to this.

434
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:37,869
Making it personal isn't good.

435
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,237
If you let yourself get personal

436
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:41,372
with your saves or your losses,

437
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,908
you'll overload, freeze up.

438
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:46,411
And then you'll find yourself
drowning in...

439
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:48,246
Yes!

440
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,581
I found it.

441
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:50,648
Found what?

442
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:52,221
Nothin'.

443
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:56,888
Look, if you find yourself
getting attached,

444
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:58,289
you shut it off,

445
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,658
you put it up in a shelf
and you lock it away.

446
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:03,561
Because they won't get you anywhere good.

447
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,598
That's what you do?

448
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,534
Yeah. Damn right I do.

449
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,477
You know, there's a reason

450
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:21,279
the textbook says heat hole first.

451
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,680
It's lets you take a peek

452
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:25,316
before you tear the whole roof
open with a damn strip.

453
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:26,784
I mean, you taught me that.

454
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,153
I love a good strip.

455
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,554
Frankel only made it an issue

456
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:31,156
because I questioned her judgement.

457
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,194
I'm gonna say something
you're not gonna like.

458
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:37,929
Okay. You're spoiled.

459
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,932
Excuse me?

460
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:44,102
I always encouraged you
to speak up as your dad,

461
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:46,504
as your captain, but with Frankel,

462
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,307
you got to be a little more... political.

463
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,576
I am not playing politics

464
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,055
when it comes to the lives of my crew.

465
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,445
You're not eating.

466
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,282
Well, it's hard to work up an appetite

467
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,783
at radiation treatment.

468
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,587
Made some calls today to some old friends

469
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:03,888
about finding me a job.

470
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:05,438
- What?
- Well, nothing fancy.

471
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:08,660
Just sitting at a desk,
maybe answer a phone.

472
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,330
II can't just sit around here
all day, every day.

473
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,933
- It's been less than 48 hours.
- I need something to do.

474
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,868
You have something to do...
heal your body.

475
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,002
Do that.

476
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,537
I can heal just as well

477
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:20,817
sitting at a desk
as I can stuck on that couch.

478
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:22,740
Incorrect. At a desk, you help others.

479
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,209
At home, you help you.

480
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:27,549
And you really need
to help you right now.

481
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,714
This isn't a common cold, Dad.

482
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,849
- It's cancer.
- I'm aware.

483
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:35,825
But I'm not that hungry.

484
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,738
Hey, it's me.

485
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,007
What are you doing right now?

486
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,722
I could use some company.

487
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,713
I'm so glad to see you.

488
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,750
Beer. That's cute.

489
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:08,253
- I brought vodka.
- You know, my dad is...

490
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,155
I don't know what to do with him.

491
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:12,991
He... He's refusing to stay home,

492
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,026
he thinks he needs to get some desk job.

493
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,362
Then I made the mistake
of talking to him about Frankel.

494
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:18,496
Pause.

495
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,331
For a toast to your first day as captain

496
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,300
and one hell of a first shift.

497
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:23,468
You murdered it.

498
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:25,937
I will daydrink to that.

499
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,406
Frankel didn't see it that way.

500
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,542
Well, Frankel doesn't pay compliments

501
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,011
because she never got them.

502
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,445
She had it tough coming up.

503
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,780
Yeah, and she thinks I didn't.

504
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:36,881
You didn't.

505
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,049
Well, not like her.

506
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:40,018
None of us did, partly thanks to her.

507
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,153
True. And that's true.

508
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:43,421
To Frankel.

509
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,523
- To Andy.
- To vodka.

510
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,827
Daydrinking is a good first step,

511
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:51,462
but you need to treat yourself.

512
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:53,965
Yeah, II was thinking
I might head out to Gold Bar

513
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,533
and get in a good rock climb.

514
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,502
Your treats and my treats
are not the same.

515
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,803
I like to climb.

516
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:01,306
It... It gets me out of my head.
Maya, you run all the time.

517
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,341
That is selfdiscipline, not selfcare.

518
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,109
And what is your selfcare?

519
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,178
Lots and lots of sex.

520
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,113
I highly recommend it.

521
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,516
- New lady on the horizon?
- Spill.

522
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,819
More like a series of ladies and gents.

523
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:17,322
Monogamy is for the weak.

524
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,824
Or the very, very dedicated.

525
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,959
A man with a badge approaching.

526
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,262
And it might be the vodka talking,

527
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:26,364
but he looks very chiseled
in the daylight...

528
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,599
Slow your roll, Hughes.
We don't double dip.

529
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,160
Double dip? Who dipped?

530
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,871
Herrera. Okay. Respect.

531
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:35,139
I'm gonna need details.

532
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:36,140
Shh. Stop.

533
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,809
Specific and elaborate details!

534
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:39,744
Technically, I could cite
all three of you

535
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,459
for public consumption
and open containers.

536
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:43,559
This is private property.
That is not cool.

537
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,583
Guys, guys, he's kidding.

538
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:49,487
You... you off duty?

539
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:50,934
How's your dad?

540
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,724
Walked all the way over here

541
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,292
to talk about her dad, did you?

542
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:57,195
Actually, I'd hoped to catch
Andy alone for a minute,

543
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,830
but that can wait.

544
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:00,965
Are you sure?
We... We can go inside if...

545
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,468
No. No, it's not... It's fine.

546
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,037
I should go. Talk later.

547
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,107
Don't drink and drive, okay?

548
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,676
All right.

549
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:16,714
He looks just as good walking away.

550
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,151
Welldipped, Herrera. Welldipped.

551
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:31,668
You're here early.

552
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:34,073
Yeah. I wanted to get a jump on things.

553
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:35,526
I approved the overtime requests,

554
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,742
ordered tank replacements,

555
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:38,775
emailed volunteers
about the pancake fundraiser,

556
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,345
and now coffee.

557
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,813
You seem...

558
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,548
right at home.

559
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:47,351
Well, then, do you want to talk about

560
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:49,531
the admin forms I filled out
as captain from the last shift?

561
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:51,533
- No, I got myself up to speed.
- My dad and I, we...

562
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:54,558
Okay. Well, then the O2
tanks need to be checked.

563
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:56,393
- I can do that.
- Already done.

564
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:58,273
And in the future, I want people
to check their own tanks.

565
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:00,163
I don't like micromanaging.

566
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,898
I'm... I'm just trying to help.

567
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,834
I'll let you know if I need any.

568
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,536
Thanks, Lieutenant.

569
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:18,949
All right, let's get started.

570
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,317
Roll call time.

571
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:23,086
I just want to say
that I've cleaned the showers

572
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:25,554
two shifts in a row,
and I'm ready to move on.

573
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,660
Then I got good news for you, Montgomery.

574
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,295
I'm switching it up.

575
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,683
No one has to scrub the showers.

576
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:34,285
At least not right now.

577
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,499
Say what now?

578
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,234
Look, obviously, it's got to get done.

579
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,536
But on my shift, there are no hard rules.

580
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,640
As long as chores are done
by the end of the day,

581
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:42,873
I'm fine.

582
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,508
I trust everyone can manage their time.

583
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:49,579
Sure. Me, too.

584
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:51,132
II trust everyone.

585
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:53,984
But "B" shift
raided our pantry last night

586
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,485
and left the bathrooms pretty rank.

587
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:58,555
Maybe we should clean up,
then restock in that order,

588
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,324
- like we always do.
- Like I said,

589
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,527
you'll manage your own schedule
or just get it done.

590
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,096
- Copy that.
- Will do.

591
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:07,998
- Good.
- Yep.

592
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,000
It's good, right?

593
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:11,868
Yeah, it's really good. Thank you.

594
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,437
Yeah, it's really good man.

595
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:20,077
Sticking to schedule.

596
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:21,545
You're a wild woman, Herrera.

597
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,679
I like the schedule.

598
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:25,148
The schedule keeps us safe and on task.

599
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:28,652
The schedule makes me all warm
and fuzzy inside.

600
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:32,289
So, you know how you wanted
your dad to stay home?

601
00:24:38,864 --> 00:24:40,364
You always have to dial 9 to get out.

602
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,144
- I understand. It's the transfer...
- Dad. Dad, what are you doing here?

603
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:44,579
Working reception, if I can ever
figure out the system.

604
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:45,769
Yeah, reception,

605
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,105
where germy strangers
walk in and out every day,

606
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,741
when your immune system is compromised.

607
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:52,500
- You did this.
- It was my idea.

608
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,111
I approved it, yes.

609
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:57,013
Shh! Duty calls.

610
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:02,308
Good morning. Seattle Fire
Department, Station 19.

611
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,611
This is Pruitt speaking.
How can I help you?

612
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,904
OOkay, I knew you weren't
gonna be wild about this,

613
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,037
but just hear me out.

614
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,597
- Office. Now.
- Okay.

615
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,281
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,694
Why would you hire my father
to work here?

617
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:20,223
Just... why?!

618
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:21,357
He'll...

619
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,159
He'll work reception, answer some phones.

620
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,528
At most, he'll give the walkins
their BP checks.

621
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:27,975
Look, if he's gonna work a desk
somewhere, it might as well be here.

622
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,066
He's my dad. Not yours.

623
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,400
He's my captain.

624
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,636
I got a call from Station 23,

625
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,905
asking me to recommend him
for a job over there.

626
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,206
That's clear across town.

627
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:40,142
I said no, 'cause we could be closer.

628
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:42,979
It's like you think you're
trying to help me or something.

629
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,046
But you're not.

630
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:45,681
Having him underfoot all the time,

631
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,216
watching over our shoulders...

632
00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:48,584
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

633
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,219
I value his input.

634
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,408
Okay.

635
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,789
I see.

636
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:56,058
AAnd you didn't think
to even give me a headsup,

637
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:57,581
because...?

638
00:25:58,495 --> 00:25:59,962
Byebye.

639
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:02,064
Unbelievable.

640
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,468
WWhy is it such a big deal?

641
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:23,185
You can't let them get to you.

642
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:24,487
Shut it off. Put it away.

643
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:25,799
Jack's in charge for five minutes

644
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,468
and he's already changing
every single thing.

645
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,457
Hey, can I help?

646
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,059
Well, I'm basically already d...

647
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:31,727
Okay. Well, yeah. Never mind.

648
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:33,496
So, clear the air after shift.

649
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:35,831
- Or clear the air now.
- No.

650
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:36,932
Frankel's right.

651
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:38,334
Jack's in charge now,

652
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,903
and I just need to be
the best lieutenant I can be.

653
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:43,306
He's counting on that, you know?

654
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:45,474
He's taking your ruleabiding,
goodsoldier thing

655
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,942
and using it against you.

656
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:48,010
That's smart.

657
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:49,679
That's the sign of a good competitor.

658
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,481
Or it's just Jack trying
his best and me doing mine.

659
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,291
- Doubt it.
- No.

660
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:58,254
Station 19, respond.

661
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,588
Multiple victims.

662
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:03,993
357 Fairmont Avenue.

663
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,999
Okay.

664
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,101
It's a medical call, you know?

665
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,003
Victims and people in peril.

666
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:15,071
Yeah, I know.

667
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:16,583
Yeah, well, 'cause you kind of seem like

668
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,241
you're expecting a bounce house
and a backyard barbecue.

669
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:20,676
No, no. See, no barbecue.

670
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,678
No smoke, no fire, just a medical call.

671
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:24,847
Bythebook medical call.
Why aren't you pumped?

672
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:26,882
- You're the medicine man.
- You have to come help!

673
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:28,862
I pulled them out of the pool and
I tried, but they won't wake up!

674
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,486
They won't wake up!

675
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,622
You have to wake them up!

676
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,525
- Herrera, set up a triage over here.
- Will do.

677
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,016
Everybody else, take a kid.

678
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:47,190
Start resuscitating.
Warren, check the girl.

679
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,315
See what you can find out...
drugs, alcohol...

680
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,780
This is 19 to Dispatch,

681
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:52,685
requesting additional units
and a hazmat team.

682
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:54,887
Why is there fog in the pool?

683
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,222
Why do these kids all look dead?

684
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,124
That's my brother!
That's my baby brother!

685
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,438
And the best way for us to help him
is to find out what happened here.

686
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,139
Now, did you all take anything?
Drugs or...?

687
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,830
God, no! Nothing like that.

688
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:05,465
We were just making ice cream.

689
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:10,036
Easy. Slow, deep breaths.

690
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,638
We got one back.

691
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,106
He's unresponsive to any stimuli.

692
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,119
Airway's clear. I'm bagging him now.

693
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:16,486
I'll start CPR.

694
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,645
- God!
- II need you to be specific.

695
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,446
Now, do you mean ice cream ice cream?

696
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,115
And wwhat's the gas over the pool?

697
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,282
Is that liquid nitrogen?

698
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:25,351
WWe used it to quickfreeze
the ice cream.

699
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,786
And then we went swimming,

700
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:28,132
and I poured the nitrogen in the pool.

701
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:29,689
We thought it would look cool.

702
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,758
It did, but one minute,
everyone was fine,

703
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,726
and... and no one was talking or moving,

704
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:34,961
just floating there.

705
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,707
It must have displaced
the oxygen over the pool,

706
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,264
which means they're all asphyxiated.

707
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,433
That means everybody needs
supplemental O2, right now!

708
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,046
As much as we've got.
Make sure those seals are tight!

709
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:44,513
I pulled them out! I pulled them all out!

710
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:45,609
And that was very brave.

711
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:48,107
Got another one!

712
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,654
Can you tell me your name? Where you are?

713
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,077
Blake, I'm here. I'm here.

714
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:53,746
I'm never letting you talk me
into anything, ever again.

715
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,314
He seems alert and oriented.

716
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,683
I got another one.

717
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,512
Last kid's awake.

718
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,928
Jack?

719
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:10,633
- Jack!
- Why would he do that?

720
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:13,066
Get Jack's O2 tank, right now!

721
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,201
And the reaching tools! Jack!

722
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,903
See anything? The fog's too heavy.

723
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,438
Gibson! Gibson!

724
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,639
Jack!

725
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,141
Jack?

726
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,643
Come on.

727
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,411
Gibson!

728
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,181
Gibson!

729
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,719
Travis, grab her by the head.

730
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:33,720
Sydney!

731
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,988
Get some O2 for Gibson right away!

732
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,323
On three. One, two, three.

733
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,327
I got her head.

734
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,533
- No pulse.
- SSydney told me she was leaving.

735
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:48,901
II thought she went home.

736
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,107
Five, six, seven, eight.

737
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,714
- There we go.
- It's okay.

738
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:57,971
You're okay. We got you.

739
00:29:57,974 --> 00:29:59,112
- Bag.
- We got you.

740
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,647
More warming blankets over here!

741
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,660
You didn't have to take it
to such an extreme.

742
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,630
Jumping into a pool of chemicals
just to crush me.

743
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,868
I'm gonna go check on
the rest of those kids.

744
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,572
I mean, how'd he know to jump in?

745
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,809
None of us could even see into that pool.

746
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,111
Nobody mentioned another kid missing.

747
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:34,480
Well, he said he counted the flipflops.

748
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:36,182
Six pairs, only five kids.

749
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:37,350
Wow.

750
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,963
Yeah, he's always
a couple steps ahead that way.

751
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:40,552
Rushes in like he doesn't have a plan,

752
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,632
when the truth is,

753
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,850
he's usually already
leapt ahead of the rest of us.

754
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,391
Used to drive me nuts.

755
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,759
I like to know the steps,

756
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,862
but now I learned to just trust it.

757
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,132
That's why he's ready for captain.

758
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,801
And I'm not?

759
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,737
Don't take this the wrong way,

760
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,972
but it is a skill to do what he does,

761
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,175
a skill that you haven't figured out yet.

762
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,043
Jack's been a lieutenant for years.

763
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,364
You've had less than two days.

764
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,949
You're good, Herrera,
but you're still green.

765
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,786
I lost a husband
under a captain that was green.

766
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,857
I know the cost.

767
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,359
You'll get there eventually,

768
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,628
but you're not there yet.

769
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:32,271
Patient status?

770
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,807
The scene is secure.

771
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:35,942
Patients are in good shape.

772
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,555
We're getting contact info
for the parents

773
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,889
so they can meet at the hospital.

774
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,613
Dallas, you got those numbers?

775
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,448
II can't quite catch my breath.

776
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,883
Hang on. Hang on.

777
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,318
Just go slowly, all right?

778
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:46,752
Try to breathe, okay?

779
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,254
II can't br... Deeper.

780
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:49,289
I can't breathe.

781
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,191
Okay, she's drydrowning.

782
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,560
Her airway's spasming, fluid's
building up in her lungs.

783
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,095
Let's go! Her lungs are wet!

784
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,563
I was just talking to her!

785
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,610
It's a delayed response from
pulling people out of the pool.

786
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,612
Got to get her to the hospital
right now, guys! Come on!

787
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,436
Easy.

788
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:04,637
I've got you.

789
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,589
I've got you.

790
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,069
Patient shows symptoms of drydrowning.

791
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,340
No LOC on scene, but she's in
respiratory distress,

792
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,245
- like a pulmonary edema.
- Let's go.

793
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,705
Delayed reaction... water was ingested
likely one, maybe two hours prior.

794
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,351
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Stay calm, all right?

795
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,922
We're getting some oxygen
in your lungs soon.

796
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,755
Maybe I should go with her, just to
make sure BPs don't fall any further.

797
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,812
- They've got it.
- Yeah, but I've been with her.

798
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,425
And not to mention
I know everyone at GreySloan.

799
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,327
- I can make sure they...
- They'll know what to do, Warren.

800
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,631
Regardless of who drops her off.

801
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,589
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you worry.

802
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,625
I know every single doctor there.

803
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,260
And, the residents will greet you

804
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,729
and, well, they're new,
but they're... they're smart.

805
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,764
What day is today? Thursday.

806
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,299
Dr. Kepner works trauma on Thursdays.

807
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,834
You can't do any better than that.

808
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,836
And the specialist they'll get for you,

809
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,505
well, that'll probably be Dr. Bailey.

810
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,608
She could knock you out
just with her smile.

811
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,576
I promise.

812
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,812
They've got you.

813
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,313
Don't you worry.

814
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,415
Not even for a second.

815
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,783
Behind you.

816
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:27,404
Montgomery thinks I'm too green
to make a good captain.

817
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,017
- Please. What does he know?
- That is ridiculous.

818
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,674
Experience isn't everything.

819
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,210
Yeah, he's green. Like aa booger.

820
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,382
Jack did kick ass today.

821
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,385
Well, I'm s...
Okay, we were all thinking it.

822
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,221
So Jack's keeping pace.

823
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,600
- So what?
- That's not what I'm worried about.

824
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,957
It's no big deal.

825
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,734
Consider it inspiration to
hit the track harder tomorrow.

826
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,496
- Yeah, no, II got it.
- Stay focused, stay ready...

827
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,697
I said I've got it!

828
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,132
You don't have to coach me, okay?

829
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,268
Um, this is my race, not yours.

830
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,537
Wow. Okay.

831
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,138
Just... I got it.

832
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,516
I can handle things
with Jack myself, okay?

833
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:07,077
Sure. Yeah. Go for it.

834
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,650
Jack did kick ass today.

835
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,429
The incident report for the pool.

836
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,999
No problems between you
and Herrera this time?

837
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,300
Like on the roof?

838
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,703
I stand behind my call up there.

839
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,807
But I know I could've
handled myself differently.

840
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:42,022
If my conduct up there takes me
out of the running, well...

841
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,514
I'll respect that.

842
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,018
You'd be amazed by the number
of lieutenants I served with

843
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,819
who couldn't admit a mistake.

844
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,755
You know, when I started out,

845
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,523
I dealt with a lot.

846
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,891
No women's bathrooms.

847
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,061
At one station, my locker
was the trunk of my car.

848
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,431
And pranks... stupid, endless pranks.

849
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,066
You don't know how many times

850
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,834
I stood in front of my captain's office

851
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,405
ready to file complaints,
or quit, but I didn't.

852
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,973
And when I finally made captain,

853
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,753
do you know what
those same firefighters did?

854
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,176
What?

855
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,880
They followed my orders because
I'd earned their respect.

856
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,482
I fought my way up
every rung of the ladder,

857
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:20,784
and they knew it.

858
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,487
And I didn't have anything
handed to me by my daddy.

859
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,389
And neither did you.

860
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,624
And I respect that.

861
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,201
Permission to speak frankly?

862
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,604
Granted.

863
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,039
Andy has earned her spot here.

864
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,109
I mean, she should've
made lead lieutenant years ago.

865
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,032
YYou think Pruitt gave her a leg up?

866
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:49,679
He held her back,

867
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,682
because it made his life easier
to have his daughter around.

868
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,885
This place ran so smoothly on his command

869
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,021
because of Andy Herrera.

870
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,556
Loyalty's good, Gibson.

871
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,810
It is, but you should stop
while you're ahead.

872
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,603
You look like you need to talk.

873
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:28,543
I'll listen, but I am...

874
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:30,011
very tired,

875
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,614
so don't get offended if I fall asleep.

876
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:37,952
There's... there's no followup.

877
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,555
We see a patient, we treat them,

878
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,856
throw them in an ambulance...

879
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:45,093
We never see them again.

880
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:47,162
We never see how it ends.

881
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:49,354
It's better that way. Trust me.

882
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:52,245
Look, I know what you're gonna tell me.

883
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,235
Dial it back, get some distance,

884
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,670
don't let so much in.

885
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:57,239
And I'm... I'm trying,

886
00:36:57,264 --> 00:37:00,842
but, man, this job...

887
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:03,278
hits you sometimes.

888
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:06,249
And when you least expect it, you know?

889
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,173
Nope.

890
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:10,331
I do not know.

891
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:13,190
Because, unlike you,
I don't have a soft underbelly.

892
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,014
It's a crunchy candy shell.

893
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,972
Can't crack this.

894
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:23,865
I know the name makes it sound
like we're fighting fires...

895
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,067
but that's not it.

896
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:29,137
Really, we're conquering them.

897
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,144
What happened?

898
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:38,913
Are you okay?

899
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,954
Seth died.

900
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,829
You didn't agree to promote me

901
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,464
just because I'm your daughter, right?

902
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,866
You knew I could do this job.

903
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,601
Of course.

904
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,804
Did something happen?

905
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,340
I was just...

906
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,680
It is so hard

907
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:16,418
to just sit back and not get involved.

908
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:19,512
To just let things happen.

909
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,424
I know.

910
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,892
I know you know.

911
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,928
But you can't conquer
what you can't control.

912
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:30,398
This one again.

913
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,034
Andy, do you have a minute?

914
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:41,876
Smoke inhalation can
catch you by surprise sometimes.

915
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:44,145
I don't even know why I came here.

916
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:49,384
It's just, weirdly, the one person
Seth and I had in common was...

917
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,685
you.

918
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,890
I'm alive and Seth's dead.

919
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:58,426
How does that happen?

920
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,861
Why does that happen?

921
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,097
I wish I knew.

922
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,133
How do you do it?

923
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,734
Every day...

924
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,570
how do you deal with stuff like this?

925
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:11,573
I, um...

926
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:14,008
I shut it off.

927
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:17,612
Put those feelings on a shelf...

928
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,048
and lock them away.

929
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,650
Does that work?

930
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,221
Not today.

931
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,890
So, we use tricks and tools.

932
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:30,925
I, um...

933
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,361
I guess I should go.

934
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:43,471
We talk ourselves into
believing, "We've got this."

935
00:39:46,443 --> 00:39:48,113
Your dad said this thing to me

936
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:49,592
and I wanted to talk
to you about it the other day,

937
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:50,882
but your friends were there.

938
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,461
So, then I was just gonna let it
go, but I don't think I can.

939
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:53,651
Okay.

940
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,620
Do you know your dad is still mad

941
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,355
about the time we hotwired his car?

942
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,425
Yeah, but... that's bugging you?

943
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,727
Your dad still sees me
as some screwedup kid,

944
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:03,795
and that's fine.

945
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:07,332
But I want to make sure his opinions

946
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,100
aren't also your opinions.

947
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:10,735
Meaning...?

948
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,972
I don't want you to think of me
like a kid, because...

949
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,106
I'm not.

950
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,107
II know that.

951
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:17,895
And we've kind of been acting like kids.

952
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,144
You said we were all good.

953
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,312
I know.

954
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,481
Are you saying we're not all good?

955
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:24,949
No. We are.

956
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:26,818
I think. Are we?

957
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,987
Yes.

958
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:31,856
Look, I just wanted to say

959
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:33,689
I'm not the kid next door anymore.

960
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:38,029
I've... gone through stuff.

961
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:40,632
I've grown up.

962
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,268
That fire isn't bigger than us.

963
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,804
So have I.

964
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,640
We know what to do.

965
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:51,042
Anyway, I couldn't sleep

966
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:53,144
without getting that off my chest, so...

967
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,046
Contain the flame and control it,

968
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,414
because if we don't...

969
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:58,916
What... what if I won't
be able to sleep tonight?

970
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:03,321
Can't help you there.

971
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:05,623
That fire will just spread...

972
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,125
Night.

973
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:20,471
All over the damn place.

1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:01,581
Previously on "Station 19"...

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,718
- Charlotte, don't!
- Mayday, mayday. Officer down.

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,409
When a mayday is called,
you get out immediately.

4
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:07,366
It was the right thing to do.

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:08,767
You are getting sicker.

6
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,260
My brother. He's been
living on the streets.

7
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:11,217
I don't know what to do.

8
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,328
I think I'm scared of fire.

9
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:13,898
We can run simulations on our days off.

10
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,568
Yeah, I know some drills
we can try out here, too.

11
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:17,126
- Ryan's kind of great.
- He is.

12
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,964
What are you gonna do?

13
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,567
Go with the flow.
Wear life loosely. Let it be.

14
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:28,470
These are not easy concepts
for most firefighters.

15
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,196
This is my sixth birthday party today.

16
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,499
I can't do it.

17
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:34,500
If I have to sing
that stupid song one more time,

18
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,227
I'm gonna quit.

19
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:37,897
Okay, you won't quit. You will sing.

20
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,378
No one's even paying attention to you.

21
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,681
They're all taking pictures of their kid

22
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:42,439
or their girlfriend or whatever.

23
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,809
Let's get this over with.

24
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,398
We're trained to go after a problem...

25
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:47,549
attack it, to stamp it out.

26
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,109
But that doesn't always work.

27
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,835
Now, where are those Flanner's Manners?

28
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,640
Happy faces, whappy customers! Fine.

29
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,778
Sometimes we're not the ones in control.

30
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,354
We have to go with the flow

31
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,291
and just put our game faces on...

32
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,498
Hi! We're the...

33
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,218
and see what happens.

34
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,687
Hey, I was on my way out
when they paged me.

35
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:27,424
Now, what symptoms are you experiencing?

36
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,027
Well, some nausea.

37
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,098
Weakness. I've... I've been dizzy.

38
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,371
I was hoping you could write me
a prescription or something,

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,883
clear me up before work tomorrow.

40
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:38,532
Or I could give you a full work-up,

41
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,024
get your oncology team on the phone,

42
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:41,139
and see what's really going on.

43
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:42,763
No, I don't want more tests.

44
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:44,500
I just want a prescription.

45
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,306
I can't treat your problem
if I don't know the problem.

46
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,011
These could all be side effects
from your treatment

47
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,351
or indicators of something more serious.

48
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:56,054
Look, the chemo makes you
susceptible to infections,

49
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:58,893
which can cause your kidneys, your heart,

50
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,897
your nervous system to malfunction.

51
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:05,205
So, if you found something
more serious, you'd admit me?

52
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,811
- Keep me here?
- Most likely. Yes.

53
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,188
You know, I...

54
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:18,232
I-I think I probably didn't need
to come in, after all.

55
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,401
False alarm.

56
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,207
So, sorry to waste your time, Dr. Bailey.

57
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,409
Good night.

58
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,199
Okay.

59
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,518
Where have you been?

60
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,355
Poker night.

61
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,906
With some of the guys in the department.

62
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,443
Hey. How'd your test go?

63
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,120
A guy on my team went down,

64
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,280
and a firefighter from 12 called mayday

65
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:52,842
before I had my dummy, so...

66
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,833
I stayed behind to find it.

67
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,830
You broke mayday protocol

68
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,201
in front of judges who'll decide
if you make captain?

69
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,938
Who was proctoring the test? Frankel?

70
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:02,875
- And the fire chief.
- Ripley.

71
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,550
Not an easy man to impress.

72
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:10,190
Yeah. They ranked me dead last, Dad.

73
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,860
Out of all 20 candidates.

74
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,031
But I'm fine. I'm still in this thing.

75
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,805
I just have to kick ass from now on.

76
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,131
Every call, every shift.

77
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,901
It is the sign of a real competitor.

78
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,095
I am proud of you.

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,331
I just wish the team
would see it that way.

80
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,913
I know they're gonna look at me
with "loser eyes."

81
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:28,151
I don't want loser eyes.
I don't want pity.

82
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,083
That's why I'm glad we can do this...

83
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,677
go give out vaccines, not think about it.

84
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,450
What... What about you? How are you
feeling about maybe seeing your brother?

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,522
Well, he's either gonna look at me

86
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,193
with "Long time no see,
I missed you so much, sis" eyes,

87
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,242
or "You abandoned me just like
everyone else in my life",

88
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,901
"so I hate you now" eyes.

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,805
No telling. It should be fun.

90
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,638
Si desarrolla una infección
o fiebre, vaya a la clinica.

91
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:58,241
Es gratis.

92
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,891
Your ambulance sure is nice and shiny.

93
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:03,719
Mason.

94
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,813
It's been a while.

95
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:08,049
You look good.

96
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,585
You never were a good liar.

97
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:11,651
Hey. I'm Andy.

98
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,267
We can't stay long.

99
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,071
We got to get back before shift starts.

100
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,008
You want a Hepatitis vaccine
before we go?

101
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,177
They're quick and free.

102
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:24,014
- No needles.
- I'm... I'm... I'm good.

103
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,335
Okay, well, just let me know
if you change your mind.

104
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,793
I'm not using.

105
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:31,582
I haven't been for a while.

106
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,397
I brought some stuff,
in case I ran into you.

107
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,056
Just food, blankets, clothes.

108
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,394
I don't want handouts.

109
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,937
I'm just fine on my own.

110
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,807
You're not fine.
You're living on the street.

111
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:41,976
So?

112
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,045
Come live with me.

113
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,982
- We can figure this out.
- Why?

114
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,642
Because you can't see me
living like this?

115
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,601
Because this isn't the life

116
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,938
you imagined for your little brother?

117
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,143
I have people that care about me.

118
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,211
They just happen to live around here.

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,848
I'm doing what makes me feel good.

120
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,586
I'm painting again. I'm creating.

121
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,626
Like you said, you haven't
seen me in a long while.

122
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:05,234
You don't know me or what I need.

123
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,272
Mason. I care.

124
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,820
Then get off your freaking high horse

125
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,144
and leave me alone.

126
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,036
Meditation can help you
get over your fear

127
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,227
if you actual ditate.

128
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,696
Don't drag me out of bed this early

129
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,366
and expect me to do anything but sleep.

130
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,735
Sorry. I just...

131
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:24,742
Do we... We know each other, right?

132
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:26,179
Yeah, the... the nursing home.

133
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:27,982
- My grandmother.
- You're Edith's grandson.

134
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:31,423
- Grant.
- Yes! Travis. I'm Travis.

135
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:33,427
I remember.

136
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:34,990
I'm Vic. Hello.

137
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,059
Hi. Sorry.

138
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,294
My class is starting,

139
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:39,432
but hopefully I'll see you again.

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,575
Maybe we could exchange numbers?

141
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,718
That sounds lovely!

142
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:45,914
- Travis?
- Yeah.

143
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,054
Right? I mean...

144
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,559
Here.

145
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,708
In case you're interested.

146
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,939
Damn, Trav!

147
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,676
Those are some digits!

148
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:58,620
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,227
"Yeah". Just "yeah"? That's it?

150
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:02,163
I mean, he seems nice.

151
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,800
But, I mean, he's a yoga guy,

152
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,002
and I'm into meditation,

153
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,101
so we're obviously totally incompatible.

154
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:11,181
Well, obviously.

155
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,698
I can't believe that was the
first game I made it to this season.

156
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,025
I mean, Tuck used that

157
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,845
crossover dribble I taught him,

158
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,081
and he missed the shot, but, you know...

159
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,941
Hey, where's Pruitt?

160
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,878
Should be in soon. Why?
Is something going on?

161
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,115
No. Why would anything be going on?

162
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,986
He's seemed perfectly okay lately, right?

163
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,694
Do you have reason
to think he's not okay?

164
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,303
Did you see him
for an appointment or something?

165
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,329
I-I did see him...

166
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:34,586
where I happened to be.

167
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,475
Would "where you happened to be"

168
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:40,290
happen to be the hospital?

169
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,829
Okay, you know I cannot talk
about my patients with you,

170
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:46,000
or whether or not they
might have come to see me,

171
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,564
but left instead of getting
their recommended work-up.

172
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,608
And I definitely cannot suggest

173
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,034
that one of Pruitt's
co-workers, maybe someone

174
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,172
who used to be a surgeon...

175
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,952
let's say, should keep an extra eye

176
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,791
since I wasn't able to
spend the proper time

177
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,367
with my patient at the place
where I happened to see him.

178
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,528
And here I thought you wanted to
take your husband to work,

179
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:09,665
spend more time with him.

180
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,538
Today you're not the firefighter
I'm worried about.

181
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,915
What are we supposed to say to Herrera?

182
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,585
Well, I'd suggest you don't lead with,

183
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,000
"Aw, I'm so sorry you blew your chance

184
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:25,624
at a career you always wanted."

185
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,807
I don't understand. Tests are
basically her favorite hobby.

186
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,845
She made a tough call.
I would've done the same thing.

187
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,503
Morning, everybody!

188
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,722
Okay, no, no, we're not doing this.

189
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,632
Yes, I failed the Incinerator,
but I don't feel sorry for me,

190
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,636
so you certainly don't get to.

191
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:43,574
Got it?

192
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,644
Warren, Montgomery,
routine rig maintenance.

193
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,807
Every vehicle, bumper to bumper.
You know the drill.

194
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,901
And we're coordinating with Seattle PD

195
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,905
for the upcoming
disaster simulation drill.

196
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,141
Reps are stopping by later.

197
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,978
Miller, I want you on that with me.

198
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,182
Yeah. Sounds good.

199
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,418
Everyone else, chores.

200
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,229
How you feeling?

201
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,233
Feeling good.

202
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,471
Full steam ahead. Never better.

203
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,477
How concerned do you think
a person needs to be

204
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,939
if they're experiencing nausea,
in your medical opinion?

205
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,375
Did you eat something weird?

206
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:27,716
I'm serious.

207
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:29,520
You're talking about Pruitt, aren't you?

208
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,196
What exactly is going on?

209
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,569
We just, um... We just
wanted a more private spot,

210
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:40,042
to talk.

211
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,515
Yeah, we've noticed that
you haven't been exactly, um...

212
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,287
feeling well, sir.

213
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,892
Surprise. I have cancer.
Look, I'm getting back to work.

214
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,898
Sir, you were sick last shift,
and you tried to hide it.

215
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,646
- You left early.
- I did. I saw my doctor.

216
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,207
And did your doctor advise you
to return to work today?

217
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,688
If your symptoms
are suddenly accelerating,

218
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:58,756
it is my medical opinion...

219
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,549
I am handling this in my own way,

220
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,152
on my own time.

221
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,822
We're done here.

222
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,890
Sir.

223
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,708
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

224
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:09,266
- Get off.
- Dad, you okay?

225
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,371
- Get off!
- They are overreacting.

226
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,884
Your dad's having
an increase in symptoms.

227
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:15,090
We think it's best if he gets to
the hospital to get checked out.

228
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:16,714
Don't be ridiculous! This is ridiculous!

229
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,118
Are you sure?

230
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:20,022
- Then I'm coming with you.
- Andrea.

231
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,391
You are captain today,

232
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,039
and you're on thin ice
after the Incinerator test.

233
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,363
You can't just leave.

234
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:27,102
Let the know-it-all rookie
here take me. You stay here.

235
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:29,118
This is a bad idea. You think
about what's important.

236
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,544
I am, Dad. Let's go.

237

238
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,881
For God's sake, stop doting.

239
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,366
Dad, why didn't you tell me

240
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,054
you were feeling worse after everything?

241
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:50,327
I didn't want to make a fuss,
but here we are... a fuss.

242
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,599
Okay. I-I'll be right outside

243
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:54,068
if you need anything.

244
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,995
Mr. Herrera, your labs showed

245
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:02,485
an increase in your CA-125 biomarker.

246
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:05,124
That is a sign that
your cancer is progressing

247
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:08,698
and no longer responding
to your current treatment.

248
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,434
Like I said two weeks ago,

249
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:12,673
your oncology team and I think it's time

250
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:15,010
to consider a higher dose of chemo.

251
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,279
¿Semanas?

252
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,417
¿Te has sentido así
de enfermo por semanas?

253
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,596
Um, what the new treatment would entail

254
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,156
is adding an additional agent

255
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,160
to your current combination
of chemo drugs.

256
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,765
- Another agent?
- Yes, it's called cisplatin.

257
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,370
Um, it increases the potency
of the treatment.

258
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:31,706
It's aggressive.

259
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,312
Like hitting a fire
with every hose in the city

260
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,547
all at once.

261
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,118
Side effects ranging from
mild skin irritation

262
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,559
to seizures to heart complications

263
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:42,695
and shock.

264
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:45,367
Can his body handle all of that?

265
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,304
Are there more options? Other tests?

266
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:48,673
We've been through them all.

267
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,811
Like I was telling your father
night before last...

268
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,715
"Night before last"?

269
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,119
When you were at poker night?

270
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,634
How I deal with this
is none of your business.

271
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:58,326
- Déjalo ser.
- Let it be?

272
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,931
Ya sabes que no puedo haer eso.
You're sick, Dad.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,246
- I'm taking care of it!
- No, you're not!

274
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,648
You're not taking care of anything!

275
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,440
- Look at you!
- Okay, stop. No.

276
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,611
No yelling. No fighting. Not in here.

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,684
Andy, we'll be in here
all day long today.

278
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,187
So if you need a minute...

279
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,396
- Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
- Don't thank me.

280
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:18,032
She's loud, but she's right.

281
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,621
Talk to your damn daughter.

282
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,773
Hey, everything okay?

283
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,908
No, no, no.

284
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,590
My dad's getting worse
and hiding it from me.

285
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,582
And now Dr. Bailey's saying
they want to start him

286
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,256
on this new treatment
that sounds risky, and...

287
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,915
Okay, she wouldn't suggest anything

288
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,259
if she didn't believe it
could make a difference.

289
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,508
I just... I just feel like we're
jumping to the most extreme option.

290
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,512
Okay, look. Treatments like this
are really hard for patients.

291
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,404
But, Yes.

292
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,475
Do you want to talk through the steps?

293
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,844
You can ask me questions.

294
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,058
I-I know a lot about this kind of...

295
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,552
Don't... Don't... Don't do that.

296
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,556
Don't coddle me.

297
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,027
I'm not some frightened
family member, Warren.

298
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:50,530
I don't need to be handled.

299
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:58,546
Hey, Edith. Your foot
bothering you again?

300
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,486
I'm having trouble breathing.

301
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,425
All right. Let's get you checked out.

302
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,084
All right, take a deep breath in for me,

303
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,623
and then back out.

304
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,744
Like you did in yoga this morning?

305
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,070
What?

306
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,986
Are you gonna call my grandson or not?

307
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,457
I know he ran into you.

308
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,896
Apparently, you didn't seem
anxious to take his number.

309
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:27,368
Don't be a fool.

310
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,604
He's a catch.

311
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,541
Why wouldn't you want to go out with him?

312
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,735
BP's looking good, Edith.

313
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:36,987
I mean, he's athletic,
he's sweet, and he's a chef.

314
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,257
Grams, you okay?

315
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:41,096
I just got your message.
I got here as soon as...

316
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,032
- Hi.
- Hi.

317
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:44,669
Is s-she okay? What's wrong with her?

318
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:47,809
No. False alarm, honey.

319
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:50,545
I feel much better now.

320
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,560
A lot of extra gadgets today.

321
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,675
Because this dosage will be more intense.

322
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,434
Older patients tend to have a harder time

323
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:02,581
with a treatment like this, so...

324
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:03,806
What Dr. Schmitt means

325
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,810
is that we just want to
keep an eye on you,

326
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,716
keep your levels under control.

327
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,756
It's nothing. I've faced
much worse many times.

328
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,969
Like with that roof collapse.

329
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,028
They all came back buzzing about it.

330
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,098
I told them, "This is nothing",

331
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:18,024
not when you've seen what I've seen."

332
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,495
Right, that... roof collapse.

333
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,532
My point being, it... it...
it makes you tougher.

334
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,869
I-It prepares you.

335
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,105
I'm strong.

336
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,585
Dr. Bailey, I can handle this treatment.

337
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:30,081
Um, remind me, when was
the roof thing again?

338
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,319
A few weeks back, maybe.

339
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:35,258
Either before or after
that big tanker spill.

340
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,830
Definitely before that terrible
business with the power lines.

341
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,437
You would know about that.
That one hit Warren pretty hard.

342
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,776
Yeah.

343
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:46,447
Hey, I just came in to check in and...

344
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:49,771
Hang on. Herrera didn't come back?

345
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,727
Excuse me.

346
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,370
- Gibson, PD reps are here.
- Yeah, okay.

347
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,875
- Hey. I'm Officer Reis.
- Jack Gibson.

348
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:09,823
I was just going over the
disaster drill protocols.

349
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,317
This is my partner, Officer Ryan Tanner.

350
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,597
Yeah, no, we, we know each other.

351
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:15,944
Isn't this Captain Herrera's shift?

352
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,736
Herrera was called away today.

353
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,607
You got me.

354
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,148
But good to know you're
so up on her schedule.

355
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,721
Hope you're just as prepped
on this drill.

356
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,079
He's always prepared.

357
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,383
Bit of a Boy Scout, really,
in a good way.

358
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,665
I don't mean to diminish his authority

359
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:30,590
by calling him a boy. Is everything okay?

360
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,696
- To make Andy step away?
- Personal business.

361
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,133
Nothing you need to
concern yourself with.

362
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,969
I am, though. Concerned.
Especially if it's personal...

363
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,761
Pruitt's in the hospital.

364
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,243
We're waiting to hear how it's going.

365
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,645
She didn't mention anything about her dad

366
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:42,371
when I saw her the night before last.

367
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,880
Yeah, you know, I couldn't speak to that.

368
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,689
Can we move this along?

369
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:54,349
This year's drill will be a
mass-casualty disaster simulation.

370
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,264
I've taken the liberty
of putting together a plan.

371
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:57,600
Here's the problem with your plan.

372
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,736
You haven't even heard it yet.

373
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,162
I don't have to hear it. I can see it...

374
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,099
and its problems.

375
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,349
You can't know there's problems
until you've taken a closer look.

376
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:06,985
You know, I'm picking up
on a definitive vibe here.

377
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,348
I do that. I pick up on vibes.
I'm on track to make detective.

378
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,585
What are they fighting over, exactly?

379
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:15,024
Did Tanner steal his lunch?

380
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:16,794
Or his car? He used to do that.

381
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,336
Montgomery, I did tell you
Grant was a chef, right?

382
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:22,906
I am not a chef.

383
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,044
I just got promoted to line cook.

384
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,925
He's very talented.

385
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,531
Montgomery, you should
visit Grant at his restaurant.

386
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,799
Really, it's... it's fine.

387
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:34,173
Yeah, Travis
is the best chef at Station 19.

388
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:36,586
I'm definitely no professional.

389
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,007
I mean, how hard can it be, Montgomery?

390
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,563
I've had 87 1/2 years'
worth of experience,

391
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:51,239
so I know a good match
when I see a good match.

392
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,542
Right?

393
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,977
Sorry about this.

394
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,580
She means well.

395
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,555
This morning, you asked me

396
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,202
if I was interested in seeing you again,

397
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,261
and the answer is yes.

398
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,999
I am.

399
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,470
That's great.

400
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:17,842
Um, breakfast, maybe?

401
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,812
What about tomorrow?

402
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,998
That's soon.

403
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,367
Too soon?

404
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,137
No. Nope.

405
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,678
I'll be in touch. Later.

406
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,368
Well, now that you two
have figured that out,

407
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,093
somebody give me my mirror.

408
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,645
Cupid's got to look good for bingo.

409
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,517
You think he'll take you
to breakfast or make it?

410
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,254
Like, woo you with
his homemade brioche...

411
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:44,768
I really don't want to talk about this.

412
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,794
You do like Grant, right?

413
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:48,030
Yeah, of course.

414
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,869
So, and you did agree to,
you know, go on a date.

415
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:53,841
- Yeah, I know.
- So, what is the problem?

416
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,898
Does the fear creep in
before there's a fire?

417
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,349
Do you anticipate the worst?

418
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:58,596
I think you're anticipating the worst.

419
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,021
Or is it getting caught by surprise

420
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,338
- that's getting to you?
- I think he seems really nice.

421
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,929
Why are we stopping here?

422
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,967
Come on. Bishop's waiting.

423
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,108
Okay, it's time to start
desensitizing you to fire.

424
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,578
I will light up a torch.

425
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:17,814
You douse it.

426
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,452
- Ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

427
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:32,160
Okay, now the torch to your right.

428
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:33,462
You sure this is a good idea?

429
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,585
Damn it! I dropped my line!

430
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:48,567
Sometimes we have to give
our friends the help they need,

431
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:50,693
not the help they want.

432
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:53,232
Just seems like we could
ease her into it a bit.

433
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,011
People don't always know
what's best for them.

434
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,464
Aah! Okay, that's enough!

435
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,101
Turn... I'm good! Turn it off now!

436
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,636
Get back into it! Push past it!

437
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,977
No, I need... I need to
move more slowly than this!

438
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,713
Come on. Come on.

439
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,472
No, this... this is not helping!

440
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,274
You are not helping me!

441
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,345
This will not help!

442
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,844
Structure fire. Crossroads
Strip Mall. We got to go.

443
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,674
- Did you run any of this by Herrera?
- I don't have to.

444
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,132
I'm captain today.

445
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,902
I'm not used to seeing him like this.

446
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,750
If I wasn't so tired of listening
to it, I'd find it fascinating.

447
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,689
- You know how she thinks?
- Yeah, yeah, I know how she thinks.

448
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:47,413
25 minutes and counting.

449
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:49,517
Structure fire. Crossroads Strip Mall.

450
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,121
That was unfortunate timing.

451
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,363
Officer Reis, Officer Tanner,
thank you for stopping by.

452
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:57,600
Probably finish up the rest
of the logistics by e-mail?

453
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,504
Excellent plan. E-mail.

454
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,208
Fire at Crossroads Strip Mall.

455
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:03,379
All units, please respond.

456
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:06,418
Looks like we're going to the same place.

457
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,211
Goody.

458
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,149
Look, I-I wasn't trying to coddle you

459
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:30,856
or treat you like any
other patient's family.

460
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,755
I was... I was treating you like...

461
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:34,057
well, like my family.

462
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,667
Look, I-I understand that
you might not be in a place

463
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:42,407
where you're able to be there
for your dad right now,

464
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:47,258
but I also know that he needs you.

465
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,237
This is only the beginning

466
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:52,223
of a very difficult road for him.

467
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,047
Yell at him later, all right?

468
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:55,951
Yell at me right now if you want.

469
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,042
I'd prefer if you didn't

470
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,130
yell at my wife.

471
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,495
Look, do whatever you have to do,

472
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,394
but then go in there
and be there for your dad.

473
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,376
So we're clear,

474
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:11,749
you are pretty much
the most annoying rookie

475
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:13,185
I've ever worked with.

476
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,361
I'll go talk to him.

477
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,301
This is 19.
Fire's escalated to a 2-alarm.

478
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,137
I need all available units.

479
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,478
- Montgomery!
- Yeah?

480
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,226
You and Hughes get that hose
hooked up and charged.

481
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,350
We'll need 2 1/2 inch.

482
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,854
The Big One. You got it.

483
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,374
Hey, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy.

484
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,145
Slow, deep breaths, okay?

485
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,349
It came out of
nowhere. There was no warning.

486
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,819
Just fire everywhere.

487
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,066
How many people are still in there?

488
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,992
Dinner rush. The place was packed.

489
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,127
Get her on oxygen, stat.

490
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,798
Reports of victims still inside.

491
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,003
We've only got minutes before this
building is completely unsafe!

492
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,181
I'm going in to get the
rest of the people out!

493
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,394
Stay near the engine
and the hydrant, okay?

494
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,731
Just watch the gauges.

495
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,679
Vic, you don't have to
get any closer than that.

496
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,066
Tanner, what are you doing?!

497
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,636
You got no mask, no turnouts.

498
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:58,339
Neither do the people inside!

499
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:08,378
Thought you left.

500
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,982
I... took a walk to cool off,

501
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,086
so I could come be here for you.

502
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,568
You don't have to be.
I'm not asking you to.

503
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:16,894
I know. You'd prefer
if I just leave you alone.

504
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:19,244
- That's not what I meant.
- You... You can... You can say

505
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:21,102
that your life is... is your business

506
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,341
and that you don't have to
share what's going on,

507
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,278
but it's... it's my business, too.

508
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,514
Mom is gone.

509
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,190
You're all I have,
so I can't just ignore that.

510
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,517
I'm not gonna just let it be.

511
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:33,521
I wanted to tell you
when I got the all clear,

512
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,560
- when I was finally cancer-free.
- I mean, it was you

513
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:40,968
who taught me to tackle
the scary parts head on,

514
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,962
to stand up to them, face them down.

515
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,366
I-I don't want you to spare me.
I want you to include me.

516
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:47,905
Maybe I can't. Maybe I need the space.

517
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:49,341
- From what?
- From people

518
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,813
watching me all the time,

519
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:53,182
waiting for me to drop.

520
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:55,386
For years, I was the strongest!

521
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:57,291
You're still strong.

522
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,847
- You can't fight cancer...
- It's just like...

523
00:22:58,871 --> 00:22:59,871
without being strong.

524
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,507
You should back off a little.

525
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,244
I can't do that.

526
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:05,048
It's not a request, Andrea.

527
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,817
I'm telling you, I need some space here.

528
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,590
And I'm saying no.

529
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,973
- What?
- No. I can't.

530
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:13,778
- Of course you can. I'm telling you to.
- I won't.

531
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:14,968
- Why?
- Because.

532
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:17,713
- That's not an answer.
- Because I promised Mom!

533
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:21,916
Before she died, I promised her.

534
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,922
And I'm not letting your ego
or your pride

535
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,473
get in the way of me keeping my promise.

536
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,032
Jack just messaged. They got a big call.

537
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,173
This is the absolute worst time
for me to interrupt.

538
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:34,700
You should go.

539
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:37,037
- I'll... I'll stay here.
- Yeah.

540
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,485
All entry points are blocked.
Stairs are engulfed.

541
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:46,089
This fire keeps growing and growing.

542
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,922
All firefighters, pull out.

543
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:49,648
Repeat, pull out. We're going defensive.

544
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:51,597
Wait. What are you doing?
People could still be in there.

545
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,857
It's too dangerous to keep going back in.

546
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:55,059
- Hey, hey!
- Get off!

547
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,331
Do you see that smoke right there?

548
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,935
And the corner, it's black,
which means it's toxic.

549
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,186
You'd be dead in five minutes
without a mask.

550
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,210
Give me a mask!

551
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:05,646
The building's verging on collapse.

552
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:12,795
This is Gibson.
Move the perimeter back 20 feet.

553
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,597
So we can't do anything else?

554
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:16,404
We hit it with water,
stop it from spreading.

555
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,915
But we've lost the building.

556
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,389
I need everyone to back up!

557
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:23,292
Station 15, 23.

558
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,401
15, hit it from the beta.
23, hit it from the delta.

559
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:27,366
We're gonna surround and drown.

560
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,853
Hey, Gibson.

561
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,172
- Structure's lost?
- Yes, sir.

562
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,043
Surprised to see you in charge today.

563
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,813
My schedule listed
it was Herrera's turn...

564
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:39,519
shift... whatever it is
Frankel has you two doing.

565
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,201
Herrera had to take
a personal day today, sir.

566
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,358
It's a big call to miss.

567
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,705
All right, don't let me keep you.

568
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:45,129
Guys, I want status reports.

569
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:47,535
- The line's all set up inside.
- How's the Big One coming?

570
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:48,604
I'm in position!

571
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:49,606
Set!

572
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,008
Here it comes!

573
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:56,846
Hey! We already told
you to sit yourselves

574
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,000
on the other side of this line.

575
00:24:58,024 --> 00:24:59,670
- No! We can't! We can't!
- You don't understand!

576
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:01,296
Hey, hey, non-rescue personnel

577
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,525
- can't be over here right now.
- Well, what about her?

578
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:12,752
Please! Somebody help us! Please!

579
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,349
It's okay, sweetie! It's okay!

580
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,654
Bishop, see if you can
knock down the flames

581
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:21,073
around the victims.

582
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:22,498
- Buy some time.
- On it.

583
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,269
Stairs are lost. The airbags won't fit.

584
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:25,682
We need to get that ladder
in there right now.

585
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,575
Help! Please!

586
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:34,183
I got you. Mommy's got you, okay?

587
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:38,302
They're gonna help us! Please help us!

588
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,453
The truck's blocked in.
We got to get everybody to move.

589
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:43,050
There's no time. The ladder will have

590
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,477
- to reach from here.
- It's blocked!

591
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,181
We can't put the riggers down
on the other side.

592
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:48,252
The ladder will be way too unsteady,
and you know it's unsafe.

593
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:49,876
I don't care. I'm going up.

594
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,563
A week before she died,

595
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:57,967
Mom picked me up early
from school one day.

596
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,840
I think it was a-a Thursday.

597
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,512
Sh-She didn't even make up
an excuse for my teacher.

598
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:07,153
She just decided we needed a fun day.

599
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:09,991
We had ice cream. We went to the park.

600
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,300
And we just sat there,

601
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:17,540
talking about nothing, really.

602
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,509
She looked at me and told me

603
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,217
she would always
be there for me if she could.

604
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:27,559
But if something ever happened,
if she ever wasn't...

605
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,208
that you would be there for me.

606
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:37,913
And that I had to look after you.

607
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,389
She said, "You take care of him, okay?"

608
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,310
She made me promise.

609
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,580
That's...

610
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,184
I don't... I can't... I...

611
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:53,896
I promised her...
that I'd look out for you.

612
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:59,485
She took care of you every way
she could every single day,

613
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,504
and so have I.

614
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,074
Every day since.

615
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,211
So don't shut me out.

616
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,349
Don't you dare not talk to me.

617
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,453
Don't tell me not to look out for you.

618
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:10,989
Don't you dare do that.

619
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:12,726
Not when taking care of you

620
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,165
is the one real piece of her I have left.

621
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,782
I had no idea. You never told me.

622
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:20,450
That's why I have to.

623
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,393
I can't just... I have to
watch out for you, Papi.

624
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:27,644
I know it's what she would have done.

625
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:31,351
Andrea.

626
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,223
- I...
- Dad?

627
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,496
Dad? Dad!

628
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:39,701
Dad? Da... I need help in here!

629
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,739
Dad. Dad.

630
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:45,564
Slow and steady.

631
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:50,355
All right, go, go, go!

632
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,668
It's okay, sweetie.

633
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,689
Why are they going so slow?!

634
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:05,226
Ladder only goes one speed!

635
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,330
Station's asking if we can
release a patrol car.

636
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,447
What are you do... What is he doing?

637
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,240
He's got the face...

638
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,879
the one he gets when he's got
a really stupid idea.

639
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,831
Tanner, what the hell are you doing?!

640
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:26,857
- Drop your baby to me.
- Are you crazy?!

641
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:29,027
There isn't time.
I will catch him. I promise.

642
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,731
No! Go, go, go!

643
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,273
My God.

644
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:39,148
Trust me, please!

645
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,349
- Just let go!
- No, I can't! I can't!

646
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:42,953
I can't just let go! I can't!

647
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,725
The building's about to go!

648
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:46,827
I know!

649
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:48,831
You see that firefighter on the ladder?

650
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,363
When he gets here, you're gonna have to

651
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,155
climb over the rail and jump to him.

652
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,125
You can't do that
if you're holding your baby!

653
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:55,595
You will miss! You will fall!

654
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,799
Your baby will fall with you!

655
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:58,868
Aah!

656
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,375
- What's your name?
- Allison!

657
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:03,511
And your baby?

658
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,181
Jacob!

659
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,170
Jacob. This is Jacob.

660
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:09,092
Allison, the only way to save Jacob,

661
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,373
the only way to save both of you,

662
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,943
is for you to listen to my friend Ryan.

663
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,727
- Now you can do this.
- I can't!

664
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,752
Yes, you can.

665
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,656
He was fine. He was just talking.

666
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,393
But now he's unresponsive, and...

667
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:20,731
He's hypotensive. I need one of epi.

668
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,408
What's happening?
I think he may be having

669
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:24,472
an allergic reaction to the cisplatin.

670
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,580
I need another epi. Steroids. Now.

671
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:29,982
Is he gonna be all right?

672
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,319
No, I'm sorry,

673
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,857
but I really need you
to get out of here. Nurse?

674
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:35,166
All right, pushing another epi.

675
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:37,163
And let's hang some fluid.

676
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:38,333
Come on.

677
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,192
Aah!

678
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,821
Let go! Please! It'll be okay!

679
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:54,443
Mommy loves you. I will always love you.

680
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,334
Hey, there.

681
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,602
It's time. You got to jump. Ready?

682
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,014
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

683
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,486
Yes, you can. Okay.

684
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,515
All right, you got this. Yes, you can!

685
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,185
Okay.

686
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:46,789
It's time. You got to jump!

687
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:53,937
Aah!

688
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,886
I got you! Hey!

689
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:04,291
Miller, go!

690
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,915
Jacob!

691
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:16,551
Yeah, it's okay.

692
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,459
Your dad experienced
an allergic reaction.

693
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:32,496
His regimen is tough,

694
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:35,402
and his body is going to fight it.

695
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:38,038
But now that we know
this could happen every time...

696
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,330
Every time?

697
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,145
You want him to
keep going with this treatment

698
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:43,137
when it sent him into medical distress?

699
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:46,143
I still believe it is his best option.

700
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:49,851
That said, I'll understand
if you two decide

701
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,057
that you do not want to
continue with the treatment.

702
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,661
We keep going.

703
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:02,081
Dad, if it's hurting you
this much after one treatment,

704
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:04,975
I mean, there has to be other options.

705
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,079
I mean, think of the toll
it's gonna take.

706
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,619
What kind of toll do you think
the cancer will take?

707
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,624
I would... would like to
keep going with the treatment.

708
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,187
I would like to include my daughter

709
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,464
in all future information

710
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:23,434
about my chemo schedule and appointments.

711
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:25,305
I, I would like to

712
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:28,211
make her part of this process, please.

713
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,904
Hey, Tanner.

714
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:46,824
Helluva save today.

715
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,260
Helluva save yourself.

716
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:13,882
Hey, you okay?

717
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,155
Yeah.

718
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,596
Hey, can you...

719
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,370
Can you just stand next to me?

720
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,532
This, um... This helps.

721
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,963
I think this is what I need right now.

722
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:06,930
I told you I didn't want...

723
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:08,321
Take the soup.

724
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,578
I'm sure the things I think you need

725
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:18,149
are very different than
the ones you think you need.

726
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:21,456
So, I brought some of each.

727
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:24,495
And I am here if and when you want more.

728
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,424
If you don't want to go,

729
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,072
then just tell tell her
you don't want to go.

730
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:52,512
Hi... Hi, Grant!

731
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,860
Sorry, I didn't know if there was, like,

732
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,419
a doorbell or something.

733
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,227
Sorry, yeah. Yeah, I'm just...

734
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,362
I got a, um, thing.

735
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,166
Is it weird that I just showed up?

736
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:04,892
I thought we had plans,
but then you didn't reach out,

737
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,431
so I thought maybe
I was supposed to meet you here.

738
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:09,735
I can't do breakfast.

739
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,307
You seem really great.

740
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,977
But...

741
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,680
I don't date.

742
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,562
Are you some kind of
fire-fighting monk, or...?

743
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:21,211
No, no, definitely not a monk.

744
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,881
I watched an entire building
burn to the ground last night.

745
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,586
I'm in the middle of stuff
like that all the time.

746
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,556
I know what it's like being with someone

747
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,795
who could die
in the line of duty any day.

748
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,364
It's not fair.

749
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,435
I never want to
put someone else through that.

750
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:38,142
Okay, I thought I was just here
for breakfast.

751
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,590
And not only have you married us off,

752
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:43,393
but I'm widowed now, too?

753
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:44,963
You move fast.

754
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,504
It's easier this way. I promise.

755
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:49,538
I don't date.

756
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,883
It's not what I do.

757
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:56,352
Then let me paint you a picture
of what we could do.

758
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,590
First, I... Well,
I'll take you to breakfast,

759
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,926
like we planned.

760
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,529
Not today. Today's already weird.

761
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:03,700
But soon.

762
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:07,073
Something simple, delicious.
I know a place.

763
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,117
And then that night, I'll call.

764
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,820
See how your day went.

765
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:11,900
I'm a pretty straightforward guy.

766
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:13,158
I don't play games.

767
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:15,763
It's just a thing
you should know about me.

768
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:16,952
Then, a few days after that,

769
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:18,180
I'll see if you want to grab dinner.

770
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:20,573
Nothing too fancy, but nice.

771
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,744
I'll want to dress up a little for you.

772
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,329
I'm hoping by then,
you might want to kiss me.

773
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,834
I know I'll want to kiss you.

774
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:29,045
I already do.

775
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:34,214
But I'll save that for our third date.

776
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:37,287
We'll go to Kerry Park.
We'll talk all night.

777
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,592
And I'm guessing that's all
just in the next few weeks,

778
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:42,988
so we're a ways off
from me being widowed.

779
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,624
Assuming breakfast goes well.

780
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:50,069
Let's start with breakfast.

781
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,911
Hi!

782
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,322
Hey.

783
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,300
You smell like a chimney.

784
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:03,073
Did you get another call
after you left the hospital?

785
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:04,910
Nothing important.

786
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:06,146
Yeah.

787
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:07,983
Okay, Benjamin Warren, we don't do this.

788
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,454
We do not shut each other out.

789
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,091
I agree...?

790
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,164
Pruitt told me you have had
some big calls recently.

791
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,141
You fell through a roof?

792
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,107
- Almost.
- You were almost electrocuted?

793
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,164
Trying to save a patient?

794
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:24,769
Come on.

795
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,944
I told you I wanted you to share with me.

796
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,648
I wanted to hear about the fire,
the danger, all of it.

797
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:35,513
We were right here in this bed,
and I asked you

798
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:39,283
if there was anything going on,
and you said nothing.

799
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:42,255
And now you sit here on this bed
and I'm checking in again,

800
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:44,058
and again, it's nothing?

801
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,495
I'm not asking just to ask.

802
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:48,750
I'm asking so that you tell me.

803
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:53,014
So you don't have to
hold on to this stuff alone.

804
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,784
Honey, you get to come home

805
00:37:54,853 --> 00:38:00,095
and unload anything you need to
unload so it can be unloaded.

806
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:02,967
When I check in, I need you
to tell me the truth.

807
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:06,810
That's how this works.
That's how we work.

808
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,907
Last night, a strip mall burned down.

809
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:15,212
Like, all the way to the ground.

810
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,650
But I didn't get there for the big stuff.

811
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,654
No, no, no, no. I was...

812
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:21,892
I showed up well-rested, ready to go,

813
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,896
and got put in charge of overhaul.

814
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:25,198
It's a fancy word for cleanup.

815
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,735
You know, it's... it's scut.

816
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,706
So, I was there all night

817
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:32,614
ankle deep in, burnt,
mucky remains of a nail salon,

818
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:36,849
a restaurant, a dry cleaners,
and a notary's office.

819
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:39,881
See? It's... It's scut.

820
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,553
Nothing important.

821
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:45,292
But, you're right.

822
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,731
T-There has been some stuff that
I haven't told you about...

823
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:50,341
and some of it gets to me.

824
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,240
And I didn't want to
burden you with it.

825
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:56,780
But I-I will.

826
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,250
I promise I will.

827
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:05,273
That's better. Thank you.

828
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,893
Just to warn you,
once it starts, it won't stop.

829
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,029
Once the floodgates open,

830
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:15,587
it's gonna be hours and hours of...

831
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,190
It's all about balance.

832
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:34,116
Why don't you get home
before you turn into a zombie?

833
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,631
I don't want to leave him here alone.

834
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:37,389
Why do you think I'm here?

835
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,413
Me and that chair are about to
spend some quality time together.

836
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,384
Come on. Get while the going's good.

837
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,055
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

838
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,843
It's about recognizing when

839
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:05,780
you're able to put a fire out...

840
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,008
and when you have to
stand back and let it burn.

841
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,739
I have mentioned
I hate running before, right?

842
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:16,509
Like, a lot?

843
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:17,979
Well, it's this or the torches.

844
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,851
Why? Why? Why are those
my only two options?

845
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,287
What?

846
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,630
Thank God, a break.

847
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,205
That's pretty.

848
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,909
I don't remember it. Is it new?

849
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:34,178
Yeah, it is.

850
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:41,160
So, there's no possibility

851
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:42,664
of walking the rest
of the way back, is there?

852
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:44,390
'Cause I'm not above bribery.

853
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:48,230
Dream on. We got
seven more miles to crush.

854
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,367
Great.

855
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:53,335
Great.

856
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:55,172
Slow down!

857
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,176
When a structure's not safe,
when the fire's too hot...

858
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,087
we're told to stay away.

859
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,019
You won't believe the night I just had.

860
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:11,790
Or you will because you have
these nights all the time,

861
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:12,947
but I don't.

862
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,251
I heard about the fire.

863
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,020
There was a woman trapped on a balcony,

864
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,002
and she had a baby,
and she had to throw her baby,

865
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:19,045
and I caught him.

866
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:20,630
- Me. I caught the baby.
- You?

867
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:22,400
- Caught a baby?
- Yes! It was amazing.

868
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:26,708
It was... I've never felt
anything like it.

869
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:28,379
And then we just had to...

870
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,316
stand back and watch
the building burn down.

871
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:32,253
But what if we can't stay back?

872
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,524
What if there's something
drawing us toward that fire?

873
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:37,029
Looks like you got pretty close.

874
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:38,229
Andy.

875
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,172
I can't stand back anymore.

876
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:44,569
What if it grabs hold of us?

877
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:48,319
What if it pulls us in?

878
00:41:48,387 --> 00:41:50,523
What if we get too close?

879
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,729
Close enough that fire could burn us?

880
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:54,798
Your dad?

881
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,933
Isn't home.

882
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,887
And what if...

883
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,636
we like it?

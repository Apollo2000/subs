2
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,991
Um, I usually just make a protein shake

3
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:19,958
and drink it on my way to work.

4
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:20,993
No.

5
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:24,663
Mmm!

6
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,198
Okay, that might be better than sex.

7
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:27,900
Uh!

8
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,701
That sounds like a challenge.

9
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,403
Oh, I feel guilty being this happy

10
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:33,005
when people are dying every day.

11
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,841
Mm, you feel guilty that Warren
is not seeing his wife and kids,

12
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:37,543
and we're here in the shack?

13
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,877
In the shack?

14
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,312
On the shack?

15
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:41,513
- Ah.
- What is it?

16
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:43,949
Oh, you... you mean "shacking up."

17
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:45,484
- Yeah.
- I... Yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,755
Shacking up.

19
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:50,843
- Yes.
- Shacking up.

20
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,837
We're here shacking up.

21
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:04,169
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:06,338
No way. How'd you do that?

23
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:10,042
Hey, can you help Marsha put
away all the groceries?

24
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:13,879
Thank you.

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,821
You really don't need
to keep feeding us.

26
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,056
No, I want to.

27
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,893
Oh, I got to get back to the station.

28
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,762
- You doing okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

29
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,130
No, I mean you, Inara.

30
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,899
Are you good?

31
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:35,060
I'm really good.

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,107
What's up?

33
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,297
What's this?

34
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,311
Breakfast.

35
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:45,357
Pre-cut fruit?

36
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,578
It truly is end of days.

37
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,747
Wait. Wait, no eggs and bacon?

38
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:50,849
We don't get eggs and bacon?

39
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,117
Don't we sacrifice enough?!

40
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,086
Warren says it's not safe to
cook family-style anymore.

41
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,687
Individual foods only.

42
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,323
You know, then I'm gonna make
myself an individual dozen eggs

43
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:59,925
and an individual pound of bacon.

44
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:02,294
Hmm!

45
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,295
Oh, come on!

46
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,318
Individual yogurts?

47
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:05,664
Individual yogurts. Yeah.

48
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:07,199
Yeah.

49
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,444
Okay.

50
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,552
Oh, hey.

51
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,855
Oh, hi.

52
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,724
- Heh.
- Nice to meet you in real life, sir.

53
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:33,992
You're taller than I thought.

54
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,161
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

55
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:38,463
Well, this is, uh, an odd choice

56
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,232
to hold your disciplinary hearing,

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,796
at the scene of the crime.

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,036
You know, City Hall is shut down
like everything else.

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,195
So, we can socially distance
here, and, uh...

60
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,544
Look, um, I... I know you're nervous.

61
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:55,080
I've been down this road myself.

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,549
It's not easy walking into
something like this alone.

63
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,052
Yeah, it's not so much about walking in.

64
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,582
More about walking out.

65
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,522
Oh, hey.

66
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:07,059
Hi. Um, I-I'm not here.

67
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,660
I-I'm barely here.
Just don't look at me.

68
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:09,698
Just... No, no.

69
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,711
- Uh, Andy?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:11,997
Well, go talk to her. Are you sure?

71
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,289
- It might calm your nerves.
- Are you sure? Okay.

72
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,283
Hey. Hey, wait.

73
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,458
Robert, I'm sorry. I forgot.

74
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:16,868
No, this is all a big mess.

75
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,570
You work here. You can't stay away.

76
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,751
I can go home if you want.

77
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,106
- No, no.
- Or not.

78
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,341
Or I'll... I'll sit in the front
row, cheering you on.

79
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,346
- Whatever you need.
- No. I can't see you.

80
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,341
I can't see your face.

81
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,547
If I see your face when I'm in there...

82
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,501
I know. I know. I'll blow your future

83
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,990
- with the fire department.
- No, no. If I see you,

84
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:29,366
I'm gonna want to kiss you...

85
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,849
- Oh.
- ...the way I do right now.

86
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:32,085
If I kiss you in front of
the fire commission...

87
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:33,077
Mm.

88
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,853
...that will screw my
future in the fire department.

89
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:36,121
- Okay. Bye.
- So, I can't... I can't...

90
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,890
Good luck, Robert.

91
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,492
Okay.

92
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,247
- You got this.
- Alright.

93
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,352
Okay. Alright.

94
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:53,305
- Travis.
- Emmett.

95
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,073
- Hey.
- What are you... Are you back?

96
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,108
God, no.

97
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,176
Uh, no, I'm... I'm just here to testify,

98
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,277
uh, in Sullivan's thing.

99
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:00,621
- Right.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,681
- That's... heavy.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:05,117
- How are you?
- I'm good. Yeah.

102
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,351
I'm just working at the hospital.

103
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,787
- Contact tracing.
- Oh, that's... that's amazing.

104
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:13,058
Engine 19 and Aid
Car 19 requested to 77 Joy Street.

105
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,059
That's me. Sorry.

106
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,627
No, it's okay. It's okay.

107
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,529
- Um, it was good to see you.
- Yeah.

108
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,807
Warren.

109
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,575
Herrera, I already know
what you're gonna say.

110
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,245
Great, so I can stop worrying
you're gonna help end

111
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,579
my husband's firefighting career?

112
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:35,547
I'm gonna tell the truth.

113
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,748
And I'm not telling you not to.

114
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:39,017
I'm just saying Robert made a mistake,

115
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,119
and there's a way
to talk about his mistake

116
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,155
and how he's worked
himself back from it.

117
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,190
Andy, no... no... no one's
saying he hasn't changed.

118
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:47,492
I-I've seen it. I've seen him. But...

119
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:49,261
But what?

120
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,364
This is my dream, Andy.

121
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:54,099
And that dream might come to an end

122
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:55,333
because of what Sullivan did.

123
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:58,203
Countless lives might not be
saved because of what we did.

124
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:00,072
Ima... Ima... Imagine if it was Miranda.

125
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,340
What if Miranda made a mistake
and you needed me to help?

126
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:04,209
I mean, obviously, it would
never be you and Miranda

127
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,012
because you're...
You're you and Miranda.

128
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:11,116
You're both so clear and smart
and moral and... and fine.

129
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,751
You're always so fine.

130
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,221
Which is why I need you to help us.

131
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:18,123
You have to help so Robert and I

132
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:20,392
can have a shot at being
you and Miranda.

133
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,051
So we can have a shot at being fine.

134
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,665
I'm gonna tell the truth.

135

136
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,094
Call was a smoke smell?

137
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,095
Yeah.

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,296
Looks alright from the outside.

139
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,998
- Ooh-whee!
- No, there it is.

140
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:02,234
Yeah, we definitely got an
electrical short somewhere in there.

141
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:03,335
Wiggins, Klyne,

142
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,303
walk the perimeter and look for smoke.

143
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,505
The rest of us, let's find a way in.

144
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:11,766
Oh, my God, is that...?

145
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,880
Rainbow Trout?

146
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:17,249
That's me! Fish on a platter.

147
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,283
Who's asking?

148
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:20,552
Oh, Miss Trout, I-I'm just
a huge, huge fan.

149
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,530
I saw you years ago
at Queen Patty's, and...

150
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,745
How... How are
you walking in those things?

151
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,393
Ohh, baby, don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

152
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,494
- Alright.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:34,222
Smell's not as bad down here.
Let's head back this way.

154
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,273
I don't think I can walk through this.

155
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:43,575
If I lose my career here today,

156
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,212
I... Honestly, uh,

157
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,413
I don't think
I'll be able to stay clean.

158
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,216
You need to get your feet
underneath you, Robert.

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,251
Right here and right now.

160
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,954
Not off in some imaginary future.

161
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,756
Come on, let's take a deep breath.

162
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,994
That's it. One day at a time.

163
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:06,398
And today, it's one minute at a time.

164
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,633
I'm here, okay? You're here.

165
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:11,937
We're both healthy.
We're both clean and sober.

166
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:16,397
That's what we know, at this minute.

167
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,400
Okay.

168
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,877
Hi.

169
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:32,845
Herrera, what's up?

170
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,672
Are you gonna testify
at Robert's hearing?

171
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,718
He asked me not to.

172
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,720
He said no histrionics, no dramatics,

173
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,722
just let his lawyer take care of it.

174
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:44,857
Of course he did.

175
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,115
He... He doesn't want me there, either.

176
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,393
We're four weeks into
a 90-day separation,

177
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,219
and he thinks me being there
would be a distraction.

178
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:53,565
So that'why you've been sleeping here.

179
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:56,468
It's okay. We're good.
I... It's for his sobriety.

180
00:07:56,492 --> 00:08:00,039
- His sponsor thought...
- I got it. I just... I didn't know.

181
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,675
Well, now you know.

182
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,846
Look, I'm his wife,

183
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,611
and he has asked me not to be there,

184
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,579
and I really want to
ignore that, but I can't.

185
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,316
So I'm asking you to bust in there,

186
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,419
bring everyone, help the commission see

187
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,587
what type of man my husband really is.

188
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,456
I'm sorry. I can't, Andy.

189
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,648
He asked me not to.

190
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,627
Okay.

191
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,153
Thanks.

192
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,602
Residents, please be aware

193
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,371
we are cutting the power momentarily

194
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,672
due to an electrical short.

195
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,507
Please make your way
out of the building.

196
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:36,809
Thank you.

197
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,777
I'm so hungry.

198
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,312
Dude, why didn't you
just eat the yogurt?

199
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,281
Because I don't want to eat
the yogurt, Gibson.

200
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,615
I want my eggs and bacon.

201
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,785
And don't food-shame me because
you have a rescue family

202
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,354
that gives you doughnuts
and bagels every morning.

203
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,291
My sister, she'd rather watch me
die of starvation

204
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,659
than make me breakfast.

205
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,160
Sorry, "rescue family"?

206
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,496
Yeah, man. You got a little family.

207
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,630
It's nice.

208
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,834
Hey, guys. This is the Rainbow Trout.

209
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,635
She lives here. Ma'am.

210
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,193
- How long has...
- Call me "ma'am" again,

211
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:06,705
and I'm calling the police.

212
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:09,007
Sorry. Uh, Miss Trout, is it?

213
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,042
Mm-hmm.

214
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,610
How long has the smell been going on?

215
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,678
Mm, couple hours.

216
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,480
We thought it was the plant
a few blocks over.

217
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,181
- You lose power today?
- On and off.

218
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,317
- But we do have a slumlord, so...
- Oh.

219
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,477
...not that weird.

220
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,853
Can you get us into the building

221
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,837
so we can take care of that short?

222
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:24,757
Come on in, sugar.

223
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,496
Come on in, sugar!

224
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,097
Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

225
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:35,567
Oof, the smell is even worse in here.

226
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,069
How many units are in this building?

227
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,203
15.

228
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,738
- Three on each floor?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,607
Although three of them
are empty right now,

230
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,742
thanks to Miss Rona Virus.

231
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,444
Okay, uh, find the electrical box,

232
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,412
cut the power, and then sweep
the first floor,

233
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,647
check for hot spots.

234
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,582
Miller and I will start
on the fifth floor.

235
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,385
- Alright.
- Oh, but I-I wanted, uh...

236
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,987
Fine!

237
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:02,261
And you saw that he'd
OD'd on the floor of his own office?

238
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,931
Um, well, I... At first, I
thought he'd just passed out.

239
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,567
But then I saw the fentanyl, so...

240
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,369
But you didn't report him.

241
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,204
Well, I-I was a rookie, you know.

242
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,039
And he said the station ran on trust.

243
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,414
You mean he manipulated you.

244
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:20,679
It was a tough situation, and...
And I probably handled it wrong.

245
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,514
This wasn't your fault, Mr. Dixon.

246
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,749
Did Mr. Sullivan tell you it was?

247
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,717
No. No.

248
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,719
Uh, but when I-I told
Dr. Warren, I said...

249
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,254
You told Dr. Warren?

250
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,257
Well, how long was it before
Warren turned in Mr. Sullivan?

251
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,409
Um...

252
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:38,096
I...

253
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,633
I don't... I... I don't know.

254
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,391
Was it more than a week?

255
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,606
And wouldn't you think that,

256
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,107
with something as serious as this,

257
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:52,434
that he might have reported it sooner?

258
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,915
Don't mind the music.

259
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,750

We have guests.

286
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,575
Bow, if you don't quit pulling focus...

287
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,809
Rainbow, what have I told you

288
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,144
about bringing over male entertainers?

289
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,445
You need Jesus.

290
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,713
Hi, ma'am... miss.

291
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:03,085
We're with the, uh,

292
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,349
- Seattle Fire Department.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,285
Someone called in about a smoke smell,

294
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,519
so we just have to check your unit.

295
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:08,788
Oh, do you now?

296
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,088
Your apartment.

297
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,456
We're gonna check your apartment.

298
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,960
You are all messes.
These are actual firefighters!

299
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,528
I saw the truck.

300
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:18,745
- Oh.
- Lord!

301
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:19,798
Thank you for your service.

302
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,868
- Oh! Jesus, Lord, and Mary!
- What happened?

303
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,236
We're also cutting the power.

304
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,737
Uh... Thanks for the notice.

305
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,406
We'll... We'll... We'll be quick.

306
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,774
Ma'ams... misses, misses.

307
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,876
- I'm going with them.
- Yeah.

308
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,046
He's putting in the work to stay sober.

309
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,783
He's coming to meetings,
asking me to be his sponsor,

310
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,886
even committed to a 90-day
separation from his wife

311
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,355
so he could focus
on his recovery full-time.

312
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,856
He's on the right path.

313
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,925
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

314
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,094
Exactly how long have you known
Robert Sullivan?

315
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,963
Long enough to know
that he's a man of...

316
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,898
So, your glowing recommendation
is based on what?

317
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,933
Your own personal history
as a drug addict?

318
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,736
What's the toughest thing you've
ever overcome, Mr. Lowther?

319
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,939
A bad hair day? A traffic ticket?

320
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,874
Or your favorite ribeye overcooked?

321
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,910
Addiction is a disease, sir.

322
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,778
It's not a weakness or a shortcoming.

323
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:07,913
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

324
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,749
Overcoming addiction is a daily battle.

325
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,785
It's clawing your way back
to any semblance of normal,

326
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,989
and there is nothing that is
harder than that first step.

327
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,091
And Robert Sullivan has taken it.

328
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,627
Despite the agonizing pain
of withdrawal,

329
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,263
despite the fear of losing
the career he loves,

330
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,733
he's still putting one foot
in front of the other,

331
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,101
one day at a time.

332
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,170
And he deserves to be judged
as much for that

333
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,372
as he does his past.

334
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,773
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

335
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,651
Bring in Mr. Dixon, please.

336
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,041
Good job down there, man.

337
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,047
Thanks.

338
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:15,312
- Mr. Dixon...
- Okay.

339
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,949
Here goes another episode
of the Michael Dixon show.

340
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,584
I first became aware of the drug problem

341
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,521
when Sullivan and Warren
came to my office to confess.

342
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,690
Why didn't you report them immediately?

343
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,526
I was conducting
an internal investigation,

344
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,394
trying to handle it before it escalated.

345
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:32,929
In my career, I've learned that

346
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:35,665
if you don't handle
these situations by the book,

347
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,068
a lot of important details can
slip through the cracks.

348
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:40,937
Okay, t-they have
to know that that's bull, right?

349
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:44,374
No, nothing my father gets away
with anymore surprises me.

350
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:47,344
What I found interesting was
how long it had been going on

351
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,678
before I was made aware.

352
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,080
And how long was that?

353
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,115
Could have been six months, a year.

354
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,017
There have been several incidents

355
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,286
since Sullivan joined Station 19

356
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,389
that have resulted
in the loss of a firefighter,

357
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:03,059
the most recent being Pruitt Herrera.

358
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,963
Instead of commanding the scene
from outside

359
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:09,466
like a battalion chief is supposed to,

360
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,702
it is reported that Sullivan
was inside the building,

361
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,704
shifting responsibility

362
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:18,074
onto his newly minted captain,
Maya Bishop.

363
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,142
Oh, I'm gonna kill him.

364
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,076
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna kill him.

365
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,946
I realize now that he was likely using,

366
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,409
but most affected

367
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,487
was probably my son, Emmett.

368
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:33,390
And yet your son was
complimentary of Chief Sullivan.

369
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:36,426
My boy had a difficult year.

370
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,451
Learned some things about himself.

371
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:43,756
He's... homosexual.

372
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,270
He hasn't said two words to me
since I told him,

373
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:50,006
but sure, Dad, out me publicly
for political gain.

374
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,108
Now, it doesn't matter to me,

375
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:54,344
but I can't help but wonder

376
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:59,249
if that's what Sullivan used
to manipulate him,

377
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:00,483
keep him quiet.

378
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:02,452
No, no, no, no.

379
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:04,154
Mr. Dixon, you've been punished

380
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:06,289
for your part in the cover-up,
is that correct?

381
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,658
All charges against me were dropped.

382
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:10,727
The investigation was mishandled.

383
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,163
I was asked to resign
from my position as fire chief,

384
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,664
which I haven't contested,

385
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:16,866
as I was not happy with the way

386
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,035
the department handled this case
in the first place.

387
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,204
So you're currently unemployed?

388
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:25,041
As a matter of fact, I've
recently accepted a new position

389
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,476
as deputy chief of operations

390
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,978
with the Seattle Police Department.

391
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,180
No.

392
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:31,848
What? Did... Did you know that?

393
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:35,218
And I'm excited to continue
serving the city that I love.

394
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:38,354
Thank you for your tireless
service to the city, Mr. Dixon.

395
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,923
Oh, you're quite welcome.

396
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,129
Sorry for the mess.

397
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:49,099
We've had to start doing our
shows in here since lockdown.

398
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,834
What are you looking for, exactly?

399
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,836
Checking outlets and switches
for hot spots.

400
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,138
In case there's an electrical fire.

401
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,240
Oh, thank you, Miss Know-It-All!

402
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:00,910
Izzy's a volunteer firefighter,
and she never lets us forget it.

403
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,745
Izzy. Izzy Packing.

404
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,181
Known at Station 7
as Firefighter Arnett.

405
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,316
You guys all live here together?

406
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,717
Sure do.

407
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:10,286
And we've felt every bit of it
since quarantine started.

408
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,342
Mm-hmm.

409
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:13,790
Oh, that's Big Red.

410
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:15,685
She wouldn't work for your skin tone.

411
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,762
Can I go in there?

412
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:20,731
Mm-hmm.

413
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,235
Oh, my Lord! Is that smoke?

414
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,437
Is our house on fire?!

415
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,038
It's about to be.

416
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:30,573
Yeah. We got to get out of here now!

417
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:32,308
Grab your girdles, girls! Let's go!

418
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:33,492
- Okay.
- The chicken.

419
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,611
You can leave the chicken.

420
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,112
Just calmly.

421
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:39,215
Don't run, please, in the heels.
Please don't run.

422
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,174
Seattle Fire!

423
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,121
Oh, wait. I saw Emmett at
the station this morning.

424
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,456
Was that weird, or...?

425
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,324
No, it was... It was actually...

426
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,527
Okay, yeah, it was painfully awkward.

427
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,128
Yeah, you know...

428
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,296
...you did force him out of the closet,

429
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,131
and then you rejected him when
he told you he loved you.

430
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,467
Seattle Fire!
We need to check your apartment!

431
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,936
Okay, number one, for the record,

432
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,237
I didn't force any...

433
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:02,605
- Oh, my God.
- What?

434
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,908
I was sleeping with my dad.

435
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:06,609
Emmett was my dad.

436
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,212
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That totally tracks, actually.

437
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,080
But you know what? Whatever.

438
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,282
It happens to all of us, right?

439
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,383
At some point, you know?

440
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,118
Like Henry Cosgrove... He was my dad.

441
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:17,086
The circus guy? Seattle Fire!

442
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,988
Yeah, he was a workaholic.
He was always broke.

443
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,157
I never saw him, except for
at like 5:00 a.m.,

444
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,725
when he was, you know,
making me breakfast,

445
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,060
all bleary-eyed and...

446
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,595
So, like all your ex-boyfriends?

447
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,164
Excuse me. Jackson was not broke.

448
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:31,267
Dispatch, this is Engine 19,
requesting Ladder 19.

449
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:36,172
Gibson, Ladder 19 is four blocks away.

450
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:38,107
Copy. We have a possible electric fire.

451
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,243
We're not seeing any flames,
so it's likely in the walls.

452
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,344
We're starting evac.

453
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,414
I can't believe they brought in Dixon.

454
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,716
How does he have any credibility?

455
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,975
The man is a cockroach.
I swear he won't die.

456
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:53,590
So, Carina moved in.

457
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:56,259
This morning, she...
She made me French toast.

458
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:57,293
And... And I know.

459
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,495
"How nice." "What a lovely gesture."

460
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,631
My super, super hot Italian girlfriend

461
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,334
got up early to make me
this gourmet breakfast,

462
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,402
and I sat there
nearly breaking out in hives

463
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:09,505
because it was so... It was so nice.

464
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,040
I mean, too nice?

465
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,275
I-I kept looking around my apartment

466
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,711
at her things on my bookshelves
and her vagina art...

467
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:15,878
Vagina art?

468
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,213
...and her bras drying in my bathroom,

469
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:18,348
and I was like, "Is this my life now?"

470
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,683
I mean, I'm... I'm allergic to monogamy,

471
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:23,419
and I moved in with
my girlfriend during a pandemic,

472
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:24,759
and there's something wrong with me

473
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,170
because she's perfect
and I want to be with her.

474
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:29,392
I want to live with her.

475
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,427
But it's like my body
has this security system

476
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,162
that goes off at all the wrong times.

477
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:35,231
It's like my wiring is faulty.

478
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,167
Or maybe it's just that Carina

479
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,836
is light and lovely and I'm not.

480
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,438
I mean, I'm dark as hell and messy,

481
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:43,873
and I-I just need to be able to call

482
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:45,375
my equally dark and messy best friend

483
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,211
when I'm freaking out over
vagina art and French toast,

484
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:49,445
and I can't.

485
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:52,382
- You can call me.
- Can I?

486
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:55,218
I mean, your entire world
crumbled a few weeks ago,

487
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:56,509
and I heard about it from Gibson.

488
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,270
Gibson, Ladder 19 on scene. Update?

489
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,439
Smoke on the fifth floor.

490
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:18,374
We're evacuating all units now,

491
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:19,442
working our way down.

492
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:20,410
On empty stomachs.

493
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:21,744
Copy.

494
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:25,415
Seriously?

495
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,672
Do what you gotta do.

496
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,054
Ooh, damn!

497
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:33,890
Guess that'll teach 'em to park
in front of a fire hydrant.

498
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:34,980
Send tweet.

499
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,631
Step back, guys. Give them room.

500
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,600
This is ridiculous! There is no fire!

501
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,468
We're trying to make sure
it stays that way!

502
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:52,670
Excuse me!

503
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,705
Excuse me, Mr. Firefighter Man.

504
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,541
Ruby Red Slippers! Oh!

505
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:00,010
Sorry, I'm a big fan. Hi. Are you okay?

506
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:02,117
Yes, I'm fine, but my sisters
haven't come out yet.

507
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,351
They went back in for their valuables,

508
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,319
and I haven't seen them since.

509
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,987
We're gonna get everyone out. I got you.

510
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:07,288
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

511
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,024
Montgomery, Hughes, continue with evac.

512
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,659
Herrera, Cutler,
get water to the fifth floor

513
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,194
so it's ready to go when
Miller and Gibson find fire.

514
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:19,701
Fifth floor's clear of civilians.

515
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,037
Checking for hot spots.
I think we're close.

516
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,639
Copy. Hose is on its way up.

517
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,608
You know, they're not a rescue case.

518
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:27,976
Who? The queens?

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,678
No, Inara, Marcus.

520
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,346
Oh, yeah, man. They're cool.

521
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,149
Yeah, I know they're cool,
but they're not, like, charity.

522
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,717
You know, I-I care about them.

523
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,219
Dude. I know.

524
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,221
Okay.

525
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,297
Oh, y-you.

526
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,266
Y-You are a lying, manipulative con man.

527
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,035
Sure, make me the villain,
if that's what you need to do,

528
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,749
but I'm not the one who stole drugs.

529
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,781
Oh, but you are the one

530
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,039
who tried to cover it up.

531
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,408
And you got rewarded with
a new job with SPD?

532
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,243
Oh, it's practically a demotion.

533
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,712
Let's not get too indignant, Warren.

534
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,013
Of all the entitled pieces...

535
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:07,615
Look, Sullivan is going down. Let him.

536
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,584
But don't take all of 19 down, too.

537
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:11,720
No, no, no, no, no.
You... You know what?

538
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,121
This is our house.

539
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,823
Okay, you don't get to
come in here and talk about 19

540
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:16,444
like you're part of the family.

541
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,127
Warren...

542
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,297
one of these days, you're gonna realize

543
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:26,267
you're either the fish
or you're the hook.

544
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,104
The sooner you recognize that,
the better off you'll be.

545
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:31,372
If not, don't be surprised

546
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:33,041
when someone catches you in the mouth.

547
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:36,044
Good to see you. You look trim.

548
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,857
Girl, I know you're in
pain, but we've got to go.

549
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,158
It hurts. It hurts. We've got to go.

550
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:51,693
Ladies, you need to get outside.

551
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:53,728
She twisted her ankle
trying to get her things.

552
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,597
Apparently, I can walk in
seven-inch platforms

553
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,898
but not in bare feet.

554
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,633
- D-Do you need some help?
- I got her, okay?

555
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,468
I'm a volunteer firefighter, Station 7.

556
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,604
Girl, now is not the time.

557
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,028
Come on.

558
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,364
Oh!

559
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,409
Ohh!

560
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,535
Oh, wow, she's...

561
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,414
She's strong.

562
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:14,816
Okay.

563
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,251
And when you signed off

564
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:18,052
on the PRT's missing fentanyl,

565
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:19,320
would you say that that was a decision

566
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:20,511
that you made on your own?

567
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,657
No, sir.

568
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,292
And how did you come to that decision?

569
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,495
I was... encouraged.

570
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,898
Warren, we don't have time
for vague answers.

571
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,399
It's "doctor."

572
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:34,769
Dr. Warren, who encouraged you
to sign off

573
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,137
on the false inventory?

574
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,343
Battalion Chief Sullivan.

575
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,412
Dr. Warren, you filed a petition

576
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,114
to have this
Physician Response Team vehicle

577
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,715
back out doing field surgery.

578
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,617
What proof do you have
that something like this

579
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,119
won't happen again?

580
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:52,353
Nothing.

581
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,022
I have no proof.

582
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,523
It probably will happen again

583
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:58,493
because this country has a
massive problem with addiction

584
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,528
and not enough funding
and resources for treatment.

585
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,364
My PRT is not the problem.

586
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,166
Robert Sullivan is not the problem.

587
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,468
There are systemic problems
that require systemic changes.

588
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:10,371
Do you know how much rehab even costs?

589
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,574
Do you know how few rehabs
there even are

590
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:14,509
and h-how rarely a spot opens up

591
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,511
and how little of that treatment
is covered by insurance?!

592
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,680
The system failed!
It failed Robert Sullivan.

593
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,215
It failed the people of this city!

594
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,382
That... That's enough.

595
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:27,155
A traveling O.R. complete with
Schedule II narcotics

596
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,623
is too big a liability.

597
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,059
I'm sorry,

598
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,517
but I'm gonna have to shut down
the Physician Response Team.

599
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:37,699
Valiant effort, Warren.

600
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,462
You know, I think I found it.

601
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,542
Alright, punch a hole, check for flames.

602
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,379
I'm sorry. I-I got scared.
I thought I had more time.

603
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,348
- Ma'am, what are you doing?
- I took a Xanax.

604
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,250
- What are you doing? Ma'am?
- Captain, we missed a civilian.

605
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,618
- I need to get Big Red.
- You have to head down.

606
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,887
Izzy loves her. It's very important.

607
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,421
No! No!

608
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:01,479
- Wait! Don't!
- No!

609
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:04,465
Wait!

610
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,560
Gibson, what happened? Gibson?

611
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,507
Miller?

612
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:27,617
Herrera, do you copy?

613
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,787
Gibson?

614
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:32,514
Please respond.

615
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:42,470
Emergency Traffic. This is Jack Gibson.

616
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,344
We just had a smoke explosion on
the fifth floor from unit 5C.

617
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:52,347
Firefighter Miller, myself,

618
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,049
and one civilian
were caught in the blast.

619
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:55,283
Are you hurt?

620
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:58,749
I'm okay. I'm bringing
the civilian down now.

621
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,622
Hey. Miller.

622
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:02,825
You good?

623
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,828
I'm good. Get her. Get her.

624
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,096
I'm fine.

625
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:08,500
Hey. Hey.

626
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,603
You alright? Can you get up for me?

627
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:13,140
Can you move? That's good.

628
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,733
Come on. Yeah. That's good.

629
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,485
Bishop, Herrera, and Cutler copy.

630
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,522
Thank God. Let me know when
you have eyes on Miller.

631
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:25,524
Fifth floor.

632
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:38,660
Izzy! Izzy! Oh, my God.

633
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,874
- Izzy!
- Whoo!

634
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:43,308
Izzy Packing,

635
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:44,743
you really are a whole damn firefighter.

636
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,511
Mm-hmm.

637
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:48,814
Honey, fire or not,
you don't leave a sister behind.

638
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,349
- Mnh-mnh.
- Come on.

639
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:53,685
Requesting two additional
aid cars, one additional engine,

640
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,020
and SPD for crowd control.

641
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,656
I need everyone to move
further back from the scene!

642
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,191
Miller, do you copy?

643
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:04,753
Miller?

644
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:08,734
Montgomery, Hughes,
go get Miller and Gibson.

645
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:20,913
- We got you, Miller.
- Herrera.

646
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:22,581
Don't move until we can get you.

647
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,784
- Miller, do you copy?
- Copy!

648
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:27,052
Go, go, go, go. What's your position?

649
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:29,021
Fifth-floor hallway.

650
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:30,889
Rear of building. Low visibility.

651
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:33,659
I have an exit,
but I'm having knee issues,

652
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:35,427
so I'm gonna need assistance.

653
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:37,552
We're almost to you. Hold tight.

654
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:42,935
Okay. Come here. We got you.

655
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,694
We got him!

656
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:36,882
Hey, hey, hey! Geez! Hey! Hey!

657
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:37,983
Ah, yeah. Sorry.

658
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,452
Yeah, that's a patellar dislocation.

659
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:41,476
Yeah.

660
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:45,223
- What is that?
- What?

661
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:47,959
Ohh! Ohh! What the hell was that?!

662
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,828
I was trying to distract you
from the pain.

663
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,196
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,731
Nailed it, nailed it,
nailed it, nailed it.

665
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,865
- Yeah.
- Nailed it.

666
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,023
Right.

667
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:00,572
Here you go.

668
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:03,075
Inara's my friend, man.
If you got a problem with her...

669
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,494
I don't have a problem with Inara.

670
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:06,578
You called her a rescue.

671
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:08,380
Jack, you're picking a fight
with me about something

672
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:09,714
that I don't want to fight you on

673
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,116
after you popped my kneecap
back in place.

674
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,818
Dude, I get it.

675
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:14,753
I'm not judging you.

676
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:15,921
You never had parents,

677
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,190
so Marsha is your surrogate mother.

678
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:20,759
Marcus reminds you
of your deaf foster sister.

679
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,228
And Inara is in love with you...

680
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:25,263
Ow... which is your favorite thing.

681
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,833
I'm happy for you, Jack.
I'm proud of you.

682
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,935
I'm glad you have a family.

683
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,937
Pru is the best thing
that happened to me,

684
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,872
and I didn't even know I wanted her.

685
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:37,110
So... we good?

686
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:41,346
Yo. We good?

687
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,380
Yeah.

688
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:44,249
Warren, what's up?

689
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:45,784
What's wrong?

690
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:48,987
Is it over? Is it bad?

691
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,416
Maya?

692
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,267
My MeeMaw gave me that wig.

693
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,835
It was hers.

694
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,238
I came out to her when I was 12.

695
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:08,807
She giggled, said she already knew.

696
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,244
She said she doesn't care who I love,

697
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:15,847
and she'd sling her purse at
anybody who told me differently.

698
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:19,584
And her purse was very heavy.

699
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:23,555
Then she gave me her favorite...
Her favorite dress-up wig.

700
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,947
Big Red. Who's now my favorite.

701
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:28,927
And now she's gone?

702
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,629
And now she's gone.

703
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,998
But I'd let that wig burn up
a million times

704
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,333
to make sure my sisters are safe.

705
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:37,802
They're the ones who
picked me up when MeeMaw died,

706
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:39,938
taught me how to really be a queen.

707
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:42,140
How to be part of a community.

708
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:43,808
They're my tribe.

709
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,877
Montgomery, meet us back at the house

710
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,846
after you drop the patient
at Grey-Sloan.

711
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,980
Copy.

712
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:51,583
That's, uh... That's my tribe.

713
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,019
You don't have any queen friends?

714
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:55,754
I-I did some drag back in...

715
00:31:55,778 --> 00:32:00,215
No, I mean, like, you don't hang
out with any gays or femmes?

716
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,862
Not a lot of gay guys
in the fire department.

717
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,531
Child, every queen needs a queendom.

718
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:14,105
Your sister's gonna be okay.

719
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,887
Hey, I, uh, just wanted to wash my hands

720
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,223
because I've been burying
my face in them all day.

721
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,061
Warren, I'm sorry.

722
00:32:36,085 --> 00:32:39,664
About the PRT.
I know how much it meant to you.

723
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:41,032
Look, I would understand

724
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:42,701
if you never wanted to
speak to me again.

725
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,502
If the tables were turned, I...

726
00:32:44,526 --> 00:32:47,195
J-Just...

727
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,866
Look, you didn't intend to take
anything from me.

728
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,304
And that matters.

729
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:03,488
Look, we're 19.
We fight the fight together.

730
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,001
Mr. Sullivan, you have three minutes

731
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,170
to address the commission.

732
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:26,405
Would you like to use
those three minutes?

733
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:27,996
Yes. Uh, yes, sir.

734
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:32,290
Uh, I-I know what I did was wrong.

735
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:36,815
I know I made mistakes.
I made colossally bad calls.

736
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,284
But I also know I made
a lot of good ones.

737
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,420
I made decades of good ones,

738
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:45,424
saving lives and helping more
people than I can count.

739
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:47,248
And I'm not even close to being done.

740
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:55,886
Look, I-I regret every moment
of pain I caused my colleagues.

741
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:58,437
I regret breaking their trust.

742
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,506
And I plan to spend
the rest of my career

743
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:03,308
making it up to them, making it right.

744
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:05,944
If you let me.

745
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,962
Excuse me. We are not finished.

746
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:25,497
Commission, I'm Captain Maya Bishop

747
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,665
from Station 19,

748
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,400
and I'd be doing this department
a disservice

749
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:29,668
if I didn't bring our team here today

750
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,036
to fight for our battalion chief

751
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,138
the way he has fought for us
so many times before.

752
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:37,442
Robert Sullivan
is an excellent firefighter.

753
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,277
He's one of the best.
He's committed to the job.

754
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,746
He's patient with his time
and leadership.

755
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,548
He made a mistake.

756
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:45,016
He made some mistakes.

757
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,918
Because he was suffering from pain

758
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:48,620
from an injury he got on the job.

759
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:50,755
Putting others' lives before his.

760
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:52,491
He's one of us.

761
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:54,793
He's one of us.
He's one of the good ones.

762
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:56,461
He's one of the good ones,

763
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,864
both as a human and a firefighter.

764
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,234
And I've seen a lot of people
who are terrible at both.

765
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:06,304
He was in chronic pain.
He needed drugs to treat it.

766
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:08,373
And, yes, he became dependent
on those drugs.

767
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,542
He became desperate.

768
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,511
My husband died
because of a crappy captain

769
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,379
who didn't know how to ask for help.

770
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,615
Sullivan is nothing like that guy.

771
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,185
He made a mistake,
but he's asking for help.

772
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,488
Robert Sullivan lost his parents
in a plane crash,

773
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,657
and he still became the
high school valedictorian.

774
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,526
He lost his wife in an accident,

775
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,654
and he still climbed the ladder
to battalion chief.

776
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:34,666
In our job, when you go down
physically, we rehabilitate you.

777
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,401
He went down physically.

778
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,538
Addiction is a treatable,
chronic disease,

779
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:40,739
so we rehabilitate him.

780
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,708
We do not throw him out with the trash.

781
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:47,837
At SFD, we take care of our own.

782
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:50,749
Dixon?

783
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,717
He was never one of us.

784
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,687
He was out for blood.

785
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,722
He wanted everything
that he put us through

786
00:35:57,746 --> 00:36:00,292
to come down on someone else's head.

787
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:02,185
That's not justice.

788
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:06,531
Losing a damn good firefighter
is not justice!

789
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:14,806
Let's take a recess, please.

790
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:23,515
Hey. You missed the big show
downstairs, Miller.

791
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:25,684
It was very "I am Spartacus."

792
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,052
I'm sure he did not need me.

793
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:29,487
Hey, where were you? How's the knee?

794
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:31,523
It's good. Just icing it, you know?

795
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,891
- No big deal.
- Hmm.

796
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,961
So, before you hear about it on the news

797
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,597
the PRT is done.

798
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:39,631
- What?
- What?

799
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,632
Ahh. I'm sorry, bro.

800
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,500
And Dixon is back.

801
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:43,902
- What?! How?
- No!

802
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:44,970
Satan lives!

803
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,072
He's back at the police department.

804
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,274
So, Sullivan might get kicked
out of the fire department,

805
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:51,710
but, sure, why wouldn't P.D.
take Dixon back?

806
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,979
Yeah. I'm sorry about the
knife-mobile, though, Warren.

807
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,513
- That sucks.
- Yeah, sorry...

808
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:57,616
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

809
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,917
I thought we said no sharing of food.

810
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:01,319
Uh, no, no. You said no sharing food.

811
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,488
You took away eggs and bacon.
You cannot take away lasagne.

812
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,323
I didn't take away anything.
Look, it's protocol.

813
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:07,592
No, no, i-it's protocol at the hospital.

814
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,793
- Yeah.
- But we're a pod.

815
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:09,928
- Mm-hmm.
- We're a family.

816
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,263
- Yes.
- We eat family-style.

817
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,259
- Amen.
- Overruled.

818
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:13,328
Overruled?

819
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:15,433
Do we need to paint you
a picture? Over-ruled.

820
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:16,568
Gavel.

821
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,103
- Okay.
- Second gavel.

822
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,571
Did you just salt-and-pepper me?

823
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:21,373
And what is up
with the pre-cut fruit, man?

824
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:23,074
- Why would you do that?
- What are we, a book club?

825
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:25,277
Seriously? What is wrong
with the pre-cut fruit? What is...?

826
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:26,544
Okay. Do you want to start a book club?

827
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:27,579
I would love to start
a book club with you!

828
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:28,917
Forgive me for trying to
save you from the virus.

829
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:29,911
I'm a doctor. Don't
worry about it. It's fine.

830
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:30,848
Sorry about the PRT.

831
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,898
Alright, it was good
to see you guys, okay?

832
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,986
And I'm... I'm sorry that my dad
is the devil,

833
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,955
but, uh, I'll see you around.

834
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:38,690
- Bye, Emmett.
- Your dad's the worst.

835
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,982
Hey, Emmett. Wait up, man.

836
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,597
Emmett, wait, wait, wait, wait up.

837
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,999
I'm sorry if it w... If it was weird.

838
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:49,934
I was weird earlier. Sorry.

839
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,836
- Can we be friends?
- Friends?

840
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,040
I-I never wanted to not
have you in my life.

841
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,675
And I know that I hurt you,

842
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:59,477
and I recently realized that I projected

843
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,513
a lot of unfair crap on you.

844
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:03,048
But I really care about you.

845
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,517
And I don't have any gay friends.

846
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,485
Yeah, well, me, neither,

847
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:09,354
but I've only been out
for like 10 minutes.

848
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:14,359
I, uh... I realized today, actually,

849
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:18,630
that, uh, my husband's friends
were our circle.

850
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:20,932
So when he died, you know,

851
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,767
we all kind of drifted apart and...

852
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:26,788
I'm saying let's be friends.

853
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,197
Please?

854
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,611
Yeah.

855
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,503
Yeah. Let's be friends.

856
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,288
I don't know what happened to
our friendship,

857
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:46,858
but I do know that I never
forgave you for taking the job,

858
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:48,526
for Jack, for so many things

859
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,627
that weren't entirely your fault.

860
00:38:49,651 --> 00:38:52,230
And my life kept rolling
forward, blow after blow,

861
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:54,032
and I never processed it,
I kept it inside.

862
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:56,534
I fell back on my dad's bad habits.

863
00:38:56,558 --> 00:38:58,370
I wall up and isolate and shut down

864
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,004
because that's how things
were handled in my family.

865
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:02,707
And you freak out over French toast

866
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:03,742
because you never felt safe

867
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,310
around the breakfast table as a kid.

868
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:11,499
I miss having a friend who
is just as messed up as me.

869
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:13,318
Well, you have Jack.

870
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,757
I'm sorry it's
taken me so long to say all this.

871
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:22,327
No. I'm... I'm sorry.

872
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:26,598
Move back in.

873
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,767
I mean, just till
the separation is over.

874
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,568
You shouldn't be sleeping here.

875
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:32,570
Uh, what? You just moved in with Carina.

876
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:33,638
And she makes French toast so good

877
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,006
I think I orgasmed a little.

878
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,531
Oh, God.

879
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,043
Wow, do you know
how many nights in a row

880
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,746
I've had canned green beans for dinner?

881
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,615
Like, right out of the can.

882
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:46,607
Move back in.

883
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:50,655
I miss you.

884
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:20,485
I'm still a firefighter.

885
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:22,253
Yeah, you are.

886
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:29,327
But, um, I'm no longer
your battalion chief.

887
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:30,614
What?

888
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,830
They gave you captain again.

889
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,798
No. No title.

890
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:35,500
- What? What does that even mean?
- How does that even work?

891
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:36,824
They knocked me back to grunt.

892
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,139
W-Where?

893
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,707
Since no other station would have me,

894
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,344
I guess it's your call, Captain.

895
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:58,523
Welcome to 19, probie.

896
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,592
Wow! Probie!

897
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,228
Yeah!

898
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,762
I like the sound of that.

899
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:06,731
Yeah! I love the sound of that!

900
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,033
Alright, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

901
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,235
- Alright.
- Alright.

902
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,337
- There it is.
- There it is.

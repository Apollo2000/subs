1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,788
Previously on "Station 19"...

2
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:02,980
Dad, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,680
- Working reception.
- Why?

4
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,721
If people find out,
then my dad'll find out.

5
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,816
Seth died.

6
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,318
I want to take her out on a date.

7
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:10,675
This is my race, not yours.

8
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:11,954
Not everything is about you.

9
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,503
I recognize him from my patrols.

10
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:15,299
He lives on the street.
I can keep an eye on him.

11
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,436
I just wanted to say I'm not
the kid next door anymore.

12
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,394
Couldn't sleep without
getting that off my chest.

13
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,144
Have you ever grabbed a doorknob

14
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,609
or gone to push an elevator
button and you get shocked?

15
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:28,744
Hey, hon.

16
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,006
It's usually just a little zap,
nothing big.

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,240
Nothing to worry about.

18
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,186
I stopped by in between
meetings to surprise you,

19
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,177
and you're not here.

20
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:36,211
I had cabin fever,

21
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,181
just sitting around
growing human life all day.

22
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,060
Plus, all the power outages
are driving me nuts.

23
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,185
Just be careful, please. No freeways.

24
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,654
I can still race Vin Diesel
for pink slips, right?

25
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,023
No. We can't risk losing the minivan.

26
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:51,994
You know, technically,
I'm not on bed rest.

27
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:53,505
The doctor just said, "Take it easy."

28
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:54,963
Then take it easy.

29
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,832
Electrical currents
are all over the place...

30
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,401
Great. Now they fix the power.

31
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,571
Safely encased in rubber
and hidden out of reach,

32
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,739
but they're there.

33
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,075
They're always there.

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,217
Guess there's one perk
to your newly chosen profession.

35
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:18,013
It's what happens when
you stop carrying a scalpel

36
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:20,783
and start carrying a 50-pound hose pack

37
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,718
up 10 flights of stairs.

38
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,220
By myself.

39
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:25,421
In the dark.

40
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:26,989
Okay, don't try to impress me

41
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:29,125
with your stamina, Benjamin Warren.

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,894
Are you forgetting
how many hours it takes

43
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:33,829
to resect a malignant meningioma?

44
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:35,898
Which I did yesterday.

45
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,500
On a step stool.

46
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:42,171
Well, I kicked down a door.

47
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:43,272
With a dead bolt.

48
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:46,842
I tied off a bleeder with only two knots.

49
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,911
I pulled four victims out of an accident.

50
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,780
I puled four clots
out of a femoral artery.

51
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,649
I stepped off the roof of a building

52
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:57,319
maybe a full 10 seconds...

53
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,088
before the whole...

54
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,021
damn thing...

55
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,565
collapsed.

56
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,464
I love you.

57
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,199
I love that you love what you're doing,

58
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:17,206
but maybe let's not talk so much
about the danger part.

59
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,642
Or the job part. For now.

60
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:22,211
So, even if you feel good
and you feel safe...

61
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,413
Maybe let's just stop talking.

62
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:27,297
You never know, do you?

63
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:31,020
If today's the day you might wind up...

64
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,457
with a shock to your system?

65
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,231
What are you doing here so early?

66
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,200
Or just, what are you doing here?

67
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,234
Bad news.

68
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,751
Your incident report
was accidentally destroyed.

69
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,406
So I sort of kind of
have to do another walk-through

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,974
of your place.

71
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,309
Sure.

72
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:03,185
So, how have you been...
with... everything?

73
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,388
You know, moving forward, moving on.

74
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:07,823
Moving on?

75
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,091
Yeah. Meaning?

76
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,226
You are so obvious.

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,028
You totally made up this whole
incident-report thing

78
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:14,897
- to come over here and ask me out.
- No.

79
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,042
So you don't want to ask me out.

80
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,900
- That's not what I meant.
- So you do?

81
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,870
I feel like any answer I give
is the wrong answer suddenly.

82
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:23,182
You know, this could be construed
as extremely unprofessional.

83
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,774
You might have to convince me not
to file an official complaint.

84
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,210
Okay, let's be clear. I-I-I-I...

85
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,945
Over Thai food.

86
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,513
Tonight.

87
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,015
And a bottle of red wine.

88
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,020
Okay.

89
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,722
"Okay"?

90
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,257
Okay.

91
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,565
It's been 48 hours. Not a word.

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,800
Now your dad's calling us in
early to "talk"?

93
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,102
Yeah, well, he's mad.

94
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:54,937
He goes quiet when he's mad.

95
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,174
A lot like you.

96
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,383
You're the one who ended things.

97
00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,551
- Not much else to say.
- Really?

98
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,043
When you're the one who called
things a waste of time?

99
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:09,785
You're both adults.

100
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,054
You can technically do what you want,

101
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:15,124
but it disturbs me
that you never considered

102
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:18,160
the consequences of your actions,

103
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:21,328
what it would mean, not just
to me, but to the station.

104
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:23,432
If I had known about the two of you,

105
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,935
I would've never put you both up
for the captain position.

106
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:26,902
You're trying to lead this station.

107
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:30,139
This team puts their trust
in you blindly.

108
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:33,309
You don't deserve their trust if
you can't be honest with them.

109
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:36,478
You need to come clean with them
about your...

110
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,013
whatever it is.

111
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:41,016
Immediately. Yourselves.
Or I will do it for you.

112
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,085
Dad, it's not happening anymore.

113
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:46,155
You walked in on us
deciding to call it off, so...

114
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,222
So, what?

115
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:49,097
You want to pretend
there was nothing going on?

116
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,961
You're the two who are fighting
to captain this place.

117
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,095
What do you think?

118
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:56,198
Is that how you want to lead
this station, on a lie?

119

Aid Car 19.

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,547
Response, medical.

122
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,740
Assist police.

123
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,516
- I didn't realize you were...
- Me either.

124
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,545
I figured I'd jump on the raid,

125
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,187
get out of the station for a while.

126
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,055
But I can switch with Trav or Dean.

127
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,334
You don't have to do that. I can switch.

128
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:22,891
No, no, no. Don't be silly.

129
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,392
So you and I are together today.

130
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,130
Then I guess we should go.

131
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,298
Yeah.

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,169
So, hold on. Herrera and Bishop
are on a stakeout.

133
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:35,738
Like a... Like a stakeout-stakeout?

134
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,383
It's standard procedure
if cops are planning a bust

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,417
where somebody could get hurt.

136
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,509
It's pretty routine.
Happens like once a month.

137
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,355
- Roll call, everybody.
- I want to go on a stakeout.

138
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,346
- Same.
- Mnh-mnh. Nope. No, you don't.

139
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:46,548
It takes hours of just
sitting there doing nothing.

140
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,852
Until something awesome happens
and a swarm of good guys run in,

141
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,186
yells at some bad guys,

142
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:54,156
and then somebody busts through
a giant glass window on a rope.

143
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,270
Yeah, you know, I'm sure
it goes down just like that.

144
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:58,560
Guys, come on. Let's get going.

145
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,206
Stakeouts so nobody
will bring up the fact

146
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,273
that he went to JJ's house this morning.

147
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,098
- What?!
- You didn't want to lead with that?

148
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,267
Guys!

149
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,616
Roll call.

150
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,539
I think today's a good time for inventory

151
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,241
and routine maintenance checks.

152
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,942
Every tool, every hose.

153
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:17,046
Jack, what happened to doing
things on our own schedule?

154
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,680
That's a very good question, Travis.

155
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,016
Maybe Gibson is rethinking his approach

156
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,419
of doing whatever he wants
whenever he wants.

157
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,224
Warren, you're on hoses.

158
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,348
Montgomery, check the rigs.

159
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:32,194
Hughes and Miller, tool maintenance.

160
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:35,264
And for me today, Gibson?

161
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:37,633
Well, you're at reception, sir.

162
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,700
Same as always.

163
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:39,835
Very good.

164
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,241
Chore time. Let's see that hustle.

165
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,244
Let's go.

166
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,252
You're late.

167
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,122
- Hey, Bishop.
- Tanner.

168
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,224
Come on. Briefing's already started.

169
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:03,836
We've staked out a warehouse
a few blocks from here.

170
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,471
The target, who we've
code-named the Big Boss,

171
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:06,462
is a drug trafficker.

172
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,930
He and his crew will arrive soon

173
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,465
and make a buy from our undercovers.

174
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,600
We move in,
and local PD makes the arrest.

175
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,135
Questions? Good.

176
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,737
Everyone be on their radios
and be ready to move.

177
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,149
The important thing is to stay here

178
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,132
until we give you
the green light to move in.

179
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,910
These guys are dangerous, so do not
move in until you hear from us.

180
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,445
Dangerous? Dangerous how?

181
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,580
Like, could we get shot?

182
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,592
- Do we need bulletproof vests?
- You don't need vests.

183
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,127
They're gonna barge in, arrest the guy,

184
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,185
and then congratulate themselves

185
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,931
with high fives or butt-slapping
or whatever,

186
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,199
and the whole time, we're never
gonna leave this lot.

187
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,957
We're just gonna sit here
and then go home.

188
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,108
We're like earthquake insurance.

189
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,026
Don't really need it,
but it's nice to have.

190
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,005
She's right. Except for the butt thing.
We don't do that.

191
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,198
Set your radios for Ds2.
Stay in your vehicle.

192
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,334
Do not get out or leave for any reason.

193
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,002
Time to get comfortable.

194
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:55,611
So, now we just, sit here?

195
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,347
How could you possibly
have another question?

196
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:00,983
I'm sorry. I just prefer
to have all the information

197
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:02,618
instead of being left in the dark.

198
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,955
Maybe some of us function better
when we're given a heads-up

199
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,057
about the things we should know
from our friends.

200
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,692
Ryan's your friend now?

201
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,294
Is he yours?

202
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:15,063
Because last time I checked,
friends don't belittle each other,

203
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,203
especially not in front
of their co-workers.

204
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,576
Belittle? What are you talking about?

205
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,868
You were so dismissive just now.

206
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:21,503
High fives? Butt-slapping?

207
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,315
- Really?
- I've... I've known him a long time.

208
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,551
- I promise you, he wasn't offended.
- You don't know that.

209
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,576
My God.
Why are we fighting about this?

210
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,211
- What is this?
- Talk to me. Please.

211
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,312
- No.
- Why not?

212
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,313
Why would I talk to you
when you're acting like this?

213
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:34,683
- I'm not acting like anything.
- Yes, you are.

214
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:36,362
Can you please just tell me
what's going on

215
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:37,696
so we can deal with it and figure it out?

216
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,747
Sure. Of course.

217
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,389
Let's get my stuff out of the way

218
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,058
so we can circle back around
to deal with yours.

219
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,527
Wow. Okay.

220
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,995
Let's not talk, then.

221
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,364
Okay.

222
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,338
This will help you guys keep tabs.

223
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,050
It's a live feed
from inside the warehouse.

224
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,441
We're about to go radio silent.

225
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,909
Don't want them getting ears on us.

226
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,678
Just got word the Big Boss
could be close,

227
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,346
so we're moving into a closer position.

228
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,483
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

229
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:10,886
I don't usually see you
doing this part of your job.

230
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,788
It's just... It's new. That's all.

231
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:15,224
I mean, we don't do raids every day.

232
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,070
You sure everything else is okay in here?

233
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,928
Tanner, what's your status?

234
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:21,863
- Need you back.
- Got to go.

235
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:23,465
- Eyes on the tablet.
- Yep.

236
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,470
Okay, is it me,

237
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,473
or is Captain Herrera's grumpy
level, like, grumpier today?

238
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:40,210
Yeah, what was going on
with him and Jack at breakfast?

239
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:41,546
I don't like tension with my granola.

240
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,937
- Here.
- Toss me that wrench.

241
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:45,072
- I just don't like granola.
- It's weird, right?

242
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:46,941
I mean, there's definitely
something going on

243
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:47,942
between him and Jack.

244
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:49,584
How are those chores going?

245
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,650
- Great.
- They're done.

246
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:52,054
That's what we were talking
about were the chores.

247
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:53,447
- There it is.
- Gibson!

248
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:55,483
I've got a walk-in for you.

249
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:56,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,619
You guys install car seats, right,

251
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,421
for women who are medically banned

252
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,456
from lifting anything heavy
but married to men

253
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,959
who tend to install even
toilet seats upside down?

254
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:06,785
Of course.

255
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,896
One of these guys can help you out.

256
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,503
What's that thing, Warren, that
patients say at the hospital?

257
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,197
When they want the best care,

258
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,299
they request an attending
over a resident?

259
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:19,969
Yeah, I'd be happy to
install the seat for you, ma'am.

260
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,328
Great. Thank you. That's great.

261
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,407
Also, I'm having triplets.

262
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,109
So there are three.

263
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,812
- Great.
- Great.

264
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,088
Okay, I can feel you sitting
there wanting to talk to me.

265
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:39,055
I know what it is.

266
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,622
So you might as well
just tell me what it is

267
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:41,952
and be done with it, okay?

268
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,580
- So go.
- You know what what is?

269
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,195
I saw Jack's shirt, Andy,

270
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,443
on the ground outside
the captain's bedroom.

271
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:49,042
- I know.
- You don't know the whole story.

272
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,033
You weren't exactly hiding much.

273
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,001
You're the one who seems
to be hiding something.

274
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:55,105
You told me to shut up and back off.

275
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,940
You told me this wasn't my race.

276
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,701
So I have a tough moment
and you take it to this extreme?

277
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,636
That was nothing.
I just needed a little space.

278
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,248
- Which I've been giving.
- Yeah, while getting pissed about it.

279
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,863
If you'd just talk to me...

280
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:08,043
I don't talk to you because
I don't feel like I can.

281
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,749
What are we even doing right now?

282
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:16,218
I don't know.

283
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:19,388
We've been friends since
we were probies together.

284
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:22,415
We never fight. We never do this.

285
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,927
If we didn't work together,
would we even be friends?

286
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,038
What do you mean
I don't know the whole story?

287
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:38,707
Don't worry.

288
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,742
I'll double-check everything
once he's done.

289
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:41,943
Fantastic.

290
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:45,380
Listen, you should sit.

291
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:47,516
We have beds or a sofa.

292
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,861
There's no reason for you
to stay on your feet

293
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:52,854
while Gibson takes this long to
install three simple car seats.

294
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,223
You know, just 'cause I'm cooking babies

295
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,792
doesn't mean I'm helpless.

296
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:59,861
I am pretty awesomely strong, okay?

297
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:02,297
Listen, your body
is working overtime now.

298
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,199
Family first. Please, rest.

299
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,269
Okay, maybe I could
put my feet up for a minute.

300
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,273
Figured it out.

301
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,475
Figured what out?

302
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:14,743
Jack and Pruitt.

303
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,911
Family first. Get it?

304
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,913
As usual, you are speaking in a code

305
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,714
that I only half understand.

306
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,250
Family first.

307
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,552
He picked sides.

308
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:25,964
I think Pruitt told Jack that
he's no longer staying neutral.

309
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:27,933
He's supporting his daughter
for captain with Frankel.

310
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,724
And now Jack's mad.

311
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,294
I mean, they probably had words.

312
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,930
Like, bad words. Big, bad words.

313
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,056
- Really?
- Yeah.

314
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,995
- You think Pruitt picked a side?
- Yeah.

315
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,068
- I don't buy it.
- Well, you don't have to buy it.

316
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:42,304
I've seen what I've seen.
I've heard what I've heard.

317
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:43,816
- And I'm right.
- But Jack's his guy.

318
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,841
He's been his lieutenant
for like two years.

319
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,776
And how long has Andy been his daughter?

320
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,780
Hey, guys, I invited a guest
to lunch today.

321
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,950
I'd like you all to meet
my wife, Dr. Miranda Bailey.

322
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,018
- Hello.
- And so, that's Jack,

323
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,254
Vic, Travis, and Dean.

324
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,423
Yes, the Puppy Guy.

325
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,758
I prefer Puppy Man.

326
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:04,845
Okay.

327
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,699
And, you already know...

328
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:07,798
Dr. Bailey.

329
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:12,801
Your wife is also one of my doctors.

330
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,470
I did not put that together
until just now.

331
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,705
Hello, Dr. Bailey.

332
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:17,706
And what are you doing here

333
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,975
instead of staying at home,
getting rested?

334
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,845
So, what would you like
to know about things here?

335
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,814
We're an open book. Ask us anything.

336
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,682
For instance, are you aware

337
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,218
that your husband flosses
a concerning amount?

338
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,655
Station 19, response.

339
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:34,689
Let's go.

340
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:37,993
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, just stay.

341
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,794
- You stay.
- Okay.

342
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:40,949
- Bye.
- We'll be right back.

343
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,269
Please.

344
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:57,723
I know what you're gonna say.

345
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:00,815
I know that you know what
your last checkup indicated.

346
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,919
You know that it showed your CBC
was borderline

347
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,253
and getting worse.

348
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,522
You are getting sicker,

349
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:10,058
and I told you the best way to fight this

350
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:11,826
is to stay home and rest.

351
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:15,664
By ignoring my advice,
you are playing with fire.

352
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:18,767
Okay, and you might think
that that's what you do

353
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,769
or that you're invincible.

354
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:23,438
I assure you, Mr. Herrera, you are not.

355
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:30,078
So as your physician,
I mean it in the most alarmed,

356
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:35,116
most concerned way possible
when I ask you again,

357
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,886
what the hell are you doing here?

358
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,564
- You're wrong.
- Nope. Try again.

359
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:48,387
Coming here is the thing
that is keeping me going.

360
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:50,046
If I have to sit at home and convalesce,

361
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,814
that'll kill me faster
than anything else.

362
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,752
I need to be here,
to work a desk, answer phones,

363
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:58,721
to clean up after people's dumb choices.

364
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:01,324
Being here is the best chance I've got.

365
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,598
Surely you can understand that.

366
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,527
I am worried about your numbers.

367
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,095
I am, too.

368
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,364
Okay, does anybody else here know?

369
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,836
I'm a private person.

370
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:17,740
Okay, I might...

371
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:22,845
know a little of what it's like
to experience a medical setback

372
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,517
and not want it to slow you down,

373
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,919
so, hey, let me be clear.

374
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:33,423
I do not approve of you
working here right now.

375
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:36,526
Excuse me. Can I get a glass of water?

376
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,737
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

377
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:40,296
Here, why don't you have a
seat and let me check you out?

378
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,431
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

379
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,599
Yeah. I'm sure it's nothing.

380
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:46,102
It's just what happens when
you're a walking incubator.

381
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:48,604
Yes. Okay. Good, good.

382
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,765
Thanks.

383
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,942
Um... in the hospital, I'm your patient,

384
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:54,877
but here in my house, this is what I do.

385
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,978
May I?

386
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,066
Well, you sit down, too.

387
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,983
Okay.

388
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,637
Say something.

389
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,825
You're gonna air your dirty laundry

390
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,727
to everyone at the station

391
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,429
when we are weeks away from peer review?

392
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:15,932
All your hard work
and leadership and talent?

393
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:18,901
It'll all just be muddied up
and overshadowed

394
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,837
by your stupid secret affair.

395
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,806
- It didn't feel stupid.
- Andy, it's sloppy.

396
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:27,777
Yeah, I get that now,
but when I'm with Jack,

397
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:31,781
the way he sees me
for exactly who I am right now,

398
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,284
not some kid he once knew,
not some idea he's chasing,

399
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,688
just me, the way that makes me feel...

400
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,956
I can't just shut it off.

401
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,257
But you could've shut the door.

402
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,659
I stop coaching you for 72 hours,

403
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:46,095
and this is what happens?

404
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,864
You are gonna...

405
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:48,831
You're gonna lose this for us.

406
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,032
- Us?
- Yes, us.

407
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:53,169
You, me, womankind. Us.

408
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,670
You know what? You know what?

409
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:55,982
No more talking. No more talking.

410
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,217
- We were finally not fighting.
- I know.

411
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,341
But now I'm all worked up,

412
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,009
and normally I would go for a run,

413
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:02,278
and by the time I got back,
I wouldn't be as worked up,

414
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,947
but we can't do that because
we are stuck in this damn car.

415
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,519
So I am going to go for a run
in my head right now.

416
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:15,825
- Okay, but...
- I-I am running.

417
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,927
I will let you know when I am back.

418
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,664
We are back, and we are hungry.

419
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:22,465
That was quick.

420
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,400
E-cigarette fire. No big deal.

421
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:28,004
So, how many of you are married?

422
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,174
Show of hands? Ever been married?

423
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,045
And how did your spouses
enjoy your stories

424
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,849
of fireballs and giant flames
and near-death experiences?

425
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:42,552
Well, my... my
husband was a firefighter, too,

426
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:43,920
so we used to have this really...

427
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:45,688
Station 19. Response.

428
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,590
Motor-vehicle accident.

429
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,091
Wait. Again? Already?

430
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:50,693
- Yep.
- No wonder you're slimming down.

431
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,028
You never have time to eat.

432
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,864
- Sorry. Got to go.
- Go on.

433
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:57,010
I have a surgery, so I doubt
I'll be here when you get back.

434
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,936
Um...

435
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,737
Love you.

436
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,243
Hey, man, I just want you to know

437
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:09,879
that I know why Pruitt's
being such a pain to you.

438
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:13,946
What do you mean?

439
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:16,085
I mean, I know it can't be easy for you.

440
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,088
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

441
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:20,756
But I guess I'm not all that surprised.

442
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,024
- You're not?
- Come on.

443
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,093
Whole thing was pretty obvious, you know,

444
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,344
that it would go this way

445
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:27,363
and that Pruitt would feel
the way he feels.

446
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,298
I didn't think
we were being that obvious.

447
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,935
Thought Andy and I were pretty
good at hiding our relationship.

448
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,806
Pruitt walking in,
that was just bad luck, I guess.

449
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,742
I just wish he'd lay off
a little, you know?

450
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,911
But, Travis, I mean this.

451
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:44,080
I promise, Andy and me being together

452
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:47,083
did not affect our.
Decisionmaking in any way.

453
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:51,821
I don't want you to feel you
can't trust either one of us.

454
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,123
Right. Right.

455
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:56,325
I wasn't even thinking about that.

456
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,227
Hey, thank you guys

457
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,962
for being so welcoming to Miranda today.

458
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,098
I-I really wanted her
to be able to put some faces

459
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:03,209
to some of the names,

460
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,734
get a feel for what we do every day.

461
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,469
She, She gets worried

462
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:08,804
about how dangerous this job can be,

463
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,006
so it's good that she sees

464
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,475
that it's as much about us
just hanging back, chilling out

465
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,577
as it is about us
putting our lives in danger.

466
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,078
I mean, I keep trying to tell her

467
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,156
it's more about bandaging skinned knees

468
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,214
and installing car seats

469
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:21,517
than it is about us
doing anything... dangerous.

470
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,919
Boy.

471
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,156
Help!

472
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,159
Help me!

473
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,131
Help me, please!

474
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:36,899
Help!

475
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:39,001
- Warren, you were saying?
- All right, listen up.

476
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,103
We got downed lines, victim in the car.

477
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,216
Lines are live, so the whole
area could be electrified.

478
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,184
With that voltage, even our
rubber boots won't keep us safe.

479
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,552
There could be currents
sparking through the air.

480
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:49,378
So we keep our distance till the
utility company turns the power off.

481
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,681
- Miller, let's remove these live wires.
- Got it.

482
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,115
Montgomery, Hughes, Warren,

483
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,551
get ready for rapid extrication
once it's safe.

484
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,562
Got about a 20-foot radius
of electrified pavement.

485
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,269
Everybody be careful.

486
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,295
All right, Warren,
let's get that patient talking,

487
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:12,397
but make sure he stays
inside the vehicle.

488
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:13,475
If the ground's electrified

489
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,500
and he steps one foot
out in front of the other...

490
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,668
Classic steak combo.

491
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,804
He's a Sizzler.

492
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:21,506
Inside, good. Outside, bad.

493
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,701
Got it.

494
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:27,178
Hey! Hey!

495
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:29,981
- What's your name?
- Mar... Marshall.

496
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:32,417
Marshall, okay. Okay.

497
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,585
How you feeling?

498
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,721
Any, Any dizziness or bleeding?

499
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:38,589
None of that.
I just want to get out of here.

500
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:41,492
Yeah, yeah. I'm Ben, okay?

501
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,561
And we're gonna get you out safely,

502
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,998
but, I need you to stay
where you are for now.

503
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,567
Please, just stay inside the car.

504
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,102
Can't I just make a run for it?

505
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:52,437
I'm fast and lucky.

506
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:54,572
I win every raffle I enter.
Like, every one.

507
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:56,117
Yeah, we can't take that chance, okay?

508
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,608
And I'm sure it sounds strange,

509
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,277
but right now, your car's rubber tires

510
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,579
are the only thing preventing
you from getting shocked.

511
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:05,516
So, please, no matter what,
stay in there.

512
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:10,355
Maya?

513
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:11,522
Still running.

514
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:12,757
Big Boss.

515
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,359
- What?
- Big Boss, Big Boss.

516
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:16,427
No, for real, things are happening.

517
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:17,683
Who's who?

518
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:19,530
Are those our guys or the bad guys?

519
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:21,199
I wish the cops had their badges on.

520
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,610
I think that's frowned upon
when you're undercover.

521
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,535
It's hard to see much.

522
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,204
What's that guy doing?

523
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,472
I wish we had audio.

524
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,606
I wish we had snacks.

525
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:37,115
Hey, guys. Guys.

526
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:38,383
Yeah?

527
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:42,019
That car's leaking gas.

528
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:44,155
If the sparks from one
of those wires hits it,

529
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,090
the car will explode.
With Marshall inside.

530
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,669
No, we got to get in there
and get him out.

531
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:48,726
No, no, no, no, no.

532
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,605
You touch that car,
you're gonna get electrocuted,

533
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,163
and if that gas ignites, you'll burn.

534
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:53,564
Yeah, so will he.

535
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:59,504
Okay, okay. New plan.

536
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:02,607
Hughes, try to sand that gas
without getting shocked.

537
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,142
- Montgomery!
- Yeah?

538
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:05,276
Tag me out.

539
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,930
All right.

540
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,314
- You got it?
- Yeah.

541
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,622
Marshall, I need you
to listen very closely.

542
00:22:17,656 --> 00:22:19,534
I'm gonna need you to get
out of the car yourself

543
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:20,992
in a very specific way.

544
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,794
- Whoa, whoa. Get out of the car?
- Yes.

545
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,362
That is the total opposite

546
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:26,597
of what you guys just told me before.

547
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:28,616
The situation has changed. We
don't have the time we thought.

548
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,275
Now, I'm gonna need you to listen closely

549
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,376
to my friend Jack.

550
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,678
Hi, Jack.

551
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:34,945
Hi.

552
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,448
I need you to open the door. Can
you do that for me, Marshall?

553
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,684
I can, but I don't want to.

554
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:40,918
Okay, look at me.

555
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,753
It's okay to open the door.

556
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:44,255
You just go slow. All right?

557
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,257
But don't get out of the car yet.

558
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,459
- Easy.
- Easy?

559
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,527
Yeah.

560
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:10,114
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

561
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:11,716
Okay, good, good.

562
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,950
Look at that. One step closer.

563
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:13,784
Good.

564
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,087
Now stand on the frame of the car.

565
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:18,289
Keep your arms to your sides like this.

566
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,457
And absolutely do not...

567
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:22,560
do not touch the ground
and the car at the same time.

568
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:23,627
W-W-W-Why? Why not?

569
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:24,962
'Cause that would be bad.

570
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,564
You mean, like, electric-chair bad?

571
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,466
Let's... Let's not think
about that right now.

572
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,668
Okay.

573
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,769
What's next?

574
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,904
All right, you're gonna want
to hop onto the ground.

575
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:36,507
Make sure both feet hit
the ground at the same time.

576
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,276
You're gonna hop off like a bunny.

577
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,444
A bunny?

578
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,747
That way, you won't
break the circuit, all right,

579
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,982
and all the electricity
will flow through your body

580
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:46,016
and back into the ground.

581
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:50,988
Like a bunny. I-I can't.

582
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:52,790
- Yes, you can.
- You can do this.

583
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:55,659
- I know you can.
- I don't.

584
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,996
Okay, have... have you ever
seen birds on power lines?

585
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,298
Birds love power lines, you know?

586
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,700
They... They just go up there,

587
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,335
and they just... they just chill, right?

588
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:06,103
Two feet at a time.

589
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,438
All right? They're fine.

590
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:08,839
They don't get fried.

591
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,876
So you are gonna do this
like a bird, Marshall.

592
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,977
I thought I was a bunny.

593
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,112
Okay, okay, now, look,
you just keep on doing that.

594
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,480
Keep on cracking your jokes.

595
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:17,959
I bet you're probably a pretty funny guy

596
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,460
and you're probably
trying not to think about

597
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:20,862
what's happening here, but, Marshall?

598
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:21,786
Yeah?

599
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,187
It's okay to be worried,

600
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:25,790
'cause that keeps you alert, focused.

601
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:27,291
I need you to use that right now

602
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:30,861
so we can get you through this, okay?

603
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,196
You with me?

604
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,900
I think so.

605
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,767
Okay.

606
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:37,912
We're gonna count together, all right?

607
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,805
You and me, all right?
Then it's boots on the ground.

608
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,807
Two feet leave the car and hit the ground

609
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,208
at the exact same time, okay?

610
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:45,876
- On three.
- Wait, wait.

611
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,345
Jump on three or after three?

612
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,782
On three, Marshall. Okay?

613
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:56,387
One... two...

614
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,922
- three!
- Three!

615
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,756
- Nice!
- Yes!

616
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,057
That's it. Nice.

617
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:01,392
- Okay.
- Very good.

618
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:06,047
They're moving. Why are they moving
offscreen? Where are they going?

619
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,175
No, no. Come back, come back,
come back, come back.

620
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,280
I don't... I don't like this.

621
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:09,834
Move in. All forces move.

622
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,335
Use of lethal force is authorized.

623
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,771
Wh-What the hell?

624
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,206
What the hell?

625
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,374
So, that's it, right? I'm safe!

626
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:18,242
- No!
- N-No, no, no.

627
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:19,554
You need to keep bunny-hopping to me.

628
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:23,214
The street's still electrically
charged for another few feet.

629
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:26,584
- Keep on hopping.
- Marshall, count of three, okay?

630
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:27,952
You got this.

631
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,920
One...

632
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,889
two...

633
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,057
- three.
- Three.

634
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:34,291
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

635
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,326
Good.

636
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:37,895
What, are you 80?

637
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,597
Banging stuff doesn't fix it.

638
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:41,031
Come on. Come on.

639
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,133
Ryan's in there now.

640
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,235
Three.

641
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,470
- Good. Yes.
- Okay, okay.

642
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,449
You're almost there, Marshall.
Just a few more jumps.

643
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,913
- I'm gonna make it.
- Yeah, you are.

644
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,118
I'm gonna hug you when I get over there.

645
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,743
Come on. Bring it.

646
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,418
- No!
- Marshall!

647
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:04,154
- Marshall!
- No! No! No, you can't.

648
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,056
Not till the power's off.

649
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:11,729
What was that?

650
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:13,397
Those were gunshots.

651
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,239
What are you doing?

652
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,037
Gunshots mean injuries.
People are hurt in there.

653
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,260
We can't just barrel into

654
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:23,229
an active crime scene.

655
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:25,689
Ryan said we have to wait
until they give us the word.

656
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:27,501
- What if their radios are down?
- Andy, stop!

657
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,827
We don't know what's going on in there.

658
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,696
We need to wait.

659
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,034
We have to wait.

660
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,203
We can't wait any more, Jack.

661
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:41,149
Do you know what a jolt like
that does to the human heart?

662
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:41,973
Time is muscle.

663
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,275
Back off, Warren. That's an order.

664
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,277
Hughes, talk to me about that power.

665
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,212
Any minute. No, we need it now.

666
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,715
- I'm going in.
- Hey, don't go there, man.

667
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,683
His body could still be
conducting electricity.

668
00:26:52,718 --> 00:26:53,958
You want to end up next to him?

669
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:02,727
Power's off! We're clear!

670
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,128
All right, go, go go.

671
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:05,830
Warren, Montgomery, assess the patient.

672
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:07,798
Hughes, Miller,
get that gasoline cleaned up

673
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,867
and off the street
while I secure these lines.

674
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,235
Move it!

675
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,036
Okay, on my count.

676
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,372
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

677
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:17,742
Labored breathing, weak pulse.

678
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:19,643
Cap refill is delayed.

679
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:23,481
He's in V-fib.

680
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:24,612
Charging.

681
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:28,386
Come on. This thing takes forever.

682
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,489
And clear!

683
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,491
Shock delivered.

684
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:34,725
Still in V-fib.

685
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,093
Charging again.

686
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:38,029
Come on, Marshall. Stay with me, Buddy.

687
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,830
Earthquake insurance.

688
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:42,333
We're just earthquake insurance.

689
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,502
PD pays us to sit here and not be needed,

690
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:45,836
and now an earthquake hit.

691
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,071
Someone is in there, shot,

692
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:49,237
possibly bleeding out while we sit here.

693
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:50,482
And the human body holds
eight pints of blood.

694
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:51,372
One good hit to an artery,

695
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:52,451
and all that can pour out in minutes.

696
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:54,442
How many minutes has it been?
Two? Maybe three?

697
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,421
If we get in there
and they've lost all that blood,

698
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:58,413
we'll have to get pressure up,
pack the wound,

699
00:27:58,447 --> 00:27:59,614
keep an eye on that pulse.

700
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:01,916
It goes thready, we'll be ready
with epi and I.V. fluids.

701
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,785
We'll be ready. We are ready.

702
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,588
Andy, it's not Ryan.

703
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:08,423
It's not going to be Ryan.

704
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:10,258
Call us, damn it!

705
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:11,837
Come on, Marshall.
You got this. You got this.

706
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:13,328
And clear.

707
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,530
Shock delivered.

708
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,601
Yes! Normal sinus rhythm.

709
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:24,105
- Ben.
- Yeah, I'm here.

710
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,473
You gave us a scare.

711
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:28,309
Guess I didn't stick that last landing.

712
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:29,677
BP's dropping.

713
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:35,950
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

714
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:38,620
Electrical burns can look minor
from the outside,

715
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:39,621
but given the voltage?

716
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:40,722
His insides are a mess.

717
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:42,534
His abdomen's getting rigid.
He's bleeding internally.

718
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:43,925
He needs a laparotomy right away.

719
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,727
He's not stable enough to move yet.

720
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,199
I'm not feeling so great.

721
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:54,669
A little tingling everywhere,

722
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,472
and I can't... I can't move my arms.

723
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,808
He's going into shock. I.V. fluids now.

724
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:02,110
Aid Car, move in.

725
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:03,645
Repeat... Aid Car, move in.

726
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,979
- Finally.
- All right, let's go.

727
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:11,619
Follow me.

728
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:13,165
Is it an officer down
or one of the other guys?

729
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:14,455
It's an officer.

730
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,890
I'm sure it's not him.

731
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,526
Give it to me straight. Am I dying?

732
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:20,305
No, we're just trying
to stabilize your vitals

733
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,007
so it's safe to move you
to that ambulance over there

734
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,075
so we can get you to the hospital
as soon as we can, okay?

735
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,868
You don't want to say it.
I get that, but...

736
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:30,705
if I'm not gonna make it, let me...

737
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,640
call my wife.

738
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,409
Phone's in that pocket.

739
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:37,078
I just...

740
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:38,646
I want to talk to her.

741
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,415
No. We are not there yet.

742
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:41,683
You hear me, Marshall?

743
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:44,819
Marshall.

744
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:47,689
Dopamine... now.

745
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:07,275
He's right over here.

746
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,786
He was wearing his vest,
but the blast was point-blank.

747
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,521
It burns.

748
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:21,856
We got you.

749
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,358
The vest stopped the bullet.

750
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,728
- Losing his pulse.
- BP is still dropping.

751
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:27,806
His organs are shutting down.

752
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,564
Pushing another round of dopamine.

753
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:33,701
Marshall.

754
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:48,316
We need to intubate now.

755
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,598
- Hang on.
- Why?

756
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,633
'Cause once we intubate,
he won't be able to speak.

757
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:02,764
Marshall, um...

758
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:08,736
let's call your wife.

759
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:17,890
Sorry to wake you,

760
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:21,082
but I didn't want anyone
to worry about you.

761
00:31:21,116 --> 00:31:24,953
That's my husband, always waking me up.

762
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,657
Hey, hon.

763
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:34,236
So, I had the best day.

764
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,342
I got the car seats
buy two, get one free.

765
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,534
I am a coupon master.

766
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:41,003
Then I had them installed
at the fire station

767
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:42,672
by these amazing firefighters.

768
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:44,374
Didn't even have to lift a finger.

769
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:47,410
They... They are lifesavers.

770
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:48,544
Yeah, they are.

771
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,912
They've been so great.

772
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:52,181
They let me beach myself here.

773
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:54,384
I don't know who made their couch,

774
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:57,487
but we are getting one immediately.

775
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,721
Then...

776
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,945
Lynn, honey, I just wanted to say...

777
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,615
I love our kids so much.

778
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,364
And I haven't even met them yet.

779
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,666
I know, hon. Me, too.

780
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:12,368
It's crazy, right?

781
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:14,337
I love you, too.

782
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:15,671
Aww, sweetie.

783
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,574
I know what you're doing.

784
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,576
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you're trying to butter me up

785
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:22,845
into letting your mom
into the delivery room

786
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
when we've been over this.

787
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:27,450
I didn't come out of her vagina.
I don't need her seeing mine.

788
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:30,086
No, I need you to hear me.

789
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,589
I love you so much.

790
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,719
- Okay.
- Say it back.

791
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:40,596
Is... everything all right?

792
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,360
Please, Lynn.

793
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,568
I love you.

794
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:47,103
I love you, too.

795
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:53,943
Everything all right?

796
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,446
I can't tell.

797
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,485
I don't think so.

798
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:40,623
He's gonna be okay, right?

799
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:43,593
He's alert and responsive.
He's got strong vitals.

800
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:45,294
He needs a chest X-ray just to be safe.

801
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,173
You mind giving us a few minutes
before carting him off?

802
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:49,342
I need to get a statement and
a positive I.D. on the shooter.

803
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:50,666
Not too long.

804
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,302
Thank you guys for being here today.

805
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:54,647
We wanted to get you in there sooner,

806
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:55,872
but the scene wasn't secure.

807
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:58,007
Yeah, once we heard that shot,

808
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,409
it was hard to not just bolt in.

809
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:05,882
You weren't worried it was me, were you?

810
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,517
I was happy it wasn't.

811
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:12,688
We both were.

812
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:14,443
Put your friend in the back
when he's ready.

813
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:18,361
Nice raiding with you.

814
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,568
Ryan's been helping me out recently.

815
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,203
With?

816
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:28,738
My brother.

817
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:31,641
He found him pretty messed up.

818
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,186
I guess he's been living on the streets.

819
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,545
I can coach anybody. I'm a fixer.

820
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,147
I can fix anything but not this.

821
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:39,215
I don't know what to do.

822
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:42,585
I can't believe you let me go on
and on about a guy

823
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,063
when this is what's been
going on with you.

824
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,188
I-I'm so sorry you felt
like you couldn't tell me.

825
00:34:46,223 --> 00:34:47,557
- It's not you.
- No, it is me.

826
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,902
You're right.
It... It's been all about me.

827
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:52,328
I just didn't want to say it out loud.

828
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:56,265
What are you... What are you gonna do?

829
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:00,169
I have no idea.

830
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:05,741
You know, when I asked before if...

831
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,757
if we'd be friends
if we didn't work together,

832
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:13,182
the answer is yes.

833
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:16,852
In any universe,
it'd still be you and me.

834
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,023
Copy that.

835
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,428
Ryan found him for you?

836
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:28,965
Yeah. Ryan's kind of great.

837
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:31,233
Yeah. He is.

838
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:33,469
What are you gonna do?

839
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:37,907
If you and Jack are over, you're
free and clear to move on.

840
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,683
Tough call today.

841
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:50,620
I've lost patients before.

842
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:52,189
Yeah, it feels different, though,

843
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:55,157
when you lose them
right there in the moment

844
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:57,760
and you think about
who they're leaving behind.

845
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,645
Is he okay?

846
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,079
It's never easy losing somebody.

847
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:19,115
He's dealing with a lot right now.

848
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,586
Okay, when you have something to spill

849
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,455
and you choose not to spill,
you make angels cry.

850
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,058
It's not the time.

851
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,095
- It's not the time.
- Mnh-mnh.

852
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:37,133
Okay, fine. Jack and Andy
have been hooking up.

853
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,267
- What?
- Wait. What?

854
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:39,702
- Wha...
- W-Wait. For how long?

855
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:42,838
Why would they do that? I-I don't know.

856
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:45,875
I-I don't know how I feel about this.

857
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,510
N...

858
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:49,779
I mean, not good, I think, is how I feel.

859
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,981
- Hoo-hoo-hoo.
- Jack and Andy?

860
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:53,783
Okay, that's unsettling. I am unsettled.

861
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:55,317
No wonder Pruitt was pissed.

862
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:56,519
I wonder how it started.

863
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:58,491
I wonder where it started.

864
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,991
Ew. Do you... Do you think
they did it in here?

865
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:05,828
You know, Jack's my guy, and
he hasn't said one word to me.

866
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,496
Not one word?

867
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,065
No, we are a team built on trust,

868
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,833
and they have been lying to us.

869
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,902
You know, if we can't trust each other,

870
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,937
this whole place falls apart.

871
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:26,315
Heard you had quite the day.

872
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,551
I did.

873
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,815
I heard you did, too.

874
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:33,155
Yeah.

875
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,828
I guess we should go tell everyone.

876
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,529
I guess we should.

877
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,031
It may not go well.

878
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:46,135
They could be really angry and hurt.

879
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:48,738
Yeah.

880
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,853
Jack and I wanted to talk
to you all because,

881
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:07,723
for the past few months,
we've been seeing each other.

882
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:12,128
We know it was unprofessional

883
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:13,929
not to be honest with you,

884
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,898
but we never meant to disrespect anyone.

885
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:16,932
O-Okay, wait, wait.

886
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:22,238
O-O-Okay, um, I mean,
that's unexpected, right?

887
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,615
No? N-Nobody?

888
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:27,109
If anyone has any questions,
we're here to answer them.

889
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:28,811
I'm cool with it.

890
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:32,581
Y'all can do...

891
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:34,784
who... what... I'm good.

892
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,952
Okay, first, is this why you two

893
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:38,498
spent so much time in the turnout room?

894
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,066
Second, did you do it
in the turnout room?

895
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,457
Okay.

896
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:43,092
Third, did you do it
on or near my gear

897
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,226
in the turnout room?

898
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:47,963
And fourth, who would you
save first in a fire?

899
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:49,632
Me or one of you?

900
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,569
I don't really care what you do.

901
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:55,971
It's your business.

902
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:59,508
But one of you will be captain here soon.

903
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:02,444
You have to see how that
might make some question

904
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,680
whether you can really be unbiased.

905
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:09,451
So I guess my question is,
is one of you gonna leave?

906
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,025
No, because we broke up.

907
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:18,160
The worst thing about getting shocked

908
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:19,595
is you don't see it coming.

909
00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:21,293
Thanks for listening.

910
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:22,965
We just thought you should know.

911
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:34,844
Hey.

912
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,478
It jolts you.

913
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:37,513
Was there more?

914
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:42,618
Um, I got us a table at
the jazz club in Belltown.

915
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:45,054
I wore my good jeans,

916
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:49,024
and I was gonna bust out all the stops.

917
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:49,959
I would hope so.

918
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:51,694
Yeah, it takes a minute
to look this good.

919
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,797
It grabs you.

920
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:57,733
I had a weird day.

921
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,736
And I just found out some stuff at work

922
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,139
about people that I-I thought
I knew really well.

923
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:05,975
And you came to me to talk about Seth,

924
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,810
and I don't want to bring him up

925
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,712
if it's too sad or disrespectful,

926
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:13,082
but I-I haven't always done
a lot of that.

927
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:14,255
Talking.

928
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,085
I mean, at least not
about important stuff,

929
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,891
and I-I-I just wanted to talk
because I like talking to you,

930
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,659
because I-I like you.

931
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:25,327
And, I don't... I don't know.

932
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:27,096
I don't know what I'm saying,

933
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,066
and I should just shut up
or... or go or... or both.

934
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:34,603
Or you're just staring at me,
and, um... okay.

935
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:35,938
I'm sorry.

936
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:38,173
I should... I should... I should go.

937
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,775
It's electric.

938
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:52,721
But when the shock's gone...

939
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:55,057
you have to deal with the aftermath.

940
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,096
Any interesting calls after I left?

941
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:04,366
What? I know how important
this is to you.

942
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:08,470
And while hearing about all
the fire and danger and stuff

943
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:11,140
isn't ever gonna be my favorite,

944
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:13,976
I don't want you to think
you can't share it with me.

945
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,978
Because a jolt like that...

946
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:19,148
That, That means a lot.

947
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:20,549
It'll hurt.

948
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,118
So, come on. Hit me up.

949
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:26,322
Don't you want to tell me
all about how you got all sweaty

950
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:28,691
lifting the Jaws of Life or something?

951
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:33,162
The calls aren't always that exciting.

952
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:34,630
So nothing big today?

953
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,634
Nothing big.

954
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:48,277
It can burn you.

955
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:53,015
But it can also shake you
out of your comfort zone...

956
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:57,987
zap you awake...

957
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,790
force you to do something big...

958
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:06,795
and see where the sparks fall.

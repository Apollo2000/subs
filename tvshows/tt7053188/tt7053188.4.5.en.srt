2
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,538
- Whew!
- 19!

3
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:17,887
19!

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,325
Hey, baby.

5
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,242
Now, I know firefighting's
not a competition,

6
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,114
but we had
the wet stuff on the red stuff

7
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:29,638
five minutes before 23
even hooked up to a hydrant.

8
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,485
23... were they even there?
I don't remember seeing them.

9
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,052
Sure, you do. They were the ones
with the clean turnouts.

10
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,599
Hey-oh!

11
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:35,794
Yeah, they never even made it
off their engine.

12
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,124
It's not a competition.

13
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,517
Oh, God, the whistle's back.

14
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,692
- Come on.
- Why?

15
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:47,351
Okay, guys, listen up!

16
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,919
This team's response time
and cohesion

17
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,877
is notwhat it needs to be.

18
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,401
Stay in your turnouts.

19
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:56,708
We will be doing drills
for the next three hours.

20
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:57,796
- No!
- What?!

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,755
- What?
- Come on!

22
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,106
Okay. Captain Bishop's
got jokes now.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,890
Listen.

24
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,433
We can't go to the bar,
like we usually do

25
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:10,331
after three alarms,
so our place this afternoon.

26
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,245
- Yes!
- Yeah!

27
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,028
19!

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,290
19!

29
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,075
- We love it!
- Whoo!

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,512
- Settle down.
- Nice!

31
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,209
Warren, you okay?

32
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,907
Uh, yeah.

33
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,562
My mother-in-law... she, um...

34
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:26,042
she's gone.

35
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,871
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

36
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,307
COVID? Yeah.

37
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,155
She, um... I just dropped her
at Grey-Sloan yesterday.

38
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,746
I... thought she had more time.

39
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,096
Is there anything I can do?

40
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,923
I-I got to get home.

41
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,882
Um, Miranda wants me
to tell the kids. Um...

42
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,275
Okay, go.

43
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,643
Yeah, I will. I just need
to stow my turnouts...

44
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,191
Warren, it's covered.

45
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,018
Whatever it is,
it's covered. Go.

46
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,282
Thanks, Cap.

47
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,026
Hey. You guys gonna come over?

48
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,874
Yeah, I got to swing by
my parents' restaurant first,

49
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,247
but I'll bring the pierogi.

50
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,468
Oh, good. What's day drinking
without the pierogi?!

51
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:03,035
I'm not coming unless
there's a lot of sour cream.

52
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,646
Whatever. You're gonna be there.

53
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,995
Gibson?

54
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,475
Yeah, I'll...
I'll be late, though.

55
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:10,042
Uh, I got to help Marcus
with his online classes.

56
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,393
You mean you got to go
see your girlfriend, Inara.

57
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,003
I told you, just...
Just friends, so...

58
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,614
Oh, right. Friends,
like the ones you sleep with,

59
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:17,809
live with,
and raise a child with?

60
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,940
That kind of friend? - Whoa-ho!

61
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,377
Okay, now, one,
I sleep on the couch.

62
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,316
Two, I'm not raising
any children, because,

63
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,100
like, you know,
I'm more like his, uh...

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,667
Step-daddy?

65
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,110
Inara and I are just friends.
Why is that so hard to believe?

66
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,975
Well, I don't know.
Have you met you?

67
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,891
- Jack, I believe you.
- Thank you.

68
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,937
I believe that youbelieve
you're just friends.

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,199
Ooh! Hey-oh!

70
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:36,982
19!

71
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,026
19!

72
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,122
No, no, no, no, no!

73
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,472
Come on!
- That's three straight for me!

74
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,189
You've been practicing
on the sly or something.

75
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,388
What?!

76
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,347
Here. Hey, rematch.
I want my rematch.

77
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,957
Yeah, okay.
I'll make it four in a row.

78
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,917
Benjamin Warren.
What do we owe the pleasure?

79
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,224
I, um...

80
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,704
I missed you guys.

81
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,097
You know, I got tested
yesterday. I'm COVID-free.

82
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,795
- Hey, Ben!
- Okay! COVID-free!

83
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,276
We need you to help us beat Roz
before her head gets too big.

84
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,731
Uh-huh. This is ridiculous.
Look at this. Honestly, like...

85
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:11,974
- Come on, now.
- Let's go.

86
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,671
Hey, get her, get her!

87
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,171
Oh, yeah, she can't handle you.
She can't handle you.

88
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,215
Can you pause the game
for a minute?

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,373
Actually,
just... just turn it off.

90
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,635
Please?

91
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,638
Um...

92
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,206
...what's wrong?

93
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,471
Ben?

94
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,914
Mmm! This is really good.Yeah.

95
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,265
If you want to find
the best coffee in any city,

96
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,224
you ask a recovering alcoholic.

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,488
That's a joke, Robert.

98
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,361
Uh, I'm sorry.

99
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,190
I've, uh, been in a mood lately.

100
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,714
Yeah. Roll up,
tell me what's going on.

101
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,890
Just this 90-day separation
from my wife

102
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,458
is... is wrecking me.

103
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:05,114
But Dr. Shepherd
said it's necessary, so...

104
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,377
Well, did she say
it was necessary

105
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,466
or did she suggest
that it might help you

106
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,772
focus on your recovery?

107
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,208
- I...
- Uh...

108
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,427
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,777
I'm a rule follower. See?

110
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,606
So if you tell me a rule,
I follow it to the letter.

111
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,739
A-Are you saying
it isn't a rule?

112
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,307
Robert, there are no rules
in a 12-step program.

113
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,005
The only requirement
for membership

114
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,791
is a desire
to stop drinking or using.

115
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,881
Shepherd gave you a suggestion
based on herexperience.

116
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:36,232
Are you telling me
that I can be with my wife?

117
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,886
Does your wife
support your sobriety?

118
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,627
- Yes.
- Okay.

119
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,326
Does being around her cause you
to crave alcohol or drugs?

120
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,588
No.

121
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,809
Look, you and I are here
to work these steps.

122
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,811
There's nothing in those steps

123
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,900
about separating
from the people who love you.

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Yes! -

125
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,212
So, is Sullivan coming?

126
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,953
I think so, yeah.

127
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,305
Oh! Someone's got an opinion!

128
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,045
I'm not...
I'm not saying anything.

129
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,135
Maya,
you think you have a poker face,

130
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,051
but your face
is playing "Twister."

131
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,271
Okay. Fine.

132
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,404
You guys separated for a reason.

133
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:18,990
You seemed to think
it was a goodreason.

134
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,276
Oh!

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,713
Maya "Monogamy
is for the Weak" Bishop

136
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,212
lives with her girlfriend
for a few weeks,

137
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,456
and suddenly,
she's a relationship expert.

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,328
Okay, got it. I said nothing.

139
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,044
Look, you're the one who invited
the team over to day-drink.

140
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,766
Robert is on the team.

141
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,898
And we're big kids.

142
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,205
We can make our own rules
about our own marriage.

143
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:39,164
You were right.
I'm not a relationship
expert. I'll shut up.

144
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,360
We have no snacks. We can't have
a party without snacks.

145
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,907
You're right. I am on it.

146
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,779
I'm on it, mamacita!

147
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,564
Thank you.

148
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,789
- What?
- Vic Hughes.

149
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,486
You got to stop following me.

150
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,464
Following you? Why?
Do your parents own this place?

151
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,534
Oh. Wait. No, minedo.

152
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,144
- No way.
- Yep.

153
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,320
Oh! Best pierogies in town.

154
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,105
Damn straight. Oh, now I get the
first-responder discount.

155
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,325
Yeah, you know what? I, um...

156
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,935
I don't think that's about me.

157
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,936
I think they're just trying
to keep their lights on, so...

158
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,329
Ah.

159
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,741
I didn't see you at the fire
this morning.

160
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,767
- Shift just started.
- Okay.

161
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,900
D Shift said
they kicked 19's ass, though.

162
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,816
Wow! So I guess D Shift is a
bunch of lying liars, then, huh?

163
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,341
Oh.

164
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,563
Um...

165
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:35,264
So, I-I got to...
I'm gonna bring these home.

166
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,092
I got to eat them
before they congeal.

167
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,267
- Mm.
- It's gross.

168
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,616
That's a gross word, right?

169
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,662
Congeal is...
a super-gross word.

170
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:42,837
I apologize for using it.

171
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,012
- Yeah.
- Um...

172
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,361
- Alright.
- Okay.

173
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,971
Aah!

174
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,974
- Hey.
- Yeah? Yeah?

175
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:53,238
We should run into each other
on purpose sometime.

176
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,025
Uh...

177
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:00,681
I'm... I'm not really
dating... right now.

178
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,030
You know, global pandemic.

179
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,771
Who said I was
asking you out on a date?

180
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,775
Right. I was...
I was just trying...

181
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,298
No, I totally... I totally was.

182
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,691
Oh.

183
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,694
Now watch as I handle
the rejection gracefully.

184
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,173
Ah.

185
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,349
I'm gonna eat my pain
before it congeals.

186
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,481
Ew!

187
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,749
Wait, wait,
so, you just said it?

188
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:26,881
Just like that?

189
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,578
"Dad, I know you're gay."

190
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:29,710
No.

191
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,059
I added a Bible quote.

192
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,408
Seriously?

193
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,193
Yeah, I won the
Youth Bible Trivia competition

194
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,281
three years running.

195
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,632
I have a verse
for every occasion.

196
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,808
God! I just wish
I could do that.

197
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:43,071
Quote the Bible or tell your dad
you know he's gay?

198
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,203
Neither. I wish I could just...

199
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,989
Just say to my parents what
needs to be said, you know?

200
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,120
Same.

201
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,124
Pickles and old pistachios.
You shouldn't have.

202
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,083
- Mm.
- Andy went to get more.

203
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,825
Are we not good enough
for the meat and cheeses?

204
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,870
Don'ttouch that.

205
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:02,314
Carina will kill me, and then
you really willbe doing drills.

206
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,832
Ohhhh!

207
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,941
- Great work.
- I'm proud of it.

208
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,140
Wow!

209
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,707
You shook the soda.

210
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,056
What are you? 9?!

211
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,058
What? We got jokes, too, Cap!

212
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,147
Did you not have fun at 9?

213
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,281
Oh! We doing the wet-T-shirt
contest again? Sweet.

214
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:20,935
Your teammates think
they're funny.

215
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,521
They're congealed. Sorry.

216
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,547
Oh, yummy!

217
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,331
Oh, cute date, Miller.
What's her name?

218
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,464
Oh, you... you two.
You two get to name her.

219
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,771
Why?
'Cause this is
your housewarming gift.

220
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,207
You're welcome. - Oh! Thank you.

221
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,252
"You are un-bear-ably
beautiful."

222
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,907
"Love, Baba Agba and Iya Agba."

223
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,126
This is a gift for Pru,

224
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,041
and you can't give this away.

225
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,260
Uh, it is not a gift.
That's a Trojan horse.

226
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,611
It is a sweet,
cuddly olive branch.

227
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,917
Your parents are trying
to reconcile with you.

228
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,876
They cut me off completely.

229
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,549
Now they're trying to
worm their way back in my life

230
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,748
with stuffed animals.

231
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,184
Unh-unh. I don't trust it.

232
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,597
Dude, you're a grown man
with a job.

233
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,686
Can you stop saying your
parents cut you off, please?

234
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,276
- Wow.
- Wow.

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh, well, okay, what?

236
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,255
Are we not being honest
with each other anymore or...

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,368
Help me! Help me, please!

238
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,283
What? Help?

239
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,895
Help me! Help me!

240
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,723
Somebody, please!

241
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,289
Help me!

242
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,769
Ma'am. Ma'am.

243
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,312
What is it?
What happened? What happened?

244
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,120
My baby! My daughter!

245
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,404
The man in that house took her!

246
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,572
Look, I knocked on the door.
He slammed it in my face.

247
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,964
He's a big man,
so I need backup.

248
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,551
Okay, okay, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
what is your name?

249
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,726
What's your name? My name is Joyce.
My daughter is Jada.

250
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,273
Okay.

251
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,120
I need the men, too.
Are you gonna help me or not?!

252
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,537
We should call it in.

253
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,906
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
we want to help, but first,

254
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,385
can you start
by telling us what happened?

255
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,629
What happened ismy
daughter is in that house!

256
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,259
I need to get her out,
and I need your help!

257
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,980
Alright, Joyce, please!
Please, please.

258
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,373
We are firefighters, okay?

259
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,854
We can help, but we need
to get more information.

260
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,554
- Jada is 13 years old.
- Okay.

261
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,775
Her and her friend Shanice
...they had a sleepover last night.

262
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,386
And when I woke up, they weren't
in their beds this morning.

263
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,867
Now, I tried calling her,
but she didn't answer.

264
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,304
And her, um...
Her fitness thing, her...

265
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,219
The bracelet...
It has a tracker in it,

266
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,655
and it says that she's in here.

267
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,459
Alright,
what about her phone? Where is her phone?

268
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,180
No, I traced the phone
about an hour ago

269
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,704
to some address
down by the water.

270
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,053
Now I'm getting nothing!

271
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,552
So her phonemight have died, alright?

272
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,945
Or somebody might have thrown it
in the damn ocean!

273
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,511
- Alright, alright.-Alright,
so we call the police.

274
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:24,449
We'll call the police. - Uh-huh.

275
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,800
No, I called the police!

276
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,473
And they said they'd send
a car over to my house,

277
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,933
and they never showed up.

278
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,935
So I went to the station
and filed a report,

279
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,111
but they said it could take
days to get a warrant.

280
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,331
I had to come down here myself.

281
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:39,900
There have been three
Black girls have gone missing

282
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,163
from my neighborhood
in this last year,

283
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,295
and the police
have done nothing!

284
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,664
Police don't care
about Black girls!

285
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,995
We do. We do.

286
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,016
We got you, and we're staying
right here with you...

287
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,259
I don't need you to stay here!

288
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,348
I need you to knock down
the damn door!

289
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,393
Okay, Joyce, have you called Shanice's mom?

290
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,415
Where is she? I can't... I don't know.
I can't reach her.

291
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,025
Okay, is there a chance
that she's with her?

292
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,921
No, her fitness thing...
The tracker is...

293
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,726
They're right... Right, I know,
but is there a chance that she lost that?

294
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,622
Joyce, Joyce,
we're gonna tryShanice's mom again, okay?

295
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,276
And then we're gonnacall their friends.

296
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,254
We're gonna call all of them
andask them to check social media.

297
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,368
Alright? Girls keep
a lot of secrets at that age.

298
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,413
- No, t... t...
- Joyce. Joyce, Joyce.

299
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,261
It's gonna be alright.
We're gathering information.

300
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,784
And if we have to
knock that door down,

301
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,723
I promise you
I will do it my-damn-self.

302
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,420
I give you my word, okay?

303
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,684
We're just gathering
information.

304
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,598
Joyce... - Okay.

305
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:29,601
- Alright.
- Okay.

306
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,951
If you want to go back in... No.

307
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,169
I'm right here with you.

308
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,739
- Dean, come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

309
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,783
Yeah. - We got this.

310
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,986
Robert.

311
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,137
What are you still doing here?

312
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,510
I left my phone in the locker.

313
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,990
I...
Are you
pilfering party snacks?

314
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,229
The line at the grocery
storewas like three hours long.

315
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,776
Mm-hmm. Okay.

316
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,911
Let me hear that.

317
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,654
Yeah!

318
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,876
Yeah!

319
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,400
I had a great
meetingwith my sponsor this morning.

320
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:30,488
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,186
He told me to smile more.

322
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,536
Oh. I like your sponsor.

323
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,193
Oh, no, no. B-shift.

324
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,456
Yeah.

325
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,588
Hey, um, should we go to that party?

326
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,502
Mm-hmm.

327
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,808
Or could we...

328
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,244
- Robert.
- Mm-hmm?

329
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,811
- The rules.
- The rules? What rules?

330
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,160
We're at work.

331
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,466
No, we're off duty.

332
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,902
We're separated.

333
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:54,121
We're married.

334
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:02,520
Y-Yes. Thank you.

335
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,000
I feel powerless.

336
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,673
I tried calling Shanice.
Neither of them are answering.

337
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:06,873
And oddly naked.

338
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,527
What? I think I got some masks
in the car.

339
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:10,964
Call everyone.

340
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,096
Yeah, I hope you're right.

341
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,272
Alright,
call me if you hear anything.

342
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,100
Okay. Please.

343
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,320
I just want her home.

344
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,843
You're thinking about Pru,
aren't you?

345
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:25,108
It takes a village
to raise a child.

346
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,154
That'san old African proverb.Yeah.

347
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,242
No!

348
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,721
I'm raising a little girl
by myself.

349
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,332
She knows better!

350
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,813
Pru needs a village, and...
And I haven't gotten her one.

351
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,337
You have me. You have Gibson.
You got all of us at 19.

352
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,253
Y'all are family,
but you're not hers.

353
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,950
Well, that girl
is calling me Auntie Vic

354
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,386
whether you like it or not.

355
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,433
I need you to go to the house
and wait. Just wait.

356
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:46,845
My sister keeps
trying to play matchmaker

357
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:47,957
between me and my parents.

358
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,350
Mm.

359
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,308
All that's doing
is making me madder at them,

360
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,788
which makes me push her away.

361
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,009
It's...

362
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,707
Miller, if you want
to build a village for Pru,

363
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,970
you need to start inviting
other people to live in it.

364
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,451
And whatever you think
of your parents or your sister,

365
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,061
they're yours.

366
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,236
They made you.

367
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,630
And you're one of
my favorite people.

368
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,850
Call everyone.

369
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,655
I can't... I can't
keep watching this, okay?

370
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,092
I say we go in
and we knock on the door.

371
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,987
O-Okay, yeah, alright,
and say what?

372
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,486
And tell him to give back
the girls he kidnapped.

373
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,575
Miller, Miller, when I was 14,
I climbed out of my window

374
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,036
and I went dancing at a rave,

375
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,491
and my purse was stolen within
like the first 10 minutes.

376
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,082
We cannot knock
on someone's door

377
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,431
and accuse them of kidnapping

378
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:28,844
without at least
making a few phone calls, right?

379
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,217
We can't. We can't.

380
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,089
I know.

381
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,747
Okay, come on. - Okay.

382
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,054
I've never seen a kid put away
so many grilled cheeses.

383
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,596
He was trying
to keep up with you.

384
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,406
Now he'll sleep for two hours.

385
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,537
Oops!

386
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,669
Sorry.

387
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,105
I'm butterfingers.

388
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,239
So, uh, Dr. Bailey said

389
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,936
that Marsha's sats
are looking better.

390
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,372
We heard.

391
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,548
Marcus was so happy,
he even did his homework.

392
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,161
I offered that kid a dollar
for every prime number

393
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,293
he could name, 1 through 50,

394
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,166
and, uh, he cleaned me out in
10 minutes, the little hustler.

395
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,256
I bet he had them memorized.

396
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,735
- He definitely does.
- Ah!

397
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,611
You know...

398
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,094
you don't have to
sleep on the couch.

399
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,311
You work crazy hours.

400
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,075
I'm sure you could use
a good night's sleep.

401
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,493
No. I'd feel awkward
sleeping in Marsha's bed.

402
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,887
You can... sleep in mybed.

403
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,193
I mean...

404
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,064
I can sleep on the couch.

405
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,982
You work long hours, too,
you know?

406
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,418
Not like youdo.

407
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,597
It does get cold
sleeping in the living room.

408
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,729
My room's warm.

409
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,168
Yeah?

410
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,842
Where's Mom?

411
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,539
The hospital.

412
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,715
She... She felt like it was
important to keep working.

413
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,282
You know, I mean, you know Mom.

414
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,981
She always tends to feel things
on a slight delay.

415
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,332
This is wrong.

416
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,029
I-I know. I'm so sorry.

417
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,509
I...

418
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,206
Grandma shouldn't be dead.

419
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,208
This isn't fair.

420
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:35,124
And she shouldn't
have to die like that.

421
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,344
Alone.

422
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,607
She should be here with us.
- I-I know.

423
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,825
No, you don'tknow!

424
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,523
And... And why isn't Mom here?

425
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,327
She should be the one telling
me. You're right. You're right.

426
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,981
But she's going through
her own grief process, son.

427
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,615
I... - I'm not your son!

428
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,500
Sharon, I'm sorry. Sharon, I...

429
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,459
Found these in my trunk.

430
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,741
The granola bars are expired,
but the masks are still good.

431
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,723
Joyce, how'd it go?

432
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,464
How do you think it went?!

433
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,137
When I told her that our babies
weren't in their beds

434
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,336
when I woke up this morning

435
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,922
and now I tracked them
to a strange house

436
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,036
in a strange neighborhood,
how do you think it went?

437
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,776
No one knows where they are.

438
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,951
No one knows anything!

439
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,214
Alright. I'm knocking.

440
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,780
- Wait. Miller?
- Wait.

441
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,086
- Miller.
- Joyce.

442
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,348
- Nope.
- Slow down.

443
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,089
- Jada!
- We can't...

444
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,612
- Jada!
- Hello!

445
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:30,701
Open up! Open up!

446
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,181
- Jada!
- Hello! Hello!

447
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:35,097
- Whoa, whoa! What the hell?!
- Where is my daughter?!

448
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,075
We have reason to believe
that there are two teenage girls

449
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,448
somewhere
in or around this house.

450
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,470
My daughter is here.
I traced her to this location!

451
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,887
Your tracking is as wrong
as youare.

452
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,020
Hey! Get out of my doorway!
- Joyce!

453
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,911
Sir, if you wouldn't mind
us just taking a quick look
around your property...

454
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,763
Keep her away from my door.

455
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,591
Sir, we're with
the Seattle Fire Department,

456
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,090
so if you... Yeah? Where's your truck?

457
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,594
Where are your uniforms?

458
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,180
We are off duty, sir,
but I assure you...

459
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:57,226
So I'm supposed to let you
people just walk into my house

460
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,513
because you say
you're firefighters?

461
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,255
Get the hell out of here
before I call the police!

462
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,039
- No! Jada!
- Please, can we just...

463
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,564
- Jada! Jada!
- Joyce. Joyce! We'll get her.

464
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,131
Okay?

465
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,528
He won't even talk to Joey,
let alone talk to me.

466
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,792
I've been in that boy's life
for what? Like 10 years?

467
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,881
I-I-I helped him learn
how to read.

468
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,013
I-I told him
where babies come from.

469
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,537
And, look,
I-I know he has a dad.

470
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,688
Tuck Sr.'s a big part
of his life.

471
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,061
I would never
try to replace him.

472
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,498
But...

473
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,413
that hurt, Roz.

474
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,589
You weren't that much older
than Tuck when Mom passed.

475
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,852
Remember what you saidto Pops?
No.

476
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,028
You said, "Now the only person
that ever loved me

477
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,726
in this family is gone."

478
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,902
I said that?

479
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,121
See? You don't even remember.

480
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,513
That's horrible.

481
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,949
You didn't mean it.

482
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,430
But you were angry,
and you lashed out,

483
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:51,042
and Dad was as hurt
as you are right now.

484
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:53,175
But you want to know
what he did?

485
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,267
He made you spaghetti.

486
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,095
'Cause that's what dads do.

487
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,315
They put aside
their own big pain

488
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,317
so the kids can feel safe
to have theirs.

489
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,494
Okay.

490
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,060
Okay, yeah.

491
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,192
Let's make spaghetti.

492
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,638
What just happened?

493
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:24,293
Ooh, you already forgot?
I can do this all over again.

494
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:29,211
Robert, we're having sex
on the floor of your old office.

495
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,797
And I think this might be
some of the best work

496
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:31,909
I've ever done in here.

497
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,520
Well, didn't your sponsor say...

498
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,827
My sponsor said that...

499
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,917
if you don't make me
want to crave drugs,

500
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,790
there's no reason
why we should be apart.

501
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,925
Well, then...
I already did forget.

502
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,458
That was...

503
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,763
Yeah.

504
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,287
Yeah. - Um...

505
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,897
I-I don't

506
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,657
usually do that
with my son in the next room.

507
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,987
No, we were quiet.

508
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,075
Well, yeah.

509
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,165
Also, he's deaf.

510
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,645
Yeah.

511
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,688
Yeah.

512
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,825
You were supposed to
go to a party.

513
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,740
I don't want your friends to...

514
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,350
Y-You should go.

515
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,483
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,152
Do you, um...

517
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,067
you want to come?

518
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,765
Marcus.

519
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:48,464
Oh. Yeah. 'Cause...
we're gonna be drinking.

520
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,508
Yeah.

521
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,904
- Listen, uh...
- Nope.

522
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,689
Let's not talk about it yet.

523
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,081
I'm afraid if we talk about it,

524
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,519
one of us will say
something to ruin it, and...

525
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,304
I'd like to keep feeling
this way a little while longer.

526
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,359
Hello?

527
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,630
Ew.

528
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,153
Is anyone here?

529
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,331
I swear to God,
if you jump out at me...

530
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,812
- Where is she?!
- We don't know right now!

531
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,294
Where's my daughter?!

532
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,341
Where is she?
- Sharon, I'm sorry. I tried...

533
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,777
No, no, no. Youdid this.

534
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,451
Sharon, Sharon,
this is not Joyce's fault.

535
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,191
- Who the hell are you?
- We're firefighters.

536
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,565
We're helping Joyce. - Whoa!

537
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,654
For the love of God,
do something! Get our girls!

538
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,371
- What is going on here?
- Okay, I'd like to introduce

539
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:52,485
our captain and lieutenant.
- We need to get in that house.

540
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:53,486
These ladies think
their daughters are
in that house.

541
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,835
- Against their will?
- Yes.

542
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,750
We do not have confirmation
on that quite yet.

543
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,360
- Have we called the cops?
- They did,

544
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:59,796
and we're way past that.

545
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,494
Okay, Miller, we're not on duty.

546
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,799
Okay.

547
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,061
I think I smell a gas leak.

548
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,019
- Oh, damn.
- Miller, hold on.

549
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,237
- Wait.
- No, no, no. Dean.

550
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:07,935
Miller, Miller,
we don't operate that way.

551
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,304
Yeah, except
when you needed to get Inara

552
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,503
away from her husband, right?

553
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,374
When he was using her
as a punching bag?

554
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,724
Dude, what's the difference
between then and now, Gibson?

555
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,398
What's the difference?
We have to call it in, Miller.

556
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,249
We will call the police,
and they will come.

557
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,034
If the man in that house
took our daughters,

558
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,228
what do you think
he's doing to them

559
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,558
while we stand out here
and talk?

560
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,159
That's a lot of garlic.

561
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,533
Mnh-mnh.

562
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,641
It's got to be strong enough
that his desire for food

563
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:45,189
overrides his anger at me.

564
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,105
It's not you
he's angry with, Ben.

565
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,759
He's angry with the world.

566
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,414
His grandmother just died from
a virus that shouldn't have ev...

567
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:58,246
Look, these kids are smart.
This generation is savvy.

568
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,466
They know that this pandemic
is a political football,

569
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,206
they know
that it was mismanaged,

570
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,773
and they know
what it's costing them.

571
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:04,968
And don't even get them started

572
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,552
on the state
that we left the planet in.

573
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:10,824
These kids are pissed,
and they have every right to be.

574
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,524
Look, he may be locked
in his room right now,

575
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,459
but the Tuck that I spent
the last couple of weeks with

576
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,920
does not want to carry this
on his own.

577
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,009
Not like youdid.

578
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,576
Like I did?

579
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,665
Yeah, you shut down
and shut out everybody

580
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,927
when Mom died.

581
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,320
You were selfish
with your grief.

582
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,342
You carried it on your own,
and I had to carry mine.

583
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,150
Okay, well, my grief
wasmy own, alright?

584
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,804
You have no idea
what I went through.

585
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,327
That's exactly my point.

586
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:40,070
Okay, you know what?
That was 20 years ago, Roz.

587
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,570
Look, this isn't about
you and me. It's about...

588
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,509
It's about your kid.

589
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,511
Stepson or not,
he's still your kid,

590
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,687
no matter how mad he gets.

591
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,297
He may not know it yet,

592
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,865
but he needs to talk
about his feelings,

593
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,867
workshop them, you know?

594
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,172
Like his auntie did.

595
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,962
Okay, when did you
get smarter than me?

596
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,268
About two minutes
after I was born.

597
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,618
Ohh.

598
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,661
You kidding me?

599
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,251
No. We called the police,
and they still haven't come.

600
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:14,583
I know, I know. I just want her home. Yes,
we've been waiting.

601
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,715
Are you okay?

602
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,368
I don't know how those mothers

603
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,781
aren't sending a grenade
into that house!

604
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,546
I know. I know.

605
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,437
You need to calm down before
you get yourself thrown in jail.

606
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,003
Why are we the ones
who always got to calm down?

607
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,333
You know why.

608
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,528
I'm not saying
you can't be upset,

609
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,205
but you're drawing attention.

610
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,748
Dude, do you know
how many Black girls are missing

611
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,252
in this country right now?

612
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,080
70,000.

613
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:36,649
40% of all sex-trafficking
victims are Black girls.

614
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,956
50% of Black girls experience
some kind of sexual exploitation

615
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,524
before they're 18, dude.

616
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:43,960
Is that true? Both: Yes.

617
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,527
And after Pru was born,

618
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,573
all I did was research
those numbers, Jack.

619
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,791
That's all I did.

620
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,445
And I know them by heart.

621
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,752
He's raising a Black girl,
and I grew up one.

622
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,710
So, yeah, yeah, it's true.

623
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:56,558
Even when I was 10 years old
and I was walking home

624
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,540
from school by myself,
I was so scared.

625
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,411
I knew that if I disappeared...

626
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,283
If I disappeared, the police

627
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:04,130
wouldn't even waste a tank
of gas coming to look for me.

628
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,305
I could have been
either one of those girls.

629
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,853
So, yeah.

630
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,657
I mean, that's exactly the
reason why we need to just...

631
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,465
We need to stay calm

632
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,008
and we need to gather
all the information,

633
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:14,152
and we need to get these women
their girls back, okay?

634
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,038
And if anything
ever happens to Pru,

635
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:20,041
I'll be the first person
to throw a grenade, okay?

636
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,303
Here comes PD.

637
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,567
Then it's their scene.

638
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,916
This should go well.

639
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,309
Officers! Officers!

640
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:29,571
My daughter is in that house!

641
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,573
- Okay.
- My daughter is in there!

642
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,508
I'm Captain Maya Bishop, SFD.
I'm the one that called you.

643
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,161
No, no, no. We got a call
from the homeowner.

644
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,536
He claimed that there was
a woman creating a disturbance.

645
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,383
- This is a waste of time!
- Okay, this woman believes

646
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,167
that her daughter was abducted
and is in this house.

647
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,324
We're just asking you
to check it out.

648
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,954
Ma'am, what makes you think
your daughter's in there?

649
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,782
We don't have time for this.
You people need to step aside...

650
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,871
How about a little professional
courtesy?...and let us do our job.

651
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,027
Listen, we're not gonna
barge into someone's home

652
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:53,595
because some unbalanced woman
can't keep her tabs on her kid.

653
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,771
- Are you kidding?
- Now step aside.

654
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Do you smell that now?

655
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,734
I do. I smell it.

656
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,605
Yeah, yeah, I smell it, too.

657
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,476
- Could be a gas leak.
- Check it out, Gibson.

658
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,523
- Yeah.
- Like hell. This is my scene.

659
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,588
Sure. It's your scene.
I don't care about jurisdiction.

660
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,483
We're dealing with
a possible gas leak here.

661
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,852
I'm gonna call it in
to my station,

662
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,245
and if we're right,
I'm gonna need you

663
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,750
to secure this area...
Simple as that.

664
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,883
We need backup at 10th Avenue
and Newland, please...

665
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:21,971
Immediately.

666
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,717
Seattle Fire Department.

667
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,719
We're investigating
a possible gas leak.

668
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,741
Snyder, are you gonna get
these people out of here or not?

669
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,157
That man took our daughters!

670
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,203
I don't know a damn thing
about any daughters!

671
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:37,876
- Where are our girls?!
- Hey, your kid probably ran away

672
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,640
to get away from you!

673
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,163
Get off my property!

674
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,383
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, ma'am, ma'am, listen.

675
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,579
If you want to file
a missing-persons report,
you can come with me.

676
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,126
No, I'm not going anywhere!

677
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,104
My daughter is in that house,
and I have to get her out!

678
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,149
I understand... Would you please
just do your jobs?!

679
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,436
Ma'am, you need to calm... down.

680
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,525
She absolutely does not
need to calm down!

681
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:56,658
- Whoa!
- Over here!

682
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,617
Stay back, stay back!

683
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,270
That is more than a gas leak.

684
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,354
This is our scene now. 19!

685
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:10,324
Gibson, call it in.
Hughes, uh, power and electric.

686
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,388
Jada?! Montgomery,
get some water on it.

687
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,066
Ma'am, stand back.
Calm... calm down!

688
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:14,173
Take it easy! Take it easy!

689
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,068
You're obstructing the scene.

690
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:16,460
That house is on fire,

691
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:17,612
and their crying is
what you're worried about?!

692
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,160
What the hell is going on?!

693
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,466
Hey. What's going on?

694
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,903
What's going on?

695
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:26,055
Two girls are being held captive
in that burning house.

696
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,515
- What?
- I need gloves!

697
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,666
- Here, got 'em!
- This woman believes

698
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,928
that her daughter's
in the house.

699
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:31,867
We have no proof yet.
- If we wait for proof,

700
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:33,410
those girls could die.
- Did you call it in?

701
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,871
19's on a fire downtown.
88 is 7 minutes away.

702
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:37,849
7 minutes is too long. I'm not waiting.
I'm going in.

703
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,789
- We don't have gear.
- I am not waiting. I'm going in.

704
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,984
- Miller!
- I'm going in, too.

705
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,618
- Miller!
- Robert! No! No!

706
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,683
Stay close. You don't want
to get separated in there.

707
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,361
Hey, I know how to do my job!

708
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,377
No dice, huh?

709
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,726
Mnh-mnh.

710
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,901
Auntie Roz make this?

711
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,686
No. Idid.

712
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,165
What?

713
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,732
You don't have to look
so surprised.

714
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:11,970
I just didn't know you cooked.

715
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,082
Well, I do.

716
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,781
Are youokay?

717
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,959
Oh. This is actually good.

718
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,351
Okay, you're fine.

719
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,528
Look, I-I didn't know...

720
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,750
...Miranda's mom, but...

721
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,665
she sounded nice.

722
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,840
She was.

723
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,538
She... She was really nice.

724
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:37,063
I don't think Tuck's
ever lost anyone before.

725
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,762
I don't think so, either.

726
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,808
But, um...

727
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:43,678
but youhave.

728
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,288
I mean...

729
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:49,945
You've lost lots of people.

730
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,773
Right?

731
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,558
In fact, your foster siblings...
They, um...

732
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,909
are they safe through all this?

733
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,085
Yeah. I mean, they're in homes.

734
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:02,088
It just sucks we're separated.

735
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,480
Well, I'll tell you what.

736
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,787
When this is all over,
we'll have them to the house.

737
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,310
Yeah. We'll have a barbecue.

738
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:09,965
Yeah.

739
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,538
I smelled spaghetti.

740
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,194
Auntie Roz make that?

741
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,152
Why does no one
have faith in my cooking?

742
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,898
You want something
to wash that down with?

743
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,074
Ooh! Yeah.

744
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,380
'Cause it's garlicky as hell.

745
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,228
Okay, I'm gonna
let the language slide

746
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,558
'cause, you know, you're upset.

747
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:39,951
I'm sorry.

748
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,739
About... what I said.

749
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,175
It's okay.

750
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,612
You want a bowl, maybe a chair?

751
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,536
Yeah. Or are you just gonna
stand there all day?

752
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,444
Jada!

753
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,843
Somebody help them!

754
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,325
Shanice?!

755
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,023
Seattle Fire Department!
We're coming to get you!

756
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,071
Help!

757
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:14,247
We're gonna...
We're gonna get you out.

758
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,596
Here. Can you reach this?

759
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:18,904
We got it! We got it!

760
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,341
Copy.

761
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:24,170
We're trapped!
Please, can anybody hear us?!

762
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:27,521
- Help!
- Jada! Shanice!

763
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,655
Shanice! Jada!

764
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,048
Can you see the girls?

765
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,182
I can't see them!

766
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,748
We're gonna die in here! Please!

767
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,141
I-I hear them.

768
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,013
- Somebody help!

769
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,753
I think they're behind the wall!

770
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,845
Hey. Miller says
he can hear them.

771
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,064
- Oh, my God.
- What?! What did he say?

772
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:50,370
He said he could hear voices.

773
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:51,458
They're lying!

774
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,068
My baby's in there!

775
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:55,854
- There are girls in there!
- Hello?! Aren't you the police?

776
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,378
- Do something!
- Hey! Listen to me.

777
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,988
If anybody is trapped
in that house,

778
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,400
they are going to die,
and if that happens,

779
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,513
I will move
Heaven and Earth to make sure

780
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,969
you stand trial for murder.
- Okay, back it up, missy.

781
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,231
Just tell us
where they're at, Bob.

782
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,095
Kidnapping charges are
a lot nicer than murder.

783
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,959
Jada!

784
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,355
Help!

785
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,617
Jada!

786
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,358
I see her!

787
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:23,446
I-I see!

788
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,629
We're right here!

789
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,022
Can you hear us?!

790
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,509
Alright, Shanice, Jada,
stand back!

791
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,728
We're gonna kick the door!

792
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,772
Shanice!

793
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,690
Jada!

794
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,387
Shanice! Jada!

795
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,346
Shanice!

796
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:54,869
Shanice!

797
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,574
There's not gonna be
a funeral, is there?

798
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,448
Not with COVID.

799
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,973
Things didn't have to be
this bad.

800
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,975
No. It didn't.

801
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,021
But there are
a lot of really smart doctors

802
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,239
working to fight this thing.

803
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:18,738
Yeah, and a lot
of really ignorant people

804
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:19,720
who won't listen to them.

805
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,200
Yeah.

806
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,028
That's one of the reasons
I'm angry.

807
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:28,424
You and Mom see people die
all the time.

808
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:29,251
Mm-hmm.

809
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,426
How do you deal with it?

810
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,692
Faith.

811
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,087
That's it?

812
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,176
Faith?

813
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,744
I see people on the worst days
of their lives.

814
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,528
You know,
their house is on fire.

815
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:47,139
They... They had a heart attack.

816
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,837
A child is hurt or dying.

817
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,234
One, two...

818
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,845
three!

819
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:02,806
You can actually feel
the weight of their despair.

820
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,641
More often than I like to admit,

821
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,382
we can only do damage control.

822
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,538
But sometimes,

823
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:41,889
we're the answer
to their prayers.

824
00:33:58,645 --> 00:33:59,994
Jada?

825
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:14,139
When that happens...

826
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,184
we can do more than save a life.

827
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:17,857
We can restore someone's faith.

828
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:22,103
And that strengthens mine.

829
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,720
Need some oxygen now!

830
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:14,503
How we're all gonna
get through this thing...

831
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,591
We show up.

832
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:17,115
We do our part.

833
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,726
We make each other stronger.

834
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,470
She'll need treatment
for smoke inhalation,
but nothing seems broken.

835
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,143
- Oh, baby girl.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

836
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,908
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

837
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,432
We were... We were posting dumb
pictures on Instagram and stuff

838
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,826
when we started getting DMs
from this girl.

839
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,524
She said she was an influencer.

840
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:37,483
She said that if we met her
for pizza,

841
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:38,808
she would teach us
how to make a bunch of money

842
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:41,226
from our posts and...

843
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:45,708
when we went to go meet her,
she wasn't there.

844
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,189
That's when this guy dragged us
into a van, and...

845
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,340
It's not your fault, Shanice.

846
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,322
Do you hear me?

847
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,802
It is. We started the fire.

848
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,458
We heard people yelling outside,
and we... we thought

849
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,678
maybe you'd find us,
but then the yelling stopped,

850
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:03,596
and... and we thought
no one was looking for us.

851
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,904
So... So Jada had the idea
to light the fire, and...

852
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,515
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

853
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:12,474
You don't have to tell us
any more right now. Okay?

854
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm so sorry.

855
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,525
It's okay. It's okay.

856
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,968
Just so we're very, very clear,
those girls are your victims.

857
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,559
I let you do your job,
you let me do mine.

858
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,318
You good?

859
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:31,537
Yeah, I'm good.

860
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,018
Ooh! You have a burn
on your arm.

861
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,019
We should take a look at that.

862
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,283
Yeah, it's just a blister.

863
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,850
I'll take care of it
after the fire's out.

864
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:41,982
Thanks for caring.

865
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,376
Just looking after my probie.

866
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:51,339
Was there any, um...
penetration?

867
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,317
What is the matter with you?! I'm sorry,
ma'am, but I have to ask...

868
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,256
You don't have to ask it
like that.

869
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,518
Okay.

870
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,086
Jada, we need to ask you
a personal question.

871
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,261
Do you want some privacy?

872
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,132
No.

873
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,439
I just want to stay with my mom.

874
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:05,701
Okay.

875
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,529
Did he hurt you?

876
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,617
Did he touch you?

877
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,271
No.

878
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,969
He didn't even talk to us after
he locked us up down there.

879
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,102
Wait, wait.
You think he would have...

880
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,278
No, no.

881
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,517
Miss, I'm sorry, but I have to
ask a few more questions.

882
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,717
- About what?!
- Just give us a moment.

883
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,304
What the hell
do you need to ask my daughter,

884
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,068
who has just been through hell
about?!

885
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:27,636
Your daughter just started
a fire. Is this really the time?

886
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,050
Seriously, Schneider, can't we just... Those
girls broke into my house and set fire to it!

887
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:35,122
I want them arrested
for trespassing and arson!

888
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,385
- She was kidnapped!
- So they say.

889
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,169
These kids lie all the time.

890
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,563
You son of a... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't, don't, don't.

891
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:44,087
Ma'am, you are under arrest
for assaulting a police officer.

892
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,698
- What?!
- She didn't!

893
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,048
Hey, we're right here! We can see
she didn't do anything!

894
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,137
Come on! Let go of me!

895
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,356
Stop resisting! Let go of me!

896
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,748
Mommy!

897
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,229
No, Jada! Ma'am. Stop resisting.

898
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,926
No, no.
Jada, Jada, baby, I'm okay!

899
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,319
Baby, I'm... - Take it easy!

900
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,060
Take it easy, man!
What's wrong with you?!

901
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,627
- Miller! Miller!
- Dean!

902
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,237
- Get off of him!
- You need to back up, too.

903
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,926
- Get off of him!
- You, too. Stop, stop.

904
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,058
He's a hero!
He just saved those people!

905
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,236
Hey! Hey!

906
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,041
That's it! Freeze!

907
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:50,676
- No, no, no!
- Robert!

908
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,243
Get your hands in the air! Now!

909
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,595
Robert, please.

910
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,988
Please.

911
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,599
Officer?

912
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,731
Officer, please,
this is my team.

913
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:03,950
You coming with us, too?

914
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:06,169
What... On what charges?

915
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,650
Obstruction of justice.
Breaking and entering.

916
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:09,869
Are you kidding?!

917
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,828
What are you...
What are you doing?!

918
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,092
Oh, my God.

919
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,442
They're firefighters!
Let's go of them!

920
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,319
Let them go!

921
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:40,873

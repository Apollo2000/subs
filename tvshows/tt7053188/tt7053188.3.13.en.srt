1
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:10,834
Dad!

2
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,336
Dad?

3
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:43,489
You okay?

4
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,093
You got to sleep.

5
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,207
Whatever Warren gave me,

6
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,911
it... it gives me crazy dreams.

7
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,480
Oh.

8
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,748
Come here.

9
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,519
Crazy dreams are better than
not sleeping for three days.

10
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:08,093
You have to go back to work.

11
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:11,450
You need to have Maya's back.

12
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:16,101
The only thing that's
okay in any of this

13
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:20,647
is that he went out his way.

14
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,898
Dixon doesn't get
to make that a bad thing.

15
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:29,198
Okay.

16
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:31,949
I'll go.

17
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:43,272
Oh, good, hi.

18
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,091
Uh, who wants to be July
and who wants to be August?

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,216
Hi. Back up a thought or two?

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,987
Uh, the department is refusing
Pruitt his Line of Duty funeral.

21
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,221
It's a huge honor.

22
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,523
Entire department usually comes together,

23
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,992
but Chief Dixon is saying
he was a civilian

24
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,565
when he died, which is
a giant load of crap,

25
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,901
because he was a hero.

26
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,736
Okay, now fast forward a thought or two?

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,371
Uh, so we're making a calendar.

28
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,644
Last firefighter calendar raised
more than enough money

29
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,678
for a Line of Duty funeral.

30
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:08,547
- No, no, no, no!
- Oh, c-come on!

31
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,864
You got the body. You may as
well make some money from it.

32
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,951
Yeah, I, um... I heard it,
and that sounded bad.

33
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,002
I'm so...

34
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,331
Hey... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,532
This has been happening all week.

36
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,434
- I...
- Hey, there's nothing to apologize for.

37
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,037
He sounded like a really great captain.

38
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:33,675
Um, my first day on the job, first call

39
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,382
There was this woman who threw
her poop out the window.

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,251
- What?
- Yeah, and, uh, she had gone number two

41
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,553
in her new boyfriend's house,

42
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,356
and when she went to flush the toilet,

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,124
it, uh... it was clogged.

44
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,759
So, she... You know, of course she didn't

45
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,579
want him to see the poop because...

46
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:49,948
- Because romance.
- Right.

47
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:52,817
So she just threw her poop
out the window.

48
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,021
Only the window was, like,
a double window thing.

49
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,155
So it... it just, like... pbht!

50
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,390
- Splattered there.
- Mm.

51
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:00,558
- Ohh, God.
- You know?

52
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,659
And then she had to clean it up,
so she climbed out

53
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:04,242
the first window and she got stuck.

54
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,411
- Yeah, with the poop.
- With the poop.

55
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,679
With the poop.

56
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:10,011
And she had to call for help,
but she didn't have her phone.

57
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,347
So she had to call for the boyfriend.

58
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,315
- Ohh, I'm so embarrassed for her.
- Mm.

59
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,983
Oh, yeah, I was, too. I couldn't, um...

60
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:16,151
Ugh.

61
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,609
Yeah, I could barely make
eye contact, but...

62
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,560
But Pruitt, he just, um...

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,346
He looked her in the eye.

64
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,110
You know, and he calmed her down.

65
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,120
And then he cut through
the glass, and he got her out.

66
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,277
And then he helped clean

67
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,328
the poop up off the window.

68
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,718
You're right.

69
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,454
The man deserves a hero's funeral.

70
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:51,359
Yeah, then, um, at the end
of my shift, he, uh...

71
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,902
he said it was... he was glad
it was my first call.

72
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,571
Because I'd never forget that this job,

73
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:59,373
it's not just about
the superhero crap, you know?

74
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,876
I-It's about...

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,043
Actual crap?

76
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:06,403
No, it... it's about empathy.

77
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,221
It's about treating every member
of our community

78
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:15,923
like a member of our family.

79
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,629
So will you be my Mister July?

80
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,897
- Ohh.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,866
Breakfast fairy is here!

82
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,402
Whoa! Marsha, what's this?

83
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,317
Oh. I know you fellas
are going through a lot,

84
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:34,773
and I know the only things
that help me through pain

85
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,743
are time and donuts.

86
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,211
Amen.

87
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,179
Ah! Hey.

88
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,547
Hey, Marsh.

89
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,514
Oh!

90
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:43,116
I second that, and yes, please.

91
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,351
I will take a glazed and a jelly.

92
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,686
- Ahh.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,255
You know, Marsha, you're not a bad lady.

94
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,456
Fooled ya.

95
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,361
Did Jack ever tell you
Pruitt saved my life?

96
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:54,362
No, he did not.

97
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:56,665
Well, he saved my cat, Chairman Meow,

98
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,633
who was my life back then.

99
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,860
Little guy got himself
caught on the roof,

100
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,102
you know, tangled up in
the damn satellite dish wires.

101
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,140
Captain Pruitt climbed up there
and got him down.

102
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,532
Never teased me or anything.

103
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,713
He was a real class act.

104
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,081
Yeah.

105
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,271
And good with cats.

106
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,138
Quick, donut me.

107
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,494
Aww, geez.

108
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,191
- Magical happiness treat?
- No.

109
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,027
You know, the photographer
is charging way too much,

110
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,729
so I pulled this bad boy
out of the closet.

111
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,698
Uh, photographer for...?

112
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:38,900
For the Funeral Fundraiser calendar.

113
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,501
Y... Okay, my friends
from the community theater

114
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,837
brought over a box of costumes,
so pick a month.

115
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:46,372
Oh. Um, okay, I'll do Janu-never.

116
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,916
Okay, March it is.

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,184
Montgomery? Are you almost ready?

118
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,652
I'm not ever gonna be ready for this.

119
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:52,454
Well, Miller needs to change,
so if you could just

120
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,455
come out of there already, please?

121
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,323
Uh, no, he doesn't. I am busy.

122
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:56,791
I'm drawing up my will.

123
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,584
Luckily for me, I don't own anything

124
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,721
but a houseboat and a lot of T-shirts.

125
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:02,822
Dibs on that houseboat!

126
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,598
Pru gets the houseboat!

127
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,416
The question is who... who gets Pru.

128
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,632
Oh, so... No.

129
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,667
You know I love her. I just... I've spent

130
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,503
my entire reproductive life
obsessively avoiding

131
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,095
the whole single-mother thing
one condom at a time,

132
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,213
so you don't... you don't get to just die

133
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:22,648
- and thrust that upon me.
- Yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:25,351
Also, don't... don't die.

135
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,488
I'd offer to take Pru,
but after you've seen this...

136
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,590
I can't imagine you'd say yes.

137
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm gonna need some context here.

138
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,833
Okay, I feel like a piece of meat.

139
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,136
Do it for Pruitt, man.

140
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,971
Keep... Keep laughing, Gibson!

141
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,205
You're next.

142
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,509
Gas leak at 6912 Bryn Mawr Court.

143
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,310
Bryn Mawr Court? That's like
the third time this week.

144
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,093
Darn it. Photoshoot cancelled.

145
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,596
No, no, no. You stay, you stay.

146
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,931
Your co...

147
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,266
Your country needs you.

148
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,523
And on top of keeping the Station open

149
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,059
to the community all week,

150
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,528
we also have a boot in reception
for donations.

151
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,785
Thank you, Bishop.

152
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,168
How's she doing?

153
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,591
Sir. Due respect.

154
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,660
I know you two are together.
Andy's my best friend.

155
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,252
So she told you.

156
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,587
She didn't have to.

157
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,122
Well, she's sleeping right now,

158
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,923
so that feels like progress.

159
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,304
You know, she's, uh, told me
several times to leave her,

160
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,006
to be there for you in your hearing.

161
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,607
Thank you, but I don't need any backup.

162
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:30,743
I stand by every call I made.

163
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,644
You stand by her.

164
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:34,711
I plan to.

165
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,609
Won't your gajillionaire parents

166
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,977
raise Pru if you kick it?

167
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,345
Yeah, but that's why it's imperative

168
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,147
that I put in writing
that I don't want them to.

169
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,549
Then what do you want for her?

170
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,678
I don't want her
to be judged by her looks

171
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,897
or her income, but by her passion,

172
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,922
you know, how good a friend she is,

173
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,020
how much she laughs during the day.

174
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:05,195
Basically, I want her
to be raised by parents

175
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,397
- that are not my parents.
- Huh.

176
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,665
I was gonna say I could take her,

177
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,099
but I can only teach her dominoes

178
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,202
and how to cook grilled cheese.

179
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,137
Okay, so no.

180
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,907
We received a call about a gas leak.

181
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,910
A gas leak? No, no, that wasn't us.

182
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,074
Well, we'll need you to exit
the home just so we can check.

183
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,277
Guys, really,
I appreciate all your concern,

184
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:26,345
but we don't have a gas leak.

185
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,413
We received three calls from this address

186
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,115
this week about a gas leak.

187
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,397
Now, either there's a problem
that you don't know about

188
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,399
that will kill you
and your family in their sleep,

189
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:36,000
or you're pranking the fire department,

190
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,335
which is punishable by law.

191
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,803
Which do you want it to be?

192
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,855
I'm so sorry. You're right, you're right.

193
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,123
Come on in. Inara!

194
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,591
Honey, the fire department's
here... again.

195
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:49,571
_

196
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,134
_

197
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,006
Okay, Marcus, buddy, let's
listen to the nice fireman.

198
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,113
You have a kid that doesn't hear

199
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:03,548
and you haven't learned sign language?

200
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,830
He's my new stepson, and I'm really old.

201
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,555
I'm trying to learn, I-I swear.

202
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,335
Why don't you hang out on the porch

203
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,946
and I'll just check them for hypoxia?

204
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,582
- Okay.
- Alright.

205
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,823
This place is kinda dark, huh?

206
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:27,393
When my dad talked me
into going to the academy,

207
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,263
part of the sales pitch
was that firefighters

208
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:31,799
are the friendliest guys.

209
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:33,434
You know, it's a cheerful job.

210
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,602
Our former captain
just died saving our lives.

211
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,704
So I think we earned a little darkness.

212
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,597
Yeah. Uh, no, no, I-I know.

213
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,132
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

214
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,900
I just had this idea
that firefighters are,

215
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:45,636
like, the happy heroes, you know?

216
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,980
And then on my first day, someone OD'd,

217
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,917
and then Rigo died,

218
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,618
and now this really nice old dude

219
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:55,121
sacrificed his whole damn life
so that I could live.

220
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,824
Which is, just...
I mean, I'm super grateful.

221
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,258
It's just...

222
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:00,793
Who OD'd?

223
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,813
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

224
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:12,939
Come on down. And stop! Stop, there.

225
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:14,162
- Right here?
- Perfect.

226
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,309
- Hat off.
- Hat off?

227
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,311
Yeah, like... like it's fun. Like...

228
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,080
No, like... like Yankee Doodle.

229
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:20,414
- Like I'm throwing it away?
- Look like you like this.

230
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,817
- Taxpayer dollars hard at work.
- Come on.

231
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:25,419
Let me guess: Bishop had you do
this fundraiser

232
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:27,855
the same day as her hearing
to garner sympathy?

233
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,924
I don't think anyone was looking
for sympathy, sir,

234
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,660
just a clearly deserved
Line of Duty funeral.

235
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,395
How is that coming, by the way?

236
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,897
He was a retired firefighter,
wasn't on duty,

237
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,132
and he certainly wasn't authorized

238
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:39,330
to be at that incident.

239
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:42,870
But it's no secret that this station

240
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,573
has been through a lot in the past year.

241
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,342
So I do have some good news
I'd like to share with you all.

242
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:51,679
I would like all of Station 19
to join me and my family

243
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,614
three weeks from tonight
at our country club

244
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:57,718
to celebrate the engagement
of Emmett and Alicia.

245
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,208
I'm proud of you, son.

246
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,723
Congratulations, probie.

247
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,858
Uh, yeah, thanks.

248
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:05,259
Now tell me who OD'd.

249
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,428
Uh...

250
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,654
Hey, I just gotta 10-100 real quick.

251
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,833
I didn't want you to find out like this.

252
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,982
- I do love her.
- Uh-huh.

253
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:29,130
But...

254
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:32,987
...I think I love you, too.

255
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,023
Emmett, you don't love me or her. Okay?

256
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,592
If you loved either one of us,
you wouldn't have proposed.

257
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,142
No, I didn't. She proposed to me.

258
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,301
You know, Emmett, when you try
to hide your poop from people,

259
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,651
you just end up getting stuck
in the window...

260
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,661
with your poop.

261
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:59,335
Your stepdad... does he get, you
know, really mad sometimes?

262
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:03,206
No?

263
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,953
What's your name?

264
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,354
Inara?

265
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,689
Yeah.

266
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,458
Did you call in the gas leak?

267
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:13,160
Yes, I... I smelled some gas.

268
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,730
Well, guess what.

269
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:18,199
He turned on the burners again.

270
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,333
I'm sure he didn't mean to.

271
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,403
Sweetheart, he's not stupid, he's deaf.

272
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:24,739
I... I think he needs a good talking to.

273
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:27,007
Hey, sir, do you mind waiting over there?

274
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,777
I'll check you for hypoxia
as soon as I'm done with them.

275
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,545
It's just a little gas.

276
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,247
Your... Your partner's opening
the windows. We'll all live.

277
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:36,117
Sir, we're the fire department,
and we'll be the judge of that.

278
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,551
How about you just sit over there

279
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,154
and don't go back into the home
until we tell you it's okay?

280
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,286
Okay?

281
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,512
Okay.

282
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,997
At what point did you authorize
the civilian

283
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,132
to use the ladder truck?

284
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,300
I did not authorize it...
and, sir, please stop

285
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,202
calling Captain Herrera a civilian.

286
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:58,205
Except he is. Or was.

287
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:00,107
He was a Fire Captain,
a Seattle Firefighter

288
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,208
of over thirty years,

289
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,576
he knew what he was doing.

290
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,814
Dad?

291
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,221
Dad?

292
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,823
Papi?

293
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,796
You promised you'd tuck me in.

294
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,839
Papi?

295
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,634
Papi?

296
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,937
Mm. Papi.

297
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,457
What, did you fall in?

298
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,981
- Oh, sorry, I just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:52,993
Who OD'd?

300
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,296
Uh, it was a patient.

301
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,964
I-I misspoke.

302
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,863
Well, did you misspeak,
or was it a patient?

303
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:00,670
Probie, I swear to God,
I'm gonna throw you off this...

304
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:03,070
- Help!
- Hello?

305
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:04,271
Can someone help us?

306
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:05,328
Up here.

307
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:09,574
Oh, my God, this is so bad.

308
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,177
- I know.
- I'm mortified.

309
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,945
Can you help us?

310
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,281
Um, yeah.
Yeah, uh, just stay right there.

311
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,849
We're coming down.

312
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,772
And that's when we broke through
horizontally.

313
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,874
Which has been done to great effect in...

314
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:29,066
fourteen Seattle fires
in the past five years.

315
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,002
But if you tried
and failed venting the roof...

316
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,570
the first attempt with Montgomery...

317
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,472
why did you think
you'd succeed with Herrera?

318
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,341
I wasn't going to sacrifice Montgomery

319
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,609
or any other members of my team.

320
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,279
But you were prepared
to sacrifice Herrera?

321
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:45,372
I was not prepared
to sacrifice him, no, sir.

322
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:48,610
But he was not going
to take no for an answer.

323
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,778
Okay, so you're admitting
that you knowingly

324
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:53,381
let a civilian go into a critical scene

325
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,221
- and put his life in danger.
- No, sir.

326
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,224
I knowingly allowed a lauded and
unanimously respected captain

327
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:01,627
go into a critical scene
that was certain death.

328
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,563
Bishop, pull yourself together.

329
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,634
Don't make me regret
endorsing a woman for captain.

330
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,605
My former captain knowingly
sliced through a roof

331
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:15,815
and fell to his death
to save my entire team.

332
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,445
These are tears of gratitude
and tears of amazement

333
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:22,948
and wonder and I will not
apologize for having them.

334
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,342
You think I didn't cry when
I won the gold medal? I did.

335
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:29,314
You watch 250-pound athletes
cry when they win Super Bowls,

336
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,449
and it doesn't make them any less heroes.

337
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,052
You are asking me to relive a day

338
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:37,188
that my hero died and my team lived.

339
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:40,392
I will not apologize
for having feelings about that.

340
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,801
The ability to care while doing
my job is a quality

341
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,503
Captain Herrera both modeled and lauded.

342
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,305
My ability to care while doing my job

343
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,507
is what makes me superior, not inferior,

344
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,930
to those who can't.

345
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:56,507
Well, crying won't keep you
from getting transferred

346
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,710
to pushing paper behind a desk.

347
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:08,808
I don't know what you're talking about.

348
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:16,767
_

349
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:20,474
_

350
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:23,373
_

351
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:27,904
_

352
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:33,117
_

353
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:36,954
_

354
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,515
Have you called the police?

355
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:49,392
_

356
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,263
_

357
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,243
He locked me in the closet
for eleven hours that night.

358
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:10,466
_

359
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,908
_

360
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:19,605
Here.

361
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:21,566
Hey.

362
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,309
The burners were cranked up,
the pilot light was out.

363
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,992
He thinks the kid did it.

364
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,550
The kid did.

365
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,432
Stepdad's hitting his mom.

366
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,468
Want to call PD?

367
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,771
Well, they've been here before.
It just makes it worse.

368
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,441
I keep thinking about Captain Pruitt

369
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,485
choosing to go up on that roof.

370
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,120
He wasn't a perfect man.

371
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,389
Who is?

372
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,025
But he was truly a good man.

373
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,543
Saved our lives.

374
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,434
And I just really want to be...

375
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,616
The kid called us for help.

376
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,985
We need to find a way to help them.

377
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,312
Okay. How?

378
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,988
I don't know. Just, uh...

379
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:10,925
Just buy me some time.

380
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,250
Hmm?

381
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:16,027
Yeah, we... we were studying.
It w... It was a science thing.

382
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,262
Mm. And, um, you know...

383
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:18,430
Can you not call our parents?

384
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:20,665
My dad's a cop. These are his.

385
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:25,037
He'll kill me if he finds out
I was using them for... homework.

386
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,712
Yeah. Uh, well, you know what?

387
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:29,686
- That, uh... That depends.
- On what?

388
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:32,845
Well, if we can get them
off without amputating.

389
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,614
I mean, your parents are gonna
want to know about that.

390
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:36,271
- Amputating?
- Yeah.

391
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,385
I'm messing with you. I'm sorry.

392
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,821
Are you allowed to do that?

394
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,222
Oh, it's half the fun of the job.

395
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,791
Hey, probie, why don't you
get the bolt cutters?

396
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,218
I-Is there any way to, like,
pick the lock or something?

397
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,854
You know, 'cause...
'cause my dad, he really...

398
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:49,988
Whoa! What?

399
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

400
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,724
Probie, get a turnout. She's seizing.

401
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,037
Maya.

402
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,167
I can't find a way out.

403
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,768
I'm trapped.

404
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,171
I've got 5% left on my tank.

405
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,594
5%?

406
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,643
What was it like for you growing up,

407
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,913
losing your mother and knowing
your father could die in a fire?

408
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,975
You grew up.

409
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,644
Joined the same firehouse as your father,

410
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,713
and now you're married to...

411
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,848
Andrea, you're a big girl now.

412
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,241
You don't need a daddy.

413
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,668
Hey.

414
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,228
Hey...

415
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,057
Thank you.

416
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,025
When I was a kid...

417
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,829
...my dad used to do this thing
when I was sad.

418
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,160
He would open all the blinds
and let all the light in

419
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:32,799
and say, "Casa brillantes,
corazones brillantes."

420
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,290
"Bright house, bright hearts."

421
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:35,739
Bright hearts.

422
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,460
He was so good at...

423
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,264
at pulling me back.

424
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:09,040
There's a still alarm in the barn!

425
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,347
A still alarm!

426
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:11,415
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

427
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,382
What's happening to her?

428
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,417
Make sure she stays on her side

429
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:14,451
to keep her airway clear.

430
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,275
Do not stick your fingers in her mouth.

431
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,289
Okay, her jaw is locked.

432
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:20,657
- What is that?
- Midazolam.

433
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,625
What is that for?

434
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:22,693
It's for seizures.

435
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:23,827
Warren, where do you need us?

436
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,195
Hughes, Montgomery, grab the PRT gurney

437
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,730
so we can prep for transport.

438
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:29,255
We're good here, Captain.
You can go back to your meeting.

439
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,810
What's your name?

440
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,645
- Tamil.
- Tamil, has she done this before?

441
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,997
No. N-Never.

442
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:37,499
Does she take any meds? I-I-I don't know.

443
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:39,001
Do you know her parents' phone number?

444
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,370
- Unfortunately, no.
- Do you know her name?

445
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,272
Of course I know her name. I love her.

446
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,862
It's Dara Agate.

447
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,665
You love her but you don't know
if she takes any meds.

448
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,867
Second dose isn't working.
We got to get her on the gurney.

449
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,603
Need a board.

450
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,508
Everything okay?

451
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,193
Somebody come in with a pencil
stuck in their eye?

452
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,969
Warren's handling it, sir.

453
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:03,142
Look, I know Pruitt Herrera
was hard-headed,

454
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,978
and he probably
wouldn't have listened to you,

455
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,948
even if you tried to stop him.

456
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,356
But the fact is you let him
go up that ladder and he died.

457
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:13,392
And that's public record.

458
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,288
Someone has to answer for that.

459
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,479
Your Battalion Chief abandoned
his post and ran into a fire,

460
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:25,581
sir, and you know that.

461
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:26,715
But you're not investigating Sullivan

462
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,586
because that would reflect badly on you

463
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,586
because you appointed him.

464
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,627
That storage unit was a nightmare.

465
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,095
It was a maze not up to code.

466
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,580
Our whole team was trapped in there.

467
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,284
They were dying,
and Captain Herrera saved them.

468
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:40,719
The only villain in this story is you,

469
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,788
for denying his Line of Duty funeral.

470
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,758
So I'd be happy to face
the music or face the press

471
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,460
or whatever you order me to do.

472
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,463
Or, sir, you could
just order me back to work

473
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:54,433
and stop wasting all of our time.

474
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,574
Oh, good.

475
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,942
You're done.

476
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,861
Let's go.

477
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,863
Come on!

478
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,721
Do this.

479
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:27,700
And do this.

480
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,511
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, good.

481
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,559
One more.

482
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:32,727
Okay, just one more.

483
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:33,882
- Could we do one more?
- Perfect.

484
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:34,849
- If you...
- Yeah, let's just do one more.

485
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:35,850
- Thanks.
- Got it.

486
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:36,985
Great, now, uh...

487
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,052
Is this really necessary?

488
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:40,054
Yes. You're, uh... You're doing great.

489
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,489
- Great.
- You are, just...

490
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:42,924
How you doing back there, Inara?

491
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:44,659
Don't be hogging up all the oxygen.

492
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:47,429
Such big lungs for such a tiny person.

493
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:50,195
You don't want the firemen to run out!

494
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,898
Uh, firefighter.

495
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,540
Excuse me?

496
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:55,735
Firefighters.

497
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,738
Firemen is very 1955 of you.

498
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,473
Firefighters.

499
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,791
Didn't know that.

500
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,727
Yeah, you learned something today.

501
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,237
You deserve a happy life.

502
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,041
And don't get me started on methane.

503
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:09,641
You both do.

504
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,075
You know what? Um...

505
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,633
You deserve someone
better than you're getting.

506
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,547
- You were born to this one life.
- And, uh...

507
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,986
Your child was born into this one life.

508
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,688
You don't deserve to be hit.

509
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,957
You don't deserve to be scared.

510
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,692
You deserve better.

511
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,462
Let me help you find it.

512
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:32,730
Now stand on one foot.

513
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:34,532
Can you watch him for a few minutes?

514
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,793
I, um... need to pack a bag.

515
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,546
Yeah.

516
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:47,178
So, anyway, the worst CO
poisoning that I ever saw?

517
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:52,942
Man, it... it was,
um... two parents, three kids,

518
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,179
two cats, a grandparent,

519
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,448
and a big old golden retriever.

520
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,659
- Where do you think they're going?
-

521
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,962
At the departure gates,

522
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,531
people are saying sad goodbyes,

523
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,299
waving at the planes,

524
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,677
overwhelmed they'll never see them again.

525
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:30,888
But, across the sky,
at the arrival gates,

526
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,818
other loved ones are waiting
for them to land,

527
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:40,057
waving hello,
so happy to greet them home.

528
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,325
Mm.

529
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,911
It's okay.

530
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,938
I never wanted to live without you.

531
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,107
- You don't.
-

532
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,235
Ryan?

533
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:17,059
You're back.

534
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:21,063
Andy, it's me. Robert.

535
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,511
- Robert?
-

536
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:28,513
Robert Sullivan.

537
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:31,182
Your Battalion Chief.

538
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:32,991
And husband.

539
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:35,854
You're still here.

540
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,722
Yeah, I'm still here.

541
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,140
Mm.

542
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:45,222
- Did Ted see me?
- No, I don't think so.

543
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:46,990
- Can you help me hide this?
- Yeah.

544
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:50,027
There are still trace
amounts of natural gas.

545
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:53,096
You'll probably be fine,
but your wife and kid,

546
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,272
they'll have to stay
somewhere else for a few days.

547
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:55,632
Somewhere else? No, no, no, no.

548
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,067
We... We... We have to stay together.

549
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:04,708
As a man, you are more prone
to self... filtering.

550
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,250
- What?
- You will be fine

551
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:07,461
with trace amounts of gas.

552
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,512
- No.
- But...

553
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,447
No, no. What is it with you firefighters?

554
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:13,050
Don't you have a-a-actual
fires to be fighting?

555
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,519
Why do you have to come to
my home and start this crap...

556
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,925
Shut up.

557
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:26,296
What is that arm doing?

558
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,077
You...

559
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,254
Can't... Can't use that.

560
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:30,522
I don't really know what I'm...

561
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:31,890
- This is... This is not...
- No, no, no, no, you look...

562
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,492
- This is just not my thing.
- You look great.

563
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:35,294
You look... You're doing just great.

564
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,829
Give the camera some love.

565
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,230
You know, sparkle motion.

566
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:40,467
Hot action. Hot action.

567
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,236
Just got to whip it in.

568
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,505
All right, well, you... you know.
You... You got it.

569
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,539
This is only for the department, right?

570
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,607
No civilians are gonna see this?

571
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,644
- Well, you look amazing!
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,412
And you should want
the whole city to see it.

573
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,681
Vic, if I weren't afraid that my
boob would pop out right now,

574
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,682
I would come over there
and kick your ass.

575
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,117
Maya, what you need to do probably

576
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,585
is explore the space a little bit.

577
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,686
- How? How?
- Use the props.

578
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,854
Maybe, um...

579
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,622
And also, your hands.

580
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,424
- What about my hands?
- Why do they do this?

581
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,592
Well, where am I supposed to put them?

582
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,227
If you can't make them sexy,
then hide them.

583
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,595
Maybe it's this.

584
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,186
Maybe you don't know, and you...

585
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,034
No. Wait, stop.

586
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,802
I'm not gonna kick your ass.

587
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,079
I'm...

588
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,442
I'm just so...

589
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,322
I am so sad.

590
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,186
I am just so, so sad.

591
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,492
And I am so mad.

592
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,716
Ladder 19 and Aid Car 19

593
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,619
requested to 6912 Bryn Mawr Court.

594
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,087
That's where Gibson and Miller are.

595
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,965
Can't you do something?
Isn't this thing an OR?

596
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,831
She's in status. If it continues,
she doesn't need surgery,

597
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,701
she needs to be paralyzed and sedated.

598
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:24,299
Plus, we need to get used
to not having the PRT,

599
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,701
because I'm pretty sure that
once you answer my question,

600
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:27,769
it'll get shut down.

601
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,271
Oh, my God, Dara.

602
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:32,674
- Dara?
- Okay, coming up.

603
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,410
Hey, Dara. Hey. Hey

604
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,312
Hey, I'm Dr. Ben Warren.

605
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:40,971
Uh... are you okay?

606
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,038
Dara, do you have epilepsy?

607
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:48,687
Dara, where's your medical ID?

608
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:50,456
And she's never
mentioned having epilepsy?

609
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,912
No.

610
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,416
She's embarrassed.

611
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:01,899
Dara, when you're with Tamil,
do you take off your bracelet

612
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:03,233
because you don't want him to think

613
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:04,786
there's anything wrong with you?

614
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,792
Yeah?

615
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,139
Are you serious?

616
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,680
Dara, baby, you can tell me anything.

617
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:15,183
A medical condition is not embarrassing.

618
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:19,220
The athlete's foot I've been
hiding from you is embarrassing.

619
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:20,955
Why do you think I always
keep my socks on

620
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,387
when we're...

621
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,526
studying?

622
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,285
I love you.

623
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,377
Don't ever do that to me again, okay?

624
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,900
Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?

625
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,268
- Ted, stop, you're hurting him.
- Ow.

626
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,470
I'm not hurting him,
I'm checking for burn marks!

627
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,096
He was with me the whole time,
he wasn't inside!

628
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,365
Oh, really? Is that true, Marcus?

629
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,568
You weren't inside, maybe
starting a little bit of a fire?

630
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,303
Take your hands off him.

631
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,004
Stove top gas leak, we ventilated,

632
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:55,172
but the bedroom combusted.

633
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:56,574
Hughes, inside with Gibson.

634
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,943
Cutler, I want another hose line
on that window.

635
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,044
- Montgomery?
- Yeah.

636
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,312
Check on the family.

637
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:03,314
Family? Family's fine. Thanks.

638
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,549
They are not fine. Do not leave
him alone with them.

639
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:21,268
I want a thorough overhaul
and cause investigation

640
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,205
- before you clear out.
- Nice.

641
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,540
That oughta keep 'em out
for a week or two.

642
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,242
Keep who out?

643
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:29,199
That jerk's wife and kid.

644
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,175
What did you do, Marcus?

645
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,711
- Stop yelling at him.
- I am not yelling,

646
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:36,680
I'm talking loudly so he can hear me!

647
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,048
Okay, okay, that's enough, guys.

648
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:39,149
Is there a problem, sir?

649
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,484
Oh, hi. This isn't a fire.

650
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:41,652
This is a private family matter,

651
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,020
so why don't you back the hell up?

652
00:31:43,044 --> 00:31:44,821
Sir, I'm Captain Maya Bishop,
let's take a walk.

653
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:46,189
No, I don't want to take a walk.

654
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:48,011
Why don't you put the fire out

655
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,981
in my house that one
of your fireman started?!

656
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,749
The fire is contained, sir.

657
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:53,073
- That who started?
- I don't know,

658
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:54,219
the one who looks like every high school

659
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:56,662
football star who ever failed
one of my classes!

660
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,165
He's the one who started this fire!

661
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,866
Captain Bishop... my husband.

662
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,468
He gets confused. He's not well.

663
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,070
I'm sorry, what?

664
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,137
- What did you just say?
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, no.

665
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,272
I need you to back up right now.

666
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:06,996
What? I would like to hear
what you just said!

667
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,675
- Back up right now, sir.
- Okay, let's walk it off.

668
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:09,943
I'm not well?!

669
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:13,281
Gibson. Did you start that fire?

670
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,783
No.

671
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,085
No, there must have been
a candle going or something.

672
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,589
But I swear I might have
if I'd thought of it.

673
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:24,059
This kid... all he has is his mom,

674
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,662
and the husband's beating her.

675
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:29,097
He has to watch that every day.

676
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:32,534
If she can't get out, why not help her?

677
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,219
Okay, so what's the plan?

678
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,535
Put the kid and the wife in the aid car,

679
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,370
tell the husband
we're taking them to Grey-Sloan.

680
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,572
Okay, where are we really taking them?

681
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,141
I think I have a friend
they can stay with.

682
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,142
All right.

683
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,778
Montgomery's on the aid car.
He'll get it.

684
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,946
Thank you.

685
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,045
I never had a dad,
never mind one like yours.

686
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,958
I never had a mom. So...

687
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,526
People are wired different.

688
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,052
Eva. Your mom.

689
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,506
They made mistakes.

690
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,375
They didn't mean to hurt anybody.

691
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,510
My mom died.

692
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,521
Your dad is not a bad guy.

693
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:23,252
You are not a bad guy, Jack.

694
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:26,021
But my wiring's messed up.

695
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,190
Probably on account of my childhood.

696
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,259
You're not dead, are you?

697
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:31,427
No.

698
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,087
Then why are you here?

699
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,656
Andy, we're orphans.

700
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,152
Mami?

701
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,884
Mami?

702
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,313
I'm an orphan.

703
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,398
I'm an orphan.

704
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:10,991
Me too.

705
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:14,820
What?

706
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:18,039
Uh, why didn't I know this?

707
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,228
I don't talk about it.

708
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,864
Plane crash.

709
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,590
Oh, my God.

710
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:28,392
What... That...

711
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,615
How old were you?

712
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:33,603
Um...

713
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,506
sixteen.

714
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,609
And then you got married.

715
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,436
And your wife died.

716
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:41,872
And then your friend Ripley died.

717
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,090
We're all we have.

718
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:08,248
Okay, I-I was sixteen
when I lost my virginity,

719
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,787
so I know teenagers have sex,
but... with handcuffs?

720
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,823
These kids were
the same age as my foster kid,

721
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,191
not that much older than Tuck,

722
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,551
but they're already
experimenting... with bondage.

723
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,209
All right, probie, I know
you're new, but, uh, look,

724
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,545
this... this can't have been
the worst thing you've seen.

725
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,280
Oh, that's right, you, uh...

726
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:34,032
you saw your Battalion Chief OD
on fentanyl.

727
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,820
So it was him.

728
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:42,958
Did you see the syringe?

729
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,595
You give him Naloxone?

730
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,162
Yeah.

731
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:53,259
W-What'd he even say to you?

732
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,689
Well, he, uh

733
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,791
He said he had a prescription.

734
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:03,029
And he said that this station
runs on trust.

735
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,139
And if people don't trust each other,

736
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,374
then people get hurt.

737
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,510
That's, uh...

738
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,145
That's... That's a good one
coming from him.

739
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,486
So he doesn't have a prescription?

740
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,360
Fentanyl prescriptions
are not injectable, all right?

741
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,829
They come in patches or lollipops.

742
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,768
And now I have to turn in
my Battalion Chief.

743
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:35,778
- Hey.
- Hello.

744
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,013
Hi, honey.

745
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:40,216
Marsha, this is Travis Montgomery.

746
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,384
Hi. Hi.

747
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:44,523
And this is, uh, Marcus and Inara.

748
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:45,658
Hi.

749
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:48,561
This is Marsha.

750
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,300
She's the best.

751
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,435
Thank you so much for having us.

752
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,970
Are you sure it's not too much?

753
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,471
Oh, goodness, I live for this.

754
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:55,873
I ordered pizza.

755
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,775
Hope you like Hawaiian.

756
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,035
I'm kidding. Pineapple on a pizza?

757
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,670
I'm not that crazy.

758
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,633
Thank you.

759
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:12,216
_

760
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,464
_

761
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:20,255
_

762
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,992
_

763
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,863
_

764
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:32,709
_

765
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:35,219
_

766
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:36,437
_

767
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,832
You did a good thing here, Gibson.

768
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,453
Captain Herrera would be proud.

769
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:02,111
Hey, Warren, um, can I ask you something?

770
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,312
Yeah.

771
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:05,114
I've been putting a will together.

772
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:09,718
And since I'm Pru's only parent,
if I die, then...

773
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:11,387
- Yeah.
- You know, Pru...

774
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:12,982
So...

775
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,446
Will you and Miranda take my baby?

776
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,892
You two are the best parents that I know.

777
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:24,128
Oh.

778
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:26,230
I... I'd be honored, man.

779
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,264
- My guy.
-

780
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:30,434
Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

781
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,458
Hey, Warren, you like Fall, right?

782
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,161
- What?
- You like Fall.

783
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:36,796
October?

784
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,864
Ohh.

785
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:38,931
November?

786
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:40,333
You can be a sexy turkey costume?

787
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:42,602
Do it for Pruitt, man.

788
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,304
Do it for Pruitt. Do... You are...

789
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:45,694
I'm gay.

790
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:52,145
Oh, um...

791
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,513
...yeah.

792
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:57,784
S-So, look, I know, uh, you guys
don't all know me that well,

793
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,823
and what you do know
is that my dad's the Chief,

794
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:03,449
and I just got engaged to a woman,

795
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,428
but this station runs on trust,

796
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:09,765
and I don't want to be
the person hiding her epilepsy

797
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,780
or the woman who... who got stuck

798
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:13,502
in the window with her poop.

799
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,462
So, I'm gay.

800
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:19,416
And I-I want to say
that "I'm a proud gay man,"

801
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,653
but... I don't think I'm there yet.

802
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:26,139
But I am a... a gay man.

803
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:31,136
That's cool. But you should probably tell

804
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,271
whats her face before you marry her.

805
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:33,539
- Yeah.
- T-That's what I was thinking.

806
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:35,241
- Probably.
- Really.

807
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:38,010
There isn't a club,
but if there was, welcome.

808
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,778
What Club?

809
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:41,647
Seattle Fire Queers.

810
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,182
I'm only half gay, but it counts.

811
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,618
- Okay.
- It does count.

812
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:46,951
Chili?

813
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:50,222
- I'm proud of you.
- Yeah, I am, too. I'm proud of you, too.

814
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,991
But I do... I need you
to pick a month, okay?

815
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,626
I need you all to pick a month.

816
00:40:01,758 --> 00:40:04,103
Hey!

817
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:07,039
We are alive because of Pruitt Herrera!

818
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,184
Emmett got to live long enough

819
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,560
to come out because of Pruitt Herrera.

820
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:18,326
We get to laugh and... and... and clap

821
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,495
and make chili because of Pruitt Herrera.

822
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,565
We get to breathe!

823
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,699
We get to live! Okay?

824
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,569
We all get to live
because of Pruitt Herrera.

825
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,977
So pick a damn month!

826
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,245
- October.
- Okay!

827
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,281
- Oil me up.
- Thank you. Jesus.

828
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,315
- I'm doing it for Pruitt.
- Okay.

829
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,401
- November.
- Thank you.

830
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,285
Oh, hell. You know what?
You know what? December.

831
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,569
- There it is.
- Just call me sexy Santa.

832
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,322
- Let's do this.
- Whoa!

833
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,891
Can we... Can we not... Can we
not do this in the beanery?

834
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:51,959
- Well...
- You know what?

835
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,260
- That's probably...
- There's... There...

836
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,929
- There is food here.
- All right, all right.

837
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,664
- There's food here.
- Thank you, thank you.

838
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,332
Now. Let's go. Let's go, sexy Santa.

839
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,300
Get out of here.

840
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,543
Okay. Do we need to buy props?

841
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,170
- Have fun.
- No, I have them all.

842
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,068
They have no idea.

843
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:06,265
None.

844
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:38,621
If you see a fire, put it out.

845
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:41,061
And then, move on to the next one.

846
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,461
Whatever you do, don't stick around
once the fire is out.

847
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,003
There is no life to be lived

848
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:49,407
in the ashes.

849
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,133
Let them blow away.

850
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:00,226
Good night Daddy.

851
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,403
Good night Andrea.

852
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:08,919
Good bye, Daddy.

853
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:13,376
See you later.

out of everyone

953
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,526
by demanding nothing less.

954
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:55,196
He was a natural leader,

955
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,907
as anyone who's ever
worked with him knows.

956
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,590
He built great firefighters,
future Captains.

957
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,166
Maybe even future Chiefs.

958
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,670
But beyond that, he was
the best father he could be,

959
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,174
and that wasn't easy to do,
especially on his own.

960
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,595
My dad was faced with
some pretty terrible choices

961
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,639
when I was a kid.

962
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,767
But he did what he thought
was best for me at the time.

963
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,144
Every time.

964
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:31,732
He chose to protect me
above all else.

965
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:37,530
And while he may have
made mistakes...

966
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,157
I have no doubt
he'd make them all again

967
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,784
if he thought
it was best for me.

968
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,911
It wasn't easy growing up
without my mom

969
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,372
and without siblings,

970
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,001
but what I've come to realize
is my dad did his best

971
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,752
to give me family.

972
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,380
He created a home at Station 19.

973
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,550
And everyone under his roof
was his kid.

974
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,677
[LAUGHS]

975
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,096
So he may have spent years

976
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,807
protecting me from pain
and burying his own,

977
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,812
but he did his best to give me
the gift of a group of people

978
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:14,609
who I feel closer to than
any blood brother or sister.

979
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,862
He did his best.

980
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,448
He did his best by me.

981
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,408
He loved me.

982
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,410
He stayed.

983
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,246
He stayed with me
every minute he could

984
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,334
until he had to leave me
to save me one last time.

I told you
you were crazy.

I need to focus
on my recovery.

1000
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,717
I spoke to Dr. Shepherd,
and she suggested I, uh...

1001
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,523
take some space.

1008
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,113
I knew that,
and I-I was barely sober.

00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,615
And you... you were
about to lose your dad.

We had no business
getting married.

1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,806
Previously on Station 19.

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:04,413
I don't have some fear of
fire, don't be ridiculous.

3
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:06,753
- That I want more.
- I still do.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,386
I saw Jack shirt

5
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,779
on the ground outside
the captain's bedroom.

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:11,726
I know.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,603
For the past few months,
we've been seeing each other.

8
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:15,737
Is one of you gonna leave?

9
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,672
No, because we broke up.

10
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:19,174
You are getting sicker.

11
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,810
What the hell are you doing here?

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,384
Have you ever noticed

13
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,353
that you never see
firefighters working alone?

14
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:32,954
So, I have some news.

15
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,789
Something good?

16
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:38,026
Work in sync, work in pairs.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,261
Trust your partner.

18
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,231
Yeah. I got offered a job in New York.

19
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,967
And I'm thinking about taking it.

20
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,534
I don't know.

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,971
It just feels like there's a
professional ceiling in Seattle,

22
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,942
but when in New York, you
know, the sky's the limit.

23
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,944
That way, you never get left all alone.

24
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,480
There could be other reasons
to stay in Seattle.

25
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,717
I thought you'd be a little
bit excited for me, Piper.

26
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,052
Sorry.

27
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,221
I am. I'm just surprised.

28
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,089
That's great.

29
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,457
- You'll love it.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,665
But, Finley, I...

31
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,802
Something should do something
about those damn potholes!

32
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,938
Alone leaves you vulnerable.

33
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,506
Alone leaves you exposed.

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,251
And while, at first,
that might not seem like

35
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,143
that big a deal...

36
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:32,013
if it happens often enough...

37
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,949
it's bound to catch up to you.

38
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:37,352
So, you just ran.
From Ryan's front porch.

39
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:39,187
- Like a stalker.
- Not a stalker.

40
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:42,157
A person who thought she knew
what she wanted to say,

41
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,002
but at the last minute
changed her mind too late

42
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,427
because doorbell,

43
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:47,680
so I hid in the bushes and said nothing

44
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:50,298
and just... watched him go back inside.

45
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,933
Like a stalker.

46
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:55,036
Look, my dad'll want
to eat cheese steaks today

47
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,204
with everyone else.

48
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,139
Don't let him. Make him eat this.

49
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,308
Okay, I don't know if I can
make your dad do anything.

50
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,376
Guilt him, then.

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,454
Tell him I spent my whole morning

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,488
making him a healthy lunch

53
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:05,880
when I should have been
focusing on my test today.

54
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,649
Which we both know you have in the bag.

55
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:09,184
You already aced the written exam.

56
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:11,386
Today is gonna be a piece of cake.

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,222
Today will be the hardest
thing you've ever attempted.

58
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,124
- In your life.
- Morning.

59
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,493
This is for you.
Maya's gonna give you a ride.

60
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:22,230
I am perfectly capable of
feeding and driving myself.

61
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:24,332
You know what this test
is called, correct?

62
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,067
The Incinerator!

63
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,070
Because it can burn you alive. Literally.

64
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,072
And figuratively.

65
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,041
It's designed to test every single aspect

66
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,309
it takes to be captain.

67
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,311
I know, Dad. I know.

68
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:39,214
Do you know, the day I took
the test, somebody died?

69
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,082
This is not a chaste little drill.

70
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,885
It's a real fire in a real building.

71
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,487
They call it a controlled burn,

72
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,690
but fire isn't something that
any of us can really control.

73
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:50,068
The only way to get through this test

74
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,659
is to show it who's boss.

75
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:53,695
Luckily, I boss very well.

76
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:54,805
Eat.

77
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,097
That's probably Jack.

78
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,332
Jack?

79
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,701
Yes, Jack.

80
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:01,369
We're carpooling to the test.

81
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,071
Curious choice.

82
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,108
Just because we broke up
doesn't mean we can't sit

83
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,631
in a car together for 20 stupid minutes.

84
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:16,051
- Good luck!
- Suerte!

85
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,588
You're not Jack.

86
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:21,923
I am not.

87
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:24,726
I brought you a good-luck charm.

88
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,127
What?

89
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,229
I haven't seen this in years!

90
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,142
Because the last time
we passed it back and forth

91
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,267
was the morning I tested
for the police academy.

92
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,369
- Yeah.
- Worked. I got in.

93
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:35,614
I remember handing this thing off

94
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:37,872
in the halls at school, during finals.

95
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,908
And pretty much any time
we got in after curfew.

96
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,410
I-I think you brought it
to me in juvie once.

97
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,312
And you, you slipped it into my pocket

98
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,181
before I got on the plane to New York.

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,050
To bring my dad home.

100
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,421
See?

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,390
Works every time.

102
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,794
Ryan, I wanted to talk to you.

103
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,129
Morning.

104
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,269
I was just dropping by
to wish Andy luck today.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,406
How neighborly of you.

106
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,175
Well.

107
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,411
Um, we should go.

108
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:30,811

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,634
Andy and Jack left Montgomery in charge?

110
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,803
Well, he's got seniority.

111
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,441
You are looking sharp, Montgomery.

112
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,810
Bishop, can you check the bottles...

113
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,489
and make sure
that they're all topped off?

114
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:51,880
Miller.

115
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:53,681
Are we all stocked up
on cleaning supplies?

116
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,184
Did you get your uniform
professionally pressed?

117
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:59,320
Also, I'd like
a complete list of inventory

118
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:00,555
on my desk by 11:00.

119
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,056
You did.

120
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,192
You starched your collar.

121
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,794
You know this is only
for one shift, right?

122
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:07,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,131
Hey, so, I was looking at
the new vehicle assignments.

124
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,401
Yes. A finely honed balance.

125
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,236
Each individual assignment

126
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:18,973
carefully, purposefully selected.

127
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:22,010
Right. So, I was thinking that, um,

128
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:25,380
since you're acting captain,
don't you want to be on truck?

129
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:26,748
Instead of Aid Car?

130
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,312
The captain should be on truck, right?

131
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,886
- Right. Yes, you're right.
- Yeah.

132
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,388
- Yeah.
- I should be on the truck.

133
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,190
- Duh.
- Thanks. Thank you.

134
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,225
- Of course.
- Can you do Aid Car?

135
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,435
Whatever you want.

136
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,061
- Right. Thanks.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,177
I told Maya and my dad that
you and I could get along.

138
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,679
That we weren't children

139
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,281
who have to give each other
the silent treatment.

140
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:07,388
So let's not give each other
the silent treatment, okay?

141
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,957
Especially not today, of all days.

142
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,268
I think it's best if we just stay out

143
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,492
of each other's way today.

144
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,263
Do what we're there to do.

145
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,133
Keep our distance.

146
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,470
Jack, when one of us is named captain,

147
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:25,940
we have to figure out how to get along.

148
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,996
Yup.

149
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,579
But not today.

150
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,789
Morning, Gibson.

151
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,458
Herrera, you're late.

152
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:47,395
Are... Are all these people
testing for captain, too?

153
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,464
I thought there'd be five or six, tops.

154
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,432
Grab a spot, Herrera.

155
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:59,140
Is that the fire chief?

156
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,279
Didn't know he'd be here.

157
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:07,282
Great. Because, otherwise,
today was gonna be too easy.

158
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,952
You are the candidates with
the highest written exam scores.

159
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:14,322
And today you'll put
all that theory into practice

160
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,658
by each of you leading a group of four

161
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,926
through a call inside the warehouse.

162
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,828
The goal is to extinguish a fire

163
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:24,365
and rescue a 200-pound dummy
as quickly as possible.

164
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,434
And these rankings will follow you

165
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,369
throughout your application process.

166
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:33,441
If you are unable to retrieve
the dummy at all, you forfeit.

167
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,476
I'm sure Fire Chief Ripley here

168
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,011
needs no introduction to this group,

169
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:40,014
and I know he would like
to say a few words.

170
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:42,534
Listen, guys.

171
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,152
Today is not about winning,

172
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:46,387
so wash that out of your minds.

173
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,489
Today... and every day moving forward

174
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:50,525
if you're chosen as captain...

175
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,028
is about being a leader,
so focus on that.

176
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,332
If you're physically unable to continue,

177
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,399
Aid Cars are standing by.

178
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,467
Report into them.

179
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,836
I am not in the mood
to lose a firefighter today,

180
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,805
so, please, no heroics.

181
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,707
- Got it?
- Do you think there's a day

182
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,543
when she's ever in the mood
to lose a firefighter?

183
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,345
Charlotte Dearborn, Station 12.

184
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

185
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,391
Do you have something to add,
Lieutenant Dearborn?

186
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,583
Out of curiosity, how many captain spots

187
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:17,585
are open in the department this year?

188
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:18,755
Does that matter?

189
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,484
Just like to know my odds
before heading in.

190
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,492
This year, there's just one.

191
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,494
Station 19.

192
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:30,932
The teams are gonna be
assigned alphabetically.

193
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,121
First squad is...

194
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,105
Dearborn, Edmonds, Gibson, Herrera.

195
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:41,409
Guess we're stuck together
today after all.

196
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:42,610
Guess we are.

197
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,226
Station 19. How may I help you?

198
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,998
Yeah.

199
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:07,501
Let me get your contact info.

200
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:09,503
Can you hold just a minute?

201
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:11,137
Sir, are you all right?

202
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,583
Do you need to lie down or...
What do you need?

203
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,540
I need you to mind your own business.

204
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,319
Give me the phone.
With all due respect, sir,

205
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,443
should you even be here?

206
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:17,855
Maybe you need to go home, you know?

207
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,946
- Get some rest?
- Miller, the phone.

208
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,483
Yes, sir.

209
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:25,786
Preschool down the block...

210
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,488
They want to bring
the kids by for a tour.

211
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:29,856
They're on line 2.

212
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:31,591
Copy.

213
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:39,833
Pruitt Herrera. Can I help you?

214
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,701
Jack Gibson, 19.

215
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,203
Charlotte Dearborn, 12.

216
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,172
- Cole Edmonds, 7.
- Andy Herrera, 19.

217
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,675
Both of you from 19.
That's complicated.

218
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,720
Tell me the stories are true...

219
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,378
great calls, great crew,

220
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,646
best stats in the department?

221
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,649
- All true. Every word.
- We get the job done.

222
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,651
Let's see who gets to play captain first.

223
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,785
Number draw time.

224
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,797
One thing's for sure...
You do not want to go last,

225
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:03,189
when everybody's fried
and the building is trashed.

226
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:04,658
First! Sweet!

227
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,394
- What'd you get?
- Um, last.

228
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,529
- Goody.
- All right, guys, huddle up!

229
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,831
All right.

230
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,533
Nod at me or something,

231
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:14,878
like you're agreeing with me right now.

232
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,870
Agreeing with you about what?

233
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,415
Look, Ripley never comes to these things.

234
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,424
Today's a big deal.

235
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,474
We just need to seem impressive.

236
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:22,642
You know, like a team.

237
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:25,345
So this is a fake inspirational huddle?

238
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,147
All right!

239
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:29,149
Teamwork makes the dream work,

240
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,304
right, guys?

241
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,185
We're gonna do this!

242
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,659
On my count.

243
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:42,929
3, 2, 1!

244
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,399
Come on, you guys.
Let's do this together!

245
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:47,701
Whoo!

246
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:51,037
Fire ahead!

247
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,706
Judging from the amount of smoke,

248
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,240
it's not the only one burning.

249
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,542
We should probably split off.

250
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:56,676
This ain't my first rodeo.

251
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,778
Ladies, grab the secondary hose.

252
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,691
Gibson and I will head in first
to handle this one.

253
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:02,782
We can follow you in
and hit those flames, too.

254
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,351
I'd prefer it if you stay back here

255
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,862
and cover us like I asked, okay, hon?

256
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,120
We got it.

257
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:12,258
Did he just call you "hon"?

258
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,773
Is that helping?

259
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,877
Just testing the tools.

260
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,623
Gotta keep them ready
for when we need them.

261
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:35,048
Yeah, I...

262
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:37,717
I think you know that's not what I meant.

263
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:39,919
Here we go.

264
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:42,789
I've been watching you avoid fires

265
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,724
basically every shift for weeks.

266
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,660
Yeah, and it's working like a charm.

267
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:47,894
Everything's fine.

268
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,296
No, everything's not fine.

269
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,775
I've been keeping this secret for you,

270
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,766
but what are you doing?

271
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,435
You're... You're turning
blowtorches on and off?

272
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:57,570
You need to get some help,
talk to someone.

273
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:59,082
Yeah, I don't owe you a progress report.

274
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:00,907
Look, I've seen this before.

275
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,842
I've seen surgeons
get themselves so rattled

276
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,577
they're afraid to cut.

277
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,356
If it goes on too long,
it can mess with your head,

278
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,448
and if that happens,
it is hard to get out.

279
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,027
I really don't need you
to "doctor" me right now.

280
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,818
If you would just...

281
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:13,112
Station 19. Respond. Trapped victim.

282
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,567
Vic, don't...

283
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,494
Fire's out back there.

284
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,963
- Where do you need us next?
- We've swept a dozen rooms.

285
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:26,199
The dummy must be on the
other side of this crawl space.

286
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,767
It's gonna be a tight squeeze.

287
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,112
Send me or Herrera. We're smaller.

288
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:30,336
We can navigate through.

289
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,337
That's very sweet of you to offer,

290
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:33,092
but I don't wanna get
held up in here today.

291
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,942
Gibson, stay on my six, will you?

292
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:37,310
You ladies, you stay here.

293
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,912
We'll holler if we get hung up.

294
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:41,915
Excuse me, hon.

295
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:45,552
That's not my name.

296
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:46,786
Thanks.

297
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,888
So, once again, we're sidelined.

298
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:50,123
- Doing "lady" jobs.
- Yeah.

299
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,891
I'd like to see him pull
that kind of thing

300
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:53,193
in front of Frankel.

301
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:55,258
You think he actually has a shot?

302
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,469
I think everybody here has a shot.

303
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,967
You know 19's a bit of a legend, right?

304
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,336
I mean, I know it's a great station.

305
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,804
To me, anyway.

306
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,806
You kidding? To everybody.

307
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:08,989
Must be weird to think of someone
else coming in to run it.

308
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,911
Yeah, I hadn't realized
it was the only spot open.

309
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:14,414
Come on, ladies! Coming your way!

310
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,816
Okay, sugar pie cupcake boo!

311
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:17,851
See you soon!

312
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,152
I won't,

313
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,086
but it is so tempting

314
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:22,055
to just stick my boot out and trip him.

315
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,898
- Hey, nice job.
- Made good time.

316
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,500
Impressive.

317
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,568
Hey, good job.

318
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,038
That was really fast.

319
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:40,707
Definitely better than last time.

320
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:41,741
I'm pretty sure it was.

321
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:43,181
Probably was.

322
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,712
Yeah? Do you want to sign on?

323
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:46,957
What... What is there to talk about?

324
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,215
- The stopwatch is the judge.
- Dunno.

325
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,918
Sometimes we ladies really
have to talk things over,

326
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,020
you know, with a big, tall man.

327
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:56,389
Super helpful.

328
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:02,729
Have fun in there with your new buddy?

329
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,464
The guy's a tool.

330
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,965
Ego on steroids.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,744
Yeah, I mean, we can't
have somebody like him

332
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:08,802
taking over our station.

333
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:09,980
We've really gotta be on our game.

334
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:13,373
He made good time, a time
we're both gonna have to beat.

335
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,840
Sure, okay.

336
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,896
Where's our Vic?

337
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,832
I don't get it. This is the address.

338
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:39,946
Double-check with dispatch.

339
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:41,401
Find out where they need us to go.

340
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,903
Help! Help!

341
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:45,872
No. My God.

342
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:48,107
- Hughes, where you going?
- Get up! Get up!

343
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,309
- Get up!
- I can't!

344
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,477
Get out of the street! I can't move!

345
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:54,013
Hey, get the truck to block off
the traffic right now!

346
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,415
Hughes!

347
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,317
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no, no! No!

348
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,586
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!

349
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,196
- Stop! Stop!
- Watch out!

350
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,398
- No!
- You okay?

351
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,572
Hey. Hi.

352
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,374
I'm Victoria. Everyone calls me Vic.

353
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,909
- What's your name?
- Piper.

354
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,978
Okay, Piper. I think I can let go now.

355
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,546
Hughes, you still in one piece?

356
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,114
- Yeah.
- That was ridiculous.

357
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,283
Are you sure you're okay?

358
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:26,986
- Yeah.
- Okay, follow my finger.

359
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,256
You wanna tell us how you
wound up here in this...

360
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,457
What is that, a pothole?

361
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:32,635
I was just crossing the street.

362
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,927
I didn't see the hole, and...
and when I stepped in it,

363
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,595
the whole thing just gave way.

364
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,464
Okay, we need to start
rigging up harnesses

365
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:40,777
and attach them to the truck. I
want everybody ready and secure.

366
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,168
For a pothole?

367
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,270
That could turn into a sinkhole.

368
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:49,442
Miller, let's maintain a wide
perimeter around this thing.

369
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,010
Will do.

370
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,255
Let's get you out of here, okay?

371
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,313
On the count of three. One, two, three!

372
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:56,615
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

373
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,284
Okay, the asphalt's piercing her flesh.

374
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,253
You can't pick her up without
ripping her leg to pieces.

375
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,456
So we dig her out?

376
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,323
Yeah, looks that way.

377
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:08,861
All right, let's do this!

378
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:11,464
Right.

379
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:14,600
We've got multiple blazes,
one down that front hall,

380
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:16,602
another cutting off the offices.

381
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,972
Herrera, you slide down
past the first door

382
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,474
and start your sweep from there.

383
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,785
You want me to go past the fire?

384
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,043
We never do that.

385
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,087
It's just basics.

386
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,012
Herrera's right. We might want to...

387
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,381
Hey, it's my call.

388
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,517
As captain, I'm asking you
to divide and conquer.

389
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:32,551
Go on.

390
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,387
Go divide! Go conquer!

391
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:35,988
Come on!

392
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:39,191
I've got a victim to find,
and I'm on a tight schedule.

393
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:46,165
I think I remember
a cut-through back there.

394
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,511
Maybe we can get around this,
come at it closer to the source.

395
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,403
- Where are you going?
- I just said.

396
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:51,757
Yeah, I don't have time for that.

397
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:59,011
- That's not the safest way.
- You're kidding me.

398
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:01,147
Better hurry if you want to keep up!

399
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:07,553
Aha!

400
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:30,109
See? This is why you're not
supposed to pass the fire

401
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,043
before it's out.

402
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:33,179
Guys, I could use
a little backup in here.

403
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:35,548
I got the dummy, but I can't get him out.

404
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:36,549
Over.

405
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,451
Copy! On our way.

406
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:39,952
Sit tight.

407
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:54,533
Herrera, confirm you're clear
before we open up.

408
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,238
Clear!

409
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,452
Yeah!

410
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,288
You all right?

411
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,960
Herrera, nicely done! Up top!

412
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,810
Congratulations, Dearborn.
You just set an all-time record.

413
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,802
Well done.

414
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,098
And that's how it's done, hon.

415
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,577
So, I guess she's the one to beat.

416
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,436
Seems that way.

417
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:44,783
Just keep an eye out.

418
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:46,318
If she develops compartment syndrome,

419
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:48,420
- she could lose her leg.
- Did he just say...

420
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,022
Did you just say lose my leg?

421
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:51,790
Is that true? Is that gonna happen?

422
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,336
Okay, we are doing
everything in our power

423
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,437
to make sure that doesn't happen.

424
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:56,686
- Okay.
- Okay?

425
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:57,763
Okay.

426
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:00,132
- God! Okay!
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

427
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,700
You live around here?

428
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,602
- I used to.
- Yeah?

429
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:07,139
Still come by every morning
for coffee and a walk, though.

430
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,974
A good friend of mine lives close.

431
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,876
- Do you want us to call her?
- No!

432
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:14,513
No. I'd just as soon
she not see me like this.

433
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:15,948
I'd really rather just go home

434
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,616
and pretend like this never happened.

435
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:20,019
Hey, you'll still need to go
to the hospital after this.

436
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,388
Might be nice to have
your friend with you.

437
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,855
I've gotta get used to things
without her anyway.

438
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:26,816
She's moving away.

439
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:28,943
And I...

440
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:32,565
I kinda can't bear it.

441
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,667
I was on my way
to talk to her about that,

442
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,903
but the universe clearly had other ideas.

443
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,838
I got all the way home,

444
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:41,874
I thought about it, I came back,

445
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,410
and then I didn't get two steps
across this stupid street

446
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,179
before my leg got trapped
inside a damn pothole.

447
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:50,182
And now I just...
I need to go home, okay?

448
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:51,727
Can you please just get me out
so I can go?

449
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,886
Yeah. We're... We're working on it.

450
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,260
Your calls in there were questionable.

451
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:02,561
They were dangerous.

452
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:04,563
You say "dangerous," I say "assertive."

453
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:06,576
We can't be shy little violets
to conquer this test.

454
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,767
These guys play rough,
we gotta play rougher.

455
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:09,702
- You feel me?
- No.

456
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:10,636
Plus, it worked!

457
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,839
I pushed you hard, you did badass things.

458
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,040
- Doesn't it feel good?
- No.

459
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,109
Not when you're putting lives in danger.

460
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,011
Not when you're taking unnecessary risks.

461
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,080
See, now, I know
you were recently promoted.

462
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:22,748
Here's a pro tip:

463
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:25,784
You don't get the best
from your team by coddling them.

464
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,386
You've gotta push.

465
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,722
And while I would never want
to squash another woman

466
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,458
just to win this, make no mistake...

467
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,760
I will, if I have to.

468
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,228
I'll do whatever it takes.

469
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:38,697
So I suggest you stop worrying about me

470
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:40,933
and start worrying about you.

471
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,635
You've got an uphill climb ahead.

472
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,603
Sure, okay.

473
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,681
You may have been lieutenant longer,

474
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,040
but that doesn't mean
you've got more experience.

475
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:51,210
In fact, I keep hearing people
say my recent promotion

476
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,945
means I'm not prepared to be captain.

477
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,080
I've helped my father run Station 19

478
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,749
for longer than most people around here

479
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:57,838
have been doing this job at all,

480
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,718
so unless you became a firefighter

481
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:01,387
when you were in diapers,

482
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:04,289
I'm pretty confident I can take you.

483
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:06,325
I don't mind being underestimated.

484
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,493
That's fine by me.

485
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,827
'Cause all it means is,

486
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,163
it'll be easier for me to sneak in,

487
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:14,466
rise up, and take the hell over.

488
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:20,139
You are adorable.

489
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,441
See ya in there.

490
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,673
You ever know something about somebody,

491
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:35,798
and you don't exactly know
what to do with it?

492
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

493
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:39,086
So out of respect for this person,

494
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,411
you don't do anything with it, obviously,

495
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:44,214
but it's hard, because,
like, in your heart,

496
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,526
you know that there are other people

497
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,751
who should know about this thing.

498
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,586
- Right.
- Right, so, what do you do?

499
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,131
Do you just, like, keep your mouth shut

500
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,589
and hope for the best?

501
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,759
Hey, a little less slack
on these lines, guys.

502
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,394
And don't let them get tangled.

503
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:58,939
You're really having us babysit this rope

504
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,797
instead of being up there
tearing up concrete?

505
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:03,600
If this street gives way,
I need you guys right here

506
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:05,569
making sure those people
don't go down with it.

507
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:06,814
All right? I'm not losing anybody

508
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,104
on my first call in charge.

509
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:09,139
Again, I...

510
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,874
I have to ask.

511
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,510
To a pothole?

512
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,880
Okay, that's fine. Make fun.

513
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,148
You know? Laugh it up.

514
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:19,455
It's not gonna be as funny

515
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,552
when this entire block
collapses in on itself,

516
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:26,156
and you are sucked into a giant
hole full of concrete and rebar.

517
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,001
- That just got dark.
- Did not see him going there.

518
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,670
I mean... I mean,
I think this captain thing

519
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,004
- is messing with his head.
- I mean, if you wanna talk,

520
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:32,172
- it's like, we're here.
- Do it.

521
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:33,941
Do you think the asphalt's
pinning her femoral artery?

522
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,476
If it is, we need to loosen
the opening elsewhere

523
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,434
and keep that part pinned
as long as possible.

524
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:41,004
Piper, if your leg starts
to feel too heavy or too tight,

525
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:42,839
- you let us know, okay?
- Okay.

526
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:46,076
Ya know, maybe you should
revisit talking to your friend.

527
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,644
She's not...

528
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:52,516
I mean, she is my friend,
but she's... she's also...

529
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,352
I think she's also more than that, to me.

530
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,653
I think.

531
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,689
I may have felt it for some time now,

532
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:01,424
but I've never...

533
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,361
I mean, I didn't even realize it
until this morning, and...

534
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,530
She's had girlfriends,
and I've had girlfriends,

535
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,099
but we've never...

536
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:11,935
I tell her everything.

537
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,752
I-I think I'm in love with her.

538
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:18,464
And I have no idea how to tell her that.

539
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:23,346
Maybe... just tell her.

540
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,882
Well, that's easy for you to say.

541
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,884
You guys are fricking fearless.

542
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,642
We're scared of plenty.

543
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,155
I'm scared of plenty.

544
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:34,824
You dove in front of a giant truck.

545
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,307
I can't even talk to my friend.

546
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,161
Of course you're scared.

547
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:39,273
You care about what she thinks,

548
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:42,732
and you don't want her
to think differently about you.

549
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,334
I can't.

550
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,979
I don't know how to talk
about this stuff.

551
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,904
- I just... I...
- Piper?

552
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:51,007
My God, Piper! What happened?!

553
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,331
Are you okay?

554
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,679
Hey.

555
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:01,985
All right, fire's clear!

556
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:03,720
Let's start the sweep for the dummy!

557
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:04,888
Let's go!

558
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:23,406
- Nothing?
- Tick tock.

559
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:28,912
All right, let's sweep again.

560
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,781
This time, everyone checks the
opposite sides of the building.

561
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:32,882
No stone unturned.

562
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,684
Come on. Really?

563
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,620
We just checked everywhere.

564
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:39,356
Clearly not everywhere,
or we'd have found the dummy.

565
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,691
Hey, we do what our captain says.

566
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,727
Let's go!

567
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,533
What now, Captain?

568
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:55,071
At least we know we can
eliminate Gibson as competition.

569
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:57,207
Hey. Sidebar.

570
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,878
We've done everything in the book,

571
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:04,581
double-checked every inch of this place.

572
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:07,050
The only thing left to do is... leave.

573
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,587
I mean, if you're wrong,

574
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:11,765
this could take you out of the running

575
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,156
for captain completely.

576
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,693
So could staying here.
Searching for nothing.

577
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,898
Your test, your call.

578
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,967
I'll... I'll support whatever you decide.

579
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:46,690
No dummy?

580
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,259
No, sir.

581
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,794
Not this time.

582
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,106
You are the first candidate in five years

583
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,041
to crack that variation of the test...

584
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:07,711
and in fantastic time, nonetheless.

585
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:08,878
You're right.

586
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:10,613
There was no dummy.

587
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:11,915
Very impressive.

588
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,185
What's your name again?

589
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,953
Gibson, sir.

590
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:18,188
Station 19.

591
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:19,522
All right. Good to know.

592
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:30,469
- I can't believe this.
- The swelling's getting worse.

593
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,149
I know. Her BP's creeping down.

594
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,875
I mean, these streets are unsafe!

595
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,409
And we will not stand for it.

596
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,712
I don't want you to move away.

597
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:44,474
Not because I'm not happy for you,

598
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,511
but because I don't want
to not see you again.

599
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:49,813
I...

600
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:51,949
I have feelings for you.

601
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:54,596
More-than-just-friend feelings, and...

602
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:58,822
I wanted to say it this morning,
and I couldn't.

603
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:01,091
And then this afternoon,
but then this happened,

604
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,360
and I just... I...

605
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:05,796
I wasn't even sure how you would take it.

606
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,632
Piper, how I'd take it?

607
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,334
Well, yeah, because...

608
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,849
This isn't exactly how
I imagined our first kiss,

609
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:29,186
but... I'm not complaining.

610
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,388
Look, if we have something
to say to each other

611
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,991
from now on, let's just say it.

612
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,892
Okay?

613
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,160
Yeah.

614
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,196
Her BP's too low. Most likely caused

615
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,741
by a bleed in her leg below the surface.

616
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,910
We gotta get her outta there.
Even if we have to force it.

617
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,044
Let's get a tourniquet just in case.

618
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,713
And be ready to get her
to the hospital immediately.

619
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:46,670
Every minute makes a difference.

620
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:49,473
- Work together, work fast, guys.
- Um, guys...

621
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,818
remember when you told me to let you know

622
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:52,843
if my leg started to feel tight at all?

623
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:53,948
Yeah, we know.

624
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:55,812
We're gonna get you to the hospital ASAP.

625
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,514
I'm going with you.

626
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:58,815
Okay, but if you can't, it's...

627
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,884
Piper, I mean it.

628
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:02,247
I'm not going anywhere.

629
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:06,240
I wish we had more time
to loosen the gravel.

630
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:08,759
- But we don't.
- Okay. I'll count us in.

631
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,927
- 3, 2, 1.
- You're gonna be okay.

632
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:11,828
Go.

633
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:12,963
Come on, keep pulling!

634
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,742
- We got it. We got it.
- A little more. A little more.

635
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,266
We got it.

636
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,435
Come on! Up, up, up!

637
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:20,003
Let's get her to the Aid Car, right?

638
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:21,171
Fast. Let's go.

639
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:32,949
Pretty much zero visibility in here.

640
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,085
Yeah, even the turnout lights
aren't doing much.

641
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,954
We're dealing with residual
smoke from the whole day.

642
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:39,790
Herrera, you got a plan?

643
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:45,862
All right.

644
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,431
The whole point of this test

645
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:48,965
is to prove we can captain a team,

646
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,034
and none of us
have worked that way today.

647
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,537
I want us to trust each other
and work together.

648
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:55,605
Especially if we're going in blind.

649
00:28:58,276 --> 00:28:59,743
Line up and hold on to each other.

650
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:01,682
We do this together.

651
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:03,880
All right.

652
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:07,150
Everybody call out from their position!

653
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:09,586
It's the only way to stay
connected in the dark.

654
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,254
Talk to me every step!

655
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,456
- You got it!
- Copy that.

656
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,581
Yes, ma'am!

657
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,293
All right, moving forward another step!

658
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:17,961
Good!

659
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:20,731
- Sweeping the floor.
- Nothing.

660
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,668
Hang on!

661
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,937
Encountered something.

662
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,840
Nope, no dummy.

663
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,675
Okay, good.

664
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,310
Moving forward again!

665
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:34,745
Anything?

666
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,847
- Clear!
- All clear!

667
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,650
What the hell was that?

668
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,018
Pretty sure I don't wanna know.

669
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:43,820
Keep going! Moving forward!

670
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:49,092
- That sounds bad.
- Sounds real bad.

671
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:54,998
Aah!

672
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:55,766
Aah!

673
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,970
Jack! You all right?! Check in!

674
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:05,041
- Gibson. Check.
- Dearborn. Check.

675
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,204
Cole?!

676
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:08,345
Cole, check in!

677
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,880
Who's got hands on Edmonds?

678
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:13,016
We broke apart
when the ceiling collapsed.

679
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,851
Well, dig through and find him!

680
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:18,455
- Cole?!
- Edmonds?!

681
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:20,157
- No, no, no, no.
- Edmonds!

682
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:21,725
Damn it!

683
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,994
Hey, hold on! Hold on!

684
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:25,729
I found him.

685
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:27,631
Is he okay?

686
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,199
Can't tell.

687
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,801
He's knocked out cold.

688
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:37,808
I'm calling it in.

689
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:41,178
Charlotte, don't. Don't.

690
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:43,413
Mayday, mayday. Officer down.

691
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:45,882
Are you calling for Rapid Intervention?

692
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:46,817
Negative, we've got him.

693
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:48,362
We just need to get the hell outta here.

694
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:50,086
Aid Car on standby at the door.

695
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:52,055
Everybody out right now.

696
00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:59,930
His pulse is steady. He's coming to.

697
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,098
Andy, come on.

698
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,444
Mayday was called. Mission's over.

699
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,502
You heard Frankel.
Get him out to that Aid Car.

700
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:07,337
- Stay on the walls.
- Andy, hey.

701
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,105
A huge chunk of ceiling just fell in.

702
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,384
- This building's had it.
- There's still time

703
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,842
before it's completely compromised.

704
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:13,120
- What are you saying?
- You guys go.

705
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,711
Get Cole the help he needs.

706
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:15,846
Andy, no.

707
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,181
I'll be right behind you.
As soon as I get the victim.

708
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:21,251
- Hey, it's just a dummy!
- It's not just a dummy!

709
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,687
It's my shot to captain 19.

710
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:26,957
Now, I'm not about to surrender
my home to a stranger.

711
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,391
If this were a real call,

712
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:30,288
I'd never leave that person behind.

713
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:34,264
Time to show this Incinerator
I'm the boss.

714
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,300
Get him the hell out of here.

715
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:44,541
Copy that.

716
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,150
You don't have to stay for this.

717
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:56,152
Buddy system.

718
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:57,441
I'm not leaving you alone.

719
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:30,287
Come on!

720
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,041
Very nice job.

721
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,977
- All right, Andy!
- Let's go, Herrera!

722
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,946
- Great stuff!
- Good job!

723
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:09,059
I made it out. I got the dummy.

724
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:10,971
When a mayday is called,
you get out immediately.

725
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:12,706
You don't take your time.
You don't go back in.

726
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,997
I got the victim out.

727
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,175
It was the right thing to do.

728
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:18,234
No, the right thing to do is
to pay attention to the call.

729
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,337
What you did broke protocol.

730
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,172
What you did was inherently selfish.

731
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,329
By... By going in after a victim?

732
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:25,875
By trying to get extra points on a test.

733
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,179
By playing a game, instead
of acting like a true captain.

734
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:31,181
A true captain wouldn't have flinched

735
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:33,149
if she had the chance
to save a human life.

736
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,719
- A true captain...
- Herrera, is it?

737
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:36,753
I'm gonna stop you

738
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:38,755
before you say something more
you might regret.

739
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,867
And, Frankel, I'm stopping you
because I don't like the idea

740
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,102
of reprimanding one of my officers

741
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:43,493
in front of their candidates.

742
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:44,995
Reprimand me?

743
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:48,231
Your job is to evaluate
everyone, unbiased.

744
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,679
We'll talk later.

745
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,741
I understand why you made
the call you did out there.

746
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:58,908
It's morally admirable,

747
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:01,054
and it's the kind of thing
that inspires, and that's good.

748
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,279
But our rules are in place for a reason.

749
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:04,591
And it's a captain's job
to remember that,

750
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:06,116
even when it isn't convenient.

751
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,884
Now, you got out of there this time.

752
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:08,996
It's a controlled environment.

753
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,354
But in most cases, we'd be
pulling you, your teammate,

754
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,566
and your victim out in body bags.

755
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,592
Captains have to balance what's
moral and what's practical.

756
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:17,404
Sometimes that means
making the toughest calls.

757
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:19,106
Now, I understand
why you made the decision

758
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,564
to ignore the mayday,
but I do not agree with it.

759
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,236
See you at your panel interview.

760
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,732
You suggest earlier that I
should go home, put my feet up.

761
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,211
You know, I'm thinking I'll do just that.

762
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:46,136
Go home, kick back.

763
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,305
The game's on.

764
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,539
Maybe I'll catch the end or something.

765
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:51,574
You seem like you're feeling better, sir.

766
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,044
Would you mind keeping
an ear out for the phone?

767
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:56,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure thing.

768
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:59,164
And, Miller?

769
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,251
I'd prefer if you didn't say anything

770
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:04,454
to anybody else about... earlier.

771
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,258
If you feel better,
then I feel better, sir.

772
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,126
Great.

773
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:17,634
Nicely captained today, Montgomery.

774
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,903
Turned out to be a tidy little call.

775
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,172
You know, there is something
to being stuck somewhere

776
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,007
that makes you honest with people.

777
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,121
I'm honest with Montgomery.

778
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:26,943
Whenever we're stuck in the Aid Car.

779
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:28,121
Stop wearing so much damn cologne.

780
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:31,514
Okay, now that we're back here
safely, I-I have to ask.

781
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:34,017
What is the likelihood
of a pothole like that

782
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:36,920
opening up and becoming
an actual sinkhole?

783
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:38,955
What makes you think you're safe here?

784
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,091
Okay, but, you know, at the call,

785
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,460
you... you said that you were
certain it wouldn't happen.

786
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:44,928
Defense mechanism.

787
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:46,996
- Total bravado.
- It's true.

788
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:50,633
You never know when a disaster
like that is lying in wait.

789
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:54,037
Ready to suddenly, shockingly open up

790
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,138
and swallow us whole.

791
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:57,006
I think I'm scared of fire.

792
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,946
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

793
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,814
I think she's being hyperbolic.

794
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,357
No, she's not.

795
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:11,528
Go on.

796
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:18,628
I don't... I don't have
a lot of people I'd call family.

797
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:21,464
Especially not around here.

798
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:23,293
I mean, y'all are it, basically.

799
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:25,468
Vic, what's the matter?

800
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:31,546
I have a problem.

801
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:37,387
I've been trying
to work through it on my own.

802
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,216
Willing it to go away because I know...

803
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:42,185
I know it's this disaster lying in wait.

804
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,187
And I don't know how you guys will react.

805
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:49,092
And I-I don't know
if this means I'm gonna have

806
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,650
to say goodbye to my family,

807
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,897
when I don't want that.

808
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:55,865
I don't want to say goodbye to you guys.

809
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,074
But I don't think I can...

810
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:01,838
I don't think I can hold this in anymore,

811
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:03,371
and I don't think I should.

812
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,582
I need to be honest.

813
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,080
What do you mean when you
say you're afraid of fire?

814
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:18,354
Ever Si... Ever since the tanker
with the blue fire, I just...

815
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:22,258
I've started to... to flinch.

816
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,460
Every time I get near a flame, I stop.

817
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:25,769
I...

818
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:29,933
That flash on the roof
nearly gave me a heart attack.

819
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,234
I stop.

820
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:36,072
I freeze up. I can't...

821
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:40,376
It takes every ounce of self-control

822
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:42,612
not to run in the opposite direction.

823
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,656
Kind of the opposite
of what you want to do.

824
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,325
When you're a firefighter.

825
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,726
I know.

826
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,599
This has been going on for weeks?

827
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,300
Yes.

828
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:07,337
Numerous calls, numerous shifts.

829
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,138
Not a word. Nothing.

830
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:12,440
Look, I s... Like I said, I've been...

831
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,380
I've been trying to work on it on my own.

832
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:26,522
We're not gonna let somebody
else come in and take over.

833
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,289
I'm still in this.

834
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:31,294
I'll win 19 for the both
of us if I have to.

835
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,711
I can't talk about this right now.

836
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:52,148
Thank you, Vic,

837
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:53,650
for being honest with us.

838
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,788
I think we all know
what we need to do next.

839
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:09,399
Okay, I'll tell Herrera
and Gibson when they get back.

840
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,166
No.

841
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,903
We don't say a word to them.

842
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,638
They'll have to report you.

843
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:20,550
We keep you in the Aid Car
for the time being.

844
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,146
And when we can't do that,

845
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,182
we can all make sure that
you're on pump or hydrant

846
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,552
until you're ready to go back in.

847
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:34,190
I know a guy at the training tower.

848
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:35,925
We can run simulations on our days off.

849
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,904
Yeah, I know some drills
we can try out here, too.

850
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,863
Hypnosis worked for a guy
at my old station.

851
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,665
I'll... I'll help with anything.

852
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,101
You want cover, you just
tell 'em I'm hopeless

853
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,269
and you're training me.

854
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:49,572
Well, that's not... That's not
much of a stretch, so...

855
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,127
Thank you.

856
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,881
Thanks, you guys, for doing this.

857
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,260
Yeah, like you said, we're family.

858
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:02,719
- You'd do it for us.
- Right.

859
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:05,054
Now, the question is...

860
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:07,223
Come here.

861
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:09,025
What will you do for the rest of us?

862
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:10,426
Okay.

863
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:11,538
- Don't start with the laundry again.
- What?

864
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:14,263
- That ship has sailed.
- But my shirts, they shrink.

865
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:16,632
You know you do that on purpose
to tighten your sleeves.

866
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,034
- Yeah.
- We know you do that.

867
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,370
O-Okay, don't hate.

868
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:23,072
- Appreciate.
- You said you hated my cologne!

869
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:24,117
I can't believe you said that!

870
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,652
- It's terrible.
- It is a little overwhelming.

871
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,577
The thing we sometimes forget is,

872
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:29,712
there's real strength in numbers.

873
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,385
Hey.

874
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,286
I was just stopping by
to see how things went.

875
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,822
Your dad must be asleep.
He didn't answer.

876
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,557
You're just getting back?

877
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,493
Long day.

878
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,128
How'd it go?

879
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,845
Thanks for this.

880
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:51,234
- Did it work?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

881
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:52,969
Things didn't go well today.

882
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:54,114
I don't believe for a minute

883
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:55,171
that you didn't kick ass.

884
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,146
I didn't say I didn't kick ass.

885
00:40:57,775 --> 00:41:00,309
But, still, it...
it didn't go well today.

886
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:02,845
Want me to stay to talk about it or...

887
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,481
We don't have to go it alone
if we don't want to.

888
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:06,990
Thank you, but...

889
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,620
I think my dad's the person
I need to talk to right now.

890
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,791
Okay.

891
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:16,825
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

892
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:28,337
There's value in reaching out.

893
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,106
Dad, you were right.

894
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,708
The Incinerator was brutal.

895
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:35,812
Do you know who was there? Chief Ripley.

896
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:38,688
There's hope in asking for help.

897
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:41,065
Dad, are you up?

898
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,020
Dad?

899
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,126
So reach out. Open up. Be honest.

900
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,463
Trust your team to get you out
of that burning building,

901
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,665
even if you can't see
the way out yourself.

902
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:57,667
Because one thing's for sure.

903
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:58,801
Hello.

904
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:03,473
I, need you to page
Dr. Miranda Bailey, please.

905
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:04,707
I'm her patient.

906
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,415
You can't do it alone.

2
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,131
Sorry, I...

3
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,916
You know how I survive out here?

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,880
I don't make noise,
and I don't draw attention to myself.

5
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,418
Sorry about that.

6
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,960
It's called stealth...

7
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,711
Try using it
before I regret bringing you here.

8
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,083
The Autobots ain't paying you
for attitude;

9
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,536
we're paying you to find energon.

10
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,285
I ain't a big fan of dead ends, kid.

11
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,665
Then you'll be really happy
when I activate this hidden hatch, kid.

12
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,955
Well... polish my tailpipe!

13
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,001
You weren't lying after all.

14
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,963
This will keep the Autobots in the fight

15
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,751
for a few cycles... at least.

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
Wait.

17
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,665
This was a Spacebridge?

18
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,246
Oh, yeah! I miss these beautiful beasts.

19
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,666
You ever go off-world through one?

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,880
Mm, yeah.

21
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,788
I used to go racing
on Velocitron all the time,

22
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,165
before the Decepticons destroyed 'em all.

23
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,041
You wanted me to find energon,
so I've led you to some energon.

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,535
We should collect it and go.

25
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,751
Are you crazy?
Those Seekers will be all over us!

26
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,083
This could change everything.

27
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,790
I have to tell Prime.

28
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,575
I was hired to find energon,
not be dragged into an Autobot crusade.

29
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,916
Is survival a stupid crusade?

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm trying to survive.

31
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,421
Come on!

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,790
The Decepticons won't stop, kid.

33
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,625
At some point,
you'll have to choose a side.

34
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,381
He's right.

35
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:24,328
Just be careful what side you choose.

36
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,081
You seem lost, Autobot.

37
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,416
The Surrender Stations are that way.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,000
Unless you'd prefer we surrender you here.

39
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,003
I'm not an Autobot.

40
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,543
Thundercracker, scan them.

41
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,668
Unknown.

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,375
Wheeljack.

43
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:14,748
Optimus Prime, enemy of the state.

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,463
Autobot.

45
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,751
Looters are to be executed on sight,

46
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,333
let alone Autobots.

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,961
And as the Commander of the Seekers,

48
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,831
I decide how they are dealt with.

49
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,826
You fool! They are the enemy!

50
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,333
If the Seekers were under my command,

51
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,826
you would be dead by my hand.

52
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,996
You mean that hand?

53
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,330
The Autobots laugh at us because of him,

54
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,376
and I say we eliminate all three of them.

55
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:09,708
Megatron will reward us for our loyalty.

56
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,415
So...

57
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,211
be it.

58
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,211
Go! Now!

59
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,748
You fools! They're getting away!

60
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,041
Uh-oh.

61
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,328
Lord Megatron.

62
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,710
Hail Megatron!

63
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:03,131
Did two little Autobots
do that to you, Starscream?

64
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,828
I'm not an Autobot.

65
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,501
Starscream was out of line,

66
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,543
so we had a little chat.

67
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,075
Hmm... I see.

68
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,456
We should execute every Autobot on sight!

69
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,291
This war has dragged on long enough!

70
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,166
This war was started as a revolution,

71
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,790
not a genocide.

72
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:35,825
For a better Cybertron,
we must reach their sparks and minds.

73
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,576
Some of us
don't want your vision of Cybertron.

74
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,213
You're running low on energon.

75
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,075
You're desperate, taking risks,

76
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,076
and over-extending yourselves.

77
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:55,206
I don't care what you want.

78
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,878
However...

79
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,540
I want to see an end to this war
as much as you do.

80
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:23,713
Denounce the Autobot fanatics and join us.

81
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,920
Help me put a stop
to all of this destruction.

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,040
Freedom is the right
of all sentient beings.

83
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,961
Yes.

84
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,711
The words of your leader...

85
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,206
honorable, but senseless.

86
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,541
Yeah, well...

87
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,245
I'll stick with him.

88
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,883
Such disrespect!

89
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,208
He insults you with the words of Prime.

90
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,541
Starscream, back in line.

91
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,205
You are the great Megatron,

92
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,881
and yet they defy you.

93
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,418
Such trespass cannot be allowed.

94
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,290
And you...

95
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,825
I'm just trying to survive.

96
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,253
So, a coward then?

97
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,286
Afraid to choose a side.

98
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,463
At least this one wears his allegiance

99
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,251
and his fate with pride.

100
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,420
- Execute them.
- Sir?

101
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,750
Starting with the proud Autobot.

102
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,293
With pleasure, Lord Megatron.

103
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,958
Seekers, at the ready.

104
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,276
Aim...

105
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,630
Let them go!

106
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:12,825
Ah... The noble leader has arrived.

107
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,040
You're in no position to demand anything.

108
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Accept my treaty.

109
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,583
And condemn all of Cybertron to slavery.

110
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,126
I will not do that, Megatron.

111
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,880
What do you know of slavery,

112
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,748
of the energon mines,
or gladiatorial pits?

113
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:38,583
My brothers and sisters
were pre-determined to suffer

114
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,286
while you and your kind did nothing!

115
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,995
Everything that you
and I have gone through,

116
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,633
we fought for the same things!

117
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,376
What you fight for now,
Alpha Trion would be ashamed.

118
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,998
Of us both, I think.

119
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,673
I will not accept your treaty.

120
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,708
Then we end this war here. Now!

121
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,205
I'm enjoying this, Prime.

122
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,541
Get to your feet.

123
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:51,456
Alpha Trion put us all
on the path to freedom

124
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,331
and, for that, you betrayed him, Megatron.

125
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,833
You...

126
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,080
murdered him.

127
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,328
You weren't built for this.

128
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:18,286
You'll never be able to make
the decisions Cybertron needs.

129
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,285
Cybertron needs freedom.

130
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,995
Cybertron needs strength...

131
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,463
my strength.

132
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,213
You were always the slower one,

133
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,421
the weaker one.

134
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,328
Seekers, to the air!

135
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,826
Kill her!

136
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,083
Autobots retreat!

137
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,826
- He's not an Autobot.
- I'm not an Autobot.

138
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,666
Go!

139
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,955
Don't let them escape!

140
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,208
Elita, now!

141
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,511
- Not while you're...
- Now!

142
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,923
Well done, Prime.

143
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,421
Well done.

144
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,496
Hey, uh, Optimus...

145
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,583
before those Decepticons caught us,
we discovered something back there.

146
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,036
It will have to wait
until we are out of Decepticon territory.

147
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,415
Who's this?

148
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,501
Just an energon scavenger I hired.

149
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,883
He's no Decepticon.

150
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,463
What was that back there?

151
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,291
I had to move in.

152
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,995
Wheeljack only had astro-cycles left...

153
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,423
Not that. The explosives.

154
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,380
The idea is to be as far as possible
when you blow everything up!

155
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,038
I swear, one day,
Optimus Prime, you are going to...

156
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,958
Forget it.

157
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,785
Where's the energon?

158
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:56,205
- And what exactly are you?
- What am I? Don't you mean who?

159
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,291
He's a pain in the ass, that's who he is.

160
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:04,245
As far as Megatron is concerned,
you're an Autobot now.

161
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,463
I'll tell you
what I told flashy-face over there:

162
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,171
I took a job, and the job's done.

163
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,500
Pay me, and I'll be on my way.

164
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:18,253
If the job's done,
where's the energon, energon scavenger?

165
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,883
I was paid to find it.

166
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,251
- I found it.
- We will discuss this at headquarters.

167
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:31,383
- I don't wanna go with you!
- You're welcome to go back out there

168
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,668
and see how hospitable
the Decepticons are.

169
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,875
Good point.

170
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,040
So, this is why you need all that energon.

171
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,125
Yeah.

172
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,791
Once the energon runs out,

173
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,325
party's over.

174
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,791
Have Red Alert check them out.

175
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,125
You should all report to medical.

176
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,381
- I must speak with Ultra Magnus...
- Optimus...

177
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,378
if anyone should get checked out
by a medic, it's you.

178
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,961
Thank you for your concern, Elita.

179
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,041
Yeah...

180
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,286
well, we can't have our commander
getting his brain module caved in.

181
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,378
Mm.

182
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,785
- Hey, Optimus, I found the...
- We will speak later, Wheeljack.

183
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:21,166
These hit-and-run missions aren't enough.

184
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,210
Until we find more energon,
hit-and-run tactics are all we can afford.

185
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,328
Cybertron is in ruins.

186
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,496
There may not be more energon.

187
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,745
I fear...

188
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,923
the war is lost.

189
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,420
Don't you believe that
as long as we have sparks inside of us

190
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,330
there is still a chance?

191
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:48,036
Optimus, at this moment,
we must focus on surviving as a race,

192
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,455
not winning a war.

193
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,825
There's a reason the Matrix chose you.

194
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,076
There's no one I respect more than you.

195
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,206
But as your military commander,
as your friend...

196
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,831
accept the treaty.

197
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,575
I... cannot.

198
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,001
We're facing extinction
at the hands of the Decepticons.

199
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,883
It is extinction either way.

200
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,081
You're just as stubborn as Megatron.

201
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,170
Can you check these two out, Doc?

202
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,746
We all know Wheeljack's
beyond my medical capabilities.

203
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,713
Ha! Funny.

204
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,828
Got something for you, Doc.

205
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,036
Sorry, that was all I could scrounge up.

206
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,625
Huh, Thoraxal Nodes?

207
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,078
This will get a few Autobots
back in working order.

208
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,286
- Any energon?
- No, just those.

209
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,211
And this guy.

210
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,131
Let me look at you.

211
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,415
Hmm.

212
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,080
Looks like you've seen
a fair share of action.

213
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,380
- What's your name?
- Bumblebee.

214
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,958
Mm, pretty rough out there
on your own, eh, Bee?

215
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,291
It was fine until I took this job.

216
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,875
How about I help you
patch some of this up?

217
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,828
Yeah, sure.

218
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,916
Um...

219
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,375
thanks.

220
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,416
Is this all that's left of the Autobots?

221
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,831
It may look bad, but I assure you,

222
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,126
it's as bad as it looks.

223
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,206
I was a doctor before the war,

224
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,881
and now, lucky me,

225
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,578
they gave me a blaster and now I'm a...

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
soldier.

227
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,628
We're all soldiers now.

228
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,793
Bumblebee... is it?

229
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,785
- No.
- No?

230
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,535
No, I'm not signing up for your fight!

231
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,325
- I was not asking you to...
- You were about to.

232
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,460
- Huh. Am I that obvious?
- Kind of.

233
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,001
Look, I appreciate the save back there,
but all this…

234
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,213
this isn't for me.

235
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,415
This is survival, Bumblebee.

236
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,830
No, it's not!

237
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,576
You're fighting to win,

238
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,206
and that's gonna get you all killed.

239
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,081
The Autobots can use someone like you.

240
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,786
I'm no soldier.

241
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,418
Neither were any of us.

242
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,790
The Autobots fight for the day
we no longer have to fight.

243
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,501
Yeah, well, good luck with your crusade.

244
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,125
Let him go.

245
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,038
Prime, he could give our location away.

246
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,535
Maybe I should...

247
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,288
We are not the Decepticons!

248
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,328
Please... let him go.

249
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,575
Yet again,

250
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,996
the Autobots have escalated
this conflict to the point

251
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:33,083
where we must answer
their aggression with force.

252
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,326
Under a flag of truce,

253
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:41,166
Optimus Prime refused my offer of a treaty

254
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,080
and instead tried to assassinate me.

255
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,040
It pains me to say this,

256
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:54,665
but I realize now that
there can be no peace with the Autobots.

257
00:20:55,958 --> 00:21:01,288
I empower you Decepticons
and all of Cybertron

258
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:07,785
to bring this painful chapter
of our history to a close.

259
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:14,418
Together, we fight for a lasting unity.

260
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,206
You wanna lose that hand again?

261
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,250
Lord Megatron,

262
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,753
my Seekers are on the hunt.

263
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,633
What's left of the Autobots
won't last much longer...

264
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,578
You keep saying that time and time again.

265
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,786
If I led the Seekers,

266
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,995
I would have already
brought you Prime's head!

267
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:08,415
If you are not careful,
your ambition will be your undoing,

268
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,380
Starscream.

269
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,208
And his arrogance.

270
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,331
His arrogance, I actually like.

271
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,706
But neither of you will find Prime.

272
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,421
Lord Megatron?

273
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,383
Not until you really start to hurt him.

274
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,541
We must forge weapons
from his weaknesses...

275
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,666
honor... brotherhood...

276
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,250
love.

277
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,128
That's how we'll defeat Prime

278
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,788
and win this war.

279

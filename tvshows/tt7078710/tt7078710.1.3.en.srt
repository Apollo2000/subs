1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,889
Oh, you seem to be sincere and good.

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:21,104
How strange it is that we meet
and now we must part.

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,148
That is the way of the world.

4
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,359
May I kiss you, my fair lady?

5
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,828
All right, that's it for today.

6
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,705
Good work, everyone.

7
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,041
Let's try and be off book by tomorrow.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,292
Yeah!

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,879
Oliver, wait.

10
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,673
Wow.

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,675
That was some kiss, huh?

12
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,804
I don't know what she sees in him.

13
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,515
Maybe his mouth tastes good.

14
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,728
Yeah, right.
Like raspberry Warheads and cigarettes.

15
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,813
Yeah.

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,781
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

17
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,037
Um... okay.

18
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,456
Hey, wait.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,503
I realize that all of this
may feel really sudden,

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:31,299
but I just want to let you know I'm happy
you said "yes" to going out with me.

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,926
I like you...

22
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,678
a lot.

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,388
Thanks.

24
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,557
I like you, too.

25
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,727
I figure now that
we're going out and stuff,

26
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,687
maybe we could...

27
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,941
Could what?

28
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,653
I don't know... kiss?

29
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,698
Just to get it out of the way.

30
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,076
No big deal.

31
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,495
Um, yeah.

32
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,164
Cool. Okay.

33
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,834
I'm really nervous.

34
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,975
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.

35
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,058
What do we do?

36
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,271
Um, okay, you take the front,
and I'll take the back.

37
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,814
Okay? All right.

For lunch today: chicken nuggets.

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey, Jessica Betts,

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,302
do you know what part of the chicken
the nugget comes from?

48
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,431
Uh, we interrupt this broadcast
to bring you breaking news.

49
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,308
Here now is Principal Messner.

50
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,060
Good morning. Thanks, Jessica.

51
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,395
Good morning.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,025
Thanks, Jessica. Good morning.

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,738
Due to an incident in the auditorium
yesterday after school,

54
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,533
the fall production of
Uncle Vanya is postponed, indefinitely.

55
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,287
It would appear
that someone pulled the fire alarm,

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,499
causing severe water damage,
leaving the auditorium unfit for use.

57
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,586
And sadly, destroying the beautiful sets,

58
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,422
which I know drama club
worked so very hard on.

59
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,342
"Hard on." Classic.

60
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,386
I'm asking the guilty party
to step forward.

61
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,849
Otherwise, I will be forced
to conduct a thorough investigation.

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,771
In the meantime,
all drama club activities are on hold.

63
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,439
I am so screwed.

64
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,774
I'm dead.

65
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,150
No, don't worry.

66
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,194
We'll figure this out.

67
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,570
I'll figure this out.

68
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,947
- It isn't.
- Yes, it is.

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,031
No, it isn't.

70
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,991
Yes, it is.

71
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,414
My stepdad rented it.

72
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,917
It makes Species look like Ferngully.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,085
What does?

74
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,922
Showgirls. According to Tyler,
Jessie Spano shows her...

75
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,341
things.

76
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,678
And her pussy. I mean, she totally does it
with the guy from Dune.

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,096
Like actual sex!

78
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,806
No, it isn't.

79
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,182
Yes, it is!

80
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,558
No, it isn't!

81
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,355
You haven't seen it. Why would it be NC-17
if they weren't actually doing it?

82
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,984
C-can I borrow it?

83
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,404
For research purposes.

84
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,367
Villain!

85
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,288
Duplicity!

86
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:54,252
A two-headed serpent hath crept
into our garden!

87
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,587
The venomous!

88
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,922
The wicked!

89
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,924
The A/V club.

90
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,846
I hath looked into the eyes
of the devil himself!

91
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,933
And now I know his deceitful visage.

92
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,017
Oliver!

93
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,520
What's the problem?

94
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:17,066
Mr. Messner,
this butthole pulled the fire alarm!

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,862
We saw him after school,
completely drenched!

96
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,739
- Nab his ass!
- Hey!

97
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,282
Language.

98
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,661
And get... get off the table.

99
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,793
Luke...

100
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,630
...is that true?

101
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,181
Yeah.

102
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,058
Ooh.

103
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,517
It's true.

104
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,270
It was me. I did it.

105
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
The villain admits it.

106
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:04,322
Tonight, all of drama club will toast
to the demise of the wretched A/V club.

107
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,616
The absolutely vulgar club.

108
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,161
All right, Oliver. Just knock it off.

109
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,915
Luke, come with me, pal.

110
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,252
Busted, dick-fart!

111
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,336
Hey!

112
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,589
That's a detention.

113
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,299
Oh!

114
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,384
What?

115
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,637
What?

116
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,889
Oh!

117
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,405
Hey.

118
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,618
I need to clear this up.
I am so sorry. I'll go talk to my dad.

119
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,871
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly. It's taken care of.

120
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,248
Are you in trouble?

121
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,166
Oh, detention for a week.

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,128
And he's calling my mom later.
It's whatever.

123
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,258
Why are you doing this for me?

124
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,970
It's what boyfriends do.

125
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,942
Okay, well, thanks! See you later.

Settle down!

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm gonna make your life
a living hell, freshman.

141
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,126
Mrs. O'Neil, hi, Ken Messner.

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,545
Hi, hi. Sherry's fine.

143
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,463
Won't you come in? Please.

144
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,765
I tend to overdo it
with the sugar.

145
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,934
I'm sure it's perfect. Thank you.

146
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,978
Will Mr. O'Neil be joining us?

147
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,480
No, is that a problem?

148
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,898
Oh, no, not at all.

149
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,485
So, uh, Sherry,

150
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,240
I want to make sure you understood that
what your son confessed to is serious.

151
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,158
In some situations,

152
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,287
tampering with the fire alarm
might be considered a felony.

153
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,372
I'm sorry, a what?

154
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,709
Yeah, but that's why I wanted
to have this chat.

155
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,878
To get a sense of
whether this behavior is normal, or...

156
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,465
Look, I-I don't know what to say,

157
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,468
except that this doesn't sound like Luke.

158
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,847
Notice any changes recently?
Anything different?

159
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,391
No. Nothing that makes sense
of any of this.

160
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,603
Mr. Messner, I'm raising Luke on my own

161
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,023
and with my work,
I'm not around as much as I'd like to be,

162
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,110
but from where I sit,
Luke is a happy, well-adjusted young man.

163
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,823
Or maybe I'm missing something.

164
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,951
I, uh... I didn't realize.

165
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,536
You're a single mother.

166
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,331
Single father.

167
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,584
It's hard, right?

168
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,377
Ya think?

169
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,341
And at this age, it's like,
we speak different languages.

170
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,426
Uh, da bomb?

171
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,220
All that and a bag of chips?

172
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,722
What does that mean?

173
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,225
My favorite is, "Oh, snap."

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,896
I'm here, I say, snap what?
Snap my fingers?

175
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,813
My insanity?

176
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,025
Right? I mean, it's hanging
by a thread already, it won't take much.

177
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,652
Thank you.

178
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,033
Felony.

179
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,994
- God.
- Oh, no, uh, I should be clear.

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,455
No one's pressing charges.

181
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,043
You know, it's just my job
to tell you these things.

182
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,463
Also, truth be told,

183
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:17,635
uh, my intentions today
were somewhat twofold.

184
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,516
Well, since Luke and my daughter Kate

185
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,394
are kinda going out.

186
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,772
I wanted to meet you.
Hope you don't mind. I'm just being a dad.

187
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,024
Wait, really? Luke and your daughter?

188
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,403
Wow.

189
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,155
Well, that's news to me. I...

190
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,616
I mean, I knew he liked a girl, but...

191
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,953
I must seem like the worst parent
on Earth right now.

192
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,122
What? Uh, no.

193
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,707
Please, don't think that.

194
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,960
Trust me. I meet a lot of parents.

195
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,339
After a while, you sort of develop
a sixth sense for these things.

196
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,384
You strike me as a great parent.

197
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,010
Really.

198
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,096
I could tell.

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,267
Oh, oh, no.

200
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,769
Uh...

201
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,065
sorry.

202
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,446
Thank you.

203
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,283
Are you okay?

204
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,034
Mm...

205
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,787
Boy, I don't know what's wrong with me.

206
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,792
Do you wish there were
support groups for single parents?

207
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,253
I sure do.

208
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,970
- I have this meeting, but if you'd like...
- Oh.

209
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,848
...maybe we could have coffee,
uh, tomorrow morning.

210
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,142
We could continue this conversation?

211
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,063
Maybe we could start
a support group of our own.

212
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,735
- Dumb idea. Shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no.

213
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,279
I like that idea.

214
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,532
It's just,
I'm on a transatlantic flight tomorrow.

215
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,159
How about tonight?

216
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,912
Sure.

217
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,458
Okay.

218
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,833
It...

219
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,086
It's a date.

220
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,588
Yeah.

221
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,756
Yeah.

222
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,925
Yeah, it's that. It's that. It's that.

223
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,154
♪ I didn't ask
They shouldn't have told me ♪

224
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,574
Scott Wolf is so Mr. Bingley.

225
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,537
Leslie, how do you think Mr. Bingley
knew he was in love with Jane?

226
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,124
Simple. He saw her across the dance floor,
and that was that.

227
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,294
But true love can be tricky.

228
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,507
This summer at bible camp, I saw
Kyle Monaghan across the prayer circle,

229
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,175
and I just knew.

230
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,428
We made out, like, all summer.

231
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,430
His tongue was super fat and slippery.

232
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,936
But then on the last day,
I walked into confession

233
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,148
and I saw him getting a hand job
from Leah Kagan!

234
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,693
And she doesn't even go to our camp.

235
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,948
That sucks.

236
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,367
Yeah, I was in love with him.

237
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,995
He was just leading me on the entire time.

238
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,538
You're so lucky.

239
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,790
Luke's, like, super in love with you.

240
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,544
Is his tongue super slippery?

241
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,547
I bet it is.

242
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,236
Hello?

243
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,947
May I speak
to Mr. Lucas O'Neillius, please?

244
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,908
- Speaking.
- This is Ed McMahon.

245
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,951
You've just won a million dollars!

246
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,869
Who is this?

247
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,662
It's Ed McMahon, asshole!

248
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,873
I've got a big-ass check for you.

249
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,667
Just dip it in ketchup
and shove it up your butt!

250
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,628
Drama club represent, asshole.

251
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,182
I shot another
stupid wedding video today.

252
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,977
Same speeches,
same cake, same chicken dance.

253
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:45,819
You're looking for something to inspire
or stimulate around here?

254
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,615
Phew, good luck. Movie house,
second-run blockbuster bullshit.

255
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,992
The nearest record store,
halfway to Portland.

256
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,955
The most exotic restaurant in town,
it's the freaking Crouton Factory.

257
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,248
- Son?
- Shit.

258
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,507
Wanna tell me why you pulled
the fire alarm at school?

259
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,260
I didn't... I didn't do it.

260
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,973
Hmm. Was I not just in
the principal's office on your behalf?

261
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:19,144
Mom! Mom, seriously,
I was there, but I didn't do it.

262
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,397
Okay. Well, why did you say you did?

263
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,273
I can't tell you.

264
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,151
Luke, I don't know what this game
is that you're playing,

265
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,070
but I am not interested.

266
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,697
Cut the shit.

267
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,450
Fine.

268
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,619
It was my girlfriend.

269
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,000
She pulled the alarm,
but I didn't want to get her in trouble,

270
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,002
so I said I pulled the alarm.

271
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,882
Okay, little man.

272
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,930
Thank you for being honest.

273
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,389
You're welcome.

274
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
You didn't tell me she said "yes."

275
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,649
Principal's daughter, huh?

276
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,152
Bold.

277
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,780
I know.

278
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,869
Now, in the future, I would like
to hear about those things from you.

279
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,704
We're a team, right?

280
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
Yeah, we're a team.

281
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,466
Oh.

282
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,386
Hello.

283
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,597
Hi. Is Luke there?

284
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,223
Uh, sure, he's right here.

285
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,350
- I think it's her.
- Oh!

286
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,021
Mom, give it to me.

287
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,857
I'll be out tonight.
There's a Tombstone in the freezer.

288
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,192
That's morbid.

289
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,779
Hey, how's it going?

290
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,697
It's going sexy.

291
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,699
Talk dirty to me, big boy.

292
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,367
Can you please stop calling me?

293
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,162
Oh, God, you're making me so wet!

294
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,623
Stop calling.
What if there's an emergency?

295
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,002
There is an emergency, in my panties.
Oh, Luke!

296
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,921

Twelve-layer dip.

308
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,196
Beans, sour cream,
Pace, olives, pickles,

309
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,824
cheddar, chicken nuggets.

310
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,117
You're welcome.

311

Honey, Apple Jacks, sliced apple
and a second layer of cheddar.

That's 11 layers.

Oh, the top layer's oxygen.

314
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,128
Butter my bunghole.

315
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,589
Should I be worried Kate and I
haven't kissed?

316
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,843
Dude, it's been two days.
Relax, you're golden.

317
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,802
McQuaid?

318
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,306
Well, the average high school
relationship lasts for 26 days.

319
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,183
For every year-long relationship,

320
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,144
there are an equal number
that last less than five minutes.

321
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,437
What does that mean?

322
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,149
Kiss or no kiss, your relationship
was doomed before it even began.

323
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,485
- Thanks.
- Don't listen to him.

324
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,780
I bet next time you see her,
it's gonna be tongue city.

325
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,991

Hi, what are you doing here?

327
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,294
I tried calling, but it was busy.

328
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,174
Oh, uh, this is... this is awesome.

329
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,677
I mean, this will be
like a normal thing now.

330
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,347
Do... Do you want to come in?

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,058
What? No.
I just came to tell you something.

332
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,517
Tell him what?

333
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,895
Did she bring a weird snack?

334
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,691
She can't... She can't come in without
a weird snack. I'm not flexible on this.

335
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,277
Technically, it's edible.

336
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,613
Mm.

337
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,658
Mm.

338
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,534
Tastes like candle.

339
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,661
Your phone's off the hook.

340
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,001
O'Neil residence?

341
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,379
Listen to me,
you little jizz mop,

342
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,757
don't you ever take the phone
off the hook, ever.

343
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,927
Luke, um, I-I think it's for you.

344
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,513
Who is it?

345
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,307
May I ask who's calling?

346
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,976
The Grim Reaper.

347
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,144
Uh, th-the Grim Reaper.

348
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,147
It's probably drama club.
They've been prank calling all day.

349
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,068
We're coming for you, Tyler,
and Luke and what's the kid's name,

350
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,069
with the glasses?

351
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,422
- Oh, yeah, McQuaid.
- Don't tell them my name, you idiot!

352
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,781
McQuaid, Tyler, Luke.

353
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,827
Monday morning, you are all dead.
We're gonna stab you in the eye.

354
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,662
And then we're gonna stab you in the dick.

355
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,539
- Prepare to die.
- Hang up. Hang up.

356
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,628
This is exactly what I predicted
would happen if you asked Kate out.

357
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,423
- Leave her out of this.
- They're gonna kill us.

358
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,675
- What'd they say?
- We need to transfer schools.

359
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,220
- I can't get stabbed in the dick!
- You think they're for real?

360
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,390
War isn't glorious,
and there's no shame in running away.

361
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,350
I haven't even lost my virginity.

362
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,312
How am I supposed
to lose my virginity with no dick?

363
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,522
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

364
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,276
Build a bunker, stock up on supplies,
change our names.

365
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,570
Sick. I'm changing mine to Vince.

366
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,613
Who gives a shit? We're doomed!

367
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,115
Everybody, stop talking!

368
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,741
I have a plan.

369
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,580
Does your mom have any alcohol?

370
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,966
This is the worst idea.
How do we even know they're here?

371
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,217
They're here.

372
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,470
Do you want to put a stop to this or not?

373
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,096
Glad I prepared.

374
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,807
What is that?

375
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
Casserole dish.

376
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,269
No dick-stabbing for me!

377

Luke, just be yourself.

379

Charm them, you know you can do that.

380

Oh, my God.

381
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,800
And I was like:
Luke, I am your father.

382
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,969
He was so confused,
it was so funny.

Star Wars.

384

Prank calls my ass.
We gotta kill that kid, Oliver. For real.

385
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:23,401
I mean, maybe we can
still do the play, right? Maybe?

386
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,821
The play's over. It's a sign.

387
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,574
Then what? We're gonna have
to take drama off our college resumes?

388
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,118
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

"F" resumes, all right?
"F" college, too.

391
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,919
I'm getting the hell out of here
as soon as I graduate,

00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,796
if not sooner.

393
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,464
New York city, baby.

394
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,675
Now that the show is canceled,

what the hell am I doing wasting my time
in Boring?

396

Screw it, I'll leave tomorrow.

397
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,684
- What about us?
- What about us?

398
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,437
I have another year left here.
You're just gonna leave me?

399
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,107
Pretty much.

400
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,442
How are we gonna kill him?

401
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,529
My cousin's a hitman. Just saying.

402
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,074
- That's our cue to leave.
- You're right.

No. Luke, you've got this.

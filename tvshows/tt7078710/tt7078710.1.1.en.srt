Good morning, BHS. I'm Jessica Betts.

8
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,339
And I'm Scott Pocket.

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,678
And here are your announcements
for Friday, September 27, 1996.

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,139
The new Star Wars movies
are gonna be awesome.

11
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,642
They're not new. They're just ruining
the originals with digital garb.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,270
Whatever. They're gonna be Phat, Ph.

13
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,398
Well, gee, thanks for clarifying.
I thought you meant obese.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,527
- Let's go, gentlemen, we're late.
- We were waiting for you. You're late.

15
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,739
Luke, you do realize that A/V Club
is the lowliest of electives?

16
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,158
It's beneath choir.
It's beneath weather club.

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,661
They should combine choir
and weather club. Weather choir.

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
♪ Cloudy with a chance of rain ♪

19
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,793
Guys, we're in high school now.
We gotta find our people.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,504
We might as well start with something
we know.

21
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,713
That's A/V club.

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,383
Yeah. Once they see one of our movies,
the ladies will come flocking.

23
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,762
I promise you, there isn't
a single female behind those doors.

24
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,766
There'd be ladies in weather choir.
Just saying.

25
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,519
Be sure to bring a monologue
and break a leg, comrades.

26

32
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,989
Principal Messner here.

33
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,408
Wishing you a happy Friday.

34
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,912
And thanking you for a spirit-filled
first week back at school.

35
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,291
And for all you freshman out there,
I can't wait to get to know ya.

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,003
Anyway, we're off to a super start,
so let's keep it up.

37
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,840
Back to you, Jessica and Scott.

38
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,259
Thank you, Principal Messner.

39
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,846
For lunch today, corn dogs and tater tots.

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,474
Do you like corn dogs, Jessica Betts?

41
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,812
No. In world news, President Clinton
has signed the Defensive of Marriage Act,

42
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,148
defining marriage
as one man and one woman.

43
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,984
Well, that's a shame because
I was gonna marry a burrito...

44
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,361
- What's with camera one?
- ...Jessie B.

45
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,615
- Kate Messner, camera one, focus.
- Also, happy birthday, Meatloaf.

46
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,201
- The singer turns 49 today.
- Come on, focus.

47
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,036
- Good job.
- I'm trying.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,622
I'm trying...

49
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,417
Oh!

50
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,378
Oh, help, help, help, help, help.

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,756
That's it, I hope.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,550
I don't even know how to do this.

53
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,052
- Stop touching it.
- Help, help, help!

54
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,136
Help, help!

55
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,598
Help, help, help!

56
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,765
Fuck!

57
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh. No way.

58
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,863
And those are your morning announcements.
Have a Boring day.

59
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,282
That was a disaster.

60
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,742
That was awesome.

61
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,201
Where do we sign up?

62
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,496
The first week of school
and the shit's already gone to shit.

63
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,042
Welcome to A/V club, freshman.

64
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,637
Hi.

65
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,265
Hi.

66
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,268
It looks like we're gonna be partners.

67
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,648
According to Mr. Stargrove,
I'm camera three starting tomorrow, so...

68
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,315
Great.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,318
Great.

70
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,694
Having trouble?

71
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,281
I'm good, thanks.

72
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,575
Well, these 456s are janky.

73
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,327
You sure I can't help?

74
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,084
Can you actually stand over there, please?

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,881
Thanks.

76
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,771
Huh...

77
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,732
you're out of focus.

78
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,277
I know.

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,028
I'm trying to fix that.

80
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,114
Well, it's your lucky day.

81
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,284
I, uh, I know exactly how to fix this.

82
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,286
- You do?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,705
What's wrong with it?

84
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,707
Well, there's gunk on the lens.

85
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,084
Makes the auto-focus get stuck.

86
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,336
But I have tools at home.

87
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,423
Can I check this out or something?

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,717
Are you a freshman?

89
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,260
Technically.

90
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,013
Freshman can't check out gear.

91
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,891
Right.

92
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,272
Well, maybe you can check it out
and come over to my place.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,651
Or I don't know,
if you're not doing anything.

94
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,034
Um, yeah, all right, cool beans.

95
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,078
Uh... cool as beans.

96
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,583
Sorry, that was stupid. I'm Luke.

97
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,668
Luke O'Neil, by the way.

98
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,752
Kate.

99
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,051
Damn, Gina, how'd you do that?

100
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,260
How'd I do what?

101
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,803
Ta... talk to a girl.

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,308
Uh, mm, I don't know.
Just happened, I guess.

103
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,560
She's coming over after school.

104
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,938
She's what? Wait a minute.
Don't you think we should discuss this?

105
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,982
- Why?
'Cause she's a sophomore.

106
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,941
So?

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,568
Holy snikies, older woman.

108
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,320
Hey, easy there, Romeo.

109
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,614
You are tampering with plutonium.

110
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,157
Plutonium?

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,243
That student you were just talking to,
that's Kate Messner.

112
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,412
All right? That's Mr. Messner's daughter.

113
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,705
Who's that again?

114
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,083
Mr. Messner, the principal.

115
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,128
Proceed with caution.

116
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,880
Ooh.

117
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,341
The principal's daughter.

118
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,555
Mr. Knudsen!

119
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,975
Yeah, Knudie. We gonna put some
points on the board tonight?

120
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,393
I wouldn't bet on it.

121
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,730
Well, I hope you brought a crow sandwich
for lunch,

122
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
'cause you're gonna... Kate!

123
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,194
Hey, sweetie,
was that cool or what?

124
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,613
I gotta be on
the announcements more often.

125
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,906
- Dad?
- Yeah?

126
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,367
Can we make a new rule this year?

127
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,494
Of course, I'm all ears.

128
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,621
Can you not talk to me
while I'm at school?

129
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,374
Like, pretend I'm any other student.

130
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,084
Like I don't exist.

131
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,213
Uh, okay, yeah.
If that's what you'd prefer, I suppose...

132
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,673
It is.

133
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,174
Bye.

134
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,636
Well, have a great rest of your day.

135
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,305
I'm sorry.

136

No way.

You're out of your mind!
Luke, settle this.

142
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,328
Settle what?

143
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,913
That ridiculous song.

144
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,082
Winning the lottery
and dying the next day?

145
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
The subject is 98 years old.

146
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,545
There's nothing ironic about dying at 98.

147
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,005
Rain on your wedding day?

148
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,800
It's ironic because they chose that day
to get married!

149
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,678
Well, then, they're morons,
and they deserve each other!

150

Do these people
not have five-day forecasts?

151
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,267

does Alanis Morissette live in?

152
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,977
- Canada!
- Oh.

153
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,896
- Can I have a chip?
- Oh, yeah.

154
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,979
Thank you.

155

Four years of this.

156
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,069
It's week one. It'll get better.

157
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,713
Look on the bright side, McQuaid.

158
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,241
My cousin Reese says
everyone has sex in high school.

159
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,203
Even nerds, like, with each other.

160
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,166
According to my calculations, there's
a 2% chance I get laid by senior year.

161
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,878
Kinda comforting, truthfully.
Takes the pressure off.

162
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,214
- Did you run my numbers?
- Better. Not by much.

163
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,510
What about Luke?
A girl is going to his house!

164
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,763
- It's practically a date.
- It's not a date. I'm fixing her camera.

165
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,642
- You are underestimating the implications.
- Truth.

166
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,937
Also, am I the only one concerned
by what Mr. Stargrove said?

167
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,190
He was just messing with us.
She's the principal's daughter. So what?

168
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,777
He compared her to the most dangerous
radioactive material on the planet.

169
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,739
Even befriending the principal's daughter
is like painting a target on your face.

170
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,075
And mine and Tyler's by association.

171
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,078
I mean, look at us, it's bad enough.

172
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,706
Yeah. What do you think, Tyler?

173
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,751
She seems cool. But she is a sophomore.

174
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,295
High hopes, low expectations.

175
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,714
That's what my step dad always says.

176
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,718
Then again, he's an unemployed alcoholic
who named his dog after a psychopath.

177
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,971
- How is Charles Manson?
- Oh, farts a lot.

178
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,473
You guys are right.
What are we even talking about?

179
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,101
- She probably doesn't remember my name.
- Hey, Luke.

180
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,646
Good. Good, I mean...

181
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,188
...hey.

182
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,234
- Meet by the flagpole after school?
- Y-y-yeah.

183
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,695
See you then.

184
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,368
Plutonium.

185
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,164
You think I'm some kind of slut?

186
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,085
No. I know you're a slut, slut.

187
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,296
Thou hast slept with another!

188
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,214
Untwist thy tongue!

189
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,217
What merchant of deceit
hath sold you such untruths?

190
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:58,306
In thy sleep when thou didst dream,
thou didst chirp infidelities!

191
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,268
Forsooth! But dreamers often lie,
asleep in a trance!

192
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,187
As boys and men alike ask me
into their pants.

193
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,772
Mm-hmm. Counterfeit!

194
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,734
Thou hast made me do this, you bitch!

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,949
Oh. Oh! Oh.

196
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,873
No!

197
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,587
Dagger, I am thy scabbard!

198
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,180
What was that?

199
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,853
Scene!

200
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,191
- I am Oliver Schermerhorn.
- And I am Emaline Addario.

201
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:55,404
Auditions for Uncle Vanya will be held
next Wednesday in the auditorium!

202
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,530
This could be you.

203
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,699
We are obviously playing the leads,

204
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,702
but lesser roles
and crew positions remain available!

205
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,621
- Join us!
- Join us!

206
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,062
I heard that.

207
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,818
Good afternoon, Miss Stock.

208
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,695
Hi, Ken.

209
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,573
I-I feel like I've barely seen you.
Did you get my messages?

210
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,538
Ken, we had fun this summer.

211
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,872
Agreed!

212
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,833
Summer's over.

213
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,961
Oh, don't worry.

214
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,673
According to the district handbook,
our goings-on are permissible.

215
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,217
Uh, provided we don't copulate
on school grounds.

216
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,179
I'm not attracted to you, Ken.
Physically, like, at all.

217
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,188
You okay?

218
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,732
Of course, yeah. I...

219
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,362
I'm glad you said something, actually.
I... honesty.

220
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,409
Just, brutal honesty,
it's just the best policy.

221
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,163
I-I can only thank you for that.
I appreciate this.

222
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,957
Friends?

223
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,669
Colleagues, might be better.

224
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,797
Colleagues. Yeah, hey, I'll take it!

225
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,425
Oh, and Ken?

226
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,634
Yeah?

227
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,053
- The copier's low on toner.
- Oh.

228
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,813
Nice shirt.

229
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,981
Thanks.

230
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,317
So, what's up with Tori Amos?

231
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,819
Uh, you've never heard of Tori Amos?

232
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:03,657
Well... well, I've heard of her,
but I don't know her music that well.

233
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,455
- You like her?
- Uh, yeah. She's amazing.

234
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,166
She's like nothing
you've ever heard before.

235
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,293
Oh, cool. Like what?

236
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,962
Um...

237
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,424
I don't know. How can I explain
if you've never heard it?

238
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,176
You can try.

239
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,845
Okay.

240
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,308
Well, there's this one song where
halfway through she just starts crying.

241
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,686
And it's her just singing
and playing the piano and crying.

242
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,063
And it's just so real.

243
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,146
Wow.

244
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,651
And her first album is called
Little Earthquakes.

245
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,903
- Know what that means?
- No.

246
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,321
Orgasms.

247
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,908
Like, she totally named
an entire album after orgasms.

248
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,412
Or that's what I heard.

249
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,913
Oh.

250
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,001
Sounds bad ass.

251
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,470
Oh, hey, man.

252
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,391
Hey, would you take a picture of us
in front of the sign?

253
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,422
- Okay.
- All right.

254
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,105
Ready.

255
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:20,109
One, two and...

256
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,864
You ever notice they never actually go
into town?

257
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,243
They just find the sign,
take a picture, then leave.

258
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,996
Lucky them.

259
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,963
Oh, sweet! Columbia House.

260
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,631
Hold this.

261
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,135
- What'd you get?
- Let's see.

262
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,095
New Oasis.

263
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,724
- That's supposed to be good.
- Yeah, well, I already have it.

264
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,018
I forgot to mail the thing back.

265
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,561
You want it?

266
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,940
Oh, oh, thanks, but you can get a lot
of store credit for that.

267
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,985
Oh, no, it's, it's fine really. Take it.

268
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,908
Thanks.

269
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,249
Sorry about the dust.

270
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,126
Feel free to look around.

271
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,217
So, how do you know
so much about cameras?

272
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,763
My dad used to be a wedding videographer.

273
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,183
He showed me some stuff when I was a kid.

274
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,311
I guess it just kinda
comes naturally to me.

275
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,646
What's he do now?

276
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,980
Who, my dad?

277
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,066
Who cares?

278
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,027
He bailed on me and my mom
when I was seven.

279
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,491
If you look up "deadbeat dad,"
there'd be a picture of Leroy O'Neil.

280
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,160
Apparently, he's in Hollywood now.

281
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,704
Do you miss him?

282
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,623
No.

283
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,629
What about your mom?

284
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,423
She's, uh, five miles
above the Atlantic right now.

285
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,133
What?

286
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,761
She's a flight attendant.

287
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,226
Sometimes she's gone for a whole week,
which kinda rules.

288
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,853
I get to stay up late.
Rent rated "R" movies.

289
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,690
They know me at Video Shack,
which is cool.

290
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,235
I'm more like an adult
than a teenager, really. So...

291
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,032
What's on these?

292
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,743
Oh, I don't know.

293
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,038
I think they were my dad's.
I've been meaning to check them out.

294
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,208
What made you join A/V?

295
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,129
It seemed mellow, I guess.

296
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,215
My dad was trying to get me
to run for ASB.

297
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,428
It's like I have to be some
exemplary student 'cause of who he is.

298
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,763
Sucks.

299
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,475
Mr. Messner.
You know, he actually seems kinda cool.

300
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
Not the term I would use.

301
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,523
What about Mrs. Messner?

302
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,525
She died.

303
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,196
Sorry.

304
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,824
How'd it happen?

305
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,200
She was sick.

306
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,914
We don't...
you don't have to talk about it.

307
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,166
It's all good.

308
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,543
It's okay.

309
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,256
After she died,
they made me talk to a counselor.

310
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,552
What's a five-year-old supposed
to say to a counselor?

311
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,098
And they had me make this
stupid arts and crafts project.

312
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,768
It's called a Scream Box.

313
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,772
And I was supposed to scream into it
whenever I needed.

314
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,940
I never used it.

315
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,359
My dad did though.

316
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,575
And then, I came back to school,
and everyone stopped talking to me

317
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,244
because they knew
I didn't have a mom anymore.

318
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,208
I wanted to disappear.

319
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,128
It's like I actually did, kind of.

320
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,388
How's it look?

321
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,893
Oh, perfect.

- Meatloaf or Ziti, sweetie?
- Dad!

344
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,868
Oh! Sorry! Just wanted to know
if you wanted to...

345
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,672
You know, Kate,

346
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:21,595
it's okay if you want
to look at this magazine.

347
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,390
I've seen a few myself,
if I'm being honest.

348
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,894
But I want you to know

349
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,107
is that you don't have to look
like the girls in these magazines.

350
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,321
Real men are attracted to women
of all shapes and sizes.

351
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,032
Breasts, and uh,

352
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,328
- bottom, and uh, pubis area...
- Dad.

353
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:52,876
What I want you to remember is attraction
is not limited to our physical forms.

354
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,713
Despite what some people may believe.

355
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,384
Um, got it. Thanks, Dad.

356
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,302
Anytime, sweetie.

357
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,725
Can you get out of my room now, please?

358

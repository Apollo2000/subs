You know, I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

8
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,926
- Thank you.
- Thank my dad.

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,209
He's the one who hooked us up.

10
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,555
- McWeird.
- What?

11
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,062
Dominguez Rocks! Here we come!

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,280
It looks like someone saw The Craft.

13
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,080
Sorry I'm late.

14
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,333
No, it's all good.
We're waiting on one more, Stargrove.

15
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,252
Actually, um, we're all here.

16
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,962
What do you mean?

17
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,464
Tyler, why are you wearing
Oliver's trench coat?

18
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,552
So, don't shoot the messenger, but...

19
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,763
He what?!

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,937
"Dear Tyler, New York calls.
One day, like me, you'll soar."

21
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,856
God, stupid son of a bitch.

22
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,941
I still can't believe he actually did it.

23
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,528
Those New York City hotties
are gonna be all over that kid.

24
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,240
Wait, so let me get this straight.
I'm driving you kids all the way to LA

25
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,161
to shoot a scene from your movie,
and your lead isn't even here?

26
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,413
- Better just turn around now.
- No.

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,708
I am not letting
some egomaniacal douchebag

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,877
get in the way of everything
I've been working for.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,881
Everything we've been working for.
We'll figure this out. Right?

30
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,258
- Yeah. Totally.
- Yeah, okay.

31
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,428
So, um, maybe on the way back

32
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,390
to Gloptonia the ship passes through,
like, an asteroid belt.

33
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,393
An asteroid hits the ship, killing Oliver.

34
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,479
- Works for me.
- But isn't he supposed to die at the end?

35
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,982
Maybe he passes through a cloud
of shape-shifting gas

36
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,692
that affects males only,

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,236
- and it changes his appearance.
- That could work.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,907
So when the ship lands,
Blorg is no longer played by Oliver,

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,742
but instead played by...

40
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,954
Fine, I'll do it. But I get a page one
rewrite and sole credit.

41
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,497
No, I'll do it.

42
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,043
Oliver gave me his coat.
That means something.

43
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,546
You're already in the movie.
You can't remember your lines as it is.

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,507
- I know my lines, Dennis Rodman.
- I'll do it!

45
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,219
McQuaid, really?

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,305
Yeah, I haven't been in the film yet.

47
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,182
And my acting's probably garb,

48
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,851
but maybe that will provide a new layer
of humor.

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,479
I mean, I'm... I'm the only logical choice.

50
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,858
All right, McQuaid. Way to step it up.

51
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,195
But... this is gonna be great.

52
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,114
Did anyone bring any music?

53
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,660
There's a tape up there.

54
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,831
You do know you have
a kissing scene with Emaline, right?

55
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,708
Oh, I'm very aware of that.

56
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,502
Oh, sweet. Ace of Base.

57
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,129
What?

58
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,094
No.

59
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,387
No.

60
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,527

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,162
Zarginda, my love,
what say you of your studly betrothed?

76
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,998
No, dude, you gotta say it like this:

77
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,624
"Zarginda, my love..."

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,751
Schwing!

79
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,879
Wait. Tyler, can you grab us
some sodas, please?

80
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,297
The change is in my bag.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,590
Thank you.

82
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,842
Luke, can we talk about the kiss?

83
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,843
What about it?

84
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,554
How passionate should it be
on a scale of one to ten?

85
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,557
- I think we really need to sell it.
- Wait a minute.

86
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,560
This is your first kiss, isn't it?

87
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,770
Yes, your point?

88
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
Uh, dude!

89
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,399
You know it's gonna be on tape forever.

90
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,486
You could show it to your kids one day.
If you want to.

91
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,737
Great.

92
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,840
Hey, Emaline...

93
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,552
I know you're probably not
in the mood to talk.

94
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,931
I just want to say I'm sorry about Oliver.

95
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,976
Someone who would
just leave you like that...

96
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,354
wasn't worth it to begin with.

97
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
How do you do it?

98
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,576
Do what?

99
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,246
It's like it's so easy for you.

100
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,375
I'm not sure I know
what you're referring to.

101
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,335
You just exist.

102
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,507
You don't have to be anything for anybody.

103
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,095
Is that a good thing?

104
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,555
Of course, it is.

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,976
For me,
I've always just been Oliver's girlfriend.

106
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,811
Psycho chick.

107
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,357
Now that he's gone, it's like...

108
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,820
what am I even doing?

109
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,323
I like the attention. I'm not gonna lie.

110
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,660
But I think deep down I just...

111
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,663
I wanted his attention.

112
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,046
You know how he told me he was leaving?

113
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,343
He didn't.

114
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,765
His dad called me
and asked if I knew where he was.

115
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,146
I was just a prop to him.

116
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,859
I'm so pathetic.

117
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,363
No, you're the opposite of pathetic.

118
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,407
You're funny.

119
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
You're confident.

120
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,121
You're a way better actor
than he ever was.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,707
That's true.

122
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,173
Why are you being so nice to me?

123
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,968
I was a total bitch to you.

124
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,473
Yeah, why were you so mean to me?

125
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,768
I don't know.

126
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,522
- Maybe I was a little bit jealous.
- Of me?

127
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,606
Yes.

128
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,900
You're so cool, and you don't even try.

129
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,818
- It's annoying.
- I am not cool.

130
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,778
Yes, you are.

131
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,530
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

132
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,033
You're cooler for thinking
that you aren't. It's really cute.

133
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,552
I think you're the most sexy
and attractive person I've ever met.

134
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,561
You really think so?

135
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,899
I think you're perfect.

136
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,373
Disgusting!

137
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,586
I found my retainer
on the floor of the bus.

138
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,795
The bus!

139

- My breath is like what?
- Just find some Binaca, stat.

Ready and...

166
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,883
Hey! What are you kids doing?

167
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,887
You need a permit to film up here.

168
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:28,938
Totally random question,
but, um, do you have any skin allergies?

169
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,025
Oh, you foolish human.

170
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,569
You shall feel the wrath
of Commander Blorg.

171
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,029
Cut!

172
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,781
- How was it?
- Oh, it was great.

173
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,700
- You sure? I could do it again.
- No. Why toy with perfection?

174
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,784
Great. Wonderful.

175
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,582
Twenty-five, quizzical. Take three.

Action.

177
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,627
Get him.

178
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,003
- That's a cut.
- Cut.

179
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,505
I'm the only one that says "cut."

180
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,550
Scene 25, double-dare, take two.

181
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,344
- Give me Pacino, give me De Niro!
- Get him.

182
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,430
Dude, that's Christopher Walken.

183
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,805
Cut!

184
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,393
Come on, McQuaid. Mad! Mad! Mad!

185
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,228
Get him!

186
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,064
That's the one. Cut! We got it.

00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,649
Thanks.

That's a wrap! Wow! Let's pack it up.

203
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,096
You sure we don't need another take?

204
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,890
I could do another take for... for safety.

205
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,308

What are we doing?

215
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,558
Did you know we're only 40 minutes away
from Hollywood?

No, thanks.

221
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,257
I was wondering if you wanted
to watch television with me in my room.

Dude, I found a game room.
Want to play ping-pong?

224
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,734
- Play with yourself.
- Yeah, good one.

225
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,035
I'll play if you want.

Hmm. Not really.

I was thinking about what you said
the night we went to see Tori Amos.

00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh, I think we both said
some things I'd rather forget.

I mean, about your dad.

What happened?

- Nothing happened.
- This is not nothing.

Fine. I was right. My dad's an asshole.
Thank you for the confirmation.

1
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,353
Are we gonna start sometime today?

2
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,856
I am melting in this makeup.

3
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,358
Just a few adjustments.

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,736
All righty.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,112
Places, people.

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,448
All right, here we go.

7
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,825
All right, roll camera...

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,828
and action!

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,584
Blorg, my love.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,754
I beg you, please do not leave me
and go to Earth.

11
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,215
Earthlings care for no one but themselves.

12
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,343
They only have one heart
where we Gloptonites have six.

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,261
I fear no humans, Zarginda.

14
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,264
It's for these reasons I've been chosen
to lead this mission.

15
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,516
It's my calling.

16
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,392
But why you?

17
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,937
Why must you leave me?

18
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,731
Please don't leave me.

19
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,193
Gloptonia needs me... on Earth.

20
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,200
Cut! Amazing!

21
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,452
You asshole!

22
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,496
You're going to New York without me,
aren't you?

23
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,873
You're gonna ditch me after you graduate.
I know it.

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,125
Jesus Christ!

25
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,629
What is your problem? Can you try
to act professional in front of the crew?

26
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,382
- Suck a dick, Oliver!
- Emaline.

27
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,425
Emaline!

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,429
Pookey! Little bear. Butterball.

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,473
- No, no, relax. Relax.
- Don't touch me!

30
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,559
- Leave me alone!
- Amazing.

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,962
- We got it.
- I'm sorry.

32
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,738
Dude, you ask her yet?

33
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,532
Just about to.

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,617
Nice. Chicks love romantic overtures.

35
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,870
Yeah. For shizzle.

36
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,289
Okay, here we go.

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,623
Okay.

38
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,632
Hey. What'cha doing right now?

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,677
Oh, nothing, I guess.
Probably just gonna go home.

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,890
Oh, yeah, you could do that,
or you could go see Tori Amos,

41
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,976
live in concert tonight, with me.

42
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,853
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,146
Seriously?

44
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,439
- Yeah.
- Luke!

45
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,275
Yeah, I mean,
I just wanted to surprise you.

46
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,527
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,611
Oh, my God.

48
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,245
But this is in Portland.
How are we supposed to get there?

49
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,833
This is a bad idea.

50
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,336
What if we get pulled over?
This is so illegal.

51
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,173
Kate, we're not gonna get pulled over.
You have your learner's permit.

52
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,967
- It's fine.
- Oh, God, we're gonna die.

53
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,971
We're going to die in a car accident
and end up in that Driver's Ed movie.

54
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,309
- Red Asphalt. You've seen that?
- When's the last time anyone drove this?

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,562
Uh, before this morning, seven years ago.

56
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,523
I mean, it's been rusting by the woodpile
since my dad left.

57
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,570
Funny enough,
you remember that crate of tapes

58
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,864
that you found in my garage that day?

59
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,324
Yeah, why?

60
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:07,789
Well, it turns out they're
these videos of my dad just talking.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,918
Like this video diary type thing, I guess.

62
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,797
It's weird, I used to hate the guy, but...

63
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,093
now I kinda wish I knew him.

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,470
He seems cool.

65
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,765
Well, maybe it's not too late.

66
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,559
Maybe you could write to him or something.

67
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,478
Yeah.

68
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,566
I know what we need.

69
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,779

00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,500
I've been studying up.

74
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,878
Now, hey, at this point,
I might be a bigger Tori fan than you.

75
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,549
- Is that a challenge?
- That's a big challenge.

Sherry!

84
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,096
So, where are we going?

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,974
Actually, I thought
we could just stay right here.

86
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,436
Right here, like,
in the parking lot right here?

87
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Yeah.

88
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,065
Okay.

89
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:04,947
Last week, as it happens,
it sometimes happens,

90
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,951
I, uh, confiscated some, uh...

91
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,746
- some...
- Some...

92
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,916
- ...contraband?
- Right. Yes.

93
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
Wow.

94
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,543
Ah, this is nuts.

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,672
Um, I was about to get rid of it,
but then I thought,

96
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,469
uh, maybe we could experiment a little.

97
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,640
You stole weed from a student?

98
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,974
Confiscated.

99
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,020
You are bad.

100
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,939
Oh...

101
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,150
- Okay, I'm in.
- Yeah?

102
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,693
- Yeah.
- Okay. Great.

103
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,199
I figured that it's high time
I checked this one off the list, too.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,035
Wait, wait, you've never smoked herb?

105
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,748
- Oh, Ken, this is gonna be fun.
- Is it?

106
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,125
- Yeah.
- I'm nervous.

107
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,501
What if I just freak out?

108
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,877
Okay, is there a pipe?

109
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,754
No, I don't... think so.

110
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,841
Oh, wait, I have gum in my bag.

111
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,552
We can use the wrapper.

112
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,220
We can chew the gum after.

113
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,807
- I'm gonna shut up now.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,614
Wow. I've never been to the city
without my dad or a teacher before.

115
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,866
Really?

116
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,492
Well...

117
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,246
...let's do this.

118
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:41,210

123
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,499
Nice one.

124
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,215
That's good.

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,219
No, don't breath out yet.
Hold it in, suck in a little air.

126
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,639
And now exhale.

127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,728
- That felt like a lot.
- That was a good one.

128
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,189
- You've done this a few times before?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,358
Not for a long while.

130
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,486
How'd you get to be such an expert?

131
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,820
Luke's dad.

132
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,743
Back in high school, we used to cut class
and we'd go sit out by the airport

133
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,789
and, um, get stoned
and watch the planes take off.

134
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,502
Is that what made you want to be
a stewardess or flight attendant?

135
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,004
I never wanted to be a flight attendant.

136
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,634
But I always liked the idea of flying away
from life for a minute. You know?

137
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,096
When you're young,
you feel there's this big world out there,

138
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,100
full of possibility,
and I chased that feeling.

139
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,602
All the way to Boring.

140
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,231
Right.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,317
No, that was Leroy's idea.

142
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,489
He is not a good person.

143
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:40,288
I don't like saying that, but he is not
the father that Luke deserves.

144
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,458
It all worked out for the best.

145
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,715
So, do you feel anything?

146
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,636
Oh, no. I don't... I don't think so.

147
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,599
You don't always feel it the first time.
Better not overdo it.

148
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh, maybe,
maybe just one more little puff.

149
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,029
No.

150
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,116
Sherry, what do we do?
I've never been so hungry in my life.

151
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,492
I think I'm dying.

152
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,078
Hey, you're not dying.

153
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,625
- You just have the munchies and so do I.
- Wait!

154
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,964
- You have the key?
- I have all the keys.

155
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,382
Yes!

156
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,135
I'm the key master, baby.

157
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,763
Oh, thank God!

158
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,349
Ah!

159
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,562
Come with me!

160
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,315
Leave it.

161
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,986
We're right here.

162
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,529
Excuse me.

163
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,158
Hi. Sorry. Excuse us.

164
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,327
Sorry, thank you.

165
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,790
This is us.

166
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,625
Sorry we're so far away.

167
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,878
Are you kidding?
I still can't believe you did this for me.

168
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,463
For us.

169
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,051
You're amazing. Thank you.

170
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,689
So, how's it going, Portland?

171
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,817
You've been so missed.

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,027
Thank you for coming tonight.

173
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,182
This is incredible.

174
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,991
I can actually feel my brain working.

175
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,454
Conducting my body
like a perfectly calibrated orchestra.

176
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,332
I bet a lot of the great scientists
were stoners.

177
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,710
I mean, how else is Sir Isaac Newton
gonna spend all that time

178
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,629
thinking about gravity and stuff?

179
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,464
That is stoner thinking.

180
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,550
Uh, he did more than think about it.

181
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,969
He discovered
the Law of Universal Gravitation.

182
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,056
Our feet would still be stuck
to the ground whether or not he said so.

183
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,393
Oh, don't undersell Sir Isaac.

184
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,273
The man was the father of modern physics.

185
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,943
He wrote the laws of optics,
the laws of motion.

186
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,155
I mean, he invented calculus, for fun!

187
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,158
The beauty of his mind.

188
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,328
I wish I was that smart.

189
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,955
I don't.

190
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,337
I think it'd be lonely
being that smart, you know?

191
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,257
No one else in the world
who really gets you.

192
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,429
Life's lonely enough without having
to be the father of modern physics.

193
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,729
Come here.

194
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,689

Yeah, it was.

223
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,515
Uh, yeah.

224
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,143
When my...

225
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,731
when Kate's mom, when she passed away,

226
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,734
she'd been sick for a number of years.

227
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,862
In pain for a long time.

228
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,948
That was ten years ago.

229
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,704
This whole time, I never thought I'd
feel a connection with anyone ever again.

230
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,124
Till now.

231
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,588
I know this is just fun or whatever,

232
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,051
but I wanna thank you
for giving me a little hope.

233
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,821
That was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.

234
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,283
Oh! When she was playing the piano,
didn't you think she was gonna smash it

235
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,452
the way she was pounding it like that?

236
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,870
Yeah. Totally.

237
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,206
Oh, my gosh. I mean, she's just so cool.

238
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,750
She reminds me so much of you, actually.

239
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,295
Um, so did you enjoy the show?

240
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,255
Yeah. It was the best, thank you.

241
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,341
It was the best date ever.

242
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,428
Except, it wasn't a date-date.

243
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,721
It was a fake date.

244
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, I know. But, you know,
date, fake date, what's the difference?

245
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,938
Um, the difference is that one is real,
and one isn't.

246
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,402
So, this wasn't real.
Our relationship is not real.

247
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,947
Yeah, but would it have been
different if it was a real date?

248
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,866
Luke...

249
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,995
I think we need to breakup.

250
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,666
How can we break up
if we're not in a relationship...

251
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,793
Jesus, Luke, stop!

252
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,587
Whatever you think that this is,
it isn't, okay?

253
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,339
I am what I am.

254
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,093
And we're not a couple,
and we're not going to be, ever.

255
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,897
Where's the car?

256
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,159
Mm. Okay.

257
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,376
Um, do you need to get that?

258
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,669
- No.
- No.

259
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,176
- Are you sure you don't want to...
- Just one quick sec.

260
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,809
Look, I'm sorry.
I should probably find a phone.

261
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,231
Fuck. Fuck. Why?

262
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,236
I'll be right back.

263
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,294
I'm sorry about the car.

264
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,135
Can you say something?

265
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:29,358
Look, my whole life,
I have been the freak.

266
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,903
The girl who nobody picked for dodgeball.

267
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,280
The girl who didn't have a mom.

268
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,992
The girl who dressed funny
because it was her dad buying her clothes.

269
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,289
And then, tonight...

270
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,461
I looked at these people, and I thought...

271
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:57,970
maybe there's a future
where I don't have to be a freak.

272
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,265
Maybe I can be who I am and that's okay.

273
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,184
I never said you couldn't be who you are.

274
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:10,357
I told you, whoever you are,
whatever you are, it doesn't matter to me.

275
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,318
- Luke, it matters to me.
- Okay, so now what?

276
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,446
Go and tell everyone at school
that you're a lesbian.

277
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,617
- You don't think they'll call you a freak?
- All that matters is that I know.

278
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,453
- You had a great time with me.
- I had an amazing time.

279
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,666
So why can't we keep hanging out?
Having amazing nights together?

280
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,335
Why are you doing this to me?

281
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,296
Because it's not about you!

282
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,548
I told you how from the beginning
how I felt,

283
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,110
and you wouldn't hear it
because all you care about is yourself.

284
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,052
- I like you.
- No, you don't.

285
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:43,849
You like the idea of me.
You like the idea of having a girlfriend.

286
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,643
But you're just using me
to make yourself feel better

287
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
about everything in your life that sucks.

288
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,191
So, just leave me alone.

289
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,363
That's my dad.

290
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,631
Well, you two had yourselves
quite an adventure tonight, didn't ya?

291
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,134
Coming out here, without the courtesy
of letting anyone know.

292
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,763
You know, I was your age once.

293
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,892
There's a lot of things I never did
that maybe I wish I had.

294
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,811
Like sneaking out to a rock concert.

295
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,730
You have a good time?

296
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
Fine.

297
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,610
Luke, good time, pal?

298
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,612
Fine.

299
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
Sick.

300
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,827
What's that smell?

301
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,081
I hit a skunk.

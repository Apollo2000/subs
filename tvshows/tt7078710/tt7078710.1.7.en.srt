1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,095
And action.

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,765
Victorious.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,395
Cheese Mongers of Earth shall rue the day

4
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,064
they provoked the mighty Blorg.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,444
Zarginda, my love,
what say you of your studly betrothed?

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,071
I say you're more God
than Gloptonite.

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,702
Cut, cut, cut!

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,038
My God, what is the problem?

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,208
The problem is the blue screen combined
with the blue on your faces

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,960
makes your heads disappear.

11
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,254
- You couldn't see my head?
- No.

12
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,840
- My face?
- Is your face a part of your head?

13
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,717
- Oh, so fix it!
- Fix it?

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,846
Wow! I hadn't thought of that.
Now, that is a brilliant idea.

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,056
No shit, fix it.

16
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,391
Who crapped in his Cap'n Crunch?

17
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,643
He and Kate broke up. Sensitive subject.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,523
Stargrove, we need to shoot this
at the actual Dominguez Rocks.

19
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,318
Dominguez Rocks is in Los Angeles.
Not gonna happen.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,280
Unless you convince Messner
to fund a field trip.

21
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,865
Which you can't.

22
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
And he won't.

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,745
Hey, dude. I left my baggage at the door.

24
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,414
- Do the same. You need to chill.
- I need to chill?

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,294
Okay, I'll chill. I'll let you look like
an ass and in a completely shitty movie!

26
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,380
In case you forgot,
you're the director. All right?

27
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,425
- Stop wasting my time and figure it out!
- Okay!

28
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,762
My face needs to go on the screen.

29
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,430
So, what do we do?

30
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,682
What about green makeup?

31
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,769
What did you say?

32
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,647
Green makeup against the blue screen.
That would work.

33
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,857
Would it?

34
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,444
Yeah, yeah, of course. That would work?

35
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,322
Hmm.

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,325
What about all the other scenes
we already shot, huh?

37
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,453
Where the aliens have blue faces?

38
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,708
Are they aliens,
or are they freakin' mood rings?

39
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,504
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean.

40
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,673
You know what, everybody?

41
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,133
That's a wrap.

42
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,637
I'll figure this whole thing out
on my own, like I do everything else.

43
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,724
And you guys just enjoy what's left
of this stupid Saturday.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,361
What?

45
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,407
I just want you to know,
this is all your fault.

46
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,848
Something's wrong.
Have you ever seen him rage like that?

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,931
I guess not.

48
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,812
Guess not? If you said Candyman in
the mirror five times, Luke would show up.

49
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,731
Yeah, with a hook hand.

50
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,068
- Yeah, of course with a hook hand.
- Tyler. McQuaid.

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,403
Dudes.

52
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,282
You guys wouldn't happen to know
where I could score some drugs.

53
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,868
- Drugs?
- Yeah, drugs.

54
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:26,247
Because if I don't get high right now,
I'm going to lose my shit.

55
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,791
If you're asking us,
you must already be high.

56
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,337
I told you, they're dweebs. Let's go.

57
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,381
Wait.

58
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,384

Takes a second.

81
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,402
- What are you, a hacker or something?
- It's just the net, no big deal.

82
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,446
Wait for it.

83
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,531
Wait for it.

84
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
Wait for it.

"How to get high
with these common household items"?

87
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,084
- Yep.
- God, I love the Net.

88
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,586
- Cough medicine?
- Mnh-mnh.

89
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,339
- Uh, rubber cement?
- You could die from that.

90
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,509
Um... aerosol spray.

91
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,885
You could die from that.

92
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,221
Uh, nutmeg.

93
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,848
Nutmeg? That shit you put in eggnog?

94
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,020
"Users who in..." McQuaid.

95
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,774

Oh!

98
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,909
Nutmeg. Nutmeg...

99
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:54,997
Nutmeg! Nutmeg! Nutmeg!

100
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,506
Kate!

101
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,552
- God, sweetie, what happened?
- Dad, I'm okay. I'm sorry.

102
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,138
You screamed. You're bleeding.
What happened?

103
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,098
I tried to pierce my nose.

104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,933
Excuse me?

105
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,852
My nose. I tried to pierce it.

106
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,019
Why?

107
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,229
To put a jewel in it.

108
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,649
- A jewel?
- A jewel. A ring. A stud. Whatever.

109
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,527
- Let me look at it.
- Dad.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,610
Let me look.

111
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,826
Is it horrible?

112
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,911
What did you pierce it with?

113
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,288
A safety pin.

114
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,666
A safety pin?
That could get infected, Kate.

115
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,627
Dad, I held it over a flame first.
I'm not a moron.

116
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,421
I'm getting the first aid kit.

117
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,508
Where's JTT?

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,013
Umm...

119
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,224
W-Why are... Why are we in the woods?

120
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,769
God, you're such an amateur, man.

121
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,940
What is nutmeg, anyway?

122
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,359
No one knows.

123
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,742
Who wants to go first?

124
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,621
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm not getting involved.

125
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,581
Uh, why not?

126
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,334
I'll be your tether to reality.

127
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,336
Yeah, every journey needs a Sherpa.

128
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,587
Your loss.

129
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,136
Oh...

00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,931

Me? I'm not the one
who just mutilated myself for fun.

135
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,120
- You seem happy.
- I'm always happy.

136
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,164
You seem happy for real.

137
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,709
Well...

138
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,088
that's because I am.

00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,967
Cool. Why?

140
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,178
Because...

141
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,931
I met someone.

142
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,016
- Like a girl someone?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,143
Who is she?

144
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,646
Oh, no. No, that I cannot tell you.

145
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,647
What? Why not?

146
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,065
I-I just, I can't.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,484
Is she married?

148
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,153
- What? No, of course not.
- Do I know her?

149
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
Is she a teacher?

150
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,867
Uh, I... sweetie, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

151
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
Uh...

152
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,037
Out of respect for her,

153
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:45,459
she would prefer that we not talk
about it with anyone, so...

154
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,923
I'll tell you as soon as
she gives me the okay.

155
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,467
Does she like you back?

156
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,303
Yeah, I think she does.

157
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,847
I don't get it, though.

158
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,559
I mean, if you like each other,
why won't she let you talk about it?

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,314
Isn't that kinda weird?

160
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,529
No... I...

161
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
it's complex, sweetie.

162
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,454
You know, most adult relationships are.

163
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,042
All done.

164
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,802
I have to wear this?

165
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,597
- Dad!
- Just until it scabs.

166
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,475
I mean, it shouldn't take too long at all.

167
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,317
Or maybe...

168
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,070
we could try putting a jewel in it, now.

169
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,115
- Really?
- I guess. I mean, the damage is done.

170
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,659
You already made the hole.

171
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,494
Oh!

172
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,877
Does anyone feel anything?

173
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,716
As I suspected.

174
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,594
You've all been boned
by the World Wide Web.

175
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:23,849
No, no way. Why would someone
put that on the net if it wasn't true?

176
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,768
It has to work.

177
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,936
It's going to work.

178
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah, yeah, I mean, totally.

179
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,732
Like, we should just eat more.

180
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,071
Yeah, genius idea.

181
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,997
The end of the night,
I'm packing up my stuff,

182
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:52,044
and this lard ass, he comes over and says,
"You didn't film the bouquet toss."

183
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,608
Well, there it is.

184
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,109
You happy?

185
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,194
It's great.

186
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,488
Think Luke's gonna like it?

187
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,535
You guys still having a good time?

188
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,954
I guess.

189
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,666
- You hungry?
- I'm good.

190
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,551
You know, Kate,
if you ever want to just hang out,

191
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:45,723
or if you need anything,
I'm always here, sweetie.

192
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,433
Thanks, Dad.

193
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,614
Epic.

194
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,074
Can you feel it?

195
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,078
Oh, the good gracious glory
of an ever-expanding mind.

196
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,497
Oh, my God.

197
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,125
I don't feel squat.

198
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,419
Maybe next time you should try cinnamon.

199
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,379
Cumin.

200
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,714
Oregano.

201
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,798
Paprika.

202
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,966
Garlic powder.

203
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,260
Grodie.

204
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,888
You know what I like?

205
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,224
Monologues.

206
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,895
Monologues are to an actor what...

207
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,817
...cheesecake is to a fat man.

208
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,527
They are delicious.

209
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,320
They are nutritious.

210
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,697
They are absolutely necessary.

211
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,533
You know what?

212
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,870
We need to give Blorg more monologues.

213
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,497
H-How many more?

214
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,706
Seven.

215
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,169
Seven monologues. Distinct monologues.

216
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,923
Uh, perhaps one about his childhood

217
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,177
and how his family never understood him
and still doesn't.

218
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,764
Maybe another about his first love.

219
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,641
And maybe one...

220
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,477
about the death of his father.

221
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:20,442
Monologues, when spoken
by a great actor, is like,

222
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,029
hmm, it's like. It's like. It's like...

223
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,574
Oh. Yeah, cheesecake to a fat guy.

224
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,453
Oh, yes! Yes, exactly.
You get it. Okay, you get it.

225
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,290
You're a great actor, Oliver.

226
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,668
And the world needs
to see your greatness.

227
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,004
The world needs to see...

228
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,339
Needs to see my greatness.

229
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,799
Yes!

230
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
Okay. All right.

231
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,846
You know me so well.

232
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,848
It's like you're in my head.

233
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,519
Like a tick or a wing.

234
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:03,193
Follow me, my loyal aide-de-camp.

235
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,530
Let's go.

236
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,995
- You still feel nothing?
- Zippo.

237
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,331
But as long as Oliver is having fun.

238
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,250
His fun is more important than my fun.

239
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,087
You have to be selfless when you're
in a mature relationship like ours.

240
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,756
Right.

241
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,677
I mean, you could almost say that
his fun is my fun.

242
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,513
Like, we're one, you know?

243
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,599
It's like we're connected.

244
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,100
Okay.

245
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,853
You sure that nutmeg isn't working yet?

246
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,399
How come you never smile?

247
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,485
I-I smile.

248
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,569
I smile often.

249
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,489
I'm a degenerate smiler of smiles. Um...

250
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,869
Okay, wait, that is not...
no, that is not a smile.

251
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,829
That is a creep face.

252
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,084
Alas, I suffer from creep face.

253
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,419
You're such a weird freshman, McQuaid.

254
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:08,092
But it's true. All the McQuaid men have
creep face dating back hundreds of years

255
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,260
to when the Cossacks were chasing us.

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,138
You don't laugh either.

257
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,017
Laughter's not the only way
to show that something is funny.

258
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,519
- Is that a fact?
- Sure.

259
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,605
Do something funny.
I'll react without laughter.

260
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,232
Okay.

261
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,656
You can't just do something funny.

262
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,207
Hello. Pinecone and Company.

263
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,502
Mr. McQuaid.

264
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,005
He's right here.

265
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,381
Please hold.

266
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,012
It's for you.

267
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,642
Was that funny?

268
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,647
Guys?

269
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,567
Um, w-we got a problem.

270
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,994
Oliver, what the hell?

271
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,371
The world can see me from up here.

272
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,207
And see my greatness.

273
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,001
You hear that, Boring?

274
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,795
I don't need you.

275
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,630
All right, come down.

276
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,799
I am cheesecake to a fat man.

277
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,761
What'd he say?

278
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
It's a long story.

279
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,265
You really should come down.
Never mix drugs with heights.

280
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,893
Yeah, perhaps you are right.

281
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,395
I can be lofty without being aloft.

282
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,897
Just be careful!

283
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,565
I am the Nutmeg King.

284
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,484
I can do anything.

285
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,153
- Oliver, come down!
- Okay.

286
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,532
I can't...

287
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,951
I can't get down.

288
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,497
Okay, I can't get down.

289
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,917
Oh, God, I can't get down.

290
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,293
Oh, God.

291
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,544
I want my mom!

292
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,638
What are you guys laughing at?
Stop laughing.

293
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,598
Hello. Squirrel Police?

294
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,934
I have an emergency.

295
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,852
We can pay you in nuts.

296
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,524
I said stop laughing at me.

297
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,318
It's not funny.

298
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,631
It's working.

299
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,508
Oh, yes.

300
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,552
It worked.

301
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,762
It worked.

302
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,472
♪ Gloptonites rejoice ♪

303
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,765
♪ Gloptonites rejoice ♪

304
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,433
♪ Gloptonites rejoice ♪

305
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,578
Damn it!

306
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,905
Hey, Dad.

307
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,988
Hmm?

308
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,491
I am kinda hungry, actually.

309
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,869
Great, do you want a sandwich?

310
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,621
Make you a sandwich.

311
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:13,545
Hey, have you ever heard
of Dominguez Rocks?

312
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,594
I re-watched Ghostbusters.
Here's what I figured out.

313
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,890
Aside from the ghosts,
there's really just one other bad guy.

314
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,642
The EPA guy.

315
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,645
And I'm thinking,
"How is this guy the bad guy?"

316
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,188
This guy is doing his job.

317
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,232
This guy is protecting the environment.

318
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,652
While the Ghostbusters run around
and blow up ballrooms.

319
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,365
I mean, I bet I could write a whole movie
where the EPA guy, he's the good guy.

320
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,702
I mean, heck, from his perspective,
he is the good guy.

321
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,871
That's interesting.

322
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,333
We're all the heroes of our own story.

323
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,794
Without even realizing,

324
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,839
we're probably the bad guy
in someone else's.

325
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,184
Sorry about the mess.

326
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,646
I'm trying to get this green screen to key

327
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,190
and on top of everything,
the board is broken.

328
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,608
It's just...

329
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,944
friggin' typical.

330
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,117
Cool nose piercing, by the way.

331
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh, thanks.

332
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,453
Cool blue face.

333
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,205
Oh.

334
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,832
Thanks.

335
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,585
I wanted to tell you something.
I know you probably hate me.

336
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,045
I don't hate you.

337
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,258
I'm sorry if I was mean to you.
That was messed up.

338
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,468
Thanks.

339
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,013
I'm sorry, too.

340
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,516
Thanks.

341
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,105
Um, I have awesome news.

342
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:01,153
My dad is going to give A/V club the funds
for a trip to Dominguez Rocks.

343
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,280
We're good to go.

344
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,823
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

345
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,576
I mean, our parents
will have to sign permission slips.

346
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,746
And we have to get Stargrove
to drive as chaperone.

347
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,539
But, yeah.

348
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,084
Why did you do that for me?

349
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,462
Because you're my friend.

350
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,410
Hello, Pinecone and Company,
this is Mr. McQuaid.

351
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,830
Oh, hey, Emaline.

352
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,585
Yeah, I... I like you, too.

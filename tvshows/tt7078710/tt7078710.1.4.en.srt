1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,510
Oh, God! No!

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,887
Hold him still.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,807
- Mwah!
- Let me go!

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,770
Guys, I really need to go
to the bathroom really, really badly.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,232
I find this very disrespectful.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,527
Oh, God!

7
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,532
♪ Heaven knows
It's like playing with fire ♪

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,617
♪ Your life's a throw ♪

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,745
Whoo!

10
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,459
You all look so beautiful.

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,170
What is wrong with you people?

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,924
At least listen to what he has to say.
He's a director, you know.

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,228
Zima.

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,105
All right.

15
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,315
Nice.

16
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,570
So, I was thinking.
Well... we were thinking.

17
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,907
Maybe all of the unfortunate things
that have happened recently

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,742
are actually good things.

19
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,746
No offense, but why spend
all this time rehearsing a play

20
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,123
that people can only watch once?

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,209
Are you that excited to play parts

22
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,961
that thousands of actors
have already played?

23
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,924
Also, Uncle Vanya kinda sucks.

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,760
- I'm killing him myself.
- Chill.

25
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:39,766
I propose... I propose that A/V club
and drama club join forces.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,812
We make a movie that you guys star in.

27
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,524
- We can screen it for the whole town.
- Right.

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,569
You guys saw the music video he made?
It was embarrassing.

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,989
Well, that's because the three of us,
we're terrible actors.

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,909
If we had real actors,
we could make something cool.

31
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:02,539
I mean, something unique.
Something this town has never seen before.

32
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,624
What's it about?

33
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
What?

34
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
The movie, o-ass-is.

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,754
What's it about?

36
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:15,093
Oh, um, lots of things, right?
I mean, hard to explain it right now...

37
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,688
Indulge us.

38
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,987

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,825

41

42
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,751
Be yourself. People like you.

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,090
Grazie!

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,883
Thank you.

45
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,596
- I just love this place.
- Have you ever been to Italy?

46
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,972
Oh, no.

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,017
I wish. Have you?

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,187
I have, yeah.
Actually, um, perks of the trade.

49
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,648
- Aha.
- I'd love to take Luke one day.

50
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,776
Yeah, once he's out of the jailhouse,
right?

51
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,862
The jailhouse?

52
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,616
I just assume he's grounded.

53
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,746
If Kate had done what he did,
she'd be grounded for a month, maybe two.

54
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,915
Well, you're a disciplinarian.

55
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:31,044
I don't like being the bad guy,
but sometimes that's the job.

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,963
Oh! Molto bene!

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,343
Yeah, but I just like Luke
to feel like we're a team, you know?

58
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,637
Like he can trust me as a friend.

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,600
Does he know you're out
with the principal tonight?

60
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,186
No.

61
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:55,693
But I'm a little more private
when it comes to my interactions with men.

62
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,280
No, not that I go on a bunch of dates.

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
Oh, I'm surprised to hear that.

64
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:07,247
Unfortunately, most of the attention I get
comes from passengers in first class,

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,085
a couple drinks in, wondering if I'd like
to go to the mile-high club.

66
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,545
Not exactly my idea of romance.

67
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,090
Yeah. Gosh, yeah. That's...

68
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,635
Hey! We have wine. We should cheers.

69
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,637
Yeah! What should we cheers to?

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,098
To Luke and Kate.

71
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,643
Luke and Kate.

72
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,403
So, mile-high club, huh?

73
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,487
Yeah.

74
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,365
What is that?
Is that a frequent flier thing?

75
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,244
And so, even though
it's gonna be set in the future,

76
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,329
it's gonna feel like a...

77
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,542
like a bad science fiction movie
from the 1950s.

78
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,127
And I know what you're thinking,

79
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,397
that we're gonna make
a deliberately bad movie.

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,674
No. It's gonna be, like, accidentally bad.

81
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,676
What's it about?

82
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,095
- I'm getting to that.
- Okay.

83
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,764
Ten seconds or it's round two.

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,933
Let's shave their pubes.

85
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
- Think of something.
- I'm trying.

86
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:16,357
- Seven, six, five, four...
- Well, um, I'm... how am I suppos...

87
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,402
- It's very complicated, intricate.
- ...three, two...

88
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,605
- I don't know.
- It's an alien invasion movie.

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,452
Totally.

90
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:32,123
Totally. Yeah. Alien invasion.
Like, um... Independence Day.

91
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:37,795
Right. And there's this
super-secret service-type, astronaut guy.

92
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,257
And he has to save
the President of the United States.

93
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,010
Who plays the President?

94
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,845
Um, a woman.

95
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,847
The President's a woman.

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,101
And he doesn't just save her, though.
He has to save everyone from the aliens.

97
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,230
There's this big space battle at the end.
And a smaller one in the middle.

98
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,150
Ooh! And there's this bad guy
space commander dude.

99
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,445
It's like really complex
and three-dimensional, Oliver.

100
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,238
- Does he die?
- No?

101
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,574
- He should die.
- Okay, great. He dies.

102
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,910
Barf!

103
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:14,207
Sounds like another
stupid action movie to me.

104
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,481
Well, there's one more thing.

105
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,965
Our hero, even though he wants
to save all of humanity from the aliens,

106
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,549
he can't...

107
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,844
because he's in love.

108
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,431
With one of the aliens.

109
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,815
So, even though it has
this sci-fi look, really...

110
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,775
It's a love story...

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,402
in space.

112
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,906
It's like, uh... like Romeo and Juliet,

113
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,659
just except they don't die.

114
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,994
They live happily ever after.

115
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,501
Well, sounds ambitious, but talk is cheap.

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,630
How do I know that you are
going to be able to pull this off?

117
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,675
You don't.

118
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,303
I guess you'll have to trust me.

119
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,847
Yes, I would.

120
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,018
But I don't trust anyone
I haven't had a drink with.

121
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,648
Start drinking.

122
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,193
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

123
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,612
- Oh, boy.
- Every last drop counts.

124
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,864
And... fini!

125
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,577
Can I admit one thing?

126
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,370
Okay, but just one.

127
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:40,334
Look, I know that what
Luke confessed to was bad,

128
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,755
but, um... I was kinda proud of him
for getting in trouble.

129
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh!

130
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,219
- That's a new one.
- Yeah. Kids need to mess up, right?

131
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,431
It builds character. It teaches lessons.

132
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,479
As the Principal of Boring High, I...

133
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,273
Well, my position is I disagree.

134
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,152
But as a human being...

135
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,070
absolutely.

136
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,489
- Thank you.
- Yes!

137
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,451
I bet you never got in trouble
when you were a kid.

138
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,744
Oh...

139
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,953
No.

140
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,997
Never.

141
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,082
Huh. I was always very good.

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,709
I wasn't.

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,881
But I had Luke when I was in high school,
and that straightened me out pretty quick.

144
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,178
Is there anything you wish you did?

145
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,931
Like what?

146
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,974
Like, something bad.

147
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,893
Something that would get you in trouble.

148
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,687
Mm. Not really.

149
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,859
I mean...

150
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,488
there is... there is one thing.

151
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,324
Tell me.

152
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,787
Oh.

153
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,917
I always wanted to throw
toilet paper on a house.

154
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,504
You better keep it down, Ken.

155
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,258
You do not want people to know
that you have never TP'd a house?!

156
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,342
Never.

157
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,636
Just sounds like so much fun.

158
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,726
Got any enemies?

159
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,278
Do that again!

160
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,071
Has he ever had a drink before?

161
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,490
Do you even know your boyfriend?

162
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,286
All right, guys.
I got your trust now?

163
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,664
Do you want to make this movie?
'Cause hey, it's all good.

164
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,750
No, no, no. Not quite yet.

165
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,129
How about have another
while we think about it?

166
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:55,094
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

167
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,182
All righty then!

168
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,143
Chug! Chug! Chug!

169
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,498
Mr. Messner!

170
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,626
Dylan. Dylan Barker.

171
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,544
Class of '91?

172
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,755
Uh, hi, Dylan.

173
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,550
Charmin. Nice. Quality wipes.

174
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,054
Two-ply, for sure.

175
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,058
Always two-ply. I mean,
what are we, animals?

176
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,352
Um...

177
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,317
Hey, Mr. M,
you mind me saying something?

178
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,653
Of course not, Dylan. What?

179
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,615
It's just that,
all those times I f'd up in school.

180
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,076
All those times
I should have been expelled,

181
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,578
and you sat me down
and talked straight shit.

182
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,915
- You don't have to get into any of that.
- I was a dumb-ass.

183
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,793
Most people in your position
would've bounced me,

184
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,920
but you took the time.

185
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,383
You talked me through it.
I wouldn't have graduated if not for you.

186
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,259
And look at me now.

187
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,763
And I'm not being ironic.

188
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,598
The way I see it,

189
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,142
one day you're slinging hot dogs
and butt wipes,

190
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,436
and the next day, you run the place.

191
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,271
That's because of you.

192
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,857
Well, thank you, Dylan.

193
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,360
No. Thank you, Mr. M.

194
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,198
How much do I owe you?

195
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,285
Wow. You kinda changed
Dylan Barker's life, Mr. M.

196
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,495
No.

197
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,788
Yeah, you did.

198
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,709
You motivate those kids.
Motivate them to get their lives in order.

199
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,877
I suppose.

200
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,048
While I motivate people
to, um, stow their tray tables

201
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,884
and put their seats
in the upright position.

202
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,553
No, you do more than that.

203
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,055
You hand out peanuts.

204
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,350
And those little bags
that are impossible to open.

205
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,855
- Sorry. No, I...
- Yeah. I'm just kidding.

206
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:15,359
It's okay.
I just think it's pretty sweet.

207
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,698
You ready?

208
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,324
Hell, yeah.

Ken?

222
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,389
Ken!

223
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,183
I can see your car.

224
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,435
Oh!

225
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,604
Seriously?

226
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,440
Very mature!

227
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,361
I can hear you!

228
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,157
I'm going to sleep.

229
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,621
This had better be gone in the morning,
or so help me...

230
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,798
So...

231
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,342
we went out a few times.

232
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,975
And the aliens will have blue faces!

233
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,396
Now, I know what everybody's thinking,
"Luke, aliens are always green!"

234
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,357
Not ours! Ours will be blue.

235
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,903
Oh, and we'll shoot it at Dominguez Rocks!

236
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,656
And what is Dominguez Rocks?

237
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,743
You've never been to Dominguez Rocks?

238
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,582
Neither have I. It's in California.
I have a poster of it in my room!

239
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,418
It's been
in so many classic sci-fi flicks.

240
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,753
It's these rocks.
They're all colorful and stuff.

241
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,883
And it totally looks like another planet.
Mm-hmm.

242
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, wait. I have an announcement.
I have an announcement, okay?

243
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:51,265
I wanna give it up to one special person
and that is my girlfriend Kate.

244
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,476
She helped me come up
with this entire thing.

245
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,230
My girlfriend is the greatest!

246
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,651
Give it up for Kate, everybody.

247
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,154
I want another Zima.

248
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,490
- Come with me.
- Whoo!

249
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,077
Yes! Whoo! Zima. Whoo!

250
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,537
Everybody sing along.

251
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,049
How long you known this kid?

252
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,217
Luke?

253
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,095
Um, pretty much forever.

254
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,182
What's his deal?

255
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,392
H-His deal?

256
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:41,231
Yeah, his deal. Is he Meisner?
Is he Stanislavsky? Come on.

257
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,655
Um, a lil... a little bit of both.
With some Kevin Smith mixed in.

258
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,074
- Nice.
- Yeah.

259
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,661
We made a movie this summer:
Ace Ventura and the Temple of Gravy.

260
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,454
- It was good.
- It sounds stupid.

261
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,208
Who was Ace?

262
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,961
- I played him, actually.
- You?

263
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,007
So, then you like Jim Carrey?

264
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
He's okay.

265
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,889
Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor
of our time.

266
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,351
Oh, y-yeah. I mean, totally.
He should... He should win an Oscar.

267
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,852
No, he will.

268
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,980
You think he won't?

269
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,899
- No, no, no, no, I-I think he should.
- He will.

270
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,821
Which one are you, again?

271
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
Tyler?

272
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
No.

273
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,617
Don't throw it away like that.

274
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,995
It's your name. You only get one of them.

275
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,164
Actually, I have four.
Tyler Edward Randolph Bowen.

276
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,290
So, then say it!

277
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,583
Tyler!

278
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,883
We'll work on it.

279
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,222
Whoo, whoo! All right!

280
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,855
Spin the bottle, anyone?

281
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,609
Tonight was a blast.

282
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,363
Yeah, I think it was one
of the most fun nights of my entire life.

283
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,287
So, thanks for dinner, Ken.

284
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,705
Thank you.

285
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,253
So...

286
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll see ya.

287
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,224
Okay.

288
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,937
Hey, uh, Ken.

289
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,397
Yeah.

290
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,152
We don't need to tell the kids
about this, right?

291
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,155
There's really nothing to tell.

292
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,365
Totally.

293
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,201
Okay.

294
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,368
Bye.

295
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,104
Rules are whoever it lands on

296
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,524
has to go into the prop closet
for Seven Minutes in Heaven.

297
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,529
No apple-bobbing,
cherry-picking or pumpkin-patching.

298
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,325
Tongue is encouraged, but not required.

299
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,045
Ladies first.

300
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,674
I'm not playing.

301
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,592
If you're here, you're playing.

302
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,970
Unless you're afraid.

303
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,807
We're not afraid.

304
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,022
Come on.

305
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,798
Well, well, well.

306
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,012
Ugh.

307
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,763
- Doesn't count.
- Why not?

308
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,057
It's two girls? Doesn't count.

309
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,310
It's fine by me.

310
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,686
All right. My turn.

311
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,505
Smells like wet dog in here.

312
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,967
I don't mind it.

313
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,722
So...

314
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,516
I should... I should put on some lip gloss.

315
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,894
- Oh.
- Obviously.

316
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,728
Duh.

317
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
I've never kissed a girl.

318
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,078
In case I suck.

319
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,164
S-So, you know why.

320
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,607
Wow.

321
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,237
Wow.

322
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,656
I think I'm a lesbian.

323
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
What?

324
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,998
Time's up, perverts.

325
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,625
While you were sucking face,

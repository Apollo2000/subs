1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,679
So I made him
show me his dick.

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,597
And then, I swear to God,

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,852
his dick was pierced
right through the tip. Yeah!

4
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,896
And then I told Oliver about it,
and he got so mad.

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,528
Oh, God.
My boobs are so huge right now!

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,573
Every time I get my period,
they quadruple in size.

7
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:35,035
Look at them, I'm serious.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,830
- Feel them! They're like swollen.
- Ew, gross. Get away.

9
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,501
Hey, sweetie.

10
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,090
You wanna feel 'em?

11
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,385
What?

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,685
Oh, my God!

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,730
Did anyone just see that?

14
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,358
Kate Messner just touched my boobs!

15
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,778
She seriously just grabbed them!

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,156
Lesbo much?

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,585
♪ Funny how we run around ♪

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,631
♪ And see what we got ♪

19
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,717
♪ We don't even know what it is we found ♪

20
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,346
Hello.

21
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,306
Hey, Mom.

22
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,600
Hey.

23
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,853
Wow!

24
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,272
- What's the occasion?
- There's no occasion.

25
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,983
Babe, you just made my day.

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,445
Child protective services drop by?

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,157
Yep. They always do,
and the fake mustache worked like a charm.

28
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,743
- How's school?
- Coolio.

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,162
I joined the A/V club.

30
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,541
Coolio. I bet you fit right in.

31
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,211
- And I'm dissecting a frog in science.
- Ugh.

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,379
Named it "Gorf."

33
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,424
- How'd you come up with that?
- Well, it's "frog" spelled backwards.

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,637
Oh. Duh. Well, rest in peace, Gorf.

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,518
And I, uh... met someone.

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,856
A girl.

37
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,192
Really?

38
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,154
Well, tell me about her.

39
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,656
Okay.

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,991
She's in A/V.

41
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,326
She's really artistic.

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,290
But... not in an obvious way, just... is.

43
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,627
And she's really into music
and really pretty.

44
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,090
She is all that and a bag of chips.

45
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,511
Sounds like it.

46
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,221
Yeah.

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,309
Yeah, I think I'm gonna ask her out.
I just gotta figure out how.

48
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,851
Any ideas?

49
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,439
Well, I don't know.

50
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,943
Hey, I hope...

51
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
I hope you'll be safe.

52
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,413
Oh! Oh, no. Mom, how did you
get that from me saying that...

53
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,956
- I know...
- Oh, ew.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,375
You think you're not,
but you're at that age.

55
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,420
And sometimes in high school,
we forget to look before we leap...

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,965
like Gorf.

57
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,468
Or...

58
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,262
like when you got pregnant with me?

59
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,225
Mmm.

60
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,852
- I did not mean it like that.
- Yeah.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,853
Mm-hmm. Gotcha.

62
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,774
Luke, you're the best thing
that's happened to me, you know that?

63
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,903
Okay, look.
You know what I think you should do?

64
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,986
What?

65
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,698
I think, when the time is right,

66
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,409
you should tell her exactly how you feel.

67
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,955
And you do it
in the most "you" way possible.

68
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,874
Thanks, Mom.

69
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,084
So...

70
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,544
what's her name?

71
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,188
For lunch today, Sloppy Joes.

72
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,442
But personally, I think
they should be called Sloppy Scotts

73
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,736
on a Jessica Betts bun.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,948
- Oh, my God. You are so inappropriate.
- Those are your morning announcements.

75
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,574
Have a Boring day.

76
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,868
And we're clear.

77
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,998
Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,081
I know.

79
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,127
Hey, focus working okay?

80
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,879
Oh, yeah. It's fine.

81
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,759
Oh, wait! I was thinking.

82
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,763
- Maybe you could come over...
- I got to get to geometry.

83
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,981
Next time, Luke.

84
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,365
Is he trying to open
that Surge with his mind?

85
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,034
No, he's just upset with me.

86
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
That's an understatement.

87
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,039
He's going to ask out Kate Messner
because she called him cute.

88
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,624
- Holy shit. How you gonna do it?
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,293
I don't know. Any ideas?

90
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,879
Do it while jumping out of a plane
without a parachute.

91
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,547
Wait, that's what you're doing.

92
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,259
Remember in Point Break when he jumps
without a chute? He's like, "Gee-yah"!

93
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,552
Then he jumps.

94
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,971
He breaks both his knees,
but it turns out okay.

95
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,265
- He does not say "gee-yah."
- I think he does.

96
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,268
Is that before or after
he gets his best friend killed?

97
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,561
Will you stop it, McQuaid?

98
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,230
She's really nice and smart.

99
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,817
You'd like her if you weren't
so judgmental all the time.

100
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,278
Seriously, I might have a chance
with this girl.

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,113
You could be happy for me.

102
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,283
My apologies. You have my support.

103
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,409
Thanks.

104
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,704
Where is your lady love?

105
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:19,420
Did you hear Kate Messner totally
felt-up Emaline Addario during gym?

106
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,964
I always knew there was
something weird about that girl.

107
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,468
If Kate's really a lesbian,
does that mean she has AIDS?

108
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,969
Like the guy from Real World?

109
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,137
- Yeah.
- Probably.

110
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,515
This is kinda freaking me out.

111
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,434
It should.
I wouldn't even let her breathe on me.

112
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,563
Will Kate Messner please report
to the principal's office?

113
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,691
Kate Messner,
please report to the principal's office.

114
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, my God.

115
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,202
Unbelievable.

116
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,831
Harlot!

117
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,042
Fallen woman! Street walker!

118
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,628
Say, what?

119
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,589
Pretty much everyone's been saying

120
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,259
you got felt up by some chick
in the girl's locker room.

121
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,178
Yawn, yesterday's goss.

122
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,139
Is it true?

123
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,558
Is it true?

124
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,521
'Tis true.

125
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,066
God damn it.

126
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,903
A lady's touch upon my bosom hath awoken

127
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,615
such curious
and mysterious feelings within me!

128
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,076
I'm not playing a scene with you now,
okay, Emaline?

129
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,205
Oh, how my heart yearns for her!

130
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,416
How my loins quake!

131
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,793
How free I feel on this merry day!

132
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,172
You know, this is why
you'll never be a good actress. Okay?

133
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,468
You're out of touch with your inner truth,
you can't have a genuine conversation.

134
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,179
Honestly, I feel bad for you.

135
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,432
Well, you have a tiny dick.

136
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,725
Oh!

137
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,979
We're done. All right?
It's over, that's it.

138
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,897
Fine.

139
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,815
Oh!

140
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,651
Bitch!

141
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,778
My grandma gave me those.

142
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,114
She has diabetes!

143
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,578
Dad?

144
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,040
Kate Messner! Come on in!

145
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,041
What do you want?

146
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,711
You asked me to treat you like
any other student, so I am. Take a seat.

147
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,176
Janitor Steve informed me

148
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,388
about some crassly worded vandalism,

149
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,558
graffiti really, that showed up
on a locker this morning.

150
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,685
Turns out that locker was yours.

151
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,105
It said "Dyke,"

152
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,234
which is a derogatory term

153
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,821
- for when a woman has romantic...
- I know what it means.

154
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:55,117
Okay. I'm just trying to figure out
who did this. Yeah.

155
00:08:55,201 --> 00:09:00,665
You know, has anyone been mean
or picking on ya recently?

156
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,750
I mean, why would someone do that?

157
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,046
Because people are stupid.

158
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,263
Hey, sweetie, uh...

159
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,974
I wouldn't take it personally.

160
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,726
I bet they didn't even know
whose locker it was.

161
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,233
Everything else okay?

162
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,776
Yeah.

163
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,364
Okay.

164
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,869

For today's video installment

221
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,492
of the Life and Times
of Mr. Leroy O'Neil,

222
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:52,414
that's me, I want to say
a few words about gratitude.

223
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,085
Some days it feels like life's gone
to shit.

224
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,965
Days like today,
where I'm just happy to be alive.

225
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:06,095
I'm healthy. I have a job.
I have a woman and my son,

226
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,097
little Luke'em Nuke'em.

227
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,685
He might be the smartest,
most passionate little man on this planet.

228
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,272
He's five. Kid's blowing my mind.

229
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,066
Leroy, hey, dinner's ready.

230
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,568
Come in.

231
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,320

- Look at you.

Come here.

233
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,241

- Okay. Hi.

234
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,659
I love you.

235
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,452
I love you, too.

- Are you recording this?

238
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,667
Leroy, I look like a train wreck.

239
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,752
Hey, you look beautiful.

240
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,796
Smooth talker.

Dinnertime.

242

This may not be the life that, uh,
that I imagined for myself,

Hey, Leslie.

249
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,424
I heard something about you today.

250
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,635
Something upsetting.

251
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,347
Are you a homo?

252
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,350
No! That's ridiculous.

253
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
Of course it is!

254

I mean, ew, gross.

255
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,900
Either way, I hope you overcome this.

256
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,277
I'll pray for you.

257
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,445
Thanks.

What's on it?

260
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,247
Can't tell you that.

261
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,835
- Come on. Is it inappropriate?
- No.

262
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,630
- All right. What's in it for me?
- Really?

263
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,713
Yeah.

264
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,633

- One sec.

265
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,009

- Luke.

266
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,719
- Just...
- All right.

267
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,390
Six pack of Jolt?

268
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,687
- Was that so hard?
- Thank you.

269
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,356
New information has come to light,

270
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,985
and your odds with Kate
are potentially compromised.

271
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,195
I think you should reconsider doing this.

272
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,780
What are you talking about?

273
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,533
New information. It's just a rumor.

274
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,036
- It's probably garb. But I just heard...
- Ooh, you're jealous.

275
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,497
Jealous?

276
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,957
Yes. Jealous.

277
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,167
That's why you've been negative
about this, right?

278
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,961
That's absurd. I'm always negative.

279
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,132
Listen, we're still gonna be friends
after I get a girlfriend.

280
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,884
You just gotta stop worrying so much.

281
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,013
Oh, man!
Everyone's gonna shit when they see this!

1
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:12,603
My father had a method.

2
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:14,537
Even when
he disposed of his victims,

3
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,174
he-he never destroyed his work.

4
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:18,702
His ego wouldn't let him.

5
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:22,726
He never tried to dissolve
or burn the bodies.

6
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:28,636
Whatever he did to you,
he would have preserved it.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,570
He liked knowing
you were out there.

8
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,504
How many times
have we been over this?

9
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,132
Find me.

10
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:39,240
I know, I know.

11
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:42,405
Your location
has to be somewhere here,

12
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:43,570
but I-I...

13
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:45,165
I'm missing it.

14
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,174
We've checked the cabin,
the woods,

15
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:49,603
his disposal sites,

16
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:51,471
the tunnels
underneath the town house.

17
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,636
Find me.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,603
I'm dead, Malcolm.

19
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,603
My sister over there?

20
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,273
She doesn't know where I am.

21
00:00:58,297 --> 00:00:59,570
Neither do you.

22
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,339
Only one man does.

23
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,669
Stop running from him.

24
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:07,627
You know what you have to do.

25
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:37,438
What? What is it?

26
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,174
You found something?

27
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,264
No.

28
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,264
But I know what we have to do.

29
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:52,000
How would you like
to meet my father?

30
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,438
Malcolm, my dearest plus-one,

31
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:06,603
this is your mother.

32
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,702
I was just calling
to let you know

33
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,702
that since I am here alone,

34
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:13,570
I will be donating
all of your inheritance

35
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:16,108
to the Nicholas Endicott
Endowment for the Arts,

36
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:19,273
because I know
how much you love ballet.

37
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,702
Jessica Whitly?

38
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,603
I can't believe you're here.

39
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:27,207
You're so brave.

40
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,702
I love it.

41
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,405
Thank you, Cricket.

42
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,570
I was so sorry
to hear about Connor

43
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:35,570
and that admissions scandal.

44
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:38,042
- All that for Tufts.
- Oh!

45
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,372
Oh, yes, well,

46
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,603
at least nobody died.

47
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:42,735
Jessica,

48
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,438
- there you are.
- Oh.

49
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,504
Uh, Cricket,
will you give us a minute?

50
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:48,339
We're in the middle
of something.

51
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:54,504
Oh, you don't have to save
little old me.

52
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:56,603
Especially in the midst
of your hosting duties.

53
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:59,108
You are hardly
a damsel in distress.

54
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,372
Never have been.

55
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,207
Thank you, Nicholas.

56
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,702
When everyone else
left me out in the cold,

57
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,207
you always opened your door
to me.

58
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,174
Well, I don't believe in
guilt by association.

59
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,735
So, it's been too long.

60
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,438
Oh,
let's not do the math on that.

61
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:15,504
No, I mean we should catch up.

62
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,471
Really talk. Lunch?

63
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,174
That would be lovely.

64
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,735
- They're ready for you.
- Thank you. My apologies.

65
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,504
No one told me there'd be
public speaking,

66
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,009
and now I can't get out of it.

67
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,339
- Mr. Endicott, a picture?
- Oh!

68
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,174
- Come find me later.
- Mmm.

69
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,471
<i>Tell me quick,</i>

70
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,339
Good evening.

71
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,405
Thank you all for coming.

72
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:47,570
Now, I know you didn't come here
just for the canapés.

73
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,669
You came to find out

74
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,438
where your money's going.

75
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,603
So it is my honor to introduce

76
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:56,570
Manhattan City Ballet Company's
prima, Fiona Vara,

77
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,702
and our newest star,
Javier Suarez,

78
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,636
making his American debut.

79
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,207
They'll be dancing a pas de deux

80
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:06,372
from their upcoming production
<i>Scheherazade.</i>

81
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,108
You know your mom
called this in, right?

82
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,438
Hmm, you think she's hanging out
with the wrong crowd?

83
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,669
- If you need to go find her...
- No.

84
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:06,240
I was supposed to be
her plus-one.

85
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,009
If she sees me here,
I could be the next victim.

86
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,438
Hey. You can't touch the stage.

87
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,207
There's a body on it.

88
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,702
Floor's property of the theater.

89
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:15,702
And now it's evidence.

90
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:18,165
Come on. You heard her.

91
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:22,042
Edrisa.
Have we learned anything?

92
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,042
Uh, facial discoloration,
pupil dilation

93
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,570
and heavy blood viscosity
are all classic traits

94
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,108
of a death by poisoning.

95
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,471
- Ah.
- We have any idea how it got

96
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,702
- into his system?
- Not yet.

97
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,174
But based on the severity
of his reaction,

98
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,174
he should've felt the effects
before he took the stage.

99
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,438
But witnesses said
that he danced

100
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:37,603
up until his very last breath.

101
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,669
Well, elite dancers
master cognitive methods

102
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,240
to tolerate discomfort.

103
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,009
Even acute pain.

104
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,306
Well, no one else is sick,

105
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,306
so it's not the shrimp cocktail.

106
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,471
It's a targeted killing.

107
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,207
And a high-profile one, too.

108
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:52,330
This guy defected from Cuba
eight weeks ago.

109
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:54,174
It could've been a hit job.
Assassination by poison?

110
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:58,207
That sounds like a spy novel.

111
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,438
Welcome to 2020.

112
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,726
Can't rule anything out.

113
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,075
I'm so
sorry you had to see that.

114
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,405
It was terrible.

115
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,438
Sorry to interrupt.

116
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,009
Oh, Gil, you're here.

117
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,438
I didn't know who else to call.

118
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:20,306
Have you met Nicholas Endicott?

119
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,306
Not yet.

120
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,693
Lieutenant Gil Arroyo.

121
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:26,075
I have a few questions for you,
if you don't mind. Whatever you need.

122
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,273
I was just trying to raise
some money for the arts,

123
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,570
and then... this.

124
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,528
- It's-it's devastating.
- Oh.

125
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,042
Did you know Javier?

126
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,735
I guess I could be considered
one of his patrons.

127
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,000
I helped him settle here.

128
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:47,405
So, as his patron,

129
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:48,669
it wasn't just professional?

130
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,306
You had a personal connection
with him?

131
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,570
I had a personal connection

132
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,207
with just about
everyone here tonight.

133
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,438
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.

134
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:59,669
- He's just doing his job.
- Hmm.

135
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:01,702
Isn't that right, Gil?

136
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:03,372
Yep.

137
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:05,042
Just doing my job.

138
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,636
Where is Malcolm Bright?

139
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,306
Oh, my gosh, Bright.
It's your mom!

140
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,636
Ah, Mrs. Whitly.

141
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,108
- It's such a... Okay.
- Malcolm.

142
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,471
I should've known
it would take a murder

143
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,042
for you to show up
for your mother.

144
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,603
Uh, excuse us, please, Edrisa.

145
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:21,009
Sure. No, yeah.
We can all hang later.

146
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,306
Mother, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it here for this.

147
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,009
Wait, are you apologizing
for standing me up

148
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,528
or because you missed
your chance to witness a murder?

149
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,306
Oh, forget it.

150
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,273
I'm guessing you were with her?

151
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:36,306
Eve?

152
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,009
Yes. I'm trying to help her.

153
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,264
It's the least
our family can do.

154
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,264
I know.

155
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,207
I just...

156
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,603
I don't want you
to do anything too extreme.

157
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:52,306
What would you consider extreme?

158
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,735
Okay, fine.

159
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,537
Just tell me
that whatever you're planning,

160
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,603
it doesn't involve your father.

161
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,264
Can you do that?

162
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,132
No, I can't.

163
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,438
<i>You've signed
a hold harmless agreement,</i>

164
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:16,735
<i>which indemnifies Claremont
</i><i>from any physical harm</i>

165
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,174
<i>and/or mental distress.</i>

166
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,570
I need your confirmation

167
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,174
that you are not
in the possession

168
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:26,207
of any cell phones,
recording devices or weapons.

169
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:28,009
Y-Yes. Nothing like that.

170
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,735
Dr. Whitly will be
in his restraints,

171
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,042
but he is considered
to be aggressive, unpredictable

172
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,660
and highly dangerous.
You understand?

173
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,075
You're gonna be fine.

174
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,702
But just remember,

175
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:45,726
whatever you do,
do not step across the red line.

176
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:58,042
Dr. Whitly.

177
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,594
I'd like you to meet someone.

178
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,132
Eve Blanchard.

179
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,702
My boy.

180
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:11,264
Finally, I get to meet
the special lady in your life.

181
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,264
You're prettier than I imagined.

182
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,132
To what do I owe the pleasure?

183
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,306
Well, don't be shy.

184
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,339
I know meeting the parents
can be a bit intimidating,

185
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,570
but trust me,

186
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,330
I'm a pussy cat
compared to his mother.

187
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,627
Eve?

188
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,537
Well, that's one way
to make a first impression.

189
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:01,174
She seems great.

190
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,207
The girl in the box
that Malcolm found.

191
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:05,372
Her name was Sophie Sanders.

192
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,471
Huh? How do you know that?

193
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:08,075
She was my sister.

194
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,165
Where is she?

195
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,570
I'm afr...

196
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,726
I'm afraid I don't know.

197
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,033
You were wrong.
This was a waste of time.

198
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:23,372
Your son thought that you
would tell me the truth.

199
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:25,099
But I knew better.

200
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:28,570
You're not
some self-styled genius.

201
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,273
It's all fake. Pretend.

202
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,702
You're not a surgeon.

203
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,504
You're not a father.

204
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,174
- You're not even a man.
- Eve.

205
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:39,735
You are a void.

206
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,537
A hole that consumes anyone
unfortunate enough to meet you.

207
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,207
Like your son. Like my sister.

208
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:49,033
I've told you all I can.

209
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,306
Malcolm, wait.

210
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,471
You don't understand.

211
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,273
You need to leave this alone.

212
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,075
I'm done.

213
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:04,372
When you're ready
to tell the truth, I'll be back.

214
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,594
No, you're not listening to me.
Malcolm!

215
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,240
How'd I do?

216
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:15,207
You were... brilliant.

217
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:19,174
For the first time
in a long time, he looked...

218
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:20,471
rattled.

219
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:22,075
That's a good thing, right?

220
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,075
Malignant narcissists
like my father thrive on supply.

221
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,108
- Supply?
- They need to feel relevant,

222
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,273
needed, hated, loved,
it doesn't matter.

223
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:33,504
They need to be... fed.

224
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,306
We just cut him off.

225
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,471
When he gets desperate enough,
he'll give us what we want.

226
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,075
I hope you're right.

227
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,627
I don't know
if I can do that again.

228
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,009
<i>Did you know that</i>

229
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:58,009
when he arrived in the city,
<i>The New York Times</i>

230
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:02,528
called Javier Suarez "The Most
Beautiful Man in New York"?

231
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:05,132
I disagreed.

232
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,372
What's this?
Did someone punch him?

233
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,372
Possibly, but dancers

234
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:14,372
do sustain a lot
of unusual injuries.

235
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:16,240
I once autopsied
an exotic dancer who

236
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:19,141
caught a stiletto in her neck,
and it crushed her trachea.

237
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,504
Tell me
about these injection marks.

238
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,075
Ah. Good eye.

239
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,570
So, Javier suffered
from tendinopathy,

240
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,042
also known as "jumper's knee."

241
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,273
The tox screen showed cortisone
in his system,

242
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:33,174
as well as our cause of death:

243
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,273
oleandrin.

244
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,108
Oleander flower.

245
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,570
One of the most accessible
homicidal poisons in the world.

246
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,570
Which means
it'll be untraceable.

247
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,471
If someone had access
to Javier's cortisone,

248
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,009
they could've laced his shot.

249
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,306
Poisoners are a particular type
of killer.

250
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,471
They don't derive any pleasure
from their murders.

251
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,702
They don't need
to feel the blood on their hands

252
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,174
or watch the victim's life
drain from their eyes.

253
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,273
They keep their distance
and kill for utility.

254
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,108
Like an assassination.

255
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,702
If it was the Cubans,
they'd probably use

256
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:02,306
a far more efficient poison.

257
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,504
I know I would.

258
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,702
Okay.
Then who are we looking for?

259
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:09,702
We're likely looking for someone
who killed for financial reward,

260
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,636
or to maintain
a comfortable lifestyle.

261
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,108
A classic comfort-gain killer.

262
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:17,273
The killer will have a history
of theft, larceny or fraud.

263
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,009
They can also wait years
before killing again.

264
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,240
We have to find them
before the trail goes cold.

265
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:24,042
Who stood to gain
from Javier's death?

266
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,603
I looked into the dance company.

267
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:27,273
Javier replaced Joseph Krieg,

268
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:30,042
who was something called
a "danseur noble."

269
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,009
<i>Noble.
</i>That's the lead male dancer.

270
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:35,504
My mother took me
to the ballet a lot as a kid.

271
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,976
So, Joseph Krieg

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,537
loses his spot to Javier,

273
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:42,009
then poisons him
to get back on stage.

274
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,009
I assume
there aren't a whole bunch

275
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,297
of danseur noble running around.

276
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,504
All right.

277
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,702
Let's go get some culture.

278
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,372
Okay, everybody, back to one.

279
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,438
Bright, you and Powell,
go find Mr. Krieg.

280
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,273
JT and I will talk
to the company,

281
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:13,174
see if anyone else wanted
Javier out.

282
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,438
<i>This
is Bright. Leave a message.</i>

283
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:23,471
Son, it's... Dad.

284
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,570
Hey, look,

285
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:30,240
I know our last visit, uh...

286
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,207
could have gone better, but, um,

287
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,537
please call.

288
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:36,174
I read about the murder
of that ballet dancer.

289
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,042
Love to share
some theories with you.

290
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,132
Please.

291
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,594
It's important.

292
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,372
Joseph Krieg?

293
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,174
We just have a few questions.

294
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:56,636
What was it?

295
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,306
Rotator cuff or labrum?

296
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,306
What it is, is the final "screw
you" from my former partner.

297
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,603
<i>Fiona Vara?</i>

298
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,108
Lost her balance during a lift,

299
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,372
wrapped her leg
around my arm, and pop.

300
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:10,009
Next thing I know,

301
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,976
some fresh-off-the-boat
commie has my job.

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,471
You get those bruises
from hitting Javier?

303
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,702
We heard you two had words.

304
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:19,537
We might have gotten into it.

305
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,108
Doesn't make me a killer.

306
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,042
Doesn't make you innocent,
either.

307
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,570
Everyone loved Javier...
maybe a little too much.

308
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,702
You two were
romantically involved?

309
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:33,108
Romantically?

310
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,438
There's nothing romantic
about it.

311
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:37,207
Dancers live by a code.

312
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:42,009
Pirouettes,
cigarettes, easy sex.

313
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,207
No regrets.

314
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:45,471
<i>I guess that's why</i>

315
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,702
you're not mourning his death.

316
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,207
If I wanted to kill the guy,

317
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,339
I'd wait till my two months
of rehab was up.

318
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:53,372
If you find whoever killed him,
tell them their timing sucks.

319
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:54,702
But if you want suspects,

320
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:57,141
Javier slept with half the women
in this company.

321
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,405
And believe me,
those divas are unstable.

322
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,438
Uh... code aside,

323
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,075
you both need to account

324
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:08,042
for your whereabouts
on the day Javier was killed.

325
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,264
Or you could just look
at my Insta.

326
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,438
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

327
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:15,009
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

328
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,240
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, whoa.

329
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:18,042
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- My eyes!

330
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,504
- What's going on?
- Hey, hey. - They're on fire!

331
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,603
- No! Oh, my God! No!
- Stay here.

332
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,207
What happened?

333
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,471
It's her eyes.

334
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:33,669
Capsaicin.

335
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,471
- As in pepper spray?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,669
Uh, Dani, get some milk.

337
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,174
JT, see if you can find
some dish soap.

338
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,438
Shh. Suzie, listen.

339
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,537
I need to get
your contacts out now.

340
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,669
If I don't,
you may lose your sight forever.

341
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:47,976
- Do you have an airbrush?
- Yes.

342
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,603
Uh, Gil, hold her eyes open.

343
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:52,372
I'm right here. I'm right here.

344
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:55,570
Okay. One, two, three.

345
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,132
Okay.

346
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,339
Okay, here.

347
00:17:06,363 --> 00:17:07,570
Put this on your eyes.

348
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,240
First poisoning, now blinding.

349
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:10,339
What is happening?

350
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,570
We're locking this theater down.

351
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:15,000
With any luck,
the killer's here.

352
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:21,570
Tights lined with straight pins.

353
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:24,976
Toe shoes stuffed
with shards of glass.

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,132
Laxative-spiked oat milk.

355
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,042
I've raided drug dealers' houses

356
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,297
and turned up
less incriminating evidence!

357
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,240
Does anyone have anything
to say?

358
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,264
They're all yours.

359
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,174
Everyone!

360
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:44,504
Your attention.

361
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:47,570
My name is Malcolm Bright.

362
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,702
I'm a profiler.

363
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:54,207
I spend all of my time
studying killers.

364
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,702
Now, most killers can't hide
who they are.

365
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,339
If I push the right button...

366
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,042
I can tell.

367
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,174
But not you.

368
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,174
You're all trained

369
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,405
to hide your pain,

370
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,372
your fear, everything.

371
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,273
Lucky for me,

372
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,504
one of you recently handled

373
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,273
concentrated capsaicin,

374
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,702
a highly toxic substance

375
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,504
that contaminates anyone
who touches it.

376
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,504
And the pain...

377
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:27,438
should be kicking in

378
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:29,207
about now.

379
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:33,471
At first,
it's just a tingling sensation.

380
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,273
Then it turns to a burn.

381
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,669
And soon, your entire body feels

382
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:41,075
like it's crawling
with fire ants,

383
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,141
and it just gets worse
from there.

384
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,471
Gina?

385
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:48,273
It wasn't my idea.

386
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,537
Killing Javier?

387
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,471
No, not Javier.
I meant what happened to Suzie.

388
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,528
I didn't mean to.
I-I meant to just...

389
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:00,174
You did this for someone else. Who?

390
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:03,702
- Did they ask you to hurt Javier?
- No.

391
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,108
- I never would have done that.
- But you know who could?

392
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,306
Same person
that asked you to do this.

393
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,075
Where are they?

394
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,976
- Are they?
- She won't tell you.

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,636
She can't.

396
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,528
Her career will be over.

397
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:21,033
Well, who has that power?

398
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,603
The director?

399
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:25,537
Someone on the board?

400
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:28,372
That's who you think has power?

401
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:32,273
Of course. The prima.

402
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,330
Fiona.

403
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:42,174
Madam, I'm sorry to interrupt. It's him... again.

404
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,471
He's left multiple messages,
and I don't...

405
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,339
Fine.

406
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,759
I should have expected this.

407
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:58,009
Oh, Mr. David,
I do hope it was quick. A stroke maybe?

408
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:01,702
Or a heart attack wouldn't be
the worst thing, either.

409
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:05,141
Sorry to disappoint, my dear,
but I'm still quite alive.

410
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,471
Oh. Pity.

411
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,042
Well, I'm hanging up.

412
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,273
Wait! Listen to me.
You must... listen to me.

413
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:11,636
This is about our son.

414
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,976
Martin, stop being
a helicopter parent.

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,702
<i>He can solve his murders
</i><i>on his own.</i>

416
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,339
No, this is
about that girlfriend of his.

417
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,273
She's a bad influence.

418
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,471
<i>She struck me, Jessica.</i>

419
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,198
Me!

420
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,438
Did she?

421
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,207
Oh.

422
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,702
I like her even better now.

423
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,570
Are you... are you even
paying attention to me?

424
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:36,009
Truth be told,

425
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:40,306
I am distracted
photo on "Page Six." Oh.

426
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,075
I really thought
those earrings were too much,

427
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:46,471
but they just
set that dress off perfectly.

428
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,537
"Page Six"?
What are you talking about?

429
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,405
<i>Well, I'll be hanging up now,
but please do tell Mr. David</i>

430
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,405
<i>that I do not wish
to be contacted again</i>

431
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,141
<i>until it is time
to pick up your remains.</i>

432
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:57,273
<i>Ta-ta!</i>

433
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,702
<i>Well, could you help me</i>

434
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:09,306
Fiona.

435
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,405
A word?

436
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,240
Suzie's lucky.

437
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,306
Doctors say
she'll make a full recovery.

438
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,405
That is good news.

439
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,132
Suzie has quite a future
at the company.

440
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:24,306
Then why did you have Gina

441
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,000
try to blind her?

442
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:28,240
Gina's an idiot.

443
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,504
I wanted Suzie to stop sleeping
around with the new boys.

444
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:33,504
Gina was supposed to scare her,

445
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,273
not blind her.

446
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:36,372
So you admit it.

447
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,537
Perhaps we should do this

448
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:39,099
with your lawyer present.

449
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:44,000
Is... Suzie going
to press charges?

450
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,339
Thought so.

451
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,570
Rules of the jungle, right?

452
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:53,438
No one steps to the lioness.

453
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:56,627
And nothing happens at the
company without my knowledge.

454
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,627
Like killing Javier?

455
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:01,108
I would never hurt Javier.

456
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:05,009
After years
of being manhandled by Joseph,

457
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,438
I finally had
a world-class partner.

458
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:10,594
And I would
have done anything to keep him.

459
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,273
Keep him?

460
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:14,471
He just got here.

461
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:17,339
Javier wanted out
of his contract.

462
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:20,108
He upset
some very powerful people.

463
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,471
They made his escape from Cuba
possible.

464
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:25,000
Any idea who arranged all that?

465
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:33,000
His name is
all over this building.

466
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:36,264
Nicholas Endicott.

467
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,000
Jessica's friend?

468
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:42,000
The one and only.

469
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:49,264
If you could please wait here
for Mr. Endicott.

470
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:55,108
Take away the aspirated blood
and the body bag,

471
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,726
and this place is
really something.

472
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:00,174
Too much house for me.

473
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:02,471
It's like, "We get it."

474
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,372
Detective Arroyo.

475
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:05,702
You should have called first.

476
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:07,471
Uh, Malcolm Bright, consultant.

477
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:10,702
We're here with some additional
questions about Javier Suarez.

478
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:14,108
I'm not sure
there's anything more to say.

479
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:15,372
You could have mentioned
that you arranged

480
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:16,669
and bankrolled his defection.

481
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,042
I told you I was his patron.

482
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,174
Don't start being modest now.

483
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:21,372
You helped him escape.

484
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:23,306
Look,

485
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,108
I'm happy to make a statement

486
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,570
at a more convenient time
and with my lawyer present.

487
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:29,207
But right now, I've got company.

488
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:31,009
- So if you don't mind, I'd like...
- Cole!

489
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,570
Did you say
that you wanted that martini dry

490
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:34,669
or dirty?

491
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:36,372
Malcolm.

492
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:37,273
Mother.

493
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:38,702
Oh, I see.

494
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,702
M-Malcolm, your son
who works with the police.

495
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:45,273
Yes. Um, didn't I tell you that
he was working on this case?

496
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:47,099
No.

497
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,198
Jess, what are you doing here?

498
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:51,570
Jess and I had lunch.

499
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:54,570
Which...
<i>late.</i>

500
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:57,471
Um, so...

501
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,471
- who died this time?
- Well,

502
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,438
apparently, I'm a suspect

503
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,976
because I helped Javier
escape Cuba.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,339
And you went to all that trouble
just to kill him?

505
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:08,438
Apparently.

506
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:09,702
That's not what we're saying.

507
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:12,108
Javier was a world-class dancer.

508
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:15,570
He was trapped
in an authoritarian regime.

509
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,339
After he'd been
through so much trauma,

510
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:18,438
all he wanted was freedom.

511
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,570
What was Javier's trauma?

512
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:22,504
Javier was recruited
when he was nine

513
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:24,504
by Ballet Cultural de Cuba.

514
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:25,570
That's young.

515
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,438
Then, around '09,

516
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,075
their artistic director,
Ívan Castillo,

517
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,603
was accused of embezzling funds
by his own dancers.

518
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:34,702
Before he was arrested,

519
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:37,198
he'd murdered six of them.

520
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:39,009
The Ballet was ruined,

521
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,438
and Javier's promising career

522
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:41,702
was over before it began.

523
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,528
Until you helped him escape.

524
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:48,009
I don't believe
our pasts should define us.

525
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:52,339
Do you know how the six dancers
were killed?

526
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:55,108
Poison. That's how Castillo
killed his dancers back in Cuba.

527
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:57,240
Via my contacts
in Hudson County,

528
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,174
aka Havana on the Hudson.

529
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:01,372
Wait.

530
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:02,405
JT.

531
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,570
Juan Tarmel.

532
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:06,372
No, but thanks for playing.

533
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,042
A few local journalists

534
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,570
filled us in on what happened
at the Ballet Cultural.

535
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:13,339
It was a big deal at the time.

536
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,132
What's on your mind, boss?

537
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,702
Poison.

538
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:22,108
So, we think Castillo's our guy?

539
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:26,636
Yeah, but the Cuban Dirección
de Inteligencia said

540
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,636
he died trying
to escape the country.

541
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,702
What happened to Javier
afterward?

542
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:32,042
After those six dancers died,

543
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,042
he became the principal
overnight.

544
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,207
Other ballet companies
were suspicious.

545
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,976
Maybe Javier's death was revenge
for what happened back in Cuba.

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,471
Javier wanted out of New York.

547
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,471
Something spooked him.

548
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,240
Or someone.

549
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:46,471
Good thing we know who to ask.

550
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:49,537
Nothing happens
without her knowing.

551
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,594
The lioness.

552
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,240
Well, this hasn't gone
how I planned it.

553
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:17,240
Not your fault.

554
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:18,603
It's mine.

555
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:23,033
You-you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

556
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,759
♪ Kids.

557
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,570
Oh, I have to apologize

558
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:35,042
for not showing you
the care you deserve.

559
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:38,702
Now...

560
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,372
Any last words?

561
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,339
Quickly, please.

562
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,976
<i>Isn't that the way</i>

563
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,108
Perhaps a new approach
is in order.

564
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:56,042
<i>And give me the number</i>

565
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:59,504
<i>So I can call just to tell 'em</i>

566
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:09,702
<i>I only wish my words</i>

567
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,141
<i>But that's not the way</i>

568
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,570
See?

569
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:36,108
You don't step to the lioness.

570
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,042
Okay, let's take a break.

571
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,570
Back in ten.

572
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,372
How's the new danseur noble?

573
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:44,570
Amateur hour.

574
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,207
Javier would be horrified.

575
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:49,495
We heard about what happened
at his company in Cuba.

576
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:52,174
Seems he had
a checkered past of sorts.Rumors.

577
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,702
They can hurt a dancer more
than a broken bone.

578
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:58,273
And yet you were willing
to take a chance on Javier

579
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,669
when nobody else would.

580
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:02,759
People think being in charge
is some sort of prize.

581
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:04,042
A gift. It's a burden.

582
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,174
For years, Javier worked himself
to the bone

583
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:09,042
and made that company
his burden.

584
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:12,438
That's not something
a backstabbing killer would do.

585
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:15,033
He had too much heart.

586
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:17,627
You had feelings for him?

587
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:19,693
I did.

588
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,141
So when he said
he was leaving...

589
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,240
It was a surprise.

590
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:28,405
He was always so focused
on the future before.

591
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:30,603
"Before."

592
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:32,372
So there was a change.

593
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,570
Yeah.

594
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:37,108
His, uh, performance was off.

595
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:38,976
- But I thought...
- Not his technique.

596
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,636
He was freaking transcendent.

597
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,207
I mean his...

598
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:45,570
performance.

599
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:48,042
He couldn't get on pointe,
if you get my meaning.

600
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:51,570
When exactly did things start
to change between you two,

601
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:53,438
sexually speaking?

602
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,174
About two weeks ago.

603
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:59,306
When we moved to the theater
to start tech.

604
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,660
I thought it was stage fright.

605
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:06,636
So if I've shared
enough embarrassing details

606
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,339
about my sex life,

607
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,099
can I go?

608
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,132
Hey, Fiona.

609
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,174
Be good.

610
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,976
It's hard to be good

611
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,330
when you're so much better
than everyone else.

612
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,570
Javier was the highest profile
defector since Rudolf Nureyev.

613
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:43,702
How do you know so much
about ballet?

614
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:46,976
He was the toast of New York.

615
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,108
Then something scared him enough

616
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,438
that he wanted
to leave the city.

617
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,174
Maybe he was homesick.

618
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:56,306
Sounds like he made the company
back in Cuba his whole life.

619
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,372
You're right.

620
00:30:57,396 --> 00:31:00,174
Javier did have family,

621
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:03,306
the Ballet Cultural.

622
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,009
He grew up there.

623
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,471
Then this horrific thing
happens.

624
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:10,528
Castillo poisoned six
of his own.

625
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:15,273
Imagine being a kid and having
someone you knew and respected

626
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:17,099
murder people you cared about.

627
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,132
That kind of trauma
stays with you.

628
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,669
What if that trauma
was triggered

629
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,240
by someone in New York?

630
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,240
Who?

631
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:33,405
Ívan Castillo?

632
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,174
The Cuban government said...

633
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:36,504
As little as possible.

634
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,570
- You think Castillo is alive?
- What if he is?

635
00:31:38,594 --> 00:31:41,702
And he runs into Javier Suarez,
all grown up.

636
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:45,339
And now Castillo has to face
his worst fear,

637
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,009
discovery.

638
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:49,306
That's a hell of a motive
for a comfort killer.

639
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,702
But if Castillo is alive
and here in New York,

640
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,207
Javier could've seen him
anywhere.

641
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,570
Only Javier spent
every waking moment

642
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,537
making this company
his new home.

643
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:01,471
It's what he did his whole life.

644
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:03,372
Same with Ívan Castillo.

645
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:04,603
If he fled,

646
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:06,570
he would want to be close
to his passion,

647
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,207
the stage.

648
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:11,570
Fiona said Javier changed
when they moved to the theater.

649
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:13,405
Because Castillo is here.

650
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:24,570
Dani?

651
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,438
<i>Yeah, boss. What's up?</i>

652
00:32:26,462 --> 00:32:28,042
We think Castillo is here.

653
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,273
<i>Here?</i>

654
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:30,471
Yes.

655
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:32,042
Castillo,
the dead guy from Cuba.

656
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,570
- Maybe not so dead.
- Makes sense.

657
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:35,405
Why would the Cuban D.I.
want to admit he's alive?

658
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,108
It means he escaped justice.

659
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:40,042
We need to get everybody out
who's not a Cuban male over 50

660
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,537
<i>and do it
without causing a scene.</i>

661
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:42,702
You first. Let's go.

662
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,660
Yo. Let's go. You, too.

663
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:48,066
We're moving people out.

664
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:57,405
- Bright?
- Gil, are those floor mics on?

665
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,009
Let's go, go, go. Move.

666
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,438
- Orderly fashion, please.
- Come on, everybody.

667
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,042
- Move, move, move. Let's go.
- Yep. Right through here.

668
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,438
It's an emergency. Let's go.

669
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,438
Let's go.

670
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:14,339
Hey. Hey!

671
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:15,759
Gotcha.

672
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:18,297
Not Ívan. Keep it moving.

673
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,660
Ívan Castillo, NYPD!
You're under arrest!

674
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,561
Stop! Police!

675
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:51,273
Gina. Where's the prima?

676
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,108
I don't know. I think she left?

677
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,066
Where did she go?

678
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:00,009
Stay back!

679
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,537
I will kill her

680
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,042
like Javier.

681
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:06,174
You've already proven
what you'll do.

682
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:08,174
But it's over.

683
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:10,108
If you run,

684
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,033
it won't just be the NYPD
chasing you.

685
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:17,033
We spoke to Cuban D.I.
this morning.

686
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,504
What do you think they'll do
with you?

687
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,603
They're not exactly big
on fair trials.

688
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,438
If you walk outside,

689
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,108
you're all theirs.

690
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,132
You're lying.

691
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:31,405
Look into the street.

692
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,075
You're gonna see
a delivery truck

693
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,339
blocking traffic.

694
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,594
That's them.

695
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:41,141
Is there really
a delivery truck out there?

696
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:42,537
It's New York.

697
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,759
There's always a delivery truck.

698
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,165
<i>Détourné!</i>

699
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:56,306
Clear.

700
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,603
It's fine.

701
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:59,669
- He's down.
- You good?

702
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,141
The bus is on its way.

703
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,438
Traffic was blocked
by a delivery truck.

704
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:04,669
See?

705
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:12,240
Am I imagining things,
or did you just speak...

706
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:13,438
ballet?

707
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:15,438
If you must know,

708
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:18,132
my mother
made me take ballet class.

709
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,660
For five years.

710
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:24,264
I showed great promise.

711
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:28,033
Well, bravo.

712
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,504
You were right.
Cut off his supply...

713
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:41,009
He'll tell us
what we want to know.

714
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:43,264
You okay?

715
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,669
I know. I know.

716
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:48,471
I won't go over the red line.

717
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:56,471
Oh, thank God you're here.

718
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:58,471
Are you ready
to tell us the truth?

719
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:00,141
Yes. Yes, I've...

720
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:02,702
I've been trying to, um,
order my thoughts,

721
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,372
memories so it makes sense.

722
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,636
You've had long enough.

723
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,042
Say what you're gonna say
about Sophie.

724
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,438
I doubt you can do any more
damage than you've already done.

725
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,976
Oh, I have to warn you, Eve.

726
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,240
I can always do more damage.

727
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:15,405
Stop.

728
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,405
You can't hurt me.

729
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,033
What happened to Sophie?

730
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:27,735
All right. He's told you about
our, uh, boys' weekend away.

731
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,976
I-I'd hoped for some
bonding time, but...

732
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,438
Did you bring Sophie
to the cabin?

733
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,132
Yes.

734
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:37,471
But, as you know,

735
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,702
the weekend hadn't gone
as planned.

736
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:42,537
Uh, Watkins attacked me,

737
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:45,504
Malcolm... stabbed him,

738
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:48,702
- and I still had Sophie to take care of.
- You mean murder.

739
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:51,528
I mean I had my hands full.

740
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:58,000
Eventually...
Malcolm fell asleep.

741
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:02,537
And... I managed

742
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:06,174
to carve out some time

743
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:09,240
for the two of us.

744
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:10,528
Keep going.

745
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:15,561
She was in the cellar, tied up.

746
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:20,240
Still, you know, I enjoy
a little chitchat.

747
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:23,735
Now, any last words?

748
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,976
Tell him he's not going to
get away with this.

749
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,108
I've heard a lot of last words.

750
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:31,306
Uh, people beg for their lives,
tell me about their families,

751
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,042
uh, confess their sins.

752
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:36,174
One even actually asked me to
take care of a Siamese cat.

753
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:38,042
But, uh, this is new.

754
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:40,174
Really? You think
I don't know who sent you?

755
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:43,174
I know why I'm here.

756
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:45,570
I don't think you do.

757
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,759
You were hired to kill me.

758
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:49,702
Mm-mm.

759
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,702
Then who the hell are you?

760
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,471
I'm...

761
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, I'm... The Surgeon.

762
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,504
- The serial killer?
- I didn't come up with the name.

763
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,042
It's actually kind of
embarrassing.

764
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:06,306
I mean, it's not
the worst moniker.

765
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,042
If you're The Surgeon,
that means you're smart.

766
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:14,570
I could be of value
to you... alive.

767
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,405
Well, of course alive.

768
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,042
Now, back to the business
at hand.

769
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,438
Let me tell you
a story about money,

770
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,240
influence, power.

771
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,141
That sound interesting to you?

772
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,000
Give me one hour.
That's it.

773
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:30,603
So, let me see.

774
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:34,537
Uh... to save your life,
you're gonna cut a deal with me,

775
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:36,702
a serial killer?

776
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm not exactly a good man.

777
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:41,504
You don't get it.

778
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,000
I know worse.

779
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,264
Okay.

780
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:57,306
One hour.

781
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,132
Tell me everything.

782
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:03,603
It was quite a story.

783
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:06,372
A story?
What does that even mean?

784
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:07,702
I just want to find her body.

785
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,702
Tell us what you did
with Sophie.

786
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,537
Oh. I thought it was obvious.

787
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:17,000
She... she convinced me
to let her go.

788
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:21,372
Oh, your sister was
very persuasive.

789
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:23,174
What are you going to do?

790
00:39:31,396 --> 00:39:34,132
I'm saving your life.

791
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,330
You're lying.

792
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:49,273
If Sophie was alive,
I would know.

793
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:51,471
She's my sister.

794
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:53,297
She would've found me, and...

795
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:59,702
Well, I... I gave you
plenty of warning.

796
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:03,108
It's not my fault
she never reached out to you,

797
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:07,198
that you've been chasing someone
who doesn't want to be found.

798
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:13,033
It's cruel. I know.

799
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,306
But then, the truth often is.

800
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,009
Look, I just really hope

801
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:19,405
that this hasn't put a damper
on things between you two.

802
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:23,273
I know meeting the parents
is always complicated,

803
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:26,504
and trust me, I'm the nice one.

804
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:30,660
I can't. I just can't.

805
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,000
Why?

806
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:45,075
If that's the truth,
why deny Sophie's existence?

807
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:46,735
Why the gaslighting,
the chloroform?

808
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:50,075
Trust me, Malcolm,
I'm being a good father here.

809
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,471
I'm protecting you
by stopping you.

810
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,537
Now, you go and do
the same thing for Eve.

811
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,528
Her.

812
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,504
Please, I have resources.
I can help.

813
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:10,273
I have resources, too.
I need to do this alone.

814
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:12,438
We can find her together.
You need my help.

815
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:14,009
I was so naive.

816
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,702
I actually thought
The Surgeon couldn't hurt me.

817
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,438
This is what he does.
He drives a wedge...

818
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:18,471
Is that what you really think?

819
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:21,471
Or do you believe him?

820
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,075
Is my sister still alive?

821
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,108
You've been studying him
your whole life.

822
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:30,504
You know when he's
telling the truth, don't you?

823
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,528
Was that the truth?

824
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:40,264
Yeah, I-I think so.

825
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,627
That's why I have to go.

826
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,042
This isn't your search anymore.

827
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,693
It's mine.

828
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,042
I'm sorry.

829
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,132
Goodbye.

830
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:20,561
<i>Operator, well, could you</i>

831
00:42:22,132 --> 00:42:26,561
<i>See, the number on the</i>

832
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,306
That is a fascinating story,
Sophie.

833
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,207
Oh, you are in quite a bit
of trouble, aren't you?

834
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:38,603
I have proof of everything.

835
00:42:38,627 --> 00:42:41,372
Documents, files.

836
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:43,339
You know, your lifestyle
comes with certain risks.

837
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:46,669
Information like this
might come in handy one day.

838
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:51,726
My son's up.

839
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:56,108
I can't let him
see you like this.

840
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:57,735
Imagine what damage
that might do

841
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:59,561
to a young child's psyche.

842
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,033
No, no, no.
You have to believe me.

843
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:10,297
Nicholas Endicott is a monster.

844
00:43:13,462 --> 00:43:15,264
Jessica.

845
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:21,528
Shall we?

846
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,000
Greg, move your head.

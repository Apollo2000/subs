1
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:15,145
And... there we are.
Back to seated.

2
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,495
It's one of the smoothest beds
on the market.

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,151
Rumor has it that Stephen
Hawking died on one of these.

4
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,501
What are chances it malfunctions
and crushes you?

5
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,329
Easy, Mother.

6
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,288
Now, now.

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,291
Is that any way to speak
to a man who almost died?

8
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,339
Your pathetic patient act
has run its course.

9
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,515
We are here because...

10
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,480
You need to make a statement
to the police.

11
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:47,221
You're going to tell them
that Mom

12
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,092
was forced to stab you
by the real killer.

13
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,573
But in fact, we know
that it was you.

14
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,753
My boy.

15
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:01,626
Or... I don't say anything,
and Mommy Dearest

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,499
becomes Bedford Correctional's
newest inmate.

17
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:07,197
Free to live out
all her sapphic dreams.

18
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,460
Do you still have that ice pick?

19
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,246
You want something.

20
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,554
-What?
-Well, it's not like
I'm being coy about it.

21
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:18,904
I want more quality time
with you.

22
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,254
Regular visits.

23
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:21,864
Like in the good old days.

24
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,347
No. I am not letting him

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,566
extort his way
back into your life. Let's go.

26
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,568
Well, I'd think carefully
about that, Jessie.

27
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:34,006
Even you'd have a hard time
looking radiant

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,617
in an orange jumpsuit.

29
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,886
Fine.
I'll visit once a week.

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,367
And you'll make your statement.

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,717
Twice every ten days.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,850
And yes, it...

33
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:53,548
it's all coming back to me now.

34
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:57,856
Your mother was being controlled
by a monster.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,075
Not me, of course.

36
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,699
-Give me another.

37
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,571

Oh, that man.

38
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:19,791
I can't stand that
he is still manipulating us.

39
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:24,274
Mm, if it's any comfort,
he's an expert manipulator.

40
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,146
So am I.

41
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,278
As soon as we get his statement,

42
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,281
we can really start
turning the screws on him.

43
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:36,156
But we can talk about
all that later.

44
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,637
Let's toast
to some good news for once.

45
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,293
Yes. Well, um...

46
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,997
Did you reach out to Eve?

47
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,478
I left her another message.

48
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,698
But I think she needs more time.

49
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,269
What are you doing?

50
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,227
Getting her opinion.

51
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,098
-You're what?
-Mm-mm.

52
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,491
Jessica?

53
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:10,625
Eve, dear.
Sorry to ambush you,

54
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,323
but I am here with someone

55
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,848
who would really like
to talk to you.

56
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,329
Hi. Uh...

57
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,027
Hi. Uh, I'm so sorry.

58
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,681
She's persistent, isn't she?

59
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,943
That she is.

60
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,032
Look, i-if you want to hang up,
that's fine.

61
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,687
I can keep talking, pretend
like you're still on the phone.

62
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,601
No.

63
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,255
I've been meaning to call.

64
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,648
I just needed some space.

65
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,040
But if you want to talk,

66
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,346
I'm ready to listen.

67
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,479
How-how about dinner?

68
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,264
Not romantic. More...

69
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,135
apologetic.

70
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,702
I'm free tomorrow night
around 7:00.

71
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,138
It's a date.

72
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,619
I-I mean, a get-together.

73
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:52,362
-See you then.
-Okay. Bye.

74
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,843
Well done, darling.

75
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:58,716
I have notes, of course,
but why ruin the moment?

76
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,633
It's Gil.

77
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,854
Moment ruined.

78
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,515
A high-end robbery
in broad daylight.

79
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,299
With motorcycles.

80
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,084
Nuts, right?
It was a smash-and-grab

81
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:22,305
right before a private auction
was set to begin.

82
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,134
$20 million in high-end watches
were stolen

83
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:28,616
Rolex, Patek Philippe, Hublot.

84
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,272
-You know, the sort of thing you
wear on your wrist every day.

85
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,318
Robbers rode in on motorcycles,
fired at the ceiling,

86
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,407
then grabbed the loot
and sped away.

87
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:48,244
They wanted it loud
to terrify the employees.

88
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,986
They wanted it fast so no one
had time to react.

89
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,817
And they wanted it brutal so
no one would try and stop them.

90
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,605
But none of that explains this.

91
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,611
Angela Santi, 28 years old.

92
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,352
She was the auction house's
consignment manager.

93
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,093
Entry wound is from
a nine-millimeter.

94
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,529
She was shot at close range.

95
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,009
How close are we talking?

96
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:18,970
Uh, ooh, about as close
as I am to you right now.

97
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,624
Point-blank to the face.

98
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:23,323
Um, maybe even, like,
this close?

99
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,804
-If that's okay.
-That is definitely not okay.

100
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,893
There's no emergency alarm,
so what's our victim

101
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,722
-doing in this alcove?
-Uh, the killer may have
forced her here.

102
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,856
-Isolated her.

103
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,902
-But why?
I assure you,

104
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,557
I'm allowed here. I'm a licensed
insurance invest...

105
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,821
And please don't touch my suit.
Cops, man.

106
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:46,389
-I got to dry-clean this.
-Vijay?

107
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,130
Whitly?

108
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,132
Is that you?

109
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,177
It's, uh...

110
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,657
I go by Bright now.

111
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,965
Of course you do.
How the hell are you, man?

112
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,142
It's been forever.

113
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,578
Is that Major Crimes?

114
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,972
Yeah. I'm with them.

115
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,800
-Special consultant.

116
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,279

Nice.

117
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,281
I left Treasury a few years ago.

118
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,500
With Braun Underwriters now.

119
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,894
We insured this place,
unfortunately.

120
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,504
Looks like
we're on the same case.

121
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,855
Of course,
murder really isn't my bag.

122
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,162
Ugh. I'm after the 20 mil
in watches.

123
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,511
-That's the job.
-Of course.

124
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,991
You get the watches back,

125
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,558
the insurance company
doesn't have to pay.

126
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,650
Precisely.

127
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,826
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

128
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,437
Hey, maybe we can help
each other out on this.

129
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,266
Yeah, two old friends
working together.

130
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,441
Could be fun.

131
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:41,531
Sure. Fun.

132
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,927
See you, Whitly.

133
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,409
That guy seems great.

134
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:52,499
He is. I think.

135
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,806
Vijay and I went
to boarding school together.

136
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,418
His dad went to prison
for smuggling cocaine, so...

137
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,724
Oh. You were "bad dad" kids.

138
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,465
Something like that.

139
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,814
-Mm.
-In ninth grade,

140
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,860
we used to own the corner table
at lunch.

141
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,949
The one no one else sat at.

142
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,822
You were a weird loner
in high school? Stop.

143
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,697
Yo, Bright? Help me with this.

144
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,309
Why is our victim still wearing
a tennis bracelet

145
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,267
that's worth at least $10,000?

146
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,053
Yeah, what kind of thief leaves
that much money on the table?

147
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,924
One who isn't motivated
by money.

148
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,102
See how her arm's trapped
underneath her body?

149
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,496
She was rolled over.

150
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,151
The killer wanted to look her
in the eyes while she died.

151
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,807
To savor her expression
of shock.

152
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,504
Dread.

153
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,856
This wasn't about the robbery.

154
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,119
This was about the thrill.

155
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,644
A thrill killer? That's a
liability for a group that wants

156
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,515
to get in and out
as fast as possible.

157
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,691
That's why the killer
pulled her in here.

158
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,693
He was hiding her
from his fellow thieves.

159
00:07:56,737 --> 00:08:00,392
-Like an addict hides his drugs.
-He'll do this again?

160
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,569
He craves it.

161
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,399
The endorphin rush at the kill.

162
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:08,879
He's addicted.

163
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,230
He can't stop.

164
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,856
Unfortunately, that's the only
video surveillance we've got.

165
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,727
They zapped the other cameras
with infrared.

166
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,424
The killer could be any of them.

167
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,861
Riding bikes with that kind

168
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,558
of precision indoors?
Impressive as hell.

169
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,604
You're right.
This feels rehearsed.

170
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,083
Start calling around.

171
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,345
-We need...

172
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,703
Hi. Hello. Hola.

173
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,227
Vijay Chandasara
with Braun Underwriters.

174
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,576
Here to help however I can.

175
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,578
I do know a thing or two
about thieves.

176
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,885
Vijay, this is Dani Powell,

177
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,932
Gil Arroyo and...
James Thomas Tarmel?

178
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,064
Not even close.

179
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,500
This is great.

180
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,719
Another overdressed expert.

181
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,851
-Thanks.
Mr. Chandasara,

182
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,550
I get that your company
doesn't want to shell out

183
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,552
$20 million in pricey watches,

184
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,554
but we're here
to solve a murder.

185
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,382
-That's the priority.
-Absolutely. To that end,

186
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,384
the crew that did this
had bravado.

187
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,473
The time of day,
the motorcycles.

188
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,867
I mean, usually, we see
this kind of pizzazz in Europe.

189
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,217
I had a friend at Interpol run
down a few known gangs for me.

190
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,219
-And?
-No hits.

191
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,569
Super helpful.

192
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,267
But... she confirmed a rumor

193
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,575
that some young American thieves
have been pulling jobs in Europe

194
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,272
with the more established
crews there.

195
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,839
Studying the masters,
if you will.

196
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,668
We're after a young gang
looking to make their mark.

197
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,105
How does this help us
with our thrill killer, Bright?

198
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,410
It tracks with my profile.

199
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,238
They're talented but younger,

200
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,849
quicker to violence.

201
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,068
An unintentional kill
may have been a gateway drug

202
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,156
to thrill killing.

203
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,811
Wham, bam, Flintstone.

204
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:57,118
Here are the top 50 American
crews from our database.

205
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,423
And, uh, as for the watches...

206
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,991
We don't care about the watches.

207
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,689
Totes. I get it. But they do.

208
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,386
I've been monitoring
fences, collectors.

209
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,866
Only so many people can buy

210
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,694
stolen goods
at this price point.

211
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,652
-That's how we'll catch them.
-Exactly.

212
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:13,177
All right. We'll coordinate.

213
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,571
Dani, let's get the unis
out there.

214
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,268
Monitor any potential targets.

215
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,401
JT, check the federal database
for any other cases

216
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,142
that might fit this crew.

217
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,013
Thanks.

218
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,450
Sure thing.

219
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,148
Hey, hey, look at that, huh?

220
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,279
Together again.

221
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,194
The corner table boys.

222
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,022
The rejects. The bad seeds.

223
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,110
Please stop.

224
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,464
This is gonna be great.

225
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,336
What kind of bagels y'all got?

226
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,343
You sure you don't want a bite?

227
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,563
You can use my spork.

228
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,783
I'm not hungry.

229
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,353
And I have to leave
in 12 minutes.

230
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,703
Well, someone's in a mood.

231
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:04,141
-I'm not in a mood.
-We should talk about it,

232
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,753
whatever's bothering you.

233
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,493
That's what these
visits are for.

234
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,800
No. These visits are blackmail.

235
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,628
Would you rather
spend 12 minutes

236
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
not talking about the thing
that's on your mind?

237
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,721
Care to hear my thoughts
about Medicare for All?

238
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,510
Do you remember
Vijay Chandasara?

239
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,992
Vijay. Of course, your buddy.

240
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,603
God, it was such a relief
when you started making friends

241
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,389
after all those years
of isolation, although...

242
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,478
you boys had a falling-out,
didn't you?

243
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,915
-You remember that?
-Of course.

244
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,266
You were very hurt
by the whole ordeal.

245
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,399
You both had fathers in prison.

246
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,140
You had a connection.

247
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:49,012
But once Vijay's father
was released from jail...

248
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,579
He found new friends.

249
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,060
You might say he betrayed you.

250
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,628
I'm not sure.

251
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,195
Maybe the problem was me.

252
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,328
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

253
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,418
Trust me,
you weren't the problem.

254
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,855
You're right.

255
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,422
You were.

256
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,817

Walked into that one.

257
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,776
I didn't trust him,
and that's because of you.

258
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,040
Come on. I mean,
how many problems in your life

259
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,694
can you blame on me?

260
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,827
No friends, night terrors.

261
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,829
Did I give you psoriasis
to boot?

262
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,526
-Okay, our time's up.
-L-Look, it was tough

263
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,528
having me as a father.
I get it.

264
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,356
I'll admit that.

265
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,489
But I'm sure that life

266
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,665
wasn't easy for Vijay, either,

267
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,625
which does make me wonder,
if he was able to move on,

268
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:40,847
then...  why can't you?

269
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,681
Gil.

270
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,250
-Hello?
-One of our prowlers

271
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:56,471
saw a group of motorcyclists
cruising the Diamond District.

272
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,168
I got a feeling
that might be our guys.

273
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,996
-We're on our way.
-I'll be right there.

274
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,782
Alarm in progress.
Peterson Diamond Mart on 47th.

275
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,436
Call ESU from the road.

276
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,265
I said heads down.

277
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,833
I said heads down!

278
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,793
-Echo Team, moving in.
Don't be a hero.

279
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,535
Keep your heads down
and stay on the ground.

280
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,929
I said heads down!

281
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,020
Keep your heads down!
Stay on the ground!

282
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:28,329
I will blow your brains out.
Don't be a hero.

283
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,026
Damn it.

284
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,246
Level one, clear.

285
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,509
Level two, clear.

286
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,601
We got another one.

287
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:41,864
Call a bus.

288
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,608
She looks similar
to the last victim.

289
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,740
Same hair.

290
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,136
Oh, God.

291
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,531
I-I heard gunshots.

292
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,012
Is everyone okay?

293
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,982
Is the victim still alive?
Were you able to speak with her?

294
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,897
No. They rushed her
into the O.R.

295
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,117
This woman is our only witness.
What if she dies?

296
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,206
For a craniotomy,
they'll have to keep her awake.

297
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,903
We could question her
during the surgery.

298
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,731
Lieutenant Arroyo, please.

299
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,559
This may be our only chance
to catch our killer.

300
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:25,690
And get your watches back?

301
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,910
Stand down, both of you.

302
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,695
Even I can't get you in there.

303
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,659
What are you thinking, Whitly?

304
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,231
Well, you do know who used to be
head of surgery around here.

305
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,932
You have a call from Malcolm.

306
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,413
Y'ello?

307
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,936
This is not a social call.

308
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,071
My boy! Twice in one day.

309
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,637
What a treat.

310
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:02,205
I have a witness
in a critical condition

311
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,207
who survived a bullet
to her brain.

312
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,470
Well, isn't she lucky?

313
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,255
She's in the middle
of a craniotomy.

314
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,213
They're estimating
15 more hours.

315
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:13,695
But you want to talk to her now.
Where's she been admitted?

316
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:14,914
Brockton.

317
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,611
Your old stomping ground.

318
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,005
They're not letting me
into the O.R.

319
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,963
Is Dr. Orenstein
covering the procedure?

320
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,182
He is.

321
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,140
-You knew him, right?
-Of course.

322
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,795
Oh, we were good friends.
He's got great hands.

323
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,144
Uh, so said his patients,

324
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,408
and half the nursing staff.

325
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,846
I covered with his wife, uh,
more than once whilst he was,

326
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,371
uh, otherwise occupied.

327
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:40,069
-That's just what
I needed to hear.
-Wait.

328
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:43,116
Are you gonna blackmail your way
into his surgery?

329
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,726
Yeah.

330
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,511
That's my boy.

331
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,821
You have five minutes.

332
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:56,129
Thank you, Doctor. Hi, Patti.

333
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,957
I'm Malcolm Bright
with the NYPD.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,306
This is Vijay Chandasara.

335
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,395
He's an expert
when it comes to thieves.

336
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,701
We're both very excited
to talk with you.

337
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,094
Hi.

338
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,618
Uh, they told me
not to move too much.

339
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,098
You're doing great.

340
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,448
Patti, I know this is, uh,
unconventional,

341
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,582
but can you tell me
about the person that shot you?

342
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,628
Of course. It was, um...

343
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:21,110
Nurse, I need
a three-by-three with saline.

344
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,807
Anything distinguishable?

345
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,201
Was it a male
or a female attacker?

346
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:28,770
I-I'm sorry. I-I, um...

347
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:31,686
I-I-I remember
that we were alone.

348
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,340
B-But when I try to

349
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:37,126
picture a face, i-it's a blur.
It-it's just blank space.

350
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,910
Patti, I need you to stay calm.

351
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:42,001
Bullet caused damage
to the right fusiform gyrus.

352
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,264
She has prosopagnosia.

353
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,266
-What?
It's all right, Patti.

354
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,659
That's just a fancy word
for facial blindness.

355
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,922
One in 50 people has it
to some degree.

356
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,620
It's going to be okay.

357
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:57,320
Just try to concentrate on
the visuals that aren't faces.

358
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,149
Uh...

359
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,369
I think I heard
someone say, "Coop."

360
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,327
That's great. That's great.

361
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,634
A-Any other
identifiable features?

362
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:10,246
Uh, scars, birth marks,
piercings?

363
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,249
There was a tattoo
on the forearm

364
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,859
a bird, I think.

365
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,210
It was like a peacock.

366
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,952
Fenghuang, the Chinese phoenix.

367
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,563
That's our killer's tattoo.

368
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,391
It's the emblem
of the Ghost Phoenix,

369
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,088
a Chinese street gang
out of Seattle.

370
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,742
They branched out from drugs
and protection

371
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:28,873
to more sophisticated crimes,

372
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,702
including high-end robberies.

373
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,095
The "Coop" Patti identified

374
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:36,838
is Cooper Wu, mid-30s,
prior for assault,

375
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,361
presumably the leader
of the gang,

376
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,929
not necessarily
our killer, though.

377
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,062
Patti couldn't I.D.
her attacker, and...

378
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,715
all of the members
have phoenix tattoos.

379
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,848
I turned up a half dozen
previous jobs

380
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,371
that could be connected to them.

381
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,374
No casualties at first,
until Chicago.

382
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:54,290
That's when our killer
acquired a taste for blood.

383
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:57,076
After that,
one more in St. Louis,

384
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,296
both women in their 20s with
curly hair. He's got a type.

385
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,081
Your profile was right.

386
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,432
I'll put a BOLO out on Cooper
and all known associates.

387
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,651
Nice work, you two.

388
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,359
Vijay still wants the watches.

389
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:22,579
He might try to make
a side deal with Cooper.

390
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,103
Can we trust him?

391
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,455
I don't know.

392
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:32,198
I'll put a tail on him,
see where he goes.

393
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,896
Vijay. What up?

394
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,333
Nothing.
Good job in there, baby boy.

395
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:43,122
Listen, um, I wanted
to ask you about school.

396
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,602
Really?
That's ancient history, man.

397
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,866
We were friends, and then,

398
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,695
after your dad got out,
we weren't.

399
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:52,870
Why did that happen?

400
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,308
Where is this coming from?

401
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,136
It's not a thing.

402
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,138
I mean, we're adults.

403
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,487
Just curious is all.

404
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,837
It's not like
I've thought a lot about it.

405
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,968
Why did that happen?

406
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,101
I tried, man.

407
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,148
I invited you to parties,
introduced you to people,

408
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:13,195
but you were... intense,

409
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:17,765
judging people
without saying anything,

410
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,898
like they weren't trustworthy.

411
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,075
Yeah, I have rather profound
trust issues.

412
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,034
That's what my therapist
would say.

413
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,211
I'm glad you're getting help.

414
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,300
I'm trying,
but here's the problem.

415
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:35,739
Um, I'm having trouble
trusting you right now.

416
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,828
Cooper Wu has to unload

417
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,179
$20 million in watches,
and your job

418
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,398
is to recover them
by any means necessary.

419
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,228
You're making a deal to buy
the watches from Cooper.

420
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,101
See, this is the old Whitly.

421
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,539
All suspicious, all the time.

422
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,541
You'd be aiding and abetting
known criminals,

423
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,196
not to mention putting yourself
in the crosshairs of a killer.

424
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,372
I was texting a girl.

425
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,897
I'll see you around.

426
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,992
Bon appétit.

427
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,864
I hope you like scallops...

428
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:18,391
that I ordered because I burned
the ones I tried to cook.

429
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,527
Don't worry, I locked away
all the steak knives.

430
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:28,879
Sorry. Bad joke.
I-I think I'm nervous.

431
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:32,927
Is that why you asked me here,
to tell me you're nervous?

432
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,321
-No.
-Malcolm,

433
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,672
I came here because I thought
you were ready to talk

434
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,196
about you, about that night.

435
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,677
Oh, my God,
Bright, Bright, wake up!

436
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:48,116
I trusted you by coming here.

437
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,945
Now trust me.

438
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,817
Okay.

439
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:58,605
Um, that night,

440
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,260
I was dreaming,

441
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,262
having a nightmare about a girl.

442
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,480
A girl?

443
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,701
One of my father's victims.

444
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,969
The one my mother's
been searching for.

445
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,536
The girl in the box.

446
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,539
Why do you call her that?

447
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,062
I found her in a trunk

448
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,847
my father kept
in the basement of our house.

449
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,591
She comes to me in visions.

450
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:29,897
I tried to save her.

451
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,333
I think.

452
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,249
But I still feel responsible.

453
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,426
And in my nightmares,
she likes to remind me of that.

454
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,604
You were only ten.

455
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,214
It's not your fault.

456
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:48,872
Look, I hate that I messed
things up between us.

457
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,353
I really wanted...

458
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,575
What?

459
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:58,099
What did you want?

460
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:07,282
Damn it.

461
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,329
Uh, would it ruin everything
if I took that?

462
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,201
It's safe to say
we've weathered worse.

463
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,295
-Gil.
-Vijay slipped his tail.

464
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,514
He's in the wind.

465
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:24,168
He's meeting
with the Ghost Phoenix.

466
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,909
Making a deal with Coop
to buy the watches.

467
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,172
You have any idea
where he'd set that meeting?

468
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,523
I might. Uh, I'll drop you
a pin right now.

469
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:31,698
Meet me there.

470
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,453
How'd you find me?

471
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,065
Your dad used these docks
to smuggle cocaine in the '80s.

472
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,067
You used to brag
about how he ran down

473
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,070
a Colombian hit man
in his Bentley.

474
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,506
You were in the back.

475
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,029
Yeah.

476
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,683
That's great. You need to go.

477
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,033
You told me you weren't
gonna do a side deal.

478
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:04,948
-You lied to me.
-This is my job.

479
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,515
Making deals with bad people.

480
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,431
These aren't just bad people.
There's a thrill killer.

481
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,172
This isn't just another deal.

482
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:15,219
Gil is on his way.

483
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:18,309
All we have to do is wait.

484
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,704
Gil's not gonna make it.
They're here.

485
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,706
You got to leave.
If they find out you're a cop...

486
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,534
Dead. Got it.

487
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:27,057
I'm not leaving.

488
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,624
-Come on.

489
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,194
I'm meeting new people,
being social.

490
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,804
It's good for us.

491
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:41,158
Coop! Fellas, how we doing?

492
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:44,161
Ready to make a deal?

493
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:45,554
Mr. Chandasara.

494
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:48,078
This isn't a plus-one situation.

495
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,384
Who's this?

496
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,125
I'm Malcolm Bright.

497
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,651
The appraiser.

498
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,219
The suits in London need him
to check out the merchandise

499
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,961
-before they release funds.
-He's clean.

500
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:05,879
But I'm thinking y'all still
want to make some money tonight.

501
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,620
Am I right?

502
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,537
Let's go.

503
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,453
Boom.

504
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,591
All right, Mr. Bright.

505
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:25,202
Here's what we're selling.
Take a look.

506
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,509
Make sure it all meets
your exacting standards.

507
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,468
We can move
the watches ourselves.

508
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,948
We don't need to trade them
to this guy for a finder's fee.

509
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,994
Yeah, a rush sale like this?

510
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,778
You'll be lucky to get 15%.

511
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,781
You've got 20 minutes.

512
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,483
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

513
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,310
I'm gonna make a deal
with these guys,

514
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,660
and everyone walks
out of here happy.

515
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,531
Sound good? Great.
Glad you agree.

516
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,402
-I have a plan.
-I knew you were gonna say that.

517
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:54,405
Haggle with Cooper. Draw it out.

518
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,929
Give me time to figure out
who the thrill killer is.

519
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,626
 That could be
any of these guys.

520
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,368
You handle the money,
I'll handle the killer.

521
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,544
Coopy-Coop!

522
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,199
Let's make some magic happen.

523
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,034
This phone is reserved for
telemarketers and politicians.

524
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:17,124
Identify yourself so I know
how hard to slam the receiver.

525
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,647
Mrs. Whitly.

526
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,911
You kept the old number.
How sentimental.

527
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,304

Martin?

528
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,915
It's good to hear your voice.

529
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,177
What do you want?

530
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:29,353
Uh, to make a complaint.

531
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,573
What did you say to our son?

532
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,619
Malcolm isn't
answering my calls.

533
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,403
I haven't said a word to him.

534
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:37,144
You know, I'd hate
to tell the police

535
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,494
the wrong story, Jess.

536
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,671
-But my feelings have been hurt.

537
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,499
Psychopaths don't have feelings.

538
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,414
Actually, we do.

539
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:50,418
Trick is, we can turn them off
whenever we want.

540
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,333
Well, he isn't answering
my calls, either.

541
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,248
I know as little as you.

542
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,729
Oh. Well, do you think
he's all right?

543
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,774
I hadn't considered
I should be worried.

544
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,560
Forgot to turn on
those feelings?

545
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:05,389
So is this what it's like?

546
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,566
Worrying about your kids,

547
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,872
thinking of all the terrible
things that could be happening?

548
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:14,398
Parenting is tough stuff.

549
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,705
It's good to have
someone to talk to,

550
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,403
someone who cares
as much as you do.

551
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,405
You're right.

552
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,407
I should call Gil.

553
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,630
And she turns the dagger.

554
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,025
Surprise, suckers.

555
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,680
Taking your money feels so good.

556
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,638
This wasn't about the robbery.

557
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,901
-This was about the thrill.

558
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,337
Hey.

559
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,818
What are you looking at?
Eyes on the prize, man.

560
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,951
Leave him be, Petey.
Guy's got work to do.

561
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,910
Kid's kind of young
for this work.

562
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,434
Hothead's got to learn
his place.

563
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,915
So, you born in that suit,
or does appraising

564
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,135
just pay a whole lot better
than I thought?

565
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,224
I was born in it.

566
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,356
Had a Brooks Brothers onesie.

567
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,881
-How about you?
-Other side of the tracks.

568
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,840
But I'm working my way
out of a bad situation.

569
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:08,191
I get cash, lolz, jewelry,
and one-percenters like you

570
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:11,630
bankroll it all of it
whether you like it or not.

571
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,936
-Power to the people.

572
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,068
You're cute.

573
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,810
I could steal you, too.

574
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,468
What did Sheila say to you?

575
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,689
Nothing special. Small talk.

576
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:30,779
-You two together?
-Yeah. We are.

577
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,652
Kind of.

578
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,306
Keeping your options open.
Got it.

579
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,701
Always heard this was the most
stressful part of the job,

580
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:42,269
waiting.

581
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:44,358
People get greedy.

582
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,882
Not sure who you can trust.

583
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,364
How did you get
into this line of work?

584
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,152
Explosive temper.

585
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:57,676
-Good to know.

586
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,765
We got a deal, Coopy!

587
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:02,942
This guy did me dry.

588
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,291
What happened here?

589
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,380
He's a cop.

590
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,780
I've been watching him.

591
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,434
He's been sucking up information
on our team for an hour.

592
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,089
-I'm not a cop.
-Yeah, he's not a cop.

593
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,438
Grant.

594
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,832
He ain't gonna talk.

595
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,143
Uh, Coop,

596
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,535
what are you doing?

597
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,276
You know I'm legit.
I just transferred

598
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,887
30% to your account.

599
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,761
That's the thing. You'll talk.

600
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,161
-The question is,

601
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:51,425
how much pain gets me the truth?

602
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:53,427
Who is he?

603
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,691
Stop! Stop.

604
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,173
I'm not a cop,

605
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,349
but...

606
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:05,134
I do work with the NYPD.

607
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:08,007
I'm a profiler.

608
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,878
Close enough.

609
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,575
You're dead.

610
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,666
We got to kill them and go.

611
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,059
You're not turning
cop killer today.

612
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,192
Well, what are you gonna do
about it, hmm?

613
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,021
Leave Vijay out of this.

614
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:26,199
If you ever want to see the rest
of your money, don't hurt him.

615
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:27,766
Excellent point. Thanks, buddy.

616
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,943
Shut up. Let me handle this.

617
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,167
Alex, take Vijay
back to the docks.

618
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,516
Help him with the merchandise.

619
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,650
I'll take care of this profiler.

620
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

621
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,133
Hold on. Hold on!

622
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:49,788
I can't leave without him.

623
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,616
You're in no position
to negotiate.

624
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,490
He's my friend.

625
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:58,666
Friend?

626
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,842
Don't, Vijay.
I know what happens next.

627
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,802
You're gonna leave!
You have to. I get it.

628
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,412
I knew I shouldn't have come.

629
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,805
I knew it in school.

630
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,504
Really? You're gonna
bring up school here?

631
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,072
What the hell
does that even mean?

632
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:16,249
I never could trust you.

633
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,338
You're just like your dad.

634
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,992
Go.

635
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,210
Save your own ass.

636
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,256
Get in your Bentley and go.

637
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,561
I drive a vintage Porsche.

638
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,389
That'll work, too.

639
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,651
Just go!

640
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,262
Hey, hey...

641
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,853
Looks like Vijay
got what he wanted.

642
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,681
Yeah, but where's Bright?
He said he'd be here, too.

643
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,248
We'll follow the van.

644
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,772
Hopefully it leads to...

645
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,905
What the hell?

646
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,865
What is Vijay doing?

647
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:20,966
So, why does a profiler care
about a bunch of thieves?

648
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,185
Boss, we don't
have time for this.

649
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,709
Easy, Grant.

650
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:28,321
I want to know.

651
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,411
Ah. Got it.

652
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:32,978
Got what?

653
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:36,938
We're both trying to
figure out the same thing.

654
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:38,940
Which one of them
is the killer.

655
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,900
What the hell does that mean?

656
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,555
Two jobs in two days,
both planned to the second.

657
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,124
Both end with a dead civilian,
shot in the same way.

658
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,735
It's got you thinking.

659
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:56,044
Is he right? This profiler?

660
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,220
Yes, I'm right.

661
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,482
Almost always.

662
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:02,355
-So, who is it, then?
-Obviously not you.

663
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,617
As for Alex...

664
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:06,925
He's family, right?

665
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,014
His first job, maybe.

666
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:12,278
You sent him with Vijay,
so you trust him.

667
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,454
You can't say the same
for these three.

668
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,630
We've been a team
for five years.

669
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,719
You don't know anything
about us.

670
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,025
Pete's right.

671
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,983
Maybe you've been together
too long.

672
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,596
What do you think, Sheila?

673
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,773
What?
I didn't kill anybody.

674
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,125
Can I ask you
a personal question?

675
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,085
Do you have curly hair?

676
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,065
How long have you been
in love with Sheila, Pete?

677
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:04,156
What? I'm not.

678
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,333
What is this?

679
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:11,163
Robbing banks was
the gateway drug.

680
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:12,903
Pure adrenaline.

681
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:16,037
She kept you along
for the ride. Sheila.

682
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,517
You can't get her out
of your head.

683
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,650
See, the problem with
an overstimulated psychosis

684
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:24,480
is that you start looking for
bigger hits of adrenaline.

685
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:27,135
The downside for your team...

686
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,311
you made them all accessories
to your murders.

687
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,096
Tell me you didn't
do that, Pete.

688
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,793
I go down, I go for life.

689
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:33,837
I thought that we were friends.

690
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,056
Don't say "friends," bitch.

691
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,841
All his victims looked like you.

692
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,365
They're all proxies.

693
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:42,542
One day soon, he's gonna
tire of the stand-ins

694
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,022
and go for the real thing.

695
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,029
Everybody relax.

696
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,467
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

697
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,730
Grant, put it down.

698
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:01,778
I said put it down.

699
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,693
We worked together for years,

700
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:06,174
and you pull a gun on me?!

701
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,871
Listen!

702
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,873
We're still a team.

703
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,312
We don't have to
kill each other.

704
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,357
Problem is...

705
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,403
one of you does.

706
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,009
That was impressive.

707
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,621
Am I dead?

708
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,972
No. Just shaking off
one seriously crunchy crack

709
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,452
to the back of
your occipital bone.

710
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:09,150
Might want to run you
through a CT scanner...

711
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:13,198
if you survive this, killer.

712
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,812
-I'm not.
-Not a killer?

713
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,555
Murderer? Psycho?

714
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:23,947
I beg to differ.

715
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,298
Look at what you did.

716
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,605
Taking out four
hardened criminals

717
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,825
in one fell swoop.

718
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,568
I didn't shoot anybody.

719
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:37,918
Well, you didn't pull
the triggers or load the guns.

720
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:39,789
No, no, no.

721
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,141
You loaded their minds

722
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:46,361
with fear and anger.

723
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:52,019
Each one
with the exact right amount.

724
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:55,805
Ah, my boy,
it was a work of genius.

725
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,069
All this talk about friends,

726
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:03,117
it's really beside the point.

727
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,337
You don't need friends.

728
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,602
You're too much like
your old man.

729
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,606
You're wrong.

730
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,477
You're not even him.

731
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:19,525
You're a mixture of fear and
anger playing out in my head.

732
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,309
Also true.

733
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:25,270
And since I'm obviously some
figment of a fear response,

734
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:28,925
I think you should clear
that head of yours

735
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,189
and get out of here.

736
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,366

They're not all dead.

737
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:07,529
Don't do it.

738
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,403
Oh, aren't you smart, huh?

739
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:13,666
Calling me out,

740
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,059
turning all my friends
against me-- for what?

741
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,933
Hmm?

742
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,372
What happened, Pete?

743
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,723
Why'd you start killing
those women?

744
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,943
What changed?

745
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:40,562
You know, every job I ever did,
I saved my cut.

746
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,738
I-I put it away.

747
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:44,523
I-I invested, even.

748
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,917
She was never gonna leave
with me.

749
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,745
Not ever.

750
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:53,096
And then some punk like Alex
comes around.

751
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,801
I'm gonna have to
kill him, too.

752
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,634
-No!

753
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:20,167
You did it.
You came back.

754
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,995
Of course.
I clocked the address

755
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,866
when I was making the deal
with Coop.

756
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,303
Then I got your hint about

757
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,000
my dad running over
the coke dealer.

758
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,089
-That was the plan, right?
-Yeah.

759
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,699
But I just can't believe
it worked.

760
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,485
I couldn't leave a buddy behind.

761
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:35,965
Right.

762
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,402
Thanks... buddy.

763
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,100
And how often do you get
to run a guy down

764
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,319
in a vintage Porsche?!

765
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,670
Bright, you okay?

766
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,586
Fine. Good.

767
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:48,717
Thanks.

768
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,633
What happened?

769
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:53,548
We happened.

770
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,508
The corner table boys.
The bad seeds.

771
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,292
We saved the day.

772
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,164
I'm not under arrest, am I?

773
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,437
Eve, what a lovely surprise.

774
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,395
And you brought me flowers.

775
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,442
To thank you for reconnecting me
with your son.

776
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:21,359
-So you finally saw each other.
-Mm-hmm.

777
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,709
It went well, I take it.

778
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,493
It did. He cooked me dinner,

779
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:30,411
and he told me about the girl
he found in the basement.

780
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,936
Oh, he really has to work
on his dating skills.

781
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,721
It actually brought us closer.

782
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:41,161
I know about your search
for the girl in the box.

783
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,816
And you know my background.

784
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,644
Please, let me help you.

785
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,690
Really?

786
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,172
I'd be so grateful.

787
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:58,831
Let me put these in some water,
and we can start strategizing.

788
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:02,791
Oh, they're so beautiful.

789
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,272
Just give me a minute.

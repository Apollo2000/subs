1
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,634
You didn't.

2
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:14,307
I did.

3
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,101
And they're blueberry, your favorite.

4
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,595
These are cherry.

5
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,410
I thought you said they were blueberry.

6
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,452
They are.

7
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:43,658
What's wrong?

8
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:46,327
Nothing.

9
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,240
It's just, uh...

10
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:52,453
this is when the scary
thing usually happens.

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,139
Nightmares back?

12
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,066
No.

13
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:17,806
Just a dream.

14
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:20,397
Good. I was worried about you.

15
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,455
Well...

16
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,482
I have sleep issues.

17
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:26,659
He says to the girl
who's been shackling him

18
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,558
to the bed every night for two weeks.

19
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,030
Not that I'm complaining.

20
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,966
I think it's kind of hot.

21
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,116
What were you working on?

22
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,994
What were you dreaming about?

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,830
You.

24
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,588
Always you.

25
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:53,427

26
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,155
She's hiding something from me.

27
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,741
Two weeks in, and you're already
sabotaging the relationship?

28
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,075
Sounds about right.

29
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,410
I'm serious, Ains.

30
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,812
In my dream last night,
Eve gave me muffins.

31
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:06,774
She said they were blueberry,
but they were actually cherry.

32
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:08,139
Why would she lie about that?

33
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,444
She lied to you...

34
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:11,601
in your dream

35
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,757
about imaginary muffins.

36
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:16,634
My subconscious was telling me
something's wrong.

37
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,745
Or, maybe you just don't
know how to be happy,

38
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,964
and-and right now, Eve seems
too good to be true.

39
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,666
Has she done anything in the real world

40
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,517
to make you doubt her?

41
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,593
Yes.

42
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,733
She has a briefcase that's locked.

43
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:29,472
Ooh!

44
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,484
Okay, well, that's not so strange, but...

45
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,688
...she came back,
after I nearly killed her.

46
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:38,806
Why would she do that?

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,283
Because she cares about you.

48
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,868
And for some reason,
that's harder for you to believe

49
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:44,982
than your girlfriend having
some secret agenda.

50
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:48,482
99% of people

51
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:50,460
aren't serial killers, Malcolm.

52
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,003
But we're part of the one percent.

53
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,446
Fine, you work for the NYPD.

54
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,646
If you're so concerned, check her out.

55
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,292
I'll do the same.

56
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:00,786
We can finally see who
the better investigator is.

57
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:02,631
Bye.

58
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,916
"The better investigator"?

59
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,316
It's me!

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,067
Ready for something intense?

61
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,109
- Always.
- Welcome to the wonderful world

62
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,469
of mommy blogging.

63
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,406
The owners of this home
were throwing a sip and see.

64
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,425
- "Sip and see" what?
- The baby.

65
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,577
It's a way for influencer moms to debut

66
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,770
their brand-new babies
and post-baby bods.

67
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:28,898
Probably not in that order.

68
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,733
Victim is Ezra Cassavel.

69
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,451
Uh, heir to a textile fortune

70
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,609
and husband of the host, Alessa Cassavel.

71
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,632
Perfect life,

72
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:39,533
camera-ready family,

73
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,995
but sometimes perfect can be an illusion.

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,830
Where's Gil, Edrisa?

75
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,432
Oh, in here with the stiff!

76
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,042
Really?

77
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,326
Sorry, is "stiff" inappropriate?

78
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,599
Death by a bottle of bubbly's
got to be a new one.

79
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:04,842
Actually, official

80
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,936
cause of death is
a severed carotid artery.

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,529
Probably six to eight hours ago.

82
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,031
And from the spatter pattern and pooling,

83
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,033
he lost a liter of blood

84
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,568
in seconds, then fell
backwards into the ball pit

85
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:16,570
and, you know, died.

86
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:18,089
Ooh!

87
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,799
Careful.

88
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:23,077
That bottle is firmly lodged in
his neck and aerobic metabolism

89
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,162
has taken over, pressure is building

90
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,048
and his body cavity is squeezing.

91
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,207
The cork is gonna pop?

92
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:29,800
Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,127
Edrisa... your hand?

94
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,505
Oh, sorry.

95
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,622
What are you seeing, Bright?

96
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:39,027
Well, the murder weapon
was provided by the hosts...

97
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,512
which means our suspect wasn't
planning on killing Ezra

98
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,849
when he woke up this morning.

99
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,496
Our suspect went from zero
to killer in an instant.

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,971
Someone with a history of aggression.

101
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,311
Anger issues.

102
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,103
Or he took one look at the
price tag on all this baby swag.

103
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:57,536
Let's go with the anger.

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,888
After thrusting the champagne
bottle into Ezra's neck,

105
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,158
our killer simply left him to die.

106
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:04,994
<i>They showed both</i>

107
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,457
explosivity and indifference.

108
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,406
He may have what is clinically

109
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,875
known as a "depraved heart."

110
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,627
Run backgrounds on friends and family

111
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,126
with any reports of assault.

112
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,339
Who found Ezra's body?

113
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,883
The nanny, she's upstairs
with Alessa and the baby.

114
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:22,594
Alessa and I got back
from last-minute errands.

115
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,815
She took Nina upstairs to nap.

116
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,151
And... I... I went to finish setting up.

117
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,602
That's when I saw the blood and glass.

118
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,638
It was Ezra.

119
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,986
Can you tell us what you remember?

120
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:40,946
Christine started screaming.

121
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,241
And I... I ran downstairs.

122
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:45,912
And, um...

123
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,207
and then I called you.

124
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,008
Are you hurt?

125
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:00,282
Oh, no, it's fine.

126
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:03,761
I, um... it's from a few nights ago.

127
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,601
I've-I've been in such a daze
since I brought Nina home.

128
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,475
Baby brain.

129
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,860
That psychological haze

130
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,644
is an adaptive reaction to help

131
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:14,363
mothers connect with their newborns.

132
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,615
It's a cloud of love.

133
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,034
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

134
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,633
Sorry. I'll be right back.

135
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:26,667
<i>Hello?</i>

136
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,595
My boy! Oh, I've missed you.

137
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,597
I was getting worried
you were avoiding me.

138
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,424
Why would I ever avoid you?

139
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,958
<i>You must have mixed feelings after</i>

140
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:37,511
stabbing your old man.

141
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,047
I'm making a speedy recovery, by the way.

142
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,600
More nimble than ever.

143
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,027
And I accept your apology.

144
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,811
I'm not apologizing.

145
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,627
Oh, potato, potato.

146
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,099
So, what have you been up to?

147
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,618
What's been keeping your attention?

148
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:55,896
I thought we agreed
on two visits every ten days.

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,980
<i>Uh...</i>

150
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,399
Just been busy.

151
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,402
Dinners, plays.

152
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,443
Those sound like dates.

153
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,124
No reason to be shy.

154
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,495
Is this that lovely
lady partner of yours?

155
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,581
- Dani?
<i>- No.</i>

156
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:16,500
- Look, I really can't...
<i>- Oh, come on!</i>

157
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,843
I can hear it in your voice.

158
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,771
Love is in the air!

159
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:25,096
Was that... a baby?

160
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:26,727
My, you work fast.

161
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,011
<i>I'm on a case.</i>

162
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,513
<i>A man's been murdered</i>

163
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,722
at his baby's sip and see.

164
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,650
<i>Sip and what?</i>

165
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:34,977
Careful.

166
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,936
<i>- Tell me more!</i>
- That cork is gonna...

167
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,731
Bright!

168
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,834
Was that champagne?

169
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,995
I think I mistimed that.

170
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,953
I got to go.

171
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,546
18 different vendors were in and out

172
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,898
of the Cassavel residence this morning.

173
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,690
I want lists of everybody

174
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:07,320
who had access to that bottle of Dom.

175
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:09,241
I hate to say it,
but Alessa looks good for this.

176
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:10,312
No way.

177
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,639
Alessa's too obsessed
with her image, her brand.

178
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,424
Killing her husband
would destroy all that.

179
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,286
Unless she thought
her image was in jeopardy.

180
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,020
Killing Ezra might help preserve it.

181
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,983
Exactly, all I'm saying is there
are two sides to motherhood.

182
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,275
The warm, fuzzy one,
and the one where you

183
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,239
maim your spouse for eating
all the pizza rolls.

184
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,249
Um, I think that the au pair
is worth digging into.

185
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:31,801
She is the one who found the body.

186
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,273
What are you thinking, Bright?

187
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,194
Neither Christine nor Alessa

188
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:36,427
appear to be murderers.

189
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,209
But that's the problem
with a "depraved heart."

190
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,704
Our killer might not
present as dangerous.

191
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,007
That's kind of a nonanswer.

192
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,959
Our crime wasn't premeditated.

193
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,427
So what matters most is motive.

194
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:48,338
We need to find out what caused
our killer to snap.

195
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,616
JT, look into Ezra...
just because he's the vic

196
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,165
doesn't mean he was innocent.

197
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:54,187
Dani, run background on the au pair.

198
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:56,304
Bright and I will talk to
the mothers in Alessa's group.

199
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,771
Great, moms love me.

200
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,069
Hey, uh...

201
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:03,895
if you're running
a background on Christine,

202
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,072
could you do me a favor?

203
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,365
Uh, sure, what's up?

204
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,109
Could you also look up Eve Blanchard?

205
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,736
You want me to run a background check

206
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,713
on your girlfriend?

207
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,027
It's a long story.

208
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,591
Starts with a serial killer father,

209
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,393
ends with a whole lot of trust issues.

210
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,244
Bright, that's wrong on so many levels.

211
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,388
Guess you didn't get
the trust issues joke,

212
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:23,039
which wasn't really a joke.

213
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,518
I did.

214
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:28,003
If you're having doubts about Eve,

215
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,930
I'm not gonna be the one
who confirms them.

216
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,296
You can, uh, screw things up
all on your own.

217
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Good talk, thanks.

218
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,088
Alessa's my best friend.

219
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,681
I can't believe this happened.

220
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,609
Or that she's trending.

221
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,197
Oh, my God. This is...

222
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:52,595
Wow.

223
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,639
Deirdre, did Alessa ever confide in you

224
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,276
about any issues
she was having with Ezra?

225
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,350
"Issues"?

226
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:58,286
No.

227
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,047
They were the perfect couple.

228
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:02,397
And professionally, they were killing it.

229
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,582
Oh.

230
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,066
You're talking about their brand?

231
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,034
Yeah.

232
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:07,402
They made it look so easy.

233
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,113
- But they had help.
- Christine?

234
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:13,614
You know they met her in Monaco
on their babymoon?

235
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,370
Ezra was a bit of a flirt.

236
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,039
I know if I had just given
birth, I wouldn't want

237
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:22,300
a waif like Christine
in my home, know what I mean?

238
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,025
Deirdre,

239
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,337
would you mind if we asked
your nanny a few questions?

240
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,523
Not about me, right?

241
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:28,732
No.

242
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:29,674
About Christine.

243
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,342
Oh.

244
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,719
Of course.

245
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:35,013
I just keep my head down
and collect my checks.

246
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,515
All these women are crazy.

247
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,151
Like, "too crazy for Bravo" crazy.

248
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,061
Do you have any reason
to believe that Christine

249
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,607
and Ezra were sleeping together?

250
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:45,749
Christine only opened up to me once.

251
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,327
Said she had bad luck with men,
but "Ezra was different."

252
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,695
He was "one of the good ones."

253
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,548
If that's not code

254
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:54,429
for "we're smackin' uglies..."

255
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,351
I don't know what is.

256
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:02,864
So, you have something</i> to show me?

257
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:03,938
Yeah.

258
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:05,543
Mom?

259
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,312
Uh, in here, darling!

260
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,130
I'm with Eve!

261
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,349
Eve Blanchard, Ainsley...

262
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,299
The well-adjusted Whitly.

263
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,427
What's that?

264
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,576
Eve is helping me search
for the girl that Malcolm found.

265
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,633
The girl in the box.

266
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,233
You really think this might be her?

267
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:26,335
Maybe.

268
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,566
Um, her name is Sophie Sanders.

269
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,736
She ran away from a group home
in South Carolina in '94.

270
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,747
Her mother's initials are A.M.S.

271
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:36,146
Ah. Amelia Sanders.

272
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,915
Deceased, 1993.

273
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,537
Where does it say
that her middle initial's "M"?

274
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,506
Uh, it's in the file somewhere.

275
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,601
You're from South Carolina, too, right?

276
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,153
No, North.

277
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,720
Oh. But weren't you in South Carolina

278
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:51,503
before the Blanchards
adopted you in 1995?

279
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:53,516
How do you know that?

280
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,753
Can't help it.

281
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,177
I'm a journalist.

282
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,230
You're perfect on paper, by the way.

283
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,274
- You looked me up?
- Course.

284
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,035
Eve,

285
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,110
ignore her.

286
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,537
My children can be socially bizarre.

287
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:08,398
But it's best to find it
endearing and not deranged.

288
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,001
I shouldn't have come. Excuse me.

289
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,077
Eve, where are you going?

290
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,592
Please-please stay.

291
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,966
Ainsley.

292
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,452
Not every interaction has to be
a Pulitzer Prize-winning feat

293
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,546
of investigative journalism.

294
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:26,229
We need to talk about Eve.

295
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,718
Everything all right?

296
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,242
I can't stop thinking about the life

297
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,340
Ezra and Alessa presented to the world.

298
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,645
They were... they were happy.

299
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,043
Thriving.

300
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,782
Was it all a lie?

301
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,301
Can you ever really know anyone?

302
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,313
Sure, you can.

303
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,408
- What's going on...
- Got something.

304
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:06,497
Ezra withdrew $30,000 from
his private account a week ago.

305
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,891
Married man pulling large sums
from under his wife's nose?

306
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,326
That's good. But mine is better.

307
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,306
Christine Chartrand, the au pair?

308
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:15,919
She doesn't exist.

309
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,223
It's a fake name.

310
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:21,029
Alessa's as type A as they come.

311
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,464
There's no way
she'd let someone into her home

312
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,680
and around that baby
without thoroughly vetting them.

313
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,202
I need to talk to her now.

314
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,037
To understand the real picture...

315
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,205
no filters.

316
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,523
Right now? It's after 10:00.

317
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,525
Her baby feeds every two hours at night,

318
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,502
and her husband was murdered.

319
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,153
She'll be up.

320
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,093
Powell, go with him, please.

321
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,535
Thank you for seeing us this late.

322
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,201
Yeah, it's fine. I just got Nina down.

323
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,706
- And Christine?
- Uh, she's...

324
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,017
sleeping upstairs in her room.

325
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,081
I don't know. Why?

326
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,980
That cut on your arm.

327
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,140
You said you got it a few nights ago,

328
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:59,509
but it's bleeding, like it's fresh.

329
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,282
I'm a slow healer.

330
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:04,114
Um, I'm sorry.

331
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:08,362
What is going on?

332
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,320
We have reason to believe that Christine

333
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,354
isn't who she says she is.

334
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,994
It's an alias.

335
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,407
That's impossible.

336
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:17,169
Ezra said her background check
was spotless.

337
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,362
We also believe that Ezra

338
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,214
may have been having an affair with her.

339
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:23,647
What?

340
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,544
Uh, no. I would have known.

341
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,638
Is that true?

342
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:29,997
You're exhausted,

343
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,666
sleeping odd hours,

344
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,501
vigilant when it comes to your baby...

345
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,066
But not with my husband.

346
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,628
You're worse than our trolls.

347
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,818
Alessa, is it possible that,

348
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:43,987
behind this perfect exterior,

349
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,572
something could have happened
between them?

350
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:47,657
I can only imagine

351
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,452
the pressure having a baby puts
on a relationship.

352
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,926
No, no. It was the opposite.

353
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,398
We were almost separated
before the pregnancy.

354
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,442
Nina saved us.

355
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,581
Is that Christine?

356
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,585
Can she hear us?

357
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,533
Uh, maybe.

358
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,212
Her room's right above us.

359
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,519
Where is she going?

360
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,157
The nursery.

361
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,399
Nina doesn't need anything.

362
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,906
- She's taking her.
- Oh, my God.

363
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,355
She's stealing my baby!

364
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,688
Stay here. Don't move.

365
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,028
Baby's still here.

366
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,485
Where's Christine?

367
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,489
She's gone.

368
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:10,598
We've had teams out all night.
No sign of Christine.

369
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:14,083
Dani's still at Alessa's,
keeping an eye on her and Nina.

370
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,396
Do you think Christine
really tried to steal the baby?

371
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,083
Let's say Christine did kill Ezra.

372
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:22,735
Why didn't she just steal Nina and run?

373
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:24,678
What is she after?

374
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,437
And who is she, really?

375
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:28,324
I know who can help.

376
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:31,011
About an hour ago, I got a call
from a guy outside of Montreal

377
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,287
claiming to be Christine's husband.

378
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:34,622
And the story checks out.

379
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:36,429
Lucas Gerard.

380
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,183
Got him on video chat.

381
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,754
- Say hello.
<i>- Hello. Uh, can you hear me?</i>

382
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:43,782
<i>We don't always get the best connection</i>

383
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,143
<i>up here in Stanstead.</i>

384
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,426
<i>But, uh, I-I called as soon
as I saw her photo online.</i>

385
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,965
- Christine Chartrand is your wife?
<i>- Yes.</i>

386
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,431
<i>Her real name is Christine Gerard.</i>

387
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:55,206
<i>This is from our honeymoon.</i>

388
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,851
<i>I, uh, reported her missing last year.</i>

389
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,158
<i>I worried about her every day.</i>

390
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:05,196
<i>All the messed up things she
could've been tangled up in.</i>

391
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,405
<i>But I-I never imagined
it would be homicide.</i>

392
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:08,942
What can you tell us about her?

393
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,362
<i>Christine's a good girl.</i>

394
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:13,160
<i>She, uh, had a rough past.</i>

395
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,718
<i>Got in trouble for some robberies</i>

396
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,603
<i>when she dropped out of school.</i>

397
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,052
<i>Fights, drugs, all that stuff.</i>

398
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:22,458
That means she has a record.

399
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,963
Run it down.

400
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:25,772
So, why'd she run away?

401
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,357
<i>I don't know.</i>

402
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,793
<i>She was always a bit of a wild one.</i>

403
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,629
<i>Yeah. But we had a good life.</i>

404
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,114
<i>And then...</i>

405
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:36,208
<i>she vanished.</i>

406
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:39,709
<i>But I love her,
and I want her to be okay.</i>

407
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,462
Thanks for your help. We'll be in touch.

408
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,301
Lucas Gerard's description of Christine

409
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,635
paints a picture of delinquency,

410
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,563
compulsive behavior and aggression.

411
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,973
Add attempted baby-napper
and extortion to that list,

412
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:53,309
and it's quite the résumé for a nanny.

413
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,011
Women who commit child abduction
fall into four categories,

414
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:59,231
one of which is cluster B personalities.

415
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:00,983
Unpredictable, manipulative.

416
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,893
They often ingratiate themselves
with the family

417
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,111
prior to abduction.

418
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,321
Christine fits the profile.

419
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:07,281
You said the killer had anger issues.

420
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,345
If Ezra found out
about Christine's rap sheet

421
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,735
or stopped her in her
first attempt at taking Nina,

422
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,880
there's your motive. The trigger.

423
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:15,364
We stopped her once.

424
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,119
But if she's willing to kill Ezra,

425
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,375
it's only a matter of time

426
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,083
before she tries to take Nina again.

427
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,504
Help Dani keep an eye on Alessa's place.

428
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,557
Don't let that baby out of your sight.

429
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,964
I'll set up a 24-hour watch on the house.

430
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,188
Yo.

431
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:30,482
You okay?

432
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,673
Dani told me you asked her to run

433
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,288
a background check on your girl.

434
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,194
Wow. News travels fast around here.

435
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,246
And, yes,

436
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,348
I've been told that I'm very bad
at relationships.

437
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,433
I ran a background check
on every girl I dated

438
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,554
when I was single.

439
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,312
- Even Tally?
- Hell yeah.

440
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:51,380
And she didn't talk to me
for weeks after she found out.

441
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,735
I almost lost the best thing in my life

442
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,288
because I was too afraid
to be honest with her.

443
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,240
Honest like, "I'm sorry, Eve.

444
00:18:58,264 --> 00:18:59,700
"I'm a profoundly suspicious person,

445
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,368
"afraid that everything good in my life

446
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:02,461
is hiding some terrible lie"?

447
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,319
Yeah, maybe not that honest.

448
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,872
Just let her know how you feel.

449
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,173
You don't want a relationship
built on secrets.

450
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:16,508
Martin, your dinner date is here.

451
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,935
Ah.

452
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,396
I'm sorry about the spread.

453
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,555
If you think<i> I'm</i> a criminal,

454
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,599
you should try our cook's vegan lasagne.

455
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,902
I'm not hungry.

456
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,562
But you'll eat

457
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,280
with your, uh,

458
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,783
new girlfriend?

459
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,527
I don't want to talk about her.

460
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,292
So,

461
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,889
there is a her.

462
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,042
And you look upset.

463
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,575
Trouble in paradise?

464
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,878
How can I help?

465
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,004
You're the best liar I know.

466
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,056
You fooled Mom,

467
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:57,697
me,

468
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,181
everybody.

469
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,852
And you made the lies feel so real.

470
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,554
How did you do that?

471
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,556
Well,

472
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,922
I wasn't lying.

473
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:09,716
Of course you were.

474
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,360
You pretended to be the perfect father.

475
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,863
I was the perfect father.

476
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,616
I mean, living a double life, for sure.

477
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,943
But... that doesn't mean
I loved my family any less

478
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,201
than the next man.

479
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,116
You think this woman
you're seeing is lying to you?

480
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,928
I think she has secrets.

481
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,378
All women do, my boy.

482
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,420
It's one of their best qualities.

483
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:33,425
But if she's hiding
something important from me,

484
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:34,385
if she's lying...

485
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,253
Then she's human, Malcolm.

486
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:40,215
Real love is about accepting the parts

487
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,665
of another person that are...

488
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:44,483
unknown.

489
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:48,774
Opening yourself up to
the possibility of being duped.

490
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,274
Or hurt.

491
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,892
It's terrible business.

492
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,021
But if I'd never done it, then...

493
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,441
...you wouldn't be here right now.

494
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,663
No.

495
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,909
I'm not.

496
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,369
We are not having a moment.

497
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,202
We're having a little bit of a moment.

498
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,372
Fine.

499
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,769
Tell me about your case.

500
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:18,167
What do you got?

501
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:21,015
A dead husband,

502
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,966
a frayed mommy blogger,

503
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,019
a baby-napping au pair

504
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:26,279
and no idea who the killer is.

505
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,294
Mm. Salacious.

506
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:31,097
Have we ruled out the baby?

507
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,183
We're focusing on the au pair.

508
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,675
But the mom has secrets, too.

509
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,324
She lied about a cut on her arm.

510
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:40,067
She said it was from a week ago,

511
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,752
but it opened up and started bleeding.

512
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,160
Anything else with her?

513
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,322
She was drinking a soda,

514
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,533
though she preaches clean eating
across her social media.

515
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,576
She take pills?

516
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,994
A few.

517
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,263
- What are you thinking?
- Well, the wife

518
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,914
may have type 1 diabetes.

519
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:56,792
Nerve damage can cause slow healing.

520
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,836
The tablets she took with
the soda could be glucose pills.

521
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,089
Why would she lie about that?

522
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,476
Unless a diabetic pregnancy
would be considered high-risk.

523
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,810
Of course.

524
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,513
Did your mommy blogger post
about complications

525
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,140
or bed rest before the baby was born?

526
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,357
No.

527
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,861
She was in Monaco, sailing.

528
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,945
Sailing?

529
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,001
What obstetrician would let
a high-risk pregnant woman...

530
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:23,002
What if she wasn't pregnant?

531
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:28,374
<i>Are you still sitting on Alessa?</i>

532
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:31,034
Yeah. Unis are changing shifts,
but we got it covered. Why?

533
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,492
She lied about being Nina's mother.

534
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,216
She's leaving the house right now.

535
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,967
Just when she thought
no one would be watching.

536
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,252
<i>Follow her.</i>

537
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,202
What is she doing?

538
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,669
No!

539
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:22,937
Alessa.

540
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,221
- Alessa!
- Hands!

541
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:25,481
Turn around and put your hands up!

542
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,380
Put them up!

543
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,067
Thank God.

544
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,365
Please, it's not what you think.

545
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,367
It's exactly what we think.

546
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,628
You used these to fake your pregnancy.

547
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:49,037
Nina isn't your baby.

548
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,873
No, I am her mother, I swear.

549
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,405
Then how do you explain this?

550
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,462
All you ever wanted was a child.

551
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,260
But in a cruel twist of fate,

552
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,027
your body wouldn't let you carry one.

553
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:10,100
Not without risk, at least.

554
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,476
I did everything right.

555
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:16,095
But I still had three miscarriages.

556
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:20,413
That's what put the strain
on your relationship.

557
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,873
You tossed the evidence,

558
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,399
which shows you're not delusional.

559
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,107
But you know you're not Nina's mother.

560
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,070
So who is?

561
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,235
I am.

562
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,533
It was my egg.

563
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,827
We just used a surrogate.

564
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,994
We're gonna need proof.

565
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,797
- Records.
- I don't have any.

566
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:41,616
It was all done under the table.

567
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,498
Ezra handled it.

568
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:47,468
You're scared.

569
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,994
Because you think the same
person that carried your baby

570
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,340
also killed your husband.

571
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,897
Your surrogate was Christine.

572
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,357
Alessa and Ezra
used a black market surrogacy

573
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,025
to protect their brand.

574
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,639
Keeping it off the books
made it easier to fake,

575
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:14,501
but it also meant that Christine
wasn't properly vetted.

576
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,283
They didn't know
about her criminal history

577
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,760
or her mental instability.

578
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,595
Now the crazy au pair wants that baby.

579
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,496
We have her on every watch list
from here to the border.

580
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,224
If she comes out of hiding,
we'll know about it.

581
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,376
Canadian area code.

582
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,054
Must be Lucas, the husband,
wanting an update.

583
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,180
Tarmel.

584
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,059
What's up, kid?

585
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:37,585
You got that look again.

586
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:38,939
Is it this case?

587
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:41,380
Yes and no.

588
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:44,036
Christine makes sense
as a child abductor.

589
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,153
It fits the profile.

590
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:49,397
But something about it feels off.

591
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,486
Or maybe I'm just off.

592
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,247
Go home.

593
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:57,040
Take care of yourself.

594
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,031
I'll call if we get anything.

595
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:11,171
What's going on?

596
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,048
It's about Eve.

597
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,382
And my historically
questionable taste in cohorts.

598
00:26:22,924 --> 00:26:25,870
- What did you find?
- She is a human rights attorney,

599
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:27,371
and her name is Eve Blanchard,

600
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,949
but we think she infiltrated the family

601
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,274
to get information
on The Surgeon and his victims.

602
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,156
So my subconscious was right.

603
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,575
That and, you know, like, I'm a
great investigative journalist.

604
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,577
But that's, like, neither here
nor there. It's fine.

605
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,963
I should never have let her into my home.

606
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:46,729
Into your life.

607
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:48,800
Oh, no. It wasn't your fault.

608
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:53,213
I had nagging doubts for a week.

609
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,172
I just pushed them aside.

610
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,178
You said Eve was trying

611
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,802
to find out more about The Surgeon.

612
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,221
Why?

613
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,904
Because she grew up in the same orphanage

614
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,844
as a runaway she was presenting to Mom.

615
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:14,150
I think Eve is connected
to the girl in the box.

616
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,001
You're right.

617
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,239
She's my sister.

618
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:29,965
How could you?

619
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,381
I came here to explain,

620
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,224
but I can see now it doesn't matter.

621
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,385
You've already made up your mind
about me.

622
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,098
Eve, wait!

623
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,389
Malcolm.

624
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,628
Malcolm, I'm sorry.

625
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,290
Stop. Please.

626
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,876
No one else has to apologize.

627
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,932
I knew deep down

628
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,956
something was wrong with Eve.

629
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:17,422
With-with us.

630
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,715
With me.

631
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:27,439
Is it Eve?

632
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:34,523
No.

633
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,573
It's Dani. She found Christine.

634
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,898
Our suspect.

635
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,450
I have to go.

636
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,916
Malcolm. You can't just leave.

637
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,292
- You have to deal with this.
- No, I don't.

638
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,576
I can't solve this.

639
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:55,438
This I can solve.

640
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:02,851
Thank God you're here.

641
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,562
She wouldn't tell us anything,
not even her name. Come in.

642
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,312
Um, hey, I'm not trying
to pry or anything,

643
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,662
but you seem on edge.

644
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:19,061
Normally, I would let that go,
but we're on a case.

645
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,816
I need you focused.

646
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:28,567
Eve<i> was</i> hiding something from me.

647
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:33,203
Her sister was the girl in the box.

648
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,274
What? Do you...

649
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,048
Do you want to talk about it?

650
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:39,489
Not even a little.

651
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,136
What happened?

652
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:51,055
Lucas.

653
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,671
- Your husband did this?
- Ex-husband.

654
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,270
I left Lucas.

655
00:29:58,294 --> 00:30:00,158
I ran from him,

656
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:03,732
but, um, he found me.

657
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,603
Ezra tried to pay him off,

658
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:09,047
but Lucas said no and, um...

659
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,336
and killed him.

660
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:15,317
I thought if I agreed

661
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,990
to go with him, he would stop.

662
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:18,397
He wouldn't hurt anyone else.

663
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:19,843
What are you saying?

664
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,784
Get out!

665
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:27,023
Lucas has been in New York
this whole time.

666
00:30:27,883 --> 00:30:29,019
I should have known.

667
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,528
Before, he wasn't talking
about a woman he cared about.

668
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:34,014
He was talking about a possession.

669
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:37,131
He also knows about Nina.

670
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:40,068
Please. Please, you have to save her.

671
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:41,871
What does he know, exactly?

672
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,657
That, um...

673
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,360
That she's our baby.

674
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:48,026
Mine and Lucas's.

675
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:56,484
You weren't trying to steal Nina.

676
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:58,967
You were trying to say goodbye.

677
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,506
I-I didn't mean to tell him,

678
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:02,678
but he was hurting me, and I...

679
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,631
It's all my fault.

680
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:10,769
I'm the reason Ezra's dead,
and now he's after her.

681
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,480
We need to get to Alessa right now.

682
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,191
If Lucas is going after Nina,
she's in danger.

683
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:19,869
Alessa geotags all of her photos.

684
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,186
She just posted.

685
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,464
Send the location to Gil.

686
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,615
I'm gonna stay with Christine.

687
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,158
Go.

688
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,746
Let's go shopping, my love.

689
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,097
Thank you.

690
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,694
All in mommy's head.
Nothing to worry about.

691
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:33,173
Oh, you scared the crap out of me.

692
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,512
What is going on?

693
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,680
I know Christine is Nina's
biological mother.

694
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:41,233
- How? Did you find her?
- Yes. But so did

695
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:43,185
her abusive husband, Nina's birth father.

696
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,849
What? No...

697
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:46,814
Now he's here to take your baby.

698
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,552
Ezra tried to pay him off last week,

699
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:51,014
thinking he'd leave all of you
alone, but it didn't work.

700
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,692
Oh, why didn't he tell me?

701
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:56,240
Because Ezra loved you.

702
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:59,210
And he died trying to
protect you. He was a good man.

703
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:00,754
But now...

704
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,299
a very bad one is coming
for you and Nina.

705
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,251
Do you trust me?

706
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,249
Yeah.

707
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:26,476
If I had my Le Mans,
we'd be there by now.

708
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:41,574
No, it's blocked.

709
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,098
- Bright?!
- Give me my daughter!

710
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:51,505
- No.
- Don't make me say it again.

711
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:56,089
She belongs... to me.

712
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,890
Lucas, wait.

713
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:05,076
The police are on their way.
If you take her,

714
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,494
you're putting her in danger.

715
00:34:06,518 --> 00:34:08,121
No one else needs to get hurt,

716
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,189
- especially your daughter.
- That doesn't matter.

717
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,952
She'll be with me... where she belongs.

718
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,360
Think about it, Lucas.

719
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:24,150
Christine never wanted you to have Nina.

720
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,167
Ask yourself: why?

721
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,966
- Give her to me!
- No.

722
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,169
She knew Alessa and Ezra

723
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,338
would truly love her.

724
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:36,715
They'd give Nina a chance

725
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,925
to break the cycle.

726
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,102
What cycle?

727
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:43,127
I gave Christine everything.

728
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:44,949
I loved her.

729
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:46,401
No, Lucas.

730
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:50,863
Someone in your past... beat you down,

731
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,405
made you feel powerless.

732
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,111
And then... they made you
believe that was love.

733
00:34:58,872 --> 00:35:00,290
It isn't.

734
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:02,250
It's abuse.

735
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:08,872
No! No!

736
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:09,954
No!

737
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,405
Where is she?!

738
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,989
Where's my daughter?!

739
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:21,049
That's...

740
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:51,123
Alessa!

741
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:52,141
Stop.

742
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:54,960
You're safe.

743
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:56,845
Nina...

744
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:58,557
is safe.

745
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,967
Oh, I don't know what came over me.

746
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,731
Maternal instinct.

747
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,992
You'll do anything
to protect your daughter.

748
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,162
Yeah.

749
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,818
Bright?

750
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:22,204
We need a bus.

751
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:28,961
He's got a pulse.

752
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:35,375
Are they all right?

753
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:37,961
She's fine.

754
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,648
They're both fine.

755
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,578
What's going to happen to Nina?

756
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,732
From Christine.

757
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,234
She completed all the adoption paperwork.

758
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:03,680
Well...

759
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:05,697
She always wanted you to have Nina.

760
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:07,688
Now it's official.

761
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,559
No more lies.

762
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,129
Thank you.

763
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:14,120
You're welcome.

764
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,006
Okay.

765
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,526
I know I said
motherhood makes people crazy,

766
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,678
but what Alessa did back there...
that was badass.

767
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:32,317
Well, parents will do almost
anything to protect their young.

768
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:34,256
Congrats, by the way.

769
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,192
On what?

770
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:38,105
On eating all the pizza rolls

771
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:40,897
and knowing way too much
about sip and sees.

772
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,219
- Yeah.
- Classic couvade syndrome,

773
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:49,675
also known as sympathetic pregnancy.

774
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,326
Tally's pregnant.

775
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,994
The thing's the size of a peanut,

776
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:54,465
and you're already profiling it.

777
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:58,250
Don't tell anybody, okay?

778
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,387
It's early, and I don't want to jinx it.

779
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,846
I promise.

780
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:04,568
I'm happy for you.

781
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:05,943
You don't do happy.

782
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:13,513
And I don't know the first thing
about being a father.

783
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:17,156
What if I screw the kid up?

784
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:21,324
What if it ends up like you?

785
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,577
First of all,
don't become a serial killer.

786
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:33,149
But more importantly,
listen to your own advice.

787
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,332
Be honest.

788
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:40,164
That's always the best way.

789
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,443
What does it say?

790
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:08,648
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be home.

791
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,773
Solved my case last night.

792
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:12,000
That's good.

793
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:16,161
It's an explanation.

794
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:18,214
Does it explain why you lied to me?

795
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:26,770
I didn't want to hurt you...
or your mother.

796
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,766
I just wanted to get close to her to see

797
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,602
if she knew anything about my sister.

798
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,279
And when I spent time with her,
I realized

799
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:35,595
she knew as little as I did.

800
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:39,068
And then there was you.

801
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,718
I didn't know this would happen,

802
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:44,616
how I would feel.

803
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,661
I'm sorry.

804
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:54,208
It's okay.

805
00:39:58,457 --> 00:40:00,048
You wanted answers.

806
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,092
I know what that's like.

807
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:07,769
Your sister's the other half
of the heart,

808
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,748
the woman you lost.

809
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:19,845
Her name is Sophie.

810
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:23,192
She was 16 when she ran away.

811
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,028
I was young when our mother died,

812
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:26,955
so I had a better chance
of getting adopted.

813
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:29,532
She was a teenager.

814
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:31,579
She sent me postcards from New York,

815
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:33,483
and then they stopped.

816
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,194
I spent years

817
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,334
searching for her, and...

818
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:41,920
then I read about The Surgeon.

819
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:44,940
And he was arrested a few weeks
after her last postcard.

820
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,966
I thought if he had 23 victims...

821
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,465
Maybe there were more.

822
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,594
You really think it's her?

823
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,341
You have a picture of her in there.

824
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,479
Show me.

825
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:01,356
I can't.

826
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,358
If Sophie's the girl in the box,

827
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:04,943
- I can confirm it.
- That's what

828
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,444
I'm afraid of... that my worst fear

829
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:08,655
is true, and that she's really gone.

830
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,657
That's why I waited so long
to show Jessica.

831
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,012
Don't you want the answer?

832
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,383
Not if it destroys you.

833
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:15,662
I've seen what your repressed memories,

834
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,255
what your nightmares can do.

835
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:21,009
Eve, we can't hide from this.

836
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,919
We have to face it head-on.

837
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,754
We can't.

838
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:27,966
I have real feelings for you, Malcolm,

839
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:31,552
and no relationship can withstand this...

840
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,930
search for the truth.

841
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,561
We should just stop looking.

842
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:40,601
It's the only way for us to move on.

843
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:44,652
Life doesn't work like that.

844
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:49,320
We can't keep secrets

845
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:51,114
in locked bags,

846
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:53,397
or girls in basements

847
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:57,495
and not expect them
to come back to haunt us.

848
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,373
We're living proof of that.

849
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:05,198
I need to remember.

850
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:08,317
And you deserve the truth.

851
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,049
It's the only way.

852
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:10,394
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:12,448
Your sister's dead.

854
00:43:58,232 --> 00:43:59,698
Greg, move your head.

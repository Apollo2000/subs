1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,827
MARTIN:
So what's your new paper about?

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,843
"Deviations in Modus Operandi."

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,640
Sophomoric topic.

4
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,375
Well, I am a sophomore.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,279
(chuckles)

6
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,382
Serial killers tend to be
fairly consistent

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,757
in their modality.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,054
Berkowitz had "women who
looked like his mother."

9
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:23,911
Kemper had coeds,
decapitations and...

10
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:25,497
Please, son, not before lunch.

11
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:26,601
(Bright laughs)

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:31,008
- You had your scalpel.
- Like any artist, I had my themes.

13
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,582
But I also experimented.

14
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:37,507
So you would sometimes
improvise?

15
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,867
A little free-form jazz.

16
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,077
Yeah, often.

17
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,582
That's interesting.

18
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:48,093
Improvisational murder.

19
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:52,585
Which...
which raises the question,

20
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,835
if you were going
to kill me right now,

21
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:57,874
how would you do it?

22
00:00:58,163 --> 00:01:00,569
Oh, geez, son...

23
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,593
what a morbid thought.

24
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:08,265
I'm afraid my options are
a tad restricted.

25
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:12,741
If you weren't cuffed.

26
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,577
Come on, my professor would
love to know your thoughts.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,679
Well, that's a tricky one.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,727
Perhaps I'd just bash your skull
into the table.

29
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:25,980
You know, one swift strike
and it's done.

30
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,983
Maybe that loose screw
on the table behind me.

31
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:35,872
Jamming that into
your carotid artery

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,226
would do the trick.

33
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,780
Though it might get
a little messy.

34
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,648
Um, I could plow it
into your eye socket.

35
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,044
Go for the frontal lobe.

36
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,537
Turn you off
like a light switch.

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,639
(laughs)

38
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:51,147
But this is nonsense.

39
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,911
- I could never hurt you.
- Why?

40
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,537
Because you're...
because you're my son.

41
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,593
I mean, could you kill me?

42
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,186
No.

43
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:13,890
No. Of course not.

44
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,624
Right, right.
Of course not.

45
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,430

<i>JESSICA:
To your first day reporting</i>

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,912
from the studio!
Now you don't have

49
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,708
to pound the pavement
like some salesman

50
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,044
- or census taker.
- BRIGHT: Yes.

51
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,093
- To Ainsley.
- AINSLEY: Aw.

52
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:36,780
Anderson Cooper is
shaking in his boots.

53
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,945
And I am so proud
of you, too, Malcolm.

54
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,780
No murders for two weeks.
It's a new record.

55
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,912
Are you glad you went
on your vacation after all?

56
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,846
I did miss the work,
but it was nice to get away.

57
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,384
I shut the drapes
and never left my room.

58
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,827
Just me and my books.

59
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:56,773
On your tropical holiday?

60
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,780
When you say "get away,"

61
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,516
I take it you mean
from your father.

62
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:04,944
In which case, might I suggest
a permanent vacation?

63
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,880
We seem to be entering
the "daddy issues" segment

64
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:12,069
of this meal, which is
my cue to go to work.

65
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,813
- Love you.
- Bye. Bye.

66
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,714
Really, Malcolm, you haven't
seen him in two weeks,

67
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,384
and you seem great.

68
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,038
I'm not exactly rushing
to Claremont,

69
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,780
but there are some things
that were left unresolved.

70
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,345
<i>BRIGHT:
You were going to kill me.</i>

71
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:31,108
I have done bad things,
but I never did that.

72
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,812
Like what?

73
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,504
I mean, you can tell me.

74
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:37,516
I-I feel sure I've heard
everything by now.

75
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,801
It's complicated.

76
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,145
What are you doing after this?

77
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,272
Just errands.

78
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,514
You, you don't run errands.

79
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:48,780
(sighs)

80
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,225
Fine.

81
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,608
I'm meeting someone.

82
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:56,449
They claim to know something
about the girl in the box.

83
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,490
It came from the tip line.

84
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:03,498
And you were going to meet
this total stranger alone?

85
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,384
Yes.

86
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:06,895
(exhales sharply)

87
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,603
Until my meddling son
got involved.

88
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,978
Well, I don't see anyone.

89
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,978
He said he'd be wearing
a blue sweater.

90
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,648
Did he say by the carousel

91
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,303
the carousel?

92
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,530
Oh...

93
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,801
(thunder rumbling)

94
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,990
(carousel music playing)

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
(Jessica stammers)

96
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,089
Stay here.

97
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,031
Hello?

98
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,873
Anybody here?

99
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:58,405
(music slowing)

100
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,864
Don't look!

101
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,381
(screams)

102
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,935
Malcolm!

103
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,648
I knew this vacation
wouldn't last.

104
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,316
Be honest.
Did you kill this guy

105
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,543
just so you could
get back to work?

106
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,318
This one fell in my lap.
Tell them, Mother.

107
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,224
- What are you looking for?
- My purse.

108
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,780
I dropped it when...
Forget it.

109
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:51,089
Uh, this gentleman was
supposed to give us information

110
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,482
on the girl in the box.

111
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:54,716
Who's the vic?

112
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:55,826
That's gonna be tough.

113
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,644
His fingerprints were burned off
postmortem.

114
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,956
DNA's gonna take some time.

115
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,904
Hey, you stole my thunder.
(chuckles)

116
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,601
It's okay,
I've got plenty of thunder.

117
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:08,122
He died by exsanguination
from the carotid artery,

118
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,253
aka a slit throat.

119
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,647
Which may be metaphorically
significant.

120
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,318
A silencing of sorts.

121
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,450
Any idea who'd want
to silence your informant?

122
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,222
Well, yes, but he's rotting
in a cell.

123
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,297
Not... not rotting.
More like flourishing.

124
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,394
You're saying Martin Whitly
is somehow behind this?

125
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:26,714
With that man,
anything is possible.

126
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,477
So you think we should
question your dad?

127
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:29,565
No, I don't.

128
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,318
I mean... not yet.

129
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:36,117
Martin Whitly's psychopathic.
He's not superhuman.

130
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:39,468
It's also unnecessary
'cause you're completely wrong.

131
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,654
Sorry, that came out harsher
than I intended.

132
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:45,443
I was going for, like,
a playful repartee.

133
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,312
Have I mentioned
how much I missed you?

134
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,333
- (Edrisa chuckles)
- You'll get used to it.

135
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,048
I missed you, too.
Now tell me

136
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,982
why I'm completely wrong.

137
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,398
He died last night.

138
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:00,513
You know, based on the lividity,

139
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,784
he spent several hours on
his side, in a fetal position.

140
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,515
Like in the trunk of a car.

141
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,784
But the call came in
to the tip line this morning.

142
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:15,762
Which means our killer
was the one who called you.

143
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,429
He wanted you to find the body.

144
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:22,922
<i>LESLIE:
Ainsley.</i>

145
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,685
Ainsley, we're throwing
to you next.

146
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,898
- I thought Rod was up.
- We're breaking in.

147
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,124
The body they found
on the carousel...

148
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,724
we've got somebody on the line
claiming to be the killer.

149
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:34,949
And they want to talk to you
on the air right now.

150
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:39,648
Well, um... are-are you sure
it's not a hoax? I mean,

151
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:41,483
I don't want to get Baba
Booey'd the first day. - Trust me.

152
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,209
Trust me, we ran it down.

153
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,935
The caller knew the victim's
prints were burned off.

154
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:47,529
That hasn't been made public.

155
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,081
A-And no one's concerned
about the ethics of all this?

156
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,255
I mean, putting a, a killer
live on the air?

157
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,180
That's an interesting position
coming from you.

158
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,135
I just...

159
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:02,797
Look, he says if we don't
do this, others will die.

160
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:06,732
I got the lawyers on the phone
with the FCC and NYPD.

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,766
If you want,
I'll give it to James.

162
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,609
But he wants you.

163
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:12,336
We're set to go.

164
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:15,916
Okay.

165
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,943
I'm going to need
a fact sheet ASAP,

166
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:23,081
and, uh, call Gil Arroyo
at Major Crimes.

167
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,916
He's gonna want to see this.

168
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,531
Thank you.

169
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,784
- FLOOR MANAGER: Five, four...
- (Ainsley clears throat)

170
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:32,916
...three...

171
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,246
(intro music plays)

172
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,916
Welcome back.

173
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,345
I'm Ainsley Whitly interrupting
our regular programming

174
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,784
with an unusual caller
on the line.

175
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,246
A man claiming responsibility
for a murder

176
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,784
that occurred this morning
in Queens.

177
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:47,982
Are you there?

178
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,916
(static buzzing)

179
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,805
<i>DISTORTED VOICE:
Hello, Ainsley.</i>

180
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,378
Hello.
Who am I speaking with?

181
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:59,841
<i>I am the Carousel Killer.</i>

182
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,180
Catchy.

183
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,054
I have two questions for you.

184
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,791
Why did you kill
that man this morning,

185
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,782
and why are you calling us
about it?

186
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,783
<i>So you would all take heed.</i>

187
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:12,009
<i>AINSLEY: Well, you have our attention.
Now what?</i>

188
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,246
When he called the tip line,
he didn't leave a name?

189
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,461
(door opens)

190
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,195
You got to see this.

191
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,730
Oh, who picked out that blazer?

192
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,915
She looks like the carpet
at the DMV.

193
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,850
<i>AINSLEY:
You didn't answer my question.</i>

194
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,081
<i>Why did you kill that man?</i>

195
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,784
<i>I chose him at random</i>

196
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,015
<i>to let everyone know
</i><i>I'm serious.</i>

197
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,322
Is this live?

198
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,030
The killer called in
a few minutes ago.

199
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,444
<i>AINSLEY:
Serious about what?</i>

200
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:37,718
<i>CAROUSEL KILLER:
Your mother Jessica Whitly.</i>

201
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:40,114
<i>She went on TV and offered
</i><i>a million dollars</i>

202
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,378
<i>for information about one
of her husband's victims.</i>

203
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:45,048
- I'm aware.
<i>- Like she's some kind of hero.</i>

204
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,267
<i>But she's not.
She's a fraud and a hypocrite.</i>

205
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,312
My mother is neither
of those things.

206
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,784
<i>(laughs) The chickens
are coming home to roost.</i>

207
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,345
- (slams desk)
- What...?

208
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:56,850
What, exactly, do you want?

209
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,398
<i>I want that money.</i>

210
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,180
<i>I'll call back
with instructions.</i>

211
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,817
<i>If she doesn't listen,
more people will die.</i>

212
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,333
- (line clicks)
- Wha...

213
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:14,382
No good deed goes unpunished.

214
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,048
If I hadn't gone on TV,
I hadn't offered that money...

215
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,850
You can't think like that.

216
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:22,048
Why? The killer just
announced it

217
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,421
to millions of people.

218
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,444
- That man is dead because of me.
- No.

219
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,718
He's dead because
someone killed him,

220
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,241
not you.

221
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,595
You were just trying to do
some actual good.

222
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:35,072
I want to pay.
It is a small price

223
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,882
to ensure that
no more lives are lost.

224
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,288
NYPD policy is firm.

225
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,180
We do not cooperate
with extortionists.

226
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,784
- I don't give a flying...
- BRIGHT: Mother!

227
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,093
Gil's right. We'll send
an officer to the house.

228
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,220
The smartest thing you can do
right now is go home

229
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,945
and let us do our jobs.

230
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,444
Please.

231
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,201
(sighs)

232
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,784
You know, I have
to tell you, Mr. David,

233
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,916
I am... really
taking to clay time.

234
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,429
You know, I think it would be
even more therapeutic, though,

235
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,444
if I had the, the proper
implements, huh?

236
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:18,289
Is there any chance I could get
a fettling knife?

237
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,890
Well, you lost me at knife.

238
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,498
Well, then my hands

239
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,180
will just have to suffice.

240
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,876
Ready for your TV time?

241
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,562
Ooh, I never say no to TV time.

242
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,529
<i>AINSLEY: Authorities have not
released the victim's identity,</i>

243
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,380
<i>- but have...
</i>-Oh, look at that.

244
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,949
My little girl's reporting
from the studio now.

245
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:40,662
<i>AINSLEY: The killer asked
to speak to me directly</i>

246
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,341

Oh, my. <i>- It should come as
no surprise that my father...</i>

250
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,875
Oh, this looks very exciting. <i>-...Martin
Whitly, also known as The Surgeon,</i>

251
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,050
<i>has been in the news before.</i>

252
00:11:56,137 --> 00:12:00,297
<i>He was arrested in 1998
for murdering 23 people.</i>

253
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,253
<i>The Carousel Killer...</i>

254
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,611
I know you're worried.

255
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:09,401
Best thing we can do for them
is to catch this guy.

256
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,976
Ransom killers
are most often motivated

257
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:16,570
- by financial gain.
- Could this be

258
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:18,786
a crime of opportunity?
Someone sees a million bucks

259
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:20,182
offered up on TV
and they jump on it?

260
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:21,644
That explains the hasty M.O.

261
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:23,547
Slitting a throat is simple,
straightforward.

262
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,710
You're right. The killer
didn't savor the murder.

263
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:28,479
This isn't any
sort of paraphilia.

264
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,945
And the money is definitely
part of it,

265
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,446
but it's not only
about the money.

266
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,132
He wanted everyone
to hear his demands.

267
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,795
- He's after the notoriety.
- BRIGHT: Yes.

268
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,552
Except he didn't call
a random newscast.

269
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,908
He called Ainsley,

270
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,050
told her "the chickens
are coming home to roost,"

271
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,218
and then demanded money
from our mother.

272
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,578
This killer has been wronged
by the Whitlys.

273
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:49,314
DANI: Okay, well,
we're gonna need a list

274
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,131
of all the people connected
to your father's victims.

275
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,644
That's a long-ass list.

276
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,248
- No offense.
- None taken.

277
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,710
- Start with the Lehrer brothers.
- Who?

278
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:58,578
GIL: The Surgeon killed
their mother in '96,

279
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:00,849
but he wasn't connected
with the crime for three years.

280
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,314
In the meantime
they went to jail for it.

281
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,116
BRIGHT: My mother offered
them a settlement.

282
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,512
She wanted to help them.

283
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,710
They insisted on a jury trial
and lost.

284
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,050
Financially motivated
with a personal vendetta.

285
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,380
- That fits.
- GIL: JT and I will take them.

286
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,467
Dani, you and Bright
get down to ADN.

287
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:24,599
(carousel music playing)

288
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:32,248
Change of plans, Adolpho.

289
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,380
Take me to the bank.

290
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,347
BRIGHT: When he calls back,
you need to keep him on the line

291
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:38,578
as long as possible.
Let him ramble.

292
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,743
Don't interrupt.
Try to tease out any details

293
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,050
about his past.

294
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,578
Oh. You mean, be a journalist?

295
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,743
I went to Columbia
J School, Malcolm,

296
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,512
I know how
to conduct an interview.

297
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,314
This is different.

298
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,984
- You're dealing with an active killer.
- Yeah, well,

299
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,335
interviewing killers
is kind of my thing now, so...

300
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,578
- Joking.
- This is a bad idea.

301
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,648
Okay, don't big brother me,
Malcolm.

302
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,446
- I can handle it.
- You're not trained for this.

303
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,380
These people
can get under your skin.

304
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,512
Oh, I see we're going
for maximum irony here.

305
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,314
Do you think this is how I saw
my first day going?

306
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,182
I did not ask to be put
in the center of a crisis,

307
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,446
but I am here,
so I'm gonna do whatever I can

308
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,578
to help you catch this guy.
Cool?

309
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,182
- Fine.
- (sighs)

310
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,632
Yeah.
Let's do this.

311
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,314
<i>- NEWSMAN: A deranged killer called into...</i>

Detectives.

317
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,182
GIL:
Must feel pretty good, right?

318
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,446
Someone messing
with the Whitlys?

319
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,248
I got nothing to do
with any of this.

320
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,710
We just want to ask you
some questions.

321
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:53,644
Last time you people asked me
some questions,

322
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,380
you stole three years
of my life.

323
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:57,536
I ain't going through
that again.

324
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,021
Then give us better answers.

325
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,576
GIL: We know the killer has a
grudge against the Whitly family.

326
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:02,903
And we know he had access

327
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,050
to high-end
electronic equipment.

328
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,701
You can see why that makes
the two of you

329
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:07,700
pretty good suspects.

330
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,314
I didn't do anything.

331
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,203
You said "I."
You didn't say "we."

332
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:20,446
I've been doing this
a long time, Ari.

333
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,314
I can tell
you're holding something back.

334
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,611
And I can also see
that you're afraid.

335
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:27,764
(sighs)

336
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,743
Guy came in.

337
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,625
Maybe two, three weeks ago.

338
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:38,050
White guy, 40s.
He knew who we were.

339
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,666
Said he had a plan
to get back at the Whitlys.

340
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,248
- Asked for our help.
- What'd you tell him?

341
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,578
I told him to piss off.

342
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,672
Trying to keep the past
in the past.

343
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,219
- But your brother was interested.
- He didn't say.

344
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:53,088
But he's been acting
a little strange.

345
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:54,182
Calling in sick.

346
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,050
Hmm. That's why
you were glued to the TV.

347
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,314
- You're worried about him.
- Eh, it's just...

348
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:00,940
he can't let it go.

349
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,190
We need to find
your brother ASAP.

350
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:05,143
Can you help us do that?

351
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,279
You have a chance to stop him

352
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,432
from losing more
than three years.

353
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:15,158
I can track his phone.

354
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,563

355
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,006

Pacing?

356
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,891
Not helping.

<i>- Uh, well,</i>

387
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,544
profit-motivated killers
have always mystified me.

388
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,478
You know, taking a human life
for something

389
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:51,346
as tawdry as money, uh...

390
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,742
but I guess that's easy to say
when your wife's loaded.

391
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:57,478
- Ex-wife.
<i>- Then again, uh,</i>

392
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:58,907
I don't think our killer

393
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,610
is motivated one whit
by the money.

394
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,874
In fact, it's clear
his motivation

00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,742
...me.

398
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,610
He's a psychopath
and a narcissist.

399
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:14,364
Everything is always about him.

400
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:16,874
<i>AINSLEY: Well, you are a
diagnosed psychopath</i>

402

- always about you?
<i>- Well, that may be.</i>

404
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:27,006
Uh, but even a broken psyche
is right twice a day.

405
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:29,544
And I'd bet my life that, uh,

406
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,006
this Carousel Killer

407
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:36,676
is connected to one
of my alleged victims.

408
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:37,907
You don't need to say "alleged"

serving time.

why does he think the money

414
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,862
I have a question
from one of our producers.

415

Why do you think the money
doesn't matter?

<i>MARTIN:
A producer, really?</i>

417
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:56,808
Astute question.

418
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,478
Uh, well, uh,
it's the ostentation of it all.

419
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,610
You know, the, the dead body

calling into your program...
there's a,

421
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:07,893
there's a performative quality
about it that makes me think...

422
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,874
and, you know, this is
just one man's opinion...

423
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,006
that, uh, this is all
a distraction.

424
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,610
You know, this killer
really wants something else.

425
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:18,418
- Ask him...
<i>- AINSLEY: And what do you think</i>

426
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,604
the killer really wants?

This is my show,
and I ask the questions.

472
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,661
Who is that man you killed?

473
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,478
Tell me, or I will
cut to commercial

474
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,763
and you won't get
your million dollars.

475
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:09,346
<i>CAROUSEL KILLER:

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,705
- Hello, dear. Any updates?
<i>- BRIGHT: Possibly.</i>

485
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:38,371
I need you to tell me the spot
where you first met Dad.

486
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,643
Oh... who can remember?

487
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,027
That's ancient history.

488
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,252
You're planning
to pay the ransom.

489

<i>Don't do this.
It's too dangerous.</i>

490

- Tell me the meeting spot.
<i>- Malcolm,</i>

491
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,478
he's left me no choice.

492
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,940
I need to put an end to this

493
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:58,499
before any more blood
is shed in our name.

494
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,895
(sighs)

495
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,874
And we'll be back with
more coverage after the break.

496
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,676
And clear.

497
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:12,167
- Where did Mom and Dad meet?
- How am I supposed to know?

498
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,799
It's not exactly a story
she was fond of telling.

499
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:16,307
You think the killer knew her?

500
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,742
No.

501
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:19,574
But she was a socialite.

502
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,121
They must've done a write-up
on the wedding

503
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,143
Those usually
include how they met.

504
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,533
- I'll get my researchers on it.
- DANI: Uh, no need. We got

505
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:28,098
a lock on the killer's phone.
Those extra seconds did it.

506
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,499
(phone buzzing and ringing)

507
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,412
Hello?

508
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,532
<i>CAROUSEL KILLER:
Walk to the northwest corner.</i>

509
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,742
We're closing in on Noah Lehrer.
What do you got?

510
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,006
We tracked the call.
The killer's in Stuyvesant Park.

511
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,544
That's funny, so are we.

512
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,874
He's here.

513
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,928
I'll take the east side.

514
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:35,346
<i>CAROUSEL KILLER:
Good. Now look up.</i>

515
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:38,006
<i>The corner building.</i>

516
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,742
<i>- Do you see us?
</i>-Yes, I see you.

517
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:46,631
<i>Do exactly as I say,
or I shove him over the edge.</i>

518
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:53,877
<i>CAROUSEL KILLER:
Did you bring the money?</i>

519
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,742
- Of course I did.
- Good.

520
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,618
<i>I want you to dump it out.</i>

521
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,282
You can't be serious.

522
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,909
<i>Dump the money,
or I dump the man.</i>

523
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:04,408
- What?
<i>- Now!</i>

524
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,397
Do you understand me?

525
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,047
Yo, yo,

526
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,650
that-that crazy lady's
throwing hundreds.

527
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:25,911
(overlapping shouting)

528
00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:36,499
Are you happy?
I did exactly what you said.

529
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,895
GIL:
Jessica!

530
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:41,874
- Jessica!
- (gasps)

531
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:43,874
- (shrieks)
- Are you okay?

532
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:46,893
- (bystanders screaming)
- (gasps)

533
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,757
He did it anyway!

534
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:58,844
That's Noah Lehrer.
Ari's brother.

535
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,190
The killer was just on that
roof, he can't have gone far.

536
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:06,260
GIL:
All right. You can't stay here.

537
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,846
Okay? We got to go.

538
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,081
He did it anyway.

539
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,718
Come on. Come on.

540
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,400
We searched everywhere,
but there's no sign of him.

541
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:27,532
Why? Why would anyone do that?

542
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,433
You'd think I'd understand after
all these years, but I don't.

543
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,532
That's a good thing.
You're not supposed to.

544
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:33,865
Adolpho's here.

545
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:35,447
I'll have uniformed officers
waiting at home.

546
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,136
Wait, that's it?

547
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:40,610
You're not gonna scream at me
for not listening to you both?

548
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,940
It's not your fault. It's mine.

549
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:44,821
This guy's been toying
with us all day.

550
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,037
Go easy on yourself,
both of you.

551
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,883
If I flew off the handle every
time a Whitly went rogue on me,

552
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,336
I'd never get anything done.

553
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:54,322
(sighs)

554
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,068
BRIGHT:
Mom.

555
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,913
From now on,
let the police deal with this.

556
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:07,948
Can you do that?

557
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,630
Just stop him.

558
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,729
Million dollars.

559
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,368
(exhales) Gone.

560
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:22,268
Could've fixed
my I. Mans with that.

561
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,167
This is psychological warfare.

562
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,641
The killer wanted
to humiliate my mother

563
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:30,004
by flaunting his disregard
for her wealth.

564
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,104
He wanted my sister to look
like some craven muckraker.

565
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,333
According to Ari,
he's a white male, 40s.

566
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,136
I've already spoken to almost
all of the family members

567
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,664
of your father's victims...
so far that's a dead end.

568
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,628
Still no ID on the body
on the carousel?

569
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:45,695
DNA didn't match anyone
in the system.

570
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:49,159
The killer said
he was an "accessory."

571
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,678
To him or my father?

572
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,557
- Where are you going?
- To ask him myself.

573

575
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:20,532
Adolpho, you found my purse?

576
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,697

Now, who says there are others?

Nope. I'm sorry.

628
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:27,166
- (lock buzzes, latch clicks)
- Damn it. I got to go.

629
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:29,291
Don't leave angry.
I want to help.

630
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,145
Malcolm.

631
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,948
Well,

632
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:37,575
this truly is my lucky day.

633
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,129
I need to talk to your father,

634
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:43,783
alone.

635
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,957
MARTIN: Jessie, darling,
we were not expecting you.

636
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,442
Not that I'm complaining.

637
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,575
Oh, gosh, when was the last time

638
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,722
the three of us
were together like this?

639
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:02,531
Could it be at that
pumpkin patch in Ossining?

640
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:04,200
It was your murder trial.

641
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,135
Ah, yes. You're right.

642
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:10,309
- (chuckles)
- Oh, good times.

643
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:13,872
Why are you here, Mother?

644
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:18,104
I have something urgent
to discuss with your father.

645
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:19,777
I just need a minute
alone with him.

646
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:21,502
Well, as much as it pains me
to say this,

647
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,525
I don't think I'm allowed
a conjugal visit

648
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:27,246
right now. I'm a little on thin
ice when it comes to privileges.

649
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:32,783
I'm very familiar
with your stress reactions.

650
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:36,036
What's going on?

651
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:38,777
Nothing.

652
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:41,503
Did the killer contact you?

653
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,160
He's holding something
over your head. What is it?

654
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,564
MARTIN:
Look at him go, dear.

655
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:49,102
Profiler extraordinaire.

656
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,432
Shut up.

657
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:53,012
What happened?

658
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,074
Malcolm, I am begging you: go.

659
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,855
You're working up your nerve.

660
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,316
There's something
he wants you to do.

661
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:04,233
That's your purse from the park.
The one you lost.

662
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,494
- Uh...
- What's in there? -I'm quite certain, son,

663
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:09,519
you're not supposed
to ask a lady that.

664
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,403
You're here to kill him.

665
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,913
Sorry, what's that now?

666
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,504
(exhales)

667
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,264
JESSICA (whispers):
He says your father

668
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:25,967
has to die.

669
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,551
BRIGHT: You're not
working with a clear head.

670
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:30,793
The killer's gotten
under your skin.

671
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,463
You're not going to do this.

672
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,762
JESSICA:
Why?

673
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,510
How do you know that I won't?

674
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:37,762
Because you're a good person.

675
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,267
And going through with this
makes you like him.

676
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,630
And you are nothing like him.

677
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,127
MARTIN: Oh, I wouldn't be
so sure of that, Malcolm.

678
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,543
I can see a look in her eyes.

679
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,795
- Ainsley.
- (knocks)

680
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:03,774
You okay?

681
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,205
What happens next time
somebody's taken?

682
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:09,966
Are we gonna give every killer
this platform?

683
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:12,369
All they have to do is call in
and we put them on TV?

684
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,098
You know we did
a six share today?

685
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:15,526
People died.

686
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:19,006
You reported the news.
That's the job.

687
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:21,127
- (scoffs)
- And you're great at it.

688
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,498
What's the matter?

689
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:29,498
My family.

690
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:32,487
They're not answering.

691
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,080
We should call Gil.

692
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:40,025
No. The killer will know
if I call the police.

693
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,808
And he will know if I don't
go through with it.

694
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,464
How was he planning to verify?
Did he give you

695
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:44,784
- any sort of camera?
- No, he just said

696
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:47,057
that I have 30 minutes
to go through with it,

697
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,971
and if I don't,
an innocent woman will die.

698
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,684
Here. See for yourself.

699
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,300
Who is she?

700
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,474
- He didn't say.
- MARTIN: That's Cathy Paul.

701
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,347
I used to do
the occasional surgery

702
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:01,432
at Tarrytown Medical Center.

703
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,707
Cathy was a, an OR nurse there.

704
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,402
Actually, d-do you have
that other photo?

705
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,655
Ah.

706
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:12,738
Well, now I see it.
That's Dr. Jack Weaver.

707
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:14,879
He assisted me
with the procedures.

708
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,488
Man had terrible breath.

709
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,326
Oh, I shouldn't speak ill
of the dead.

710
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,930
Did anybody ever die
on your table there?

711
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,656
Only one. Uh, Amelia Wheaton.

712
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,941
Congenital heart defect.
She never had a chance.

713
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,379
Did you purposely kill her?

714
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,348
I never hurt a patient
on purpose.

715
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:31,012
I followed the Hippocratic Oath
to the letter.

716
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,332
Albeit with one small asterisk.

717
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,277
We've been looking for someone
connected to your victims,

718
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,723
but this killer is connected
to one of your patients.

719
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,512
And he blames Cathy, too.

720
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:44,524
In-in his eyes,
she's an accessory to murder.

721
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:45,841
Malcolm, what are we
going to do?

722
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:48,511
- I just need a minute to think.
- We don't have a minute.

723
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,863
A good woman dies
so that a bad man can live?

724
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:53,930
You know, I consulted
on three operations this week.

725
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,667
Three. Saved lives.

726
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,219
I mean,
maybe I'm the good person.

727
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:58,973
BRIGHT:
You're not...

728
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,397
a good person.

729
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,730
He tried to kill me
when I was ten years old.

730
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:11,061
(groans, chuckles)

731
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,458
BRIGHT:
I found the girl.

732
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:15,184
I'd learned what he was.

733
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,935
- And he wanted to silence me.
- This is John Watkins

734
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:18,885
told him this.

735
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:21,216
He's taking the word
of a serial killer over...

736
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:22,566
JESSICA:
Over who?

737
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,450
A serial killer? You bastard.

738
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:37,093
Yes, it's true.

739
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,675
I took you up to the cabin
to kill you.

740
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,040
The chloroform had lost its
efficacy, so I thought I'd...

741
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,383
nip it in the bud.

742
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:51,934
But...

743
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,367
...I couldn't bring myself
to go through with it.

744
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,104
That was my choice.

745
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,709
And God knows I've been
paying for it ever since.

746
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,259
You made sure of that.

747
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:07,652
JESSICA:
I never imagined

748
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:11,241
my opinion of you
could drop any lower.

749
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,908
We're out of time.

750
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:19,314
MARTIN:
Well, the solution is clear.

751
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:25,629
If this man told you
to kill me, then kill me.

752
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:27,996
What?

753
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,809
You heard.

754
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,324
I'm the villain here.

755
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,520
The monster.

756
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:37,668
So vanquish me.

757
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:42,344
I hereby put myself
on the chopping block.

758
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,213
Don't be such a martyr.

759
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,169
Come on, boy!

760
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:52,067
Remember Old Jeb Waller.

761
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,390
- What would he do?
- Who?

762
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,434
Are you sure?

763
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:14,458
MARTIN:
Well, look at that.

764
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:16,656
Steady as a statue.

765
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:18,738
JESSICA:
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

766
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:22,012
Malcolm. Malcolm,
you do not have to do this.

767
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:25,574
He's right.

768
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,099
It's the only way.

769
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:29,738
My boy.

770
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,413
(screams)

771
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:40,136

774
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,326
<i>MARTIN:
My boy.</i>

777
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:43,545
BRIGHT:
Stop.

778
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:50,810
Cory Wheaton,
you're under arrest.

779
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,375
- (grunts)
- (handcuffs click)

780

(laughs)

781
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:57,336
Where's the hostage?

782
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,239
- CORY: How did you find me?
- I was wondering how you'd know

783
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:00,942
Martin Whitly was dead.

784
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:05,680
The cameras at Claremont
are ancient, impossible to hack.

785
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:07,945
They haven't hired
new guards there in years.

786
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,055
It's what they don't have:
an operating room.

787
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,617
A morgue.

788
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:14,860
This hospital handles both.

789
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:18,782
So all you needed was some
stolen scrubs and a badge.

790
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,742
(sniffles)

791
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:27,128
Your wife Amelia...
had a heart condition.

792
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:28,994
Martin Whitly tried to save her.

793
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:30,157
He murdered her.

794
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,243
For what it's worth,

795
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,100
The Surgeon never killed
any of his patients.

796
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:38,328
That's a lie. - There's just
one thing I can't figure out.

797
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:40,375
Why now?

798
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:43,383
I thought I'd moved on.

799
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:47,135
But then there's this interview
and a news conference.

800
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,492
Suddenly, it's the Whitlys
everywhere,

801
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:54,996
reminding me of Amelia
and everything I lost.

802
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,136
Why do they get to be happy?

803
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,625
We don't.

804
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:03,703
We never have.

805
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:07,336
We feel the same pain as you do.

806
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:10,524
The kind that never goes away.

807
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,430
But we don't go
murdering people.

808
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:16,336
You're the son.

809
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:19,516
Malcolm.

810
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:23,078
(laughing)

811
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:25,563
It looks like your mother

812
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,930
followed my instructions
perfectly.

813
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:29,211
Where's Cathy?

814
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:30,876
- All right. Bright, easy.
- Where's the nurse?

815
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:33,242
I always knew your mother
had it in her.

816
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:35,321
Where is Cathy?

817
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:38,422
Why should I tell you?
She helped that monster.

818
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,621
You're the monster!
How do you explain Noah?

819
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:43,210
He had nothing to do
with your wife's death.

820
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:47,343
You'll tell yourself anything to
help justify what you've done.

821
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,180
Cathy Paul?

822
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:53,700
She's not a murderer,
she's not an accessory.

823
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,930
She's just an innocent person.

824
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:01,297
Where does it stop?

825
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:08,054
42 Briggs. Apartment 12.

826
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,047
16 Squad Central.

827
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,727
Need a hostage recover,
42 Briggs, Apartment 12.

828
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:14,891
I did you a favor
tonight, Malcolm.

829
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,863
You're free of him.

830
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:19,477
Your father's dead.

831
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:28,594
Do you remember Jebediah Waller?

832
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:31,823
MARTIN:
Why do I know that name?

833
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:34,242
The St. Paul's Stabber.

834
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,336
He tried improvisation.

835
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:39,969
He stabbed a No. 2 pencil into
the heart of a local sheriff.

836
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,111
I know this story. Uh, he
pierced the cop's myocardium

837
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,244
a centimeter beneath
the seventh intercostal.

838
00:41:46,332 --> 00:41:47,509
And the cop lived.

839
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:49,500
I still can't believe
he was okay.

840
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:51,303
You know, there is a,
there is a point

841
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,110
where you can pierce the heart,

842
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:55,602
uh, and not disrupt
a single coronary artery.

843
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,603
So, in effect, you know,
you can be stabbed right here

844
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,770
and somehow emerge
perfectly fine.

I mean, if you miss the target,
the heart will fail,

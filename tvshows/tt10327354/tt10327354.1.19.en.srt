1
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,812
<i>It's why I have to go.</i>

2
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:19,853
This isn't your search anymore.

3
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,420
Hello? Mom?

4
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,289
Oh.

5
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,292
No sign of her yet.

6
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,560
Guess I'm not
as late as I thought.

7
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,795
I'm on my second cup.

8
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,831
Sorry.

9
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,567
Malcolm.

10
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,902
I thought I smelled coffee.

11
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:42,704
- Good morning.
- And you must be Ainsley.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,643
My pleasure.

13
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:50,445
I hope you can keep this off
the record. I'm Nicholas...

14
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,948
Endicott.
I know.

15
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:55,284
Sorry to be intruding.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,787
It's your mother's fault for
making such a damn good martini.

17
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,557
Don't tell her
I crashed your party.

18
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,859
I promised I'd be discreet.

19
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,360
Mmm.

20
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,899
Good coffee.

21
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:12,568
Way to go, Mom?

22
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:15,538
I don't know.
I have done a lot of reading

23
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,973
on Endicott Pharmaceuticals,
and honestly,

24
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,675
they seem kind of shady.

25
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,744
I mean, Dad used to do
research for them,

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,948
and I'm pretty sure
he just gave me a once-over.

27
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,951
Ainsley Whitly,
ever the romantic.

28
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,954
Speaking of, how's Eve?

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,690
She finally reached out
a couple weeks ago.

30
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,495
And?
Did she apologize?

31
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,595
Actually, she broke up with me.

32
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,996
Via voice mail.

33
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,000
Turns out people
can still surprise you.

34
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:46,768
All right.
Let's hear it.

35
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:49,705
Ains, I'm not gonna
play my breakup for you.

36
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,708
Well, you might have
misinterpreted.

37
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,542
You know, women are from Venus
and all that.

38
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:54,776
Let-let me hear it.

39
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:56,246
Come on.

40
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,550
Please?

41
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,856
<i>Hey. I just...</i>

42
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,525
<i>I wanted to say I'm sorry</i>

43
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,494
<i>to leave you
and end things this way.</i>

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,863
<i>But I have to do this
on my own.</i>

45
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,798
<i>Please don't come
after me, okay?</i>

46
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,799
<i>Take care of yourself, Malcolm.</i>

47
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,440
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

48
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,508
Yeah, that was super clear.

49
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:26,743
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,344
I know it hurts.

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,513
It's okay.
It really doesn't.

52
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,551
I'm fine.

53
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,384
Gil.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,419
There's an emergency
at the precinct.

55
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,422
- Give Mother my love.
- Nope. Nope, nope.

56
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,360
Malcolm, do not
leave me stra... Malcolm!

57
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:01,447
What's going on?

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,453
It's Eve.

59
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,889
Oh. Wow.
News travels fast.

60
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,595
Yeah, she broke up with me,
but I'm fine.

61
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,001
Eve's dead.

62
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,002
What?

63
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,309
Suicide.

64
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,542
No.

65
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,676
Unis found her this morning
in the Hudson.

66
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:37,513
Edrisa's examining her now.

67
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,652
Kid, I am so sorry.

68
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,590
Bright? Bright.

69
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,894
Bloat is consistent
with prolonged exposure.

70
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,031
Severe maceration
of the hand and feet.

71
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,733
Foam at the mouth and nostrils

72
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,902
appears antemortem.

73
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,638
Hello, Edrisa.

74
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,346
Bright?
I wasn't expecting the...

75
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,746
Did you eat? I have half
a slamming breakfast burrito.

76
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:11,981
No cheese, extra pico.

77
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,750
I couldn't choke
the whole thing down.

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,753
I don't have
much of an appetite.

79
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,857
Right.
So, what's up?

80
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,626
I-I don't have anything for you.

81
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:27,830
I... Ugh, I mean, you know,
she's just a floater.

82
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,999
They pulled her
from the Hudson last night.

83
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,371
It's pretty gnarly.

84
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,874
Her name's Eve Blanchard.

85
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,079
Oh, y...
Oh, you know her.

86
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,780
I'm sorr...
Uh, Bright,

87
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,417
- I'm so sorry.
- Please.

88
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,583
Tell me what you know.

89
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,953
Right.
Um...

90
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,422
Well, I can tell from

91
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,525
my initial examination

92
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,093
that Eve has been dead for,

93
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,165
um, approximately two weeks.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,833
She never even
made it out of town.

95
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,835
Eve's death wasn't a suicide,

96
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,671
it was a murder,
and I want on the case.

97
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,972
Look, she had a dark past...

98
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,174
- I have a dark past.
- We talked to Homicide.

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,876
They're calling it a suicide.

100
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,177
Said Eve had a history
of depression,

101
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:17,513
- that she's medicated...
- I'm medicated.

102
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,047
Again, irrelevant.

103
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,184
Eve died two weeks ago.

104
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,919
Right after she found out
her sister was still alive.

105
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:26,855
She wasn't depressed,
she was motivated.

106
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,124
Driven to find her.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,891
I know what you're gonna say,

108
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,527
that I'm too close to this
and I can't be objective...

109
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,931
- All true.
- but I'm not gonna let you bench me.

110
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,702
Not this time.

111
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,215
Dig in.

112
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,585
Do what you got to do.

113
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,587
But first...

114
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,092
someone's got to
tell your mother.

115
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,234
Of course,
as parents, our first instinct

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,503
is to protect our children.

117
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,239
But you're suffering
just as much as Malcolm.

118
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,245
You have to remember to make
space for your own grief.

119
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,179
Malcolm.

120
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,047
Eve's office just called.

121
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,948
I'm so sorry.

122
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:30,119
Malcolm, you have
my deepest condolences.

123
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,787
Thank you.

124
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,789
Jessica tells me
your friend's death

125
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,058
was ruled a suicide.

126
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,027
The police are still
investigating.

127
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,996
I'm sorry.
It's a needless tragedy.

128
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,999
But I should be going.

129
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,133
This is a time for family.

130
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,773
- Take care of yourself.
- Mm.

131
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,213
Nicholas was with you
when you got the call?

132
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:00,850
He was.

133
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,787
I just wish
that Eve had reached out

134
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,256
- to one of us...
- Eve was murdered.

135
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,958
What?

136
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,859
- Her office told me...
- They told you it was a suicide

137
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:13,028
because that's what the killer
wanted us to believe.

138
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,631
Dad warned me.

139
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,635
And I think he knew who it was.

140
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,171
Well, then, we have no choice
but to demand the truth.

141
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,705
I'll have Dolpho
bring the car around.

142
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,107
He'll never tell us.

143
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,943
Oh, never bet against
your mother, darling.

144
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,811
<i>Your father's just a man.</i>

145
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,650
<i>Grab him where it counts
and he'll squeal like a pig.</i>

146
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,897
- Ainsley?
- Mom...

147
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,969
Why are you here?

148
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,133
What is this?

149
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,273
Well, isn't that obvious?

150
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,743
It's a family reunion.

151
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:03,873

152
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,564
Oh, we should celebrate.

153
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,602
You know, the canteen sells
a very festive Cajun snack mix.

154
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:16,048
Eddie, could you
grab us a few bags to nosh on?

155
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,182
A-And get something
for yourself.

156
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,951
I hope he heard that.

157
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:23,322
My, uh, new friend has a touch
of wrestler's ear.

158
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,091
If he comes back
with cheddar or ranch,

159
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,329
just be cool about it.

160
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,430
I uncovered some information

161
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,901
on the girl in the box.

162
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:37,206
Sophie Sanders worked
for Nicholas Endicott.

163
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,339
What? No.

164
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,874
No, that can't be true.

165
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,209
Nicholas had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

166
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:46,811
He is a good man.

167
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,217
There's only one monster
in this story.

168
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,654
You made a deal with Sophie.

169
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:58,223
She had information,
dirt on someone.

170
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,992
That's why you let her live.

171
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,764
That information was on Nicholas
Endicott, wasn't it, Dad?

172
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,833
He's the reason Dad got
the plea deal of the century.

173
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:10,868
No, that can't be true.

174
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:14,305
Mom, this isn't a coincidence.

175
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,278
Wait, why are you two here?

176
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:21,115
Eve Blanchard was murdered.

177
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,315
My boy.

178
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,084
Oh, I'm so sorry.

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,088
Oh, she was
such a spirited girl.

180
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:32,290
A real match
for your vigor, but...

181
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:33,825
I did warn her.

182
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:35,493
Why?

183
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,199
Why did you want to stop Eve
from searching for her sister?

184
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,898
I don-I don't think we should

185
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,166
discuss this
in front of your mother.

186
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,803
She's upset,
and understandably so.

187
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,473
Let's leave the past
in the past.

188
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,742
Focus on us.

189
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:52,014
Our family.

190
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,914
We are not your family.

191
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,483
We are just a group of people

192
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,151
tragically bound to you
by blood.

193
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,192
Your children want answers.

194
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,224
Talk!

195
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,393
Or there will be
no more family reunions.

196
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:11,032
With any of us.

197
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,978
The kids are right
about Nicholas.

198
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,044
I will tell you

199
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,412
what Sophie told me,

200
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,515
for your own good.

201
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,818
To save you from the same fate

202
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:35,023
that befell our poor Eve.

203
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,391
Sophie told me...

204
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:42,261
You can never say no to him.

205
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:43,462
<i>"Never</i>

206
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:44,997
tell him no."

207
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,902
That's Nicholas Endicott's
one rule.

208
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,068
Oh, he plucked Sophie
off the street,

209
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:53,338
gave her a job,
turned her life around,

210
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,507
and all she had to do

211
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,175
was say yes.

212
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,079
Nicholas' empire
is built on cruelty.

213
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:04,583
And he saved his truly

214
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:08,152
despicable requests for Sophie.

215
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:10,856
I did everything he asked.

216
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:13,124
I knew if I didn't...

217
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,294
I'd be next.

218
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,996
It takes a special
kind of monster

219
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,868
to turn someone else into one.

220
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,369
You're lying.

221
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,439
Sorry, Jess.

222
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:30,278
Another romantic
swing and a miss for you.

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,882
Please tell me he's lying.

224
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,083
I can't.

225
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,518
The profile makes sense.

226
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,088
Nicholas Endicott
is a genetic narcissist.

227
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,857
A born sociopath.

228
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:46,624
But Eve must have
gotten too close.

229
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,160
Please stop.

230
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:49,627
I don't want to hear
any more about this.

231
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:51,630
A sociopath
who no one ever said no to.

232
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,967
And a man we will
all stay away from.

233
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,401
- I said stop.
- Fine with me.

234
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:57,636
Should we play
highlights/lowlights?

235
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:59,103
Oh, you loved that

236
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,104
when you were kids.

237
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,239
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,306
I know this is a shock.

239
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,407
But if Nicholas killed Eve...

240
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,010
Uh, one quibble there.

241
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,944
He would never have
done that himself.

242
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,180
Remember, murder's just

243
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:12,117
another business transaction...
a task for a loyal employee.

244
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:13,417
A contract killer.

245
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:14,518
I'll find him.

246
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,655
Force him to flip on Endicott.

247
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:17,955
Flip on Endicott?

248
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:19,424
Did you hear what I said?

249
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,560
He will destroy us all.

250
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:22,960
Goodbye, Dr. Whitly.

251
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:23,996
Malcolm...

252
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:25,396
I forbid you from continuing

253
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:27,064
this investigation.

254
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,233
Malcolm Whitly,

255
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,167
I am still your father!

256
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,536
Well...

257
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:33,372
I'd say that was a lowlight.

258
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,143
You slept with him, didn't you?

259
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,678
Good thing you never say no.

260
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,264
I've completed Eve's autopsy.

261
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:03,968
Cause of death?

262
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,603
She drowned.

263
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,140
And there are
injuries consistent

264
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,177
with hitting the water
from a significant height.

265
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:18,617
But it wasn't a suicide.

266
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:20,718
Drowning is a diagnosis
of exclusion,

267
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,587
meaning I've ruled out
literally every other

268
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,989
possible cause of death.

269
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:27,358
So most pathologists would have
toed the company line

270
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,460
and ruled it a suicide.

271
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:30,494
The company line?

272
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,496
I got a call from

273
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:32,497
the commissioner's office.

274
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,098
They were wondering why

275
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:35,733
I haven't made my determination.

276
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,502
That's Endicott at work.

277
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,603
What did you tell them?

278
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,205
Don't worry, I am not like

279
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,007
most pathologists.

280
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,008
That's for sure.

281
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:45,710
When a person inhales water,

282
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,747
diatoms...
a kind of microalgae...

283
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,148
enters into the lungs,
then circulates

284
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,584
through the organs.

285
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,520
I extracted the diatoms
from Eve's bone marrow,

286
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,689
examined them,
revealing a slightly

287
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:59,358
different level of chlorophyll

288
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:01,229
than in the sample
water from the river.

289
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,363
- Meaning?
- Someone drowned her.

290
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,335
And then threw her
off that bridge.

291
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,034
Bright...

292
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,103
Our first profile
is straightforward.

293
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,739
Nicholas Endicott
is the sociopath puppet master.

294
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,141
He's already proven he can
pull strings at the NYPD.

295
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,444
We have no way of knowing
how far his reach extends.

296
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,079
He's the killer
who doesn't kill.

297
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:24,782
Eve's murderer is different.

298
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,385
We're looking for an assassin.

299
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,319
They're almost
impossible to profile.

300
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,287
So...

301
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:31,622
I don't have one.

302
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:33,525
Oh.

303
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:35,193
Bummer.

304
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:37,094
If I have a blind spot...

305
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,733
this is it.

306
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,269
I might know a guy.

307
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,145
Espresso, please.

308
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:58,150
How's the family, Ciro?

309
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,654
16 grandchildren now.

310
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,259
Shall I pull out the pictures?

311
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,193
That's what I thought.

312
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,464
I need information.

313
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,099
On a pro?

314
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:17,368
Why bother?
You're never gonna catch him.

315
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:20,405
Just like you never caught me.

316
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,705
Indulge me.

317
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,840
Gil...

318
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,776
the arthritis...

319
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:27,115
makes it so tough
to pull a trigger.

320
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:33,819
The Five Families must have
been sad to see you go.

321
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:36,488
You, uh, bring a friend?

322
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,259
I don't know
what you're talking about.

323
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,624
Nice coat.

324
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,194
But it's in the wrong borough.

325
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,198
I can smell a fed a mile away.

326
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,568
Hey, tell the Bureau
what I told Arroyo here.

327
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,402
I've closed up shop.

328
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,606
The field office
is a busy place.

329
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,407
There's only
so many bomb threats

330
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,142
we can comb through in a day.

331
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,744
But I'd be happy to put
your name back in the hopper.

332
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,381
Or you could give
my colleague here

333
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,086
the information he needs.

334
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:08,652
Who was it?

335
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:10,622
A woman.

336
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,590
Eve Blanchard.

337
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,492
- Nice girl.
- That's a shame,

338
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:15,794
killing a woman.

339
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,595
Special place in hell for that.

340
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,662
Save it, Ciro.

341
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:19,763
We both know assassins

342
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,465
try to avoid overlap.

343
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,536
Too many active hits in the same
city at the same time.

344
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:26,670
What we need to know

345
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:28,843
is who's been working New York.

346
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,383
<i>They call her The Nightingale.</i>

347
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,286
Ciro said she's
possibly in her mid-30s.

348
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:42,820
- Any other description?
- No.

349
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,290
She's famously skilled
at concealing her identity.

350
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,590
Oh, cool. Should be easy then.

351
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:48,193
Yeah, but we're not
looking for her.

352
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,561
We're looking
for her next target.

353
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:53,531
The big data whistleblower,
Conrad Hulce,

354
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:57,204
has a ticket on the 234 to D.C.

355
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,641
Bar charging station,
poppy seed.

356
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,645
Way too much cream cheese.

357
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:10,415
Okay, let's keep our distance.

358
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,865
The Nightingale's here.

359
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,567
Might not go down today,

360
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:30,502
but she's watching him.

361
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,570
I can feel it.

362
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,505
<i>Bright, there are</i>

363
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,973
hundreds of women in this place.

364
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,576
<i>You're right.</i>

365
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:38,976
I'm working without a profile.

366
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,448
Any one of them
could be the assassin.

367
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,386
There's no way to get
the drop on her.

368
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,424
We need to draw her out.

369
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,998
When the commotion starts,

370
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,000
one woman will remain
perfectly calm.

371
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,335
What commotion?

372
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:04,469
Find her.

373
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:05,869
I'll take care of the rest.

374
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,472
<i>Bright?</i>

375
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,873
<i>Bright.</i>

376
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,341
What commotion?

377
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:11,612
What the hell's he doing?

378
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,346
<i>Bright.</i>

379
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,379
<i>Come in, Bright.</i>

380
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:16,817
<i>Bright, come in, Bright.</i>

381
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,587
Conrad Hulce!

382
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:21,655
Is that you?

383
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,358
A knife!

384
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,791
He just-just got stabbed!

385
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,870
Come on, let's go!

386
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,808
Squad Central, this is Tarmel.

387
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:46,980
We need a bus.

388
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,646
Fall to the ground.

389
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:52,751
I'm gonna save your life.

390
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,486
It's ketchup.
Start screaming.

391
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:11,000
You definitely know
how to cause some commotion.

392
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:12,969
Just get out of here. Go, go!

393
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:15,475
One o'clock, shopping bag.

394
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,542
I'm on it.

395
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,460
CIA?

396
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,864
NYPD.

397
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:18,600
<i>What am I doing?</i>

398
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,602
I should be working this story.

399
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,871
I'm the one who figured out that
your boyfriend is super shady.

400
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,773
Again, not my...

401
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,042
Fine, your-your special pal.

402
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,910
I don't care what we call him.

403
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:31,481
I am not afraid
of Nicholas Endicott.

404
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,683
Or any other old man

405
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,617
in a $20,000 suit.

406
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,620
I am not afraid of him, Ainsley.

407
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:40,726
I liked him.

408
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,697
He was the first man
in a long time that I could...

409
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,531
He was a widower.

410
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,932
I thought he was broken like me.

411
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,971
I thought he understood.

412
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,507
But I was wrong.

413
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,643
So...

414
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,546
until you have endured
a lifetime of heartache,

415
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:06,415
maybe you could
give the old woman

416
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:09,886
in a $20,000 suit
a little credit.

417
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:13,188
Mom... two things.

418
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:16,792
First, I am going
to take Endicott down.

419
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,528
Second...

420
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:19,932
you're not old.

421
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,470
Oh, no, please, Ainsley.

422
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,671
I'm a reporter.

423
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:30,476
This is what I do.

424
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:44,787
Two weeks ago,
you took someone from me.

425
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:47,456
Eve Blanchard
clawed her way out

426
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:50,760
from a nightmare childhood.

427
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:53,095
She built herself a life.

428
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:56,465
She wasn't like you or me.

429
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,867
She was good.

430
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,470
It's a job.

431
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,908
I know that.

432
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,512
But you killed her.

433
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:21,890
Maybe you know something
about nightmare childhoods.

434
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,193
Is that accent Warsaw?

435
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,029
Are you a profiler?

436
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,164
I work with the police.

437
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,165
Don't bother.

438
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:31,800
You can't shrink me.

439
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:37,643
I need to understand you.

440
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:43,846
I need to understand
why Eve Blanchard is dead.

441
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:47,782
My one phone call
was to the CIA.

442
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:50,520
They've offered me a job before.

443
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,687
Today I accepted.

444
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:55,961
So our time together is limited.

445
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,262
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

446
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,535
She sounds lovely.

447
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,569
But I didn't kill her.

448
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:08,875
I've been set up on Conrad
for the last month.

449
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:13,512
How did she die?

450
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,312
Drowned.

451
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:18,781
Apparent suicide.

452
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:21,817
Ooh.

453
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,552
Tough job.

454
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:25,820
You have to really sell it.

455
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:30,859
Your lawyer is here.

456
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:32,731
CIA.

457
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,203
What do you mean,
"you need to sell it"?

458
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,076
Staging a suicide
is complicated.

459
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:50,946
In success, there is not even
a whisper of foul play.

460
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:52,615
So you have to get close.

461
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,716
You have to get to know them.

462
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,985
Their home, their habits.

463
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:00,255
It's tedious...

464
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,661
but lucrative.

465
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,366
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:10,402 --> 00:24:12,667
We'll keep eyes on her.

467
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,369
What if she's telling the truth?

468
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:18,577
Whoever it was found their way
into Eve's life.

469
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,182
We need to go to her apartment.

470
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:31,020
Any update on Mr. David's
illness?

471
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:34,357
I'm not sure.

472
00:24:34,393 --> 00:24:35,992
I guess I can ask.

473
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,761
Thank you.

474
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:41,630
He and I have been together
such a long time now,

475
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,033
I, uh, I can't help but worry.

476
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,168
Hmm.

477
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:49,107
And I requested the telephone.

478
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,174
Where is it?

479
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,143
I need to check on my family.

480
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,012
I-I was told, on this unit,

481
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,351
prisoners aren't
allowed phone access.

482
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,819
I am not like other prisoners.

483
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:49,130
What do you think?
Is this acceptable?

484
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,133
The guards call it
"the penthouse."

485
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,969
I guess that's gallows humor,

486
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:56,806
but it's apt,
all things considered.

487
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:58,073
What's the square footage?

488
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,078
I don't know, Martin.

489
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:06,182
I could put some shelves here.

490
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:08,050
A desk.

491
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:11,990
A Persian rug would do wonders.

492
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:21,297
Don't look so paranoid, Martin.

493
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,465
I'd never poison you.

494
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,935
I just thought you might like
one last taste

495
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,472
of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

496
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:31,242
You should have
let it breathe first.

497
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:07,009
This is the last time we will
ever see each other again.

498
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,145
I've secured you
a very comfortable cage.

499
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:11,547
I hope that we can walk away

500
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,319
two satisfied parties.

501
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:16,952
As long as...

502
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,824
I get certain assurances.

503
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:23,428
To détente.

504
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:36,137
Oh, excuse me?

505
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,810
- I-I didn't order this.
- You should have.

506
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:41,810
Pinot grigio, as a rule,

507
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:44,012
has no personality.

508
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,085
I think it's time we had a chat.

509
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,652
Earthy, isn't it?
A bit gamey, even?

510
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:01,647
- It's delicious.
- Well, of course it is.

511
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,324
Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

512
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,297
This is such a treat,
the two of us, sharing a drink.

513
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:13,297
But I have to ask...

514
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,336
are you spying on me?

515
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:23,075
It can be difficult for adult
children, when their parent

516
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:25,443
enters into a relationship
with someone new.

517
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:28,015
I'm very protective
of my mother.

518
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,950
I think I'm falling for her.

519
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:35,152
I would do anything to...

520
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:38,656
make her life one
she's excited to live again.

521
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:40,659
My mother doesn't hate her life.

522
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:43,194
But what Martin did,

523
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,364
it-it's... stifled her.

524
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,933
There's so much potential
for happiness in Jessica.

525
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:52,240
And Malcolm. And you.

526
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,445
Tell me why you're here.

527
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,412
I want to profile you.

528
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,548
A prime-time segment
on Endicott Pharmaceuticals.

529
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:06,684
You're ambitious.

530
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,620
That's good.

531
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,622
And what's your endgame?

532
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,225
An anchor seat?
Chair on <i>The View?</i>

533
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,660
Or maybe you want more.

534
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:18,529
How about White House
press secretary?

535
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:21,533
I don't know.

536
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:25,103
I guess I never really let
myself think that big.

537
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,338
Because you never
had a man like me

538
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:29,373
in your corner.

539
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:30,678
Now you do.

540
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,954
Where do you want to start?

541
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,423
Doesn't matter.

542
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,396
I don't need gloves.

543
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,299
Tally has these red shoes.

544
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,568
I don't know who makes them
or what you call them,

545
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:59,403
but she wore them

546
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:01,739
on this really good night out.

547
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:05,177
And now, every time
I see them in the closet,

548
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:06,510
it comes back.

549
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:09,280
That feeling...

550
00:30:09,316 --> 00:30:11,053
of us.

551
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,087
Sorry, man.

552
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:18,623
It's okay.

553
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,395
I'll take the bedroom.

554
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:05,740
Yo, Bright.

555
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:08,507
Did you find one, too?

556
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:12,643
- They're all over the apartment.
- The killer was upstairs.

557
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,483
This whole time.

558
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,086
Watching us.

559
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:26,091
You can tell
my overprotective son

560
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,258
that I am safe.

561
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:28,759
Join me?

562
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,499
I can't stay for long.
I just came to check on you.

563
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,038
Yeah, okay.

564
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:41,176
I'm sorry.

565
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:44,809
I know Eve was your friend.

566
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,548
You should be worried
about Malcolm, not me.

567
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,451
I always worry about Malcolm.

568
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:53,085
As much as he resists it.

569
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,657
A quality he shares
with his mother.

570
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:03,598
All Eve ever knew was pain.

571
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,700
It's such a shame
that she'll never see justice

572
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:11,303
brought to the man
who took her sister.

573
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,509
Are you talking about Martin?
Or Nicholas?

574
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,512
What's the difference?

575
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,515
They are both malicious,

576
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:26,218
deceitful criminals.

577
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:27,619
And I chose them.

578
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,787
- Jess...
- What is wrong with me?

579
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,790
What is it about me
that I attract these...

580
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,829
these horrible men?

581
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,833
There is nothing wrong with you.

582
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:45,173
And there are good men
out there, too.

583
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:49,444
I had a chance with a good man.

584
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,478
I screwed it up.

585
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,449
We both did.

586
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,487
Too bad we missed
our window, huh?

587
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:06,461
Yeah.

588
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:09,630
Too bad.

589
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:12,697
The apartment above Eve's
wasn't rented.

590
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:14,598
The killer must have broken in,
squatted.

591
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,634
Who knows how long
they were watching her.

592
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,270
I pulled all the security
footage from the past month.

593
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,704
Tech Services is running
facial recognition

594
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,707
and cross-referencing
these images

595
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:24,880
- with the list of known tenants.
- That'll take days.

596
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:28,180
Stop.

597
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,648
That guy.

598
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:31,783
Yeah, his face is angled away
from the camera.

599
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,250
It's like he's purposely
planning his movements

600
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:34,421
to avoid it.

601
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,523
Look, Bright,
there he is again.

602
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,858
Hat. Headphones.

603
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,460
Look.

604
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,296
Hoodie.

605
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:45,564
What does it mean?

606
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,765
And who wears
white pants every day?

607
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,200
Hold on.

608
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,468
His ears are always covered.

609
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:51,536
Why?

610
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,704
Because they'll identify him.

611
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,440
<i>The pants are his uniform.</i>

612
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:56,674
<i>It's Eddie, the new guard.</i>

613
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,976
<i>He's got
perichondral hematoma.</i>

614
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,510
Cauliflower ear.

615
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:01,582
We have to get
to Claremont. Now.

616
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:14,626
Doctor, you have a visitor.

617
00:34:14,662 --> 00:34:16,427
How wonderful.

618
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:18,463
Is it my son?

619
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,664
- Mm-hmm.
- Perhaps he's, uh,

620
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,803
finally decided
to heed my warning.

621
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:27,871
You were right,
you're not like other prisoners.

622
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:31,508
You shouldn't have told
your family about Mr. Endicott.

623
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:51,530
NYPD!
Open the door!

624
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:56,566
Dr. Whitly!

625
00:34:56,602 --> 00:34:57,604
Hey, we need help!

626
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:04,409
Dad! No!

627
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:08,847
Oh!

628
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,458
This is for my son.

629
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:24,963
No. Stop.

630
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:27,496
No!

631
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:28,668
No.

632
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,336
Open this door.
Open this door.

633
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,474
- NYPD. Let him go!
- Dr. Whitly,

634
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,979
- take your hands off him.
- Let him go!

635
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:47,849
Call for medical assistance.
Go, go, go.

636
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:51,456
You're under arrest
for the murder of Eve Blanchard.

637
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:55,891
JT, you good?

638
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:58,827
So, this is JT.

639
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:01,731
I've met the whole team. Hi.

640
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,836
I'm Martin.

641
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,503
Good thing
you came in when you did.

642
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,542
I was being brutally attacked.

643
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:12,507
Yeah.

644
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:15,010
Good thing.

645
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,347
<i>And he... he threw</i>

646
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,914
- his little glove...
- No.

647
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,416
...right at Luisa, and then
he marched back to the car

648
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:23,019
with his little arms
pumping dramatically

649
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,121
the entire way.

650
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:29,691
Mm.

651
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:31,396
Mm.

652
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,639
I should go.

653
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,871
Oh. Yes.

654
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:45,007
No, of course. It's late.

655
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:47,642
But thank you.

656
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:49,349
I needed this.

657
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:56,055
Gil.

658
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,894
We didn't miss our window.

659
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,162
I slammed it shut.

660
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,901
You were right to.

661
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:12,704
I met Jackie.

662
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,975
Had a whole life.

663
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:19,541
We moved on, Jess.
No regrets.

664
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:21,010
I have regrets.

665
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:24,981
I do. I told you
we were from different worlds.

666
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:27,919
- We are.
- But that's not why I ended things.

667
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,789
I was scared.

668
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:36,191
You were the one good thing

669
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:38,563
in my son's life.

670
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:41,798
I let you believe...

671
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:44,967
that you weren't
good enough for me...

672
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:47,570
because it was...

673
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:51,206
easier than admitting...

674
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:54,579
that I could never be
good enough for you.

675
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,816
You're good enough, Jess.

676
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:07,160
You have <i>always</i>
been good enough.

677
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:37,119
Killer's in the hospital.

678
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:39,755
We got a uni on him.
He's not going anywhere

679
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,523
till we question him
in the morning.

680
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,693
No matter what,
it's a good collar.

681
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:46,998
It doesn't bring her back.

682
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:51,204
I'm sorry.

683
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,475
You did it.
You got the guy that killed Eve.

684
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:57,809
That matters.

685
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:22,731
He doesn't matter.

686
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,833
There's no profile.

687
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,739
And he killed Eve
because it was his job.

688
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:31,843
Endicott hired him to do it.

689
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:35,010
He'll make a deal.

690
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,782
That's not gonna happen.

691
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,054
You're right.

692
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,320
Where are you going?

693
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,025
Bright.

694
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,329
I'm with Major Crimes.

695
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:55,331
Lieutenant Arroyo sent me.

696
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,088
Hello, Eddie.

697
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:24,553
<i>What do you mean
by "assurances"?</i>

698
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,201
You're already locked up,

699
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:28,744
and this cell suits you,
for now.

700
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,940
But what happens in ten years,
when you're a caged animal

701
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,367
and when you go stir-crazy
and decide to burn it all down?

702
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,036
We have a deal:

703
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:39,373
mutual assurance or...

704
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,579
mutual destruction.

705
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:44,711
I need more.

706
00:40:44,747 --> 00:40:48,081
I take comfort
in a certain measure of control,

707
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:50,119
and my business
provides it for me.

708
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:53,153
What do you want?

709
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,190
I broke some laws,
just like you...

710
00:40:56,226 --> 00:41:00,126
but my business trades in
the science of the human body.

711
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:03,764
It's helped me realize that
there's one form of leverage

712
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,869
that trumps all the others.

713
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:08,138
So I use it.

714
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,137
Don't cross me, Martin.

715
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:14,074
If you tell anyone
about Sophie Sanders,

716
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,309
I will do more than destroy you,

717
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:18,311
I will destroy
your entire family.

718
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:19,979
Do not threaten my...

719
00:41:20,015 --> 00:41:22,916
I will bankrupt your estate,
ruin your children,

720
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:25,689
and make love
to your beautiful wife.

721
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,231
But it probably
won't come to that.

722
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,668
And in the meantime,

723
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:43,336
I'll make sure
you get a nice rug.

724
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:44,807
Deal?

725
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:08,932
I can't do this anymore.

726
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,378
I need you to go.

727
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:26,249
I said go!

728
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,987
Whoa.

729
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:36,827
Whoa. My name's Malcolm Bright.
I work with the NYPD.

730
00:42:39,796 --> 00:42:40,964
Gil.

731
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,369
Eddie was killed
in the hospital.

732
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:52,775
Edrisa found DNA on the body.

733
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:55,275
Your DNA.

734
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,277
Well, he was alive
when I went to question him.

735
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,079
This was not
an accidental transfer.

736
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:00,914
It was hair...

737
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,453
skin cells
under the fingernails.

738
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:06,019
Too much to ignore.

739
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:08,125
That's impossible.

740
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,425
I'm sorry.

741
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:14,494
Gil, you...
you know I didn't do this.

742
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,833
Malcolm Bright,
you're under arrest for murder.

743
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,400

Greg, move your head.

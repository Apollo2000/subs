1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,158
Malcolm, listen to me.

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:05,359
You're my son.

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,920
I will always love you.

4
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:09,119
Because we're the same.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,590
<i>We're the same.</i>

6
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:11,812
<i>We're the same.</i>

7
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:15,903
You know you're wrong.
I'm nothing like you.

8
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:17,694
We are not the same.

9
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:23,954
Sorry. Please, no.

10
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:26,046
You obviously have been
working on that for a while.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,682
I was just gonna make a joke
about our matching jumpsuits,

12
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,986
- and, uh...
- I'm not a killer... like you.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,093
Like me? No. No.

14
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:38,096
No, I got away with
way more murders than you did.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,954
Leaving all that DNA on the body?

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,092
Very sloppy, son.

17
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:43,550
You've got to clean up after yourself.

18
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,503
First rule of killing.

19
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:46,628
And kindergarten.

20
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,289
- I was framed!
- Sure.

21
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,492
But still.

22
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,968
A part of you must be happy

23
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,237
Eve's killer is dead.

24
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,067
It's okay if you did it. I won't tell.

25
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:02,493
It wasn't me.

26
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:05,287
Say it louder and angrier, and
I will definitely believe you.

27
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,511
I'm not a killer!

28
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:09,150
Whoa, man, sit your ass down!

29
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,798
- Wait, wait. What? Who are you?
- Nobody to you.

30
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:14,823
So why are you yelling at me

31
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:16,338
like I'm Maury Povich or something?

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,367
Sorry. Sorry, I was having a nightmare.

33
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,674
We're in jail, pal.

34
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,976
- This is the nightmare.
- Malcolm Bright.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,695
You made bail.

36
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:30,415
It's about time.
No more crazies, thank you.

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,368
Hey, guys, what the hell's going on?

38
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:34,908
You're being released.

39
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:36,655
Under your mother's recognizance.

40
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,024
No leaving the manor
without a court order.

41
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:40,592
An ankle monitor? Come on.

42
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:41,726
They can't put me on house arrest.

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,695
I need to work this case, clear my name.

44
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,687
Hey, sorry, man, we're not even
supposed to be talking.

45
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,288
I didn't murder Eddie.

46
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:50,792
Edrisa found DNA on the vic.

47
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,562
Your DNA. How can you explain that?

48
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,221
I can't. Not yet.

49
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,714
But Nicholas Endicott is behind this.

50
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:00,111
- Killing Eve, framing me...
- We know, Bright.

51
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:03,281
But that's exactly why
you look good for this.

52
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:04,673
You're so emotional.

53
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,731
How can I <i>not</i> be?!

54
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:11,556
Okay, okay, I hear that note.

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,826
Stop talking to the police, Malcolm.

56
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,482
They are not your friends.
My attorneys are.

57
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,723
Good thing I hire them
by the dozen. Let's go.

58
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,066
You're grounded.

59
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,692
Yoo-hoo.

60
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,411
Anybody home?

61
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,658
Hello?

62
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:03,742
<i>- Good morning, Martin.</i>
- Nicholas.

63
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,410
<i>Um...</i>

64
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:09,881
I-I was, um... I was hoping
that we'd get a chance to speak.

65
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:14,219
You know, your, uh...
your man Eddie there, uh,

66
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:16,755
acted a little prematurely.

67
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:21,059
<i>Funny. My only issue with him</i>

68
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,661
was his follow-through.

69
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:26,696
Your secrets are still
safe and secure. Okay?

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,650
I mean, sure, I, uh...

71
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:31,510
I shared a few tidbits with my family,

72
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:34,214
but nothing that could stand up in court.

73
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,584
Are you begging for your life, Martin?

74
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,883
How far The Surgeon has fallen.

75
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,748
You know, I can still hurt you, Nicholas.

76
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:46,490
One word from me, and people will know

77
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,658
exactly what you are.

78
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,963
Good point. We should
reassess your phone privileges.

79
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:54,898
<i>All your privileges, actually.</i>

80
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,033
<i>The punishment must fit the crime.</i>

81
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,894
What crime? I to... I told you,
I didn't do anything.

82
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,442
I heard you were caught trying to escape.

83
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:13,216
No, no, no, no, I wa...
I wasn't trying...

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,818
- Stay down!
- You got it wrong.

85
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:15,986
You don't understand.

86
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,787
Ah! No.

87
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,190
You've got it wrong. I have to
talk to Malcolm Bright!

88
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,292
I need my son!

89

90
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,266
Well, thank you for calling, Alan,

91
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,701
but we are all lawyered up.

92
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,992
Yes.

93
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:36,406
Yes.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,475
Well, I want him to have
a good defense, too,

95
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,310
but my son is not Claus von Bülow.

96
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,133
He is actually innocent.

97
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:46,883
- What are you doing?
- Escaping.

98
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,953
Sorry, Mother,
I need to work on this case,

99
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:51,388
and I can't do that from a living room.

100
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:55,192
Malcolm Whitly, there will be
no escaping from this home.

101
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:57,060
Don't worry. At Glynco, I studied

102
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,062
fugitive trade craft
with the Marshals Service.

103
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:03,233
I should have everything here
to disable the alarm sensor.

104
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,893
I just need a knife to get inside.

105
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,273
Mrs. Whitly?

106
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:12,152
A messenger just dropped this off.

107
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,800
Ah. Thank you, Leonard.

108
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,136
It's from Nicholas.

109
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:20,070
He wants to have dinner tomorrow night.

110
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:24,421
He says he wants to help
with your situation.

111
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,089
I can't believe...

112
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,058
He thinks he can just send you
a fancy invitation,

113
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,092
and everything's normal?

114
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,262
I can't see a reason why I wouldn't go

115
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:33,496
and hear what he has to say.

116
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,145
There are so many reasons.

117
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,635
I'm here to see Jessica.

118
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,031
Oh...

119
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,572
Well, I'd like to say
that it's a pleasure.

120
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:56,705
Malcolm is in his room sulking.

121
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:58,967
It's like the '90s all over again.

122
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:01,470
I'm not here for him.

123
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,028
I wanted to see if you were okay.

124
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,163
I'm fine.

125
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:08,769
Fine, given the...

126
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:13,470
well, everything.

127
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:16,006
I promise, it will all be over soon.

128
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,737
I know that Malcolm didn't kill anyone.

129
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,211
We'll find a way to prove that.

130
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,080
Thank you. Really.

131
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:28,718
Stay here with Malcolm,
safe inside the house.

132
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,820
Jessica?

133
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:31,919
Do you trust me?

134
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,790
Of course I do.

135
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,292
Then let me fix this.

136
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:36,797
Just sit tight.

137
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,973
You can come out now.

138
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,467
Um, he left.

139
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,730
What? But he's wearing a...

140
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,047
He also said
I could sleep in his room.

141
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,315
That's cool, right?

142
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,474
Not cool, Leonard. Not cool.

143
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,200
This bruising on Eddie's neck
indicates how he was

144
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,795
held down, perhaps with
the assailant's forearm.

145
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,179
But that's not the cause of death.

146
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,600
Trace cotton fibers confirm
that he was smothered

147
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:18,302
with a hospital pillow.

148
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:20,637
Which, I mean, right there
you know that it wasn't Bright

149
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:23,040
because where's the pizzazz in a pillow?

150
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:27,711
Suffocation required
our killer to get close.

151
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:32,472
This was intimate. Personal, even.

152
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:35,352
This fits with Bright.

153
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,488
Our vic was tied to
the murder of his girlfriend

154
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:38,922
and an attempt on his father's life.

155
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:42,159
Finding Bright's DNA on Eddie
doesn't help our boy either.

156
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,530
You're wrong.

157
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,698
I mean, you're right,
but you're also wrong.

158
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,537
You're so... so wrong.

159
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,403
I hope that we are, too. But...

160
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,072
if Bright was here, he would
lay out the same profile.

161
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,919
Everybody, take a breath.

162
00:07:58,733 --> 00:07:59,843
Focus on the job.

163
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:02,485
Thanks, Edrisa.

164
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,081
We'll circle back.

165
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,307
How much of that did you hear?

166
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:12,934
Enough.

167
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:16,193
And to think, I was just about to start

168
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:19,149
a meaningful female friendship with Dani.

169
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,776
Maybe.

170
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:25,002
Her profile's correct.

171
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,703
Don't tell me you think you did this.

172
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:28,772
No. I've been framed.

173
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,874
What I can't figure out is the DNA.

174
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:34,778
How did they get my skin
and blood under Eddie's nails?

175
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:37,114
Maybe the killer planted it
on him after the murder.

176
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,082
Planting DNA isn't like planting a gun.

177
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,784
It would take time.

178
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:43,820
The kind you don't have
in a busy hospital.

179
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:45,188
When did you swab his nails?

180
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:46,927
Back here at the lab.

181
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:48,825
I take it you trust your team.

182
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,494
I do, with my life.

183
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:52,529
They're also super fun at karaoke.

184
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,698
So that just leaves Corbell Laboratories.

185
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,100
They processed the results.
What do we know about them?

186
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,269
Well, we do most of our work
through them.

187
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,238
They've worked the city since the '90s.

188
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:04,141
There's no way a single employee
could swap out the results.

189
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,943
I'm not worried about an employee.

190
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,277
I want to know who owns it.

191
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:11,315
All I can find is a number
for their outside counsel.

192
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,416
That's it.

193
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,579
- I have to go.
- Bright!

194
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,146
Sorry. Don't die.

195
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:27,053
I won't. I promise.

196
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,794
He didn't want me to kiss him, right?

197
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,995
What the hell are you doing here?

198
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,546
What's with the empty office, Sterling?

199
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,598
Suddenly bad guys don't need lawyers?

200
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,266
Get the hell out of here.

201
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,568
Answer one question.

202
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,403
Who owns Corbell Laboratories?

203
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,638
I can't discuss that.

204
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:11,011
Nicholas Endicott?
Blink twice if that's a yes.

205
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,977
You can only make this worse, Malcolm.

206
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,214
That's how he's framing me for murder.

207
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,450
He had the lab alter the DNA results.

208
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,480
Shred another document if I'm right.

209
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,791
Do you know why
my mother calls you the devil?

210
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,926
I assumed it was my good looks.

211
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,990
Because she knows that guy.

212
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:35,032
After Endicott convinced you
to represent my father,

213
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:37,834
you became famous for defending killers.

214
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,103
Junk bond traders.

215
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:44,664
And celebrities. So many celebrities.

216
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,423
But what about this lawyer?

217
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:51,014
With civil rights activists,

218
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,250
getting arrested at peace rallies,

219
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,221
representing farm workers.

220
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,724
What happened to that man?

221
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:04,017
I think he hates what he's become.

222
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,254
And he hates the man who did it.

223
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,446
Come on, Sterling.

224
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,573
Be that guy.

225
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:16,830
Tell me about Endicott's lab.

226
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,484
It's funny. 20 years ago,

227
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:30,256
I advised against that acquisition.

228
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:33,880
There's no money in DNA analysis.

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,629
Of course, profits were never
what Nicholas was after.

230
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:40,797
He wanted power.

231
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,935
He kept a lot of
important people out of jail.

232
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,148
And his price was...

233
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,006
almost reasonable.

234
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,908
Absolute loyalty.

235
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,033
Why kill Eve?

236
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:58,615
He must've been afraid
she'd find her sister

237
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,141
and the files Sophie stole.

238
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:08,859
If you want to prove your innocence,

239
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,895
get your father to tell you
where those are.

240
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:13,914
That's the...

241
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,777
Did you bring someone?

242
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:22,933
Sterling!

243
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,149
You need... your dad.

244
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:33,850
He's the only one...

245
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,731
who can end this.

246
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,177
Ah...

247
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:42,954
Five more minutes!

248
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,785
Five minutes!

249
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,883
I know that look.

250
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,176
No lie, gen pop can
be a scary place, Doc.

251
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:12,979
Especially for you.

252
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:16,927
What gave me away?

253
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,185
Everybody knows The Surgeon, man.

254
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:24,057
My usual advice:
find friends that look like you.

255
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,370
I don't think
the Aryan Brotherhood aligns

256
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:30,473
with my, uh...
secular, humanist leanings.

257
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,776
Or my circumcised penis.

258
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,578
They wouldn't take you anyway.

259
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,846
No one will.

260
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,470
Not with the bounty they got out.

261
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,216
Bounty?

262
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:41,685
Someone wants you dead, Doc.

263
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:46,079
They're floatin' cash
to whoever gets to you first.

264
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,658
It's real bad for me, because

265
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:50,647
I'm in charge here.

266
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,775
See those faces?

267
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,736
They all got respect for me.

268
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:58,969
And 3,000 inmates,

269
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:00,637
all of them comin' at your curly head?

270
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:01,697
That's chaos.

271
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,163
And I don't want no more chaos.

272
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,872
Listen, um...

273
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:10,180
you want me gone.

274
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,249
That's what I want, too.

275
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,584
So all I need to do is make a few calls.

276
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:17,187
Uh... there'll be no more bounty.

277
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,134
I'm not here to help you, Doc.

278
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:24,717
I'm just explaining to you
why I have to kill you.

279
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:42,795
Malcolm!

280
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,385
Wh... What the hell?

281
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,094
It's okay, it's okay, it's not
my blood. It's Sterling's.

282
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,768
- He was shot. Not by me.
- How did you get in here?

283
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,770
You may recall a certain
secret tunnel under our home.

284
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:52,205
Oh, the ones murderers use?

285
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,840
Look, I just need to clean up,

286
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,174
put the ankle bracelet back on.

287
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,256
It'll be like I never left.

288
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,810
- Where's, uh...
- Leonard!

289
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,479
Oh, hey.

290
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,214
You know, the Wi-Fi doesn't work
in your room.

291
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:04,250
We need the bracelet. And your shirt.

292
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,252
Strip, young man, strip!

293
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,487
I need to get to Dad.

294
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,654
He's the only one with evidence
against Endicott.

295
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,269
That's the only reason
you want to talk to him?

296
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,291
Oh, Malcolm, you're worried about him.

297
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,726
Look, I need that evidence.

298
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,894
I know he said he wouldn't give it up,

299
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,096
but things are
pretty dire right now, so...

300
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,598
I can tell,
you're using my cashmere throw

301
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:21,278
like it's a paper towel.
The sweater will be fine, dear.

302
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:23,302
We can't get to Dad.
I've called a hundred people.

303
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,504
No one will tell us where he is.

304
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,005
Which isn't sketchy at all.

305
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,140
That's Endicott's work.

306
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,207
There may be another way.

307
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:29,310
The invitation.

308
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,667
Nicholas offered to help you.

309
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:32,145
I want to figure out why.

310
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,881
Ainsley, if I wanted
to record someone on my phone...

311
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:36,683
I would tell you it's a terrible idea.

312
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:37,784
I agree.

313
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,145
That's a terrible idea.

314
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,820
NYPD!

315
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:41,821
- Open up!
- Damn it.

316
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:43,990
All right, uh, I need 30 seconds.

317
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:45,124
Then let them in.

318
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:46,893
Don't go over 30
or JT will knock down the door.

319
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,158
- Okay?
- Got it.

320
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,631
Lieutenant Arroyo and friends.

321
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,099
- How can I...
- We need to see Malcolm.

322
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:54,200
Where is he?

323
00:15:58,301 --> 00:15:59,650
Detectives.

324
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,880
How's the case going?

325
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:02,565
<i>Town & Country?</i>

326
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,350
You expect us to believe
you've been here,

327
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:06,052
reading this the whole time?

328
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:07,674
Where else would I be?

329
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,356
We do have more
than one magazine, Detective.

330
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,393
Mother burns down a forest each
year with her European <i>Vogues.</i>

331
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,226
Gil, what's going on?

332
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,161
Did you go see Everett Sterling?

333
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,863
No, of course not.

334
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,064
What's the meaning of this?

335
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,689
My son has been here all day.

336
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,237
You promise you didn't leave?

337
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,506
Dani, I promise you.

338
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,824
Okay.

339
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:34,344
Since you're here, update me on the case.

340
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,212
Have you made any headway
with Eddie's killer?

341
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,347
I have some thoughts.

342
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,615
Sorry, kid, you got to sit this one out.

343
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,616
We're handling this.

344
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,419
W-Wait. I can help.

345
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:44,154
Uh... But not if I'm stuck here.

346
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:45,488
Please, take me with you.

347
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,623
I-I have to help.

348
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:47,657
We can't.

349
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:50,827
I did it.

350
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,723
I-I went to see Sterling.

351
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,071
And, uh, he got shot
right in front of me.

352
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:02,806
You are a real piece of work.

353
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:04,808
I used the extraction kit

354
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,643
in that bag over there to free myself.

355
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:08,865
You did what?

356
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:09,980
Malcolm.

357
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:13,016
What in the name of
all things holy are you doing?

358
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,051
He's making them take him.

359
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,843
This family, I swear...

360
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,956
Guys, come on.

361
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,991
Do we need these?

362
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:21,958
Apparently, yes.

363
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:23,255
You sure you don't want a lawyer?

364
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,596
You've been saying a lot of words

365
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,996
for a man who's the primary suspect

366
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,230
in a murder investigation.

367
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,199
I'm thinking maybe he needs
two sets of cuffs.

368
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:30,200
Can we do that?

369
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:31,568
One is fine.

370
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,669
And I don't need a lawyer,

371
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,137
I need to solve this case.

372
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,135
You need to stop lying to us.

373
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,873
You need to start believing me.

374
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,142
Um...

375
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,500
Do you guys want to...

376
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:42,846
Talk about how I'm being framed?

377
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,344
Yeah. Sterling told me

378
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,661
how Endicott forges DNA evidence.

379
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,352
Now that, I get.

380
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:51,012
What I don't get...

381
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:53,790
Wait. Can I... can I stand?

382
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,392
Suspects don't usually stand.

383
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,593
You can stand.

384
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,237
Great, thanks.

385
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:01,097
What I don't get is
who did the actual killing?

386
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,533
How did they get
into that room after me...

387
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,935
If you were the last person
who saw Eddie alive?

388
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,704
Yeah, we've been wondering that, too.

389
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,839
- No offense.
- Okay.

390
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,208
What if he wasn't alive?

391
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,078
When you spoke to him?

392
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,679
You're a profiler,
a graduate of Quantico.

393
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,947
You can tell when somebody's dead.

394
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,617
Bright, you went into that room
like a man on fire.

395
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,520
Come on, you didn't try to wake him up?

396
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:26,379
I planned to, yeah.

397
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,648
But then I saw him.

398
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:33,763
The bandages on his eyes
were bloody and...

399
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:38,101
And whatever
I wanted to do, deep down...

400
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,827
Bright. Lawyer?

401
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:45,775
I'm not my father.

402
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,113
We know that.

403
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,788
I didn't even walk over to him.

404
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:01,624
Which means...

405
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,194
he could have been dead the whole time.

406
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,995
That opens up our suspect list

407
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,665
to doctors, nurses, even a few techs.

408
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,026
All of them came through
earlier that evening.

409
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,731
We can make a list of everyone
who went in that room.

410
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:13,775
This is good.

411
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,105
But...

412
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,906
what was Endicott doing?

413
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,642
I don't know,
but you said it before...

414
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,311
Endicott only fears one man.

415
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,312
Your father.

416
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:25,181
Problem is, nobody can talk to him.

417
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,317
- Claremont's cut off all...
- No, no, he's not at Claremont.

418
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:28,852
They moved him to Rikers.

419
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,194
Gen pop?

420
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,443
That's Endicott.

421
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,191
He's breaking their deal.
Gil, this is serious.

422
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,393
My father has the only answer,
and he might not...

423
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,652
Last long in there. I know.

424
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,771
All right.

425
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:52,342
I can cut you loose... for now.

426
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,877
Say that we don't have enough
to charge you.

427
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,845
But...

428
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,480
I can't get you into Rikers.

429
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,282
Don't worry.

430
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,450
<i>I know someone who's good at</i>

431
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,619
<i>getting into all the wrong places.</i>

432
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,029
You didn't have to come in.

433
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:06,656
I'm the one who promised
the warden a puff piece

434
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,347
on "humane prisons."

435
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,702
Hey, kiddos.

436
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,903
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

437
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,970
You don't look so good.

438
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:22,438
Well, I don't feel so good.

439
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,107
I told you this would happen, didn't I?

440
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,609
But did anyone listen to me? No sirree.

441
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,912
Now I'm sitting here
with a target on my back

442
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,581
and I miss my cell and I miss Mr. David

443
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,550
and I do not like it here.

444
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:34,842
Dad...

445
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,487
You're scared.

446
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:39,956
Damn right, I'm scared.

447
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,990
But if Endicott broke your deal,

448
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,992
why not just give us the evidence?

449
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,929
Whatever Sophie had on him,

450
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,164
tell us where it is and
we can nail this guy for good.

451
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,556
I can't.

452
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,030
That's why you're scared.

453
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,441
You don't have anything.

454
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,034
And neither did Sophie.

455
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,146
Mazel tov, you figured it out.

456
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,456
So, wait. There are no files?

457
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,519
Correct. It was a... calculated bluff.

458
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,020
That worked, by the way.

459
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,056
Did you even let Sophie go?

460
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,480
I most certainly did.

461
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,927
I needed her to call Nicholas.

462
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,680
Just once. And then...

463
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,599
I never heard from her ever again.

464
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,834
If you have nothing on Endicott,
that means I'm going to jail.

465
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,569
Okay, no. You can save yourself

466
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,471
by solving Eddie's murder.

467
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,873
I mean, that's what you guys do, right?

468
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:34,510
Sure, I guess. So, h-how was he killed?

469
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,362
Suffocated with a pillow.

470
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,978
- I have sources other than you.
- Brutal method.

471
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:43,686
I mean, the pain itself
is literally breathtaking.

472
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,521
- This murder was personal.
- And...

473
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,725
it takes a lot longer
than you might think.

474
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:50,657
Two minutes, maybe more.

475
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,057
Well, that doesn't track.

476
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,596
There were too many doctors
and nurses around.

477
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,697
The killer had 45 seconds max.

478
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,872
Was there any other bruising?

479
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,502
On the side of Eddie's neck,

480
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,272
it was bruised at the base of his skull.

481
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:04,876
Doesn't match any methods
of killing that I'm aware of.

482
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,410
A forearm on the back of the neck...

483
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,912
I mean, that's how
you hold a dog down, but...

484
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:11,871
Okay. So, what does this mean?

485
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,442
I don't know.

486
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,152
I need you to know.

487
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,692
We're here because of you.
This is all your fault.

488
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,262
Look, I may have started this,
but you can end it.

489
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,164
You can still stop Endicott.

490
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,489
Save our family.

491
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,307
How?

492
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:34,699
By killing him.

493
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,089
It's the only way.

494
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,732
In your heart, you know that.

495
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,478
He's not a killer.

496
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:43,971
He's a Whitly.

497
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,349
He'll know what to do.

498
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:48,309
Whitly!

499
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,810
Let's go.

500
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:52,689
I, uh...

501
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:54,157
I love you both.

502
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:57,593
And, uh, being your father has
been the best part of my life.

503
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:59,662
You-you have been the best part...

504
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:01,405
Stop.

505
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,933
I don't want to hear any last words.

506
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:07,770
You are The Surgeon. You are
the smartest one in here.

507
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:09,428
Start acting like it.

508
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,069
Gil.

509
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,004
They're gonna file charges tonight.

510
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,940
First-degree murder.

511
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,199
I can't go to jail. I have to solve this.

512
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:51,013
That's why you got to run.

513
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,916
Take cash, get out of town.

514
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,668
Wait for my word.

515
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:01,824
Okay.

516
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,717
Thank you.

517
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,663
Gil. I'm worried about my mother.

518
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,098
Endicott invited her over.

519
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,501
Said he had a way to help me. I'm...

520
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:15,717
I'm afraid she'll go, try to
make a deal, double-cross him.

521
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:17,774
- Either way.
- Go.

522
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,483
Leave her to me.

523
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:32,488
<i>What were you dreaming about?</i>

524
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,190
<i>You. Always you.</i>

525
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:35,833
<i>Always you.</i>

526
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,461
<i>Hey.</i>

527
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:41,697
<i>I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry.</i>

528
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:43,833
<i>To leave you and end things this way.</i>

529
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,501
<i>But I have to do this on my own.</i>

530
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,538
<i>Please don't come after me, okay?</i>

531
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:50,306
<i>Take care of yourself, Malcolm.</i>

532
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,631
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

533
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,903
<i>Hey.</i>

534
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:05,154
<i>I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry.</i>

535
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,957
<i>- To leave you and end things this way.</i>
- Those are different dogs.

536
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,392
<i>But I have to do this on my own.</i>

537
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,794
- And a bird?
<i>- Please don't come after me, okay?</i>

538
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:13,680
<i>Take care of yourself, Malcolm.</i>

539
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:15,855
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

540
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:21,204
Dani. I need a favor.

541
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:24,463
Can you track the location
of a phone call Eve made?

542
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,734
<i>Nicholas.</i>

543
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,970
How exactly can you help my son?

544
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:32,949
You've probably gathered by now

545
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,751
that I'm a man who gets things done.

546
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,822
My point, Jessica, is you can
be afraid of what you know,

547
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:42,581
or you can use it to your advantage.

548
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:49,098
I have more money than I could
ever spend in three lifetimes.

549
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:52,368
Money. I'm talking about influence.

550
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:54,370
Real power.

551
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,740
Picture this: your son,
free of these murder charges;

552
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,876
your ex-husband,
thrown to the wolves in Rikers.

553
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,018
That part, I admit,
I got a little head start on.

554
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,314
I couldn't resist.

555
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:07,149
He's not gonna last another night.

556
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:10,127
Consider that the first of many gifts.

557
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,690
Why are you doing this?

558
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:16,659
Jessica, can't you see?

559
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:19,561
I-I'm head over heels for you.

560
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,275
<i>Bright, I got the address.</i>

561
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,491
<i>- What are you thinking?
- Nothing good.</i>

562
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,479
Are you the vet?

563
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,704
I am. Give me a sec.

564
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,059
Can I help you with something?

565
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:26,086
Yeah. I, uh...

566
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:29,143
I have a parakeet named Sunshine.

567
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,647
She's been feeling a little
under the weather lately.

568
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,682
With a name like Sunshine?

569
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:36,717
Well, that's not right.

570
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,909
Let's schedule an appointment.

571
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:49,145
Apologies. I'll just be a moment.

572
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,996
Don't finish the whole bottle without me.

573
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:12,065
So, Lieutenant Arroyo,

574
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,994
to what do I owe the pleasure?

575
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:15,723
Sorry to interrupt,
I just need to ask Jessica Whitly

576
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,558
a couple questions.

577
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:21,500
I appreciate that, but spending
quality time with Jessica

578
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:23,604
is simply too valuable to give up.

579
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:24,665
You understand.

580
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:29,091
Perhaps you can speak to her
after our date, in the morning.

581
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:35,155
I'm taking Jessica home.

582
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,443
And I'm coming for your company,

583
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:42,037
your reputation and your freedom.

584
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:44,884
You got it bad for her, huh?

585
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,484
You're love blind.

586
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,777
- Do you want me to pull my gun?
- No need.

587
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,756
No need.

588
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:10,076
Aaron once told me

589
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,924
that a stab to the gut's
the most painful way to die.

590
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:16,124
He'll make sure you take
your time leaving us.

591
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:32,921
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

592
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,104
A thousand apologies.

593
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:39,511
Where were we?

594
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,998
- Did you think about my offer?
- I did.

595
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,387
And?

596
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:36,885
Come on. Get up.

597
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:58,006
You got your degree.

598
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,579
Kind of can't be a vet without one.

599
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,513
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

600
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:06,682
Malcolm.

601
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:11,854
Malcolm Whitly.

602
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:25,033
Your name tag says "Dr. Sarah."

603
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,037
But that's not right, is it?

604
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,175
You're Sophie Sanders.

605
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,989
The girl in the box.

606
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,257
And you're the boy in the basement.

607
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,710
How did you find me?

608
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,269
I came looking for a killer.

609
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,067
A hit man named Eddie was murdered.

610
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:04,446
The method was personal, vengeful.

611
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,618
That's why I'm the primary suspect.

612
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:11,955
Eddie killed my girlfriend...

613
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:16,617
Eve.

614
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,380
But I didn't do it.

615
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,047
And there's only one other person

616
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:26,468
who loved Eve enough to have
exacted that kind of revenge.

617
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:29,971
Her sister.

618
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,142
You.

619
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,347
Four days.

620
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,762
We had four days together,

621
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,072
and then...

622
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,856
she was gone.

623
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,262
I couldn't just let it...

624
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,309
I had to find him.

625
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,534
- I had to...
- Kill him.

626
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:02,449
I know the feeling.

627
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:07,033
I know what you must think of me.

628
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,222
That I'm broken.

629
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,014
That your father ruined me.

630
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,105
I'm...

631
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:24,611
I'm sorry for everything
my father did to you.

632
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:31,159
For a long time...

633
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,912
you were all I could think about.

634
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,831
If you were real.

635
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:38,584
If you were alive.

636
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,208
If you were okay.

637
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,338
And how I'm sorry that...

638
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:46,414
I couldn't save you.

639
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,057
You were only a kid.

640
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,346
I understand why you killed Eddie.

641
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,815
But if I don't find the real person

642
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,575
that killed him...

643
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:16,210
I could go to prison
for the rest of my life.

644
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,757
Which is why it's such a shame
I couldn't find you.

645
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,914
Came all this way.

646
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:37,892
All the clues got me here.

647
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:43,356
But I guess they were wrong.

648
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,296
Not every case gets solved.

649
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,446
Hey.

650
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:32,854
Don't pick up my bad habit.

651
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,651
Gil's gonna make it.

652
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,464
I'm sorry for doubting you.

653
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,288
I doubt myself all the time.

654
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:58,690
We're gonna get you out of this, Bright.

655
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,317
Warrants came through for Endicott.

656
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,458
We're gonna nail him and clear your name.

657
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:08,734
I want to be the one
kicking down his door.

658
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:10,058
And I'll testify.

659
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:17,542
I'll get us some coffee.

660
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,578
We could be here a while.

661
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:36,584
All right,
straight line, gentlemen.

662
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:51,365
Let's move.

663
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,886
No hard feelings, Doc. It's payday.

664
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,888
That itch.

665
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:04,156
I thought at first that you were, uh,

666
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,182
just trying to scare me,
but it's involuntary, isn't it?

667
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,829
Your scratching is-is a sort of reflex,

668
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,961
um, but it offers no relief,

669
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:14,883
which points to a neuropathic itch...

670
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,419
which, uh, suggests

671
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,338
a-a an abnormality
in your nervous system.

672
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,697
You got a lesion on your brain, Oso.

673
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,976
Perhaps even a tumor.

674
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,950
You lying. Yeah,
you trying to save your ass.

675
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:30,103
Who else would you trust here?

676
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:31,917
I mean, the doctor in this facility...

677
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:34,019
he's no better than the executioner.

678
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,988
I, on the other hand...

679
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,223
They won't let you treat me.

680
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,059
Oh, I-I advise physicians
all over the world.

681
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,360
Yeah, uh, including several

682
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,986
exceptional neurosurgeons.

683
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,441
I-I would suggest

684
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:51,169
that a consult from one of them

685
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:53,281
is worth far more

686
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,517
than the bounty on my head.

687
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,608
Hmm?

688
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:04,659
Malcolm. Come in.

689
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,327
Sit down.

690
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,487
Now that we're all here,
our family meeting can begin.

691
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:26,913
Let's move.

692
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:38,754
Look away.

693
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:39,855
He's with me.

694
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,546
Nah, he's got to die.

695
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:44,693
Lock it down!

696
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:46,362
We need help in here!

697
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:48,263
- Uh-oh...
<i>- All guards,</i>

698
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:51,556
<i>- report to cellblock A immediately.</i>
- Here we go.

699
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,036
Did he hurt you?

700
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,295
Not a hair on her head.

701
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,736
What the hell are you doing here?

702
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,917
Sit. All will be explained
over a nightcap.

703
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,387
No doubt you could use one

704
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:13,042
after the day you've had.

705
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:17,192
Whatever you think you're doing here...

706
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:19,132
It's okay, Ainsley.

707
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:22,554
He doesn't know
how thoroughly screwed he is.

708
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,501
As we speak,

709
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,436
Major Crimes is getting a warrant

710
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,505
to search your house,

711
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:30,873
your office

712
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:32,574
and the three secret offices

713
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:34,230
you think we don't know about.

714
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:36,378
So please,

715
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:38,151
enjoy the Scotch.

716
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,272
It'll be your last.

717
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:44,491
I'm afraid those warrants
won't amount to much.

718
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:50,955
You had Gil stabbed.

719
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,031
You mean my assistant Aaron.

720
00:39:56,818 --> 00:40:00,592
One rotten apple in an
otherwise clean organization.

721
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,305
And he must have known

722
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:06,241
that his misdeeds
were gonna catch up to him,

723
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:08,444
because he took his own life

724
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,135
just a few hours ago.

725
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:21,457
You can't just keep silencing people.

726
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,459
Oh, I think you'll find I can.

727
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:25,817
Actually, it's what I do best.

728
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:31,333
You know, you should
really have that tremor

729
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:33,135
- checked out. Have you ever...
- Shut up!

730
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,660
Stop! Just stop!

731
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,727
You killed Eve.

732
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:46,048
Framed me for murdering her killer.

733
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:47,672
You may...

734
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:51,349
You may have killed Gil Arroyo.

735
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:56,521
Now you deserve to die, Nicholas.

736
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:01,971
My son.

737
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,564
I will always love you.
Because we're the same.

738
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:07,636
You know,

739
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,529
you really are
your mother's son, Malcolm.

740
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,929
All smoke.

741
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:14,664
No fire.

742
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,213
She couldn't go all the way, either,

743
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,315
which is a shame.

744
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,274
She's brilliant in the sack.

745
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:26,989
We'll find the evidence, the witnesses

746
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:29,358
and I will arrest you!

747
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:30,659
No, you won't.

748
00:41:30,683 --> 00:41:33,007
The whole system is mine. I own it.

749
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,696
I can do anything I want.

750
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,054
Aah!

751
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:05,550
What did you do?

752
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:31,453
Wha...

753
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:32,911
What...

754
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,663
What just happened?

755
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,618
It's okay, Ainsley. It's...

756
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,003
Hello?

757
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:49,338
My boy!

758
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:50,639
It's Dad.

759
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:52,174
How's it going?

760
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:53,942
Not great.

761
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:55,978
<i>Well, don't worry about me.</i>

762
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:57,679
Things are looking up.

763
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,038
I took Ainsley's advice.

764
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,188
And she took yours.

765
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:07,735
Really?

766
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,818
My girl.

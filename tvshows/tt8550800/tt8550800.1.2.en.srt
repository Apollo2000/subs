1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,006
<i>We've got a slew of witnesses.</i>

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,884
<i>Prints. DNA.</i>

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,221
<i>Did you kill my son?!</i>

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,514
<i>Is that not Terry Maitland...</i>

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,227
on the same day 70 miles away?

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,187
Poof.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,149
<i>Terry Maitland's prints</i>
<i>from the Sheraton prints,</i>

8
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,151
from the crime scene...
They all match.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,153
He can't have been
in two places at once.

10
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>We've got a video tape</i>
<i>and witnesses.</i>

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,115
What we've got beats
what they've got.

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:36,286
If Terry Maitland is innocent,
we're not done.

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,748
Jessa...

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,625
No!

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,337
He was here.
He was saying bad things to me.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>It's like he's begging us</i>
<i>to catch him.</i>

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,508
What kind of criminal does that?

18
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,095
Do you think Terry Maitland
killed that boy?

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,099
<i>I really don't know.</i>

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,547
Kinda late for a visit.

21
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,258
It's not a social call.

22
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,675
Can we lose the cuffs?

23
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,717
Against protocol.

24
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,219
I'll take
responsibility for him.

25
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,679
No, sir, you won't.

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,567
Howie Saloman...

27
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,069
would probably
fire me as a client

28
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,570
if he knew I was talking to you.

29
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,741
Well, it's the same on my end.

30
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,287
You have any idea what
the D. A. would do to me?

31
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,250
Tell me why you're here.

32
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,586
Um...

33
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,885
The van with the New York plates
is still...

34
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,095
troubling me.

35
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,559
The van I've
never seen before in my life?

36
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,395
The last time I was in New York
was 16 years ago,

37
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,771
for my honeymoon.

38
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,984
I didn't know that.

39
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,739
I mean, I knew you hadn't been
there recently.

40
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,452
We, of course,
back checked your movements

41
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,911
over the last six months.

42
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,290
Couldn't find anything
but a...

43
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,959
family vacation

44
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,919
to, Dayton.

45
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,881
And we flew
both directions for that,

46
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,174
as I'm sure you know.

47
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm as baffled...

48
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,478
by this conflicting evidence
as you are.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,898
Um...

50
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,608
Hey, will you tell me
why you're here?

51
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,069
That...

52
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,530
TV footage...

53
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,868
puts you at the
teachers' conference in Cap City

54
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,037
at the same time as
Frankie Peterson's murder

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,455
sixty miles away.

56
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,583
But I have
credible witnesses...

57
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,294
credible witnesses who saw you

58
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,922
walking around covered in
Frankie Peterson's blood.

59
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,840
Your prints are
all over the van,

60
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,342
the crime scene,

61
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,302
the boy.

62
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,767
Want me to explain
all that to you?

63
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,768
- No.
- Good.

64
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,394
- Because you can't?
- Right.

65
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,146
Right? And no one can.

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,571
On March 30th, 2019,
did you have any physical...

67
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,867
or verbal contact
with Frankie Peterson?

68
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,580
Nope.

69
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,464
On March 30th, 2019,
did you abduct Frankie Peterson?

70
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,632
No.

71
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,219
On March 30th, 2019,
did you murder Frankie Peterson?

72
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,932
I didn't kill that kid, Ralph.

73
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,732
That it?

74
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,360
For tonight, yeah.

75
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,987
- Okay.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,698
You know, Ralph,
when you arrested me...

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,242
in front of all those people...

78
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,578
at that game...

79
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,873
you asked me if I'd
ever touched your son, Derek.

80
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,083
Do you remember that?

81
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,297
Be very careful about
what you say to me next.

82
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,058
In all the years I've been
coaching Little League...

83
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,477
your son, Derek,
was the best drag bunter...

84
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
I ever had.

85
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,106
And he was just a little guy,

86
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,817
you know, he was very small,
smallest kid on the team,

87
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,652
but he had a lot of guts,

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,070
he was never afraid to
crowd the plate,

89
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,740
even if there was some great,
big eighth-grader throwing heat.

90
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,411
In most kids that short
you just count on 'em for walks.

91
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,580
That's all you can expect,
but he wasn't havin' that,

92
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,124
he just kept swinging,
and striking out,

93
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,251
and the kids
even started calling him...

94
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,337
the "Whiffer."

95
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,297
Secretly,
they called him Whiffer.

96
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,091
I asked them to stop,
but they're 12 and 11...

97
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,969
Only time he got on base was
when he got hit by a pitch, so,

98
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,763
tough to blame 'em.

99
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,723
But when I saw that
he wasn't gonna quit,

100
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,935
that he was gonna just
keep swingin' and striking out,

101
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,270
I taught him how to bunt,

102
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,274
and not a lot of kids
like to do that.

103
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,485
They're afraid they'd drop that
bat over the plate,

104
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,737
fast ball comes in,
they get their fingers smashed,

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,405
but not him.

106
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,532
He never flinched,
not once.

107
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,909
And he flew down
that first base line,

108
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,036
and you remember how many
bunt singles he got?

109
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,496
A lot more than I expected.

110
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
But those kids stopped
calling him Whiffer,

111
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,167
and they started
calling him "Push It."

112
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,837
Right? He'd come up to the plate

113
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,965
runners on the corners,
they'd start saying,

114
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,050
"Push it, Derek, push it."

115
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,136
So he had a new handle that year
when we almost won district.

116
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,766
You must have noticed
a difference in him, right?

117
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,226
Did you notice that that summer?

118
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,560
How confident he was?

119
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,107
How proud he was?

120
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,359
He was a--
He was a big little guy.

121
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,237
And, um, you know,
I don't want--

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,447
I don't want you
to get the wrong impression;

123
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,408
he practiced, a lot,

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,368
but I taught him that.

125
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,745
I taught him how to bunt.

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,834
So, when you asked me if I ever
touched your kid...

127
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,553
I really hope I did.

128
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,318
<i>Personally, I'm partial</i>

129
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,903
<i>to the Presidential;</i>

130
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,573
solid mahogany with
a high gloss finish,

131
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,243
or anything with
the velvet interior,

132
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,121
and the classic French Fold
design

133
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,956
with a hinged spilt couch,

134
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,083
and the adjustable
eternal rest bed.

135
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,753
And since you
will be ordering two

136
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,464
I'd be willing to offer you
a 20 percent discount

137
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,757
on the embalming.

138
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,351
<i>In my 18 years</i>

<i>here at Cherokee City, Bill,</i>

140
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,522
we've never had a case
as high profile as this one.

141
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,817
We have all the reporters,
all of the law enforcement here,

142
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,360

but others are here to offer
their support.

149
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,878

of that bombshell footage

153
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,348
D.A. Hayes,
do you worry your focus

154
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,766
is so narrow on Terry Maitland

155
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,228
that you could be letting other
potential suspects pass by?

156
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,562
No, absolutely not.

157
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,314
I have no doubt in my mind that
the man we have in custody

158
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,525
is the man who murdered
Frankie Peterson

159
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,984
on the afternoon of
March the 30th.

160
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,237
And on a personal note,
are the rumors true?

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,323
Could we actually see your name
on the ballot next March?

162
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,866
<i>All I care about today</i>

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>is securing justice for the kid</i>
<i>who was brutally killed</i>

164
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,870
<i>while walking home</i>
<i>in a neighborhood</i>

165
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,914
<i>we allowed him to think</i>
<i>was safe.</i>

166
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,649
Okay, we're good.

167
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,704
Okay.

168
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,045
Killer!

169
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,511
Die, asshole!

170
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,263
Disgusting!
You degenerate!

171
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,440
Terry.

172
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,026
Terry, Terry.

173
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,403
Terry, let me see.
Let me see, let me see.

174
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,115
Jesus. 911!

175
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,284
- No! 911!
- Terry. Hey, Terry.

176
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,296
Call 911!

177
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,716
Hey.

178
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,511
Hey, breathe with me.

179
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,221
- Hey. Let me take a look.
- Breathe with me.

180
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,847
Let me take a look,
let me take a look.

181
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,057
Let me take a look. No...

182
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,767
- God.
- Okay, come here.

183
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,268
Put your hand there.
Just keep it there.

184
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,645
Right there, right there.

185
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,563
Look at me, Terry. Terry.

186
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,691
I didn't do it.

187
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,486
I wasn't there.

188
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,821
It wasn't me.

189
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,864
It wasn't me.

190
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,202
Jus-- Just, Terry,
keep looking at me.

191
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,829
- Keep looking at me.
- Terry.

192
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,747
Ralph, we have a doctor here.

193
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,499
Hey, Terry,
stay with me, please.

194
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,001
- It's okay.
- Hey, I'm a doctor.

195
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,252
I'm here to help, okay?

196
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,795
We're gonna help you,
buddy. Stay with us.

197
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,006
Stay with us, buddy.

198
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,466
Got the bleeding under
control. Did someone call 911?

199
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,801
Yes.

200
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,931
Can you tell me
your name, buddy?

201
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,182
- What's his name?
- It's Terry.

202
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,435
Terry. Come on, Terry,
stay with us, okay?

203
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
- I need you to breathe.
- Terry.

204
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,604
Terry,
can you talk to me?

205
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,605
Terry.

206
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,815
Come on, Terry,
stay with us.

207
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,983
We have more help coming
on the way.

208
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,568
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

209
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,529
Come on, Terry,
stay with us.

210
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,601
Hello, sir.

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,603
Any complaints?

212
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,229
Um...

213
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,524
I killed a boy.

214
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,402
Um...

215
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,695
I meant your body.

216
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,280
Does anything hurt?

217
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,282
No, it's just...

218
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,284
tight all over.

219
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,121
Any medical history
I should know about?

220
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,876
Um, no, no.

221
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,965
You on any medications?

222
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,512
Lipitor...

223
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,763
for cholesterol.

224
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,725
Are there any other drugs
in your system right now?

225
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,102
No, sir.

226
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,149
Okay.

227
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,655
Well, I'm a little concerned
about your elevated BP so...

228
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,492
what I'd like to do right now

229
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,994
is to pull this curtain here,
and turn off the lights.

230
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,872
Just lay back, close your eyes,

231
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,541
and concentrate
on your breathing.

232
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,001
Let's see if we can get it down
on its own, okay?

233
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,589
Yeah.

234
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,386
I'm sorry
for your loss, Mrs. Maitland.

235
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,305
I just need you to answer
a few questions

236
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,516
while things are still fresh
in your mind.

237
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,892
Would that be all right
with you?

238
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,813
Yes.

239
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,500
Mother fuck!

240
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,718
Son of a bitch!

241
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,044
Hi, Mrs. Anderson.

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,431
Evening, Lieutenant.

243
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,100
Hey.

244
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,769
How you holding up?

245
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,439
You're on administrative leave?

246
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,570
Yep, two weeks.

247
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,823
They've ordered me to
see a, trauma therapist.

248
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,659
You should.

249
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,204
When do I get my gun back?

250
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,123
Let's see what the therapist
says first.

251
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,004
How's Tamika doing?

252
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,172
She's laid up.

253
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,634
Cherokee Springs Medical Center,
with a shattered tibia.

254
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,636
She's mostly worried
about the baby.

255
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,556
She should never have been at
the courthouse,

256
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,807
I don't know why I...

257
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,228
That's my call.

258
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,981
Um, I don't know why I didn't
keep her back, I...

259
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,777
Just like I don't know
why I thought that

260
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,448
arresting Terry Maitland
in front of a full stadium crowd

261
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,616
was the way to go.

262
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,494
You had your reasons.

263
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,260
Just so you know,

264
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,512
we found out who stole that
Econoline van in New York.

265
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,183
Interested?

266
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,899
Chattanooga PD picked up some
kid sleeping in a Chrysler,

267
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,151
in a Walmart lot.

268
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,944
Turns out he's been on the road
for months

269
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,489
boosting cars,
and ditching them for others.

270
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,116
The Chevy van was the first
though.

271
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,036
Drove it from New York to Ohio,
ditched it for the Mini Cooper,

272
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,205
then swapped that out for
the Chrysler.

273
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,217
The Maitlands went on
a family vacation to Ohio.

274
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,390
This kid know when...

275
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,228
and where he switched the van
and the Mini Cooper?

276
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,899
All he knows is that it was
a shopping mall,

277
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,859
and that the Mini Cooper was

278
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,903
light yellow
with a black racing stripe.

279
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,913
You okay?

280
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,254
How many weeks
vacation do you get?

281
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,299
What?

282
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,968
You know how many weeks I get?

283
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,971
1.426.

284
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,224
Ten lousy days...

285
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,060
they have the balls to call me
back in on day seven.

286
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,146
Believe that dog shit?

287
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,273
What am I,
your fucking job counselor?

288
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,615
What happened?

289
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,828
You wanna throw any more
of that beer on my face

290
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,663
I will knock--

291
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,915
What happened there?

292
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,043
What happened there?

293
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,338
Get off! Son of a bitch!

294
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,134
Got him!

295
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,303
Come on, Jack,
it's time to go home.

296
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,387
Night night!

297
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,055
- Put him in a cab.
- Good night!

298
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,098
Put him in a cab?

299
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,309
C-- Call the fucking police
on that asshole.

300
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,437
Fucking police!
Fix your balls, dude!

301
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,564
- You all right?
- Sierra, get him a beer.

302
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,957
<i>- I hate you!</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

303
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,253
<i>- No! No, you be gone!</i>
<i>- Mommy! Mommy, hurry!</i>

304
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,339
- Mom, Mom, hurry! Mom!
- I'm coming!

305
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,966
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you!
I'm coming!

306
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,802
- No, you be gone!
- Mom, she's scaring me!

307
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:43,928
Hey, what's going on?

308
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,221
- Hey, what are you doing--
- He said he's happy

309
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,597
- Daddy's gone.
- What are you doing in there?

310
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,099
- Who is?
- The man!

311
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,267
What's wrong with her?

312
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,393
Nothing, she just had
a bad dream.

313
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,771
It's okay. Hey, come on.
No one's here.

314
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,773
Come here, come here,
come here. No one's here.

315
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,568
He left, he left.

316
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,278
No, no, no.
No one's here, it's okay.

317
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,404
It's just a bad dream.

318
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,447
- Mom.
- Yes.

319
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,782
Mom, what's wrong with her?

320
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,158
Nothing. She had a bad dream.

321
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,369
Yeah.

322
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Lie down.

323
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,876
Okay?

324
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,461
- Mommy, I'm fine.
- It's okay.

325
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,671
It's all right.

326
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,894
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

327
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,355
Your cigarette did.

328
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,318
Do you remember how long
it is since I had one, or both?

329
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,237
Five years.

330
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,199
Jesus, Ralph!

331
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,160
Tastes like petrified wood.

332
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,620
Yeah, they're aged.

333
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,295
It was
a blue scrap of paper.

334
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,380
What was?

335
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,844
The thing that I couldn't
dredge up, you know?

336
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,472
When Yune was talking about the,
um, the van the other night.

337
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,349
It was under
the windshield wiper.

338
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,518
It was, um...

339
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,439
Had a small, like, animal's
head on it, I think, and...

340
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,025
maybe some words.

341
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,862
G--
I saw the techs bag it up,

342
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,781
I'd meant to
examine it myself, but...

343
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,992
everything got a little too
exciting around here,

344
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,369
but I will go in tomorrow,
I will check it out.

345
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,662
For what it's worth.

346
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,709
Ralph, you're on leave.

347
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,921
You're supposed to start seeing
the therapist before anything.

348
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,299
Come back to bed.

349
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,011
I'm done sleeping
for tonight.

350
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,140
Just come lie next to me.

351
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,267
Come on.

352
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,388
My God!

353
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,015
My God!

354
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,516
Help!

355
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,393
Help!

356
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,521
Somebody help!

357
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,061
Ralph,
you're not supposed to be here.

358
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,023
- Yeah, I'm not.
- Okay.

359
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,066
I need the keys to
the evidence room.

360
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,571
Not sure where they are.

361
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,235
Welcome back.

362
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,946
Hey, Jack,
I thought you were on vacation.

363
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,864
I was
until y'all fucked the pooch

364
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,658
at the courthouse yesterday.

365
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,618
Between Tamika taking a bullet,

366
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,328
and you shooting that kid,

367
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,082
I'm the only dick left
on the squad, so yeah,

368
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,583
here I am...

369
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,336
...ripped untimely from
the forest primeval.

370
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,671
Appreciate ya.

371
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,839
Squad...

372
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,841
Did you get to kill
anything at least?

373
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,009
Me?

374
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,761
I have a snappy retort to that,

375
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,680
but I don't think
you wanna hear it.

376
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,266
You're wrong.

377
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,768
I'd love to hear
your snappy retort.

378
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:28,021
Hey, Ralph, D. A.'s office is on
the line, are ya here?

379
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,664
At least
one of us came out a hero.

380
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,542
You bring me in here
to tell me that?

381
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,711
No.

382
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,463
I've called you in here

383
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,424
to tell you I've decided
not to run for re-election.

384
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,843
Yesterday...

385
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,055
cut the heart out of the job
for me, and I need to move on.

386
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,892
Okay.

387
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,899
But that being said...

388
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,985
lab...

389
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,406
finally crashed the saliva
sample from the bite marks.

390
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,658
It is a dead-on match

391
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,535
for the swabs we took from
Terry Maitland.

392
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,706
You said it yourself.

393
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,709
DNA's only gonna take it so far
with the jury.

394
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,296
Besides, what difference does it
make now?

395
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,340
Well, it's still important.

396
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,424
How?

397
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,345
'Cause when Glory Maitland drops
a civil suit on this office,

398
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,639
the Sheriff's Department,
and the Cherokee City PD

399
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,973
for negligence, and...

400
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,643
with Howie Saloman as her
attorney she definitely will...

401
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,103
this DNA match can help

402
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,023
keep her monetary reward from
going through the roof.

403
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,484
She might deserve every penny.

404
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,153
Ralph...

405
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,906
even if Howie Saloman...

406
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,450
would have handed me
my ass in court.

407
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,327
that doesn't change the fact

408
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,120
that we were prosecuting
the right guy.

409
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,206
You know, I thought he was
guilty from the door on in,

410
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,874
and so did you,
don't ever forget that.

411
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,835
There's very little
chance of that happening.

412
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,884
"There are more things
in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,

413
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,970
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy."

414
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,101
In World War II...

415
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,396
a US fighter squadron

416
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,815
flew into a cloud cluster
over France

417
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,233
on a clear day,

418
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,110
and never came out
the other side.

419
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,988
What happened to 'em?
Who the fuck knows?

420
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,991
1587, Roanoke Colony,

421
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,660
North Carolina, close to
200 people living there

422
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,037
when the governor sailed back
to England to get more supplies,

423
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,665
and when he returned
they vanished,

424
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,626
not a soul, and no clue
as to what happened.

425
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,169
I mean, here we are
four centuries later,

426
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,422
we still can't figure it out.

427
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,174
So it is with Terry Maitland.

428
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,635
Is there a mystery here?

429
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,970
Yes.

430
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,264
Will there always be
unanswered questions?

431
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
Most likely.

432
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,101
Sometimes that happens,

433
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,602
and when it does,

434
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,521
you just need to learn
how to live with it,

435
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,023
and move on.

436
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,359
Yeah, that's hard for me.

437
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,000
Tell me the first thing
comes into your head.

438
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,504
Um...

439
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,591
What is it?
A corner of some flyer?

440
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,509
Correct.

441
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,928
The one of that van
I was telling you about.

442
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,724
Guy gets in, sees the flyer,
gets pissed,

443
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,393
tears it off instead of lifting
up the windshield wiper,

444
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,603
leaves that behind.

445
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,067
What is the flyer for?

446
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,902
A Pig, and "Big D."

447
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,112
Well, it's not a beauty parlor,
that's for sure.

448
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,157
Butcher shop maybe?

449
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,366
Deli, restaurant?

450
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,744
Shall we try the Google machine?

451
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,247
Yeah,
look between New York and Ohio.

452
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,333
New York... Ohio...

453
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,003
Got a Big Dwayne's
Auto Repair, Albany,

454
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,464
Big Duke's Fireworks,
Pennsylvania,

455
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,674
Big Dee's Sporting Goods,

456
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,968
that's a little on
the obvious side,

457
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,553
in Steubenville, Ohio.

458
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,931
- Um...
- Stay in Ohio.

459
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,975
Ohio...

460
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,186
All right, you've got...

461
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,897
Big Duff's Plumbing in Akron.

462
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,982
Hold on.

463
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,278
Got a Big Daddy's Hangry-Q,
in Dayton.

464
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,614
- Dayton?
- That's it, look.

465
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,283
Look.

466
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,499
Dayton...

467
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,587
Yup.

468
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:39,875
Jessa.

469
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,009
Were you dreaming about
that man again?

470
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,494
Do you want any water?

471
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,996
I'm good, thank you.

472
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,290
If you need me,
I'm right there, okay?

473
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,666
- Okay.
- Okay.

474
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,962
I don't know, he's not latching
like he did yesterday.

475
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,797
Hey, baby-maker.

476
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,133
Okay, um, I'm sorry.

477
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,594
It's just a titty, Ralph,
I know you've seen a few before.

478
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,887
Aw, T,

479
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,472
even now you have to be
so crude and rude?

480
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,973
- Ma. That's me.
- Hey, Jack.

481
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,059
You did it!

482
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,727
- Thank you.
- So wonderful.

483
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,272
Wow, she's beautiful.

484
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,775
Well, actually, it's not a she.

485
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,443
Jerome...

486
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,613
Say hello to Mr. Anderson.

487
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,533
He looks a little like
ol' Uncle Jack, don't he?

488
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,243
And let me tell ya,

489
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,994
you mighta heard
giving birth <i>au naturel</i>

490
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,412
is ten kinds of hell...

491
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,331
Try doing it with your damn leg
in a cast.

492
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,666
I can imagine.

493
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,917
No you can't.

494
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,548
Look at you.

495
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,841
Hey, look, I know now's
probably not the right time,

496
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,843
but did you want an update
on the case?

497
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,178
I don't need one.

498
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,305
Yunis caught me up right before
you got here.

499
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,057
I'm surprised you
didn't pass him on your way,

500
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,392
he just left.

501
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,690
<i>ICU paging Dr. Davis.</i>

502
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,942
<i>ICU paging Dr. Davis.</i>

503
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,944
Hey, Yune.

504
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,654
Hey.

505
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,118
You know this guy?
Friend of yours?

506
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,120
You do too.

507
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,289
That's Fred Peterson.

508
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,920
What happened?

509
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,755
Is he gonna make it?

510
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,761
The rope cut off the oxygen
to his brain for ten minutes

511
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,972
so it depends on how you define
"making it."

512
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,600
I've been here five minutes.

513
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,560
I've already had two nurses
ask me to sign off on

514
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,978
harvesting his organs.

515
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,771
'Cause they can't find
anybody else.

516
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,316
That family's gone.

517
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,318
- Completely gone.
- Fucking case...

518
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,490
You go see Tamika's baby?

519
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
Yeah.

520
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,204
From Alpha to Omega?

521
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,753
I just need to know
if the kid dumped the van

522
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,506
somewhere near the BBQ place,
and if so, exactly when.

523
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,633
Ralph, you're on admin leave;

524
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,092
I want you to take advantage
of that,

525
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,594
and take some time for yourself.

526
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,387
What am I-- I--
t-- to recuperate?

527
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,930
Come on, I'm just going to be
sitting around

528
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,600
thinking about this evidence,
and how it doesn't add up, and--

529
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,644
- You go see that shrink yet?
- No, I haven't.

530
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,355
Look,
the Maitlands were in Dayton

531
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,024
from March 3rd to March 7th.

532
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:55,612
Now, if our guy dropped that van
at any time during those days,

533
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,616
and if they even came close
to crossing paths,

534
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,077
we would wanna know about that,
right?

535
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,706
Is the kid still
locked up in Chattanooga?

536
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,333
He's not locked up.

537
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,335
Cop who made the collar
took a liking to him,

538
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,295
put him in foster care.

539
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,005
Kid running from a violent home;

540
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,256
nobody wants
to see him get hurt.

541
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,008
- I wanna talk to him.
- Why?

542
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,968
He already said he doesn't
remember where he was.

543
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,303
Okay, great.

544
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,098
So now can-- can you just reach
out to somebody up there please,

545
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,516
and make it happen?

546
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,977
I'll make a deal with you,
Ralph.

547
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,896
You do something for me...

548
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,607
and I'll drive you
up there myself.

549
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,238
Have you
been to a therapist before,

550
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,531
Detective Anderson?

551
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,324
Um...

552
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,827
We saw a grief counselor
in Atlanta...

553
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,745
after my son died.

554
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,415
Sorry to hear that.

555
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,083
How old was he?

556
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,793
I'm not here to talk about him.

557
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,172
Was he helpful?

558
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,340
She.

559
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,591
Was she helpful?

560
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,593
Well, I'm still grieving, so...

561
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,806
She was okay, it was okay.

562
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,395
How are you feeling today?

563
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,106
How do you think I'm feeling?

564
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,115
Sorrowful, angry...

565
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,911
- Getting any sleep?
- Not much.

566
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,914
Dreams?

567
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,917
We're at dreams already?

568
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,463
Well...

569
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,630
If you ask ten therapists

570
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,466
for the best way to open
with a new patient

571
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,092
you'll get
ten different answers.

572
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,638
Yeah, I'm having some dreams.

573
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,309
Can you describe those?

574
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,061
Yeah.

575
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,481
People runnin', people shoutin',
people getting hurt,

576
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,108
people getting shot, um, but...

577
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,361
they're kinda slow motion
a little bit,

578
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,821
and the sound is
a little bit strange.

579
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,616
It's basically the same thing
that happened on the day.

580
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,159
Exactly as it was.

581
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,621
In these dreams,

582
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,332
were there any specific details
that stuck with you?

583
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,136
No.

584
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,723
Detective...

585
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,647
let me just give you
the big picture going forward.

586
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,191
It's good you came in
so soon after what happened,

587
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,944
but the potential injuries
to your psyche,

588
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,321
those can take weeks,
or months...

589
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,282
...even longer
to announce themselves so I--

590
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,700
Yeah, but doctor...

591
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,868
you know what?

592
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,788
The so called "reason" I'm here

593
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,957
is that the shooting has made me
so crazy

594
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,251
- I can't go back to work--
- Crazy's a meaningless word.

595
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
Whatever.

596
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,712
Look, I've been
a law enforcement professional

597
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,339
for over 20 years.

598
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,426
So, is it even imaginable
to you that I'm fine?

599
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,762
Do you feel fine?

600
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,264
Fuck no, I don't feel fine

601
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,933
but that's not really the--
the point.

602
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,645
Look, being here is just more
like a punishment,

603
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,105
feels more like that.

604
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,444
If you wanna walk out, Ralph,
I'm not gonna stop you.

605
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,246
It's just that when anybody says
to me,

606
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,956
"I'm here to help,"

607
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,916
things invariably get worse.

608
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,401
- Snap!
- I want all of them.

609
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,361
Why don't we just
take turns?

610
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,156
Yeah! Lego bus?

611
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,493
<i>So, first we decide on</i>
<i>the rules we play...</i>

612
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,620
I'll be right here.

613
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,497
Hey, Merlin.

614
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,666
Hey there, I'm Ralph.

615
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,085
This is Yunis.

616
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,755
We just, um,
wanted to ask you,

617
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,633
some questions about some of
these photographs we have.

618
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:27,926
Do you, um...

619
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,969
Do you recognize this?

620
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,598
It's a restaurant.

621
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,976
Yeah, that's right.
It's, it's in Dayton,

622
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,812
and, um...

623
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:40,980
...we found this...

624
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,067
in the, um, in the van

625
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,195
that you, that you drove
down from New York,

626
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,948
and so one of the things that
I'm hoping to achieve today,

627
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,742
with your help, son,
is to,

628
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:57,205
is to pin down exactly where
you might have left that van.

629
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,831
So, um...

630
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,751
W-- Would you like to sit down,
and talk to us about it?

631
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,836
I've never seen
this restaurant before.

632
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,005
Okay.

633
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,925
Why don't you take a look at
this photograph and...

634
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,593
just take your time.

635
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,844
Take your time.

636
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,683
Yeah, I was in this parking lot.

637
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,936
This baseball card store,

638
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,147
I wanted to go in but I was
too nervous to hang around.

639
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,108
You like baseball, Merlin?

640
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,275
I like the cards.

641
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,736
We're trying to make
an Astros fan out of him.

642
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,780
And when was this?

643
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,702
Three cars ago.

644
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,620
Okay, um...

645
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,665
well what-- what we're hoping
to do here is, um,

646
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,460
to maybe narrow it down
to the day, or even the week,

647
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,837
um, do you wanna sit down?

648
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
You wanna-- You sure you don't
wanna sit down and talk to us?

649
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,340
I'm okay.

650
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,552
Okay, so when you were driving
did you, um...

651
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,595
- did you listen to the radio?
- No.

652
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,724
Did you...

653
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,600
notice anything like, um,

654
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,894
a date and time display
out the front of a bank,

655
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,396
or a gas station?

656
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,608
Maybe you went into
a convenience store,

657
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,153
and saw a headline
on a newspaper,

658
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,406
or a magazine cover,
or the TV was on?

659
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,783
A TV in a 7-Eleven.

660
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,870
The lady behind the counter,
she had a little one running.

661
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,751
She had this big smudge
on her forehead.

662
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,587
I thought it was weird 'cause...

663
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,422
she was taking people's money
all day,

664
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,049
and not bothering
to clean her face.

665
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,843
Was it a smudge like this?

666
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,012
Yeah, it was kinda like an X.

667
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,599
Did you see anybody else that
day with something like that?

668
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,602
There was a guy
in the parking lot,

669
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,353
he had it too...

670
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,397
and a girl,

671
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,775
about my age,
coming out of a McDonald's...

672
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,735
Maybe it was a KFC.

673
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,578
The Ash Wednesday
fell on March 6th,

674
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,414
and the Maitlands were in Dayton

675
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,875
from March 3rd to March 7th.

676
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,293
But they flew both ways.

677
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,587
Terry was on that flight?

678
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,511
Yeah.

679
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,253
- Glory.
- No.

680
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,255
- I just-- I get it--
- No, you can't be here.

681
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,090
I need to talk to you.
Please talk to me.
No.

682
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,092
Look, I should never have
arrested Terry the way I did--

683
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,052
- Get your foot off my door.
- I did a lot of things wrong.

684
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,220
Get your fucking foot
off my door.

685
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,555
- Glory, please.
- I'm gonna get you arrested,

686
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,931
- get it off.
- You need to hear me out.

687
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,141
I need to what?

688
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,603
Back the fuck up.

689
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,272
What if he didn't do it?

690
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,523
He didn't do it!

691
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,400
He didn't do it.

692
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,235
He told you he didn't do it.

693
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,904
The last words my husband spoke
were to you, and not to me.

694
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,199
They were to you,
and he told you he didn't do it.

695
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,869
So, what else do you need?
A note from God?

696
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,580
If he didn't do it...

697
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,248
someone else did.

698
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,377
What if it happens again?

699
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,964
Are you asking me for my help?

700
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,340
Yeah

701
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,473
Maybe you can help me with
a few things.

702
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,683
Okay.

703
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,731
How am I supposed to get my kids
safely to school every day?

704
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,568
How am I supposed to
explain to them

705
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,361
why they no longer have friends?

706
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,283
Why people are screaming curses
at our windows,

707
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,619
and throwing shit
all over our porch,

708
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,078
and even if we move...

709
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,832
this whole goddamn thing

710
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,709
is tattooed on our faces.

711
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,086
What do I do with that?

712
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,384
The only way...

713
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,264
you're gonna get your life back
is by clearing Terry's name,

714
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,766
and the only way to do that

715
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,228
is to find whoever killed
Frankie Peterson.

716
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,106
Glory, to do that
I need your help.

717
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,374
You know, in Russia,
when Stalin had his goons

718
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,043
drag people from their homes

719
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,545
to be murdered
in some prison basement,

720
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,130
you know how he topped that off?

721
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,592
He would send
the dead man's family a bill

722
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,052
for the used bullet.

723
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,266
You talking to Glory Maitland
for help...

724
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,934
that's what this sounds like
to me.

725
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,104
Yeah, I can see how you would
see it that way.

726
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,941
If you think by talking to her

727
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,736
you can in any way stop me from
filing a suit against you,

728
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,697
or your department, Hayes,
or anyone else, you're wrong.

729
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,532
Don't give a damn about
any of that.

730
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,312
Hey, Glory,
thank you very much

731
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,773
for letting me into your house,
and, um, thank you for--

732
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,024
Enough.

733
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,735
You told Mrs. Maitland
you wanted to talk to her.

734
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,445
- Go.
- "Needed,"

735
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,822
is what he said. "Needed."

736
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,408
What do you need
to talk to her about?

737
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,535
Um...

738
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:36,122
There's some new information
that has come my way.

739
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,082
Now...

740
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,169
in and of itself it may be
inconsequential, but--

741
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,295
Punch line?

742
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,801
Turns out that the van that was
used to abduct the Peterson boy

743
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,304
was stolen in New York
by a 12-year-old kid.

744
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,266
This was the first of three
vehicles he stole,

745
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,227
and he wound up in Chattanooga,
which is where he was caught,

746
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,520
but, um... May I?

747
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:07,987
But he dumped that van
in Dayton on March 6th.

748
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,488
What of it?

749
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:11,490
Glory...

750
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,743
that's when you
and your family were there.

751
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,787
You're still trying to put this
on Terry?

752
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,913
No! No, no.

753
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,748
- That's not what this about--
- This is done.

754
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:20,916
Um, please,

755
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,835
just hear me out.
I-- Look, please.

756
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,212
I know that you and your family
flew both ways.

757
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,631
That's not in question,

758
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,176
and Terry himself told me
he never saw the van,

759
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,595
let alone stole it.
I wanna believe that,

760
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,097
we have his fingerprints
all over the goddamn thing,

761
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,307
but I want to.

762
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,100
What's the punch line?

763
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,852
There is none! But...

764
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,398
do you see how strange this is?

765
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,194
Dayton...

766
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,113
to Cherokee City,

767
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,616
I mean, that's not exactly
Paris to London.

768
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,326
It's as if this van just...

769
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,662
followed you home.

770
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,498
Maybe it was haunted.

771
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,125
Yeah, my mother the car.

772
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,211
Please just bear with me for
a moment here.

773
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,673
Why Dayton for
a family vacation?

774
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,383
Why not go to Orlando or--

775
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:15,679
Because Terry's father is
in Dayton, in a senior center,

776
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,431
but Terry's the only one
who sees him

777
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,518
because the man has dementia,
and tends to be violent.

778
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,810
Okay.

779
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:25,731
So, this vacation, when Terry
was off visiting his father,

780
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,274
what did you and the girls do?

781
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,318
He was only gone
a few hours a day.

782
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,238
We stayed in the hotel pool,
we went to the mall,

783
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,031
a movie.

784
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,784
When he came back,
did you ever go out to eat?

785
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,662
Once or twice.

786
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,373
You ever go to a place called
Big Daddy's Hangry BBQ?

787
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,751
Big Daddy's Hangry BBQ?

788
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,753
BBQ restaurant,
has a pig logo.

789
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,090
I'd like this to be done.

790
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,509
No, please, just one more.

791
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:58,180
Did anything out of the ordinary
happen while you were in Dayton?

792
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,392
Did one of the girls go missing
for a short while?

793
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,061
Did Terry say that he'd met up
with an old friend?

794
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,771
- Did you--
- Nothing happened!

795
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,524
Terry visited his dad,

796
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,693
we hung out, we came home,

797
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,611
we didn't eat at a restaurant
called

798
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,781
Big Daddy's Hangry BBQ,
and he didn't steal the van.

799
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,784
Goodnight.

800
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,911
<i>Daddy got a cut.</i>

801
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,255
Hey, love,
what are you doing down here?

802
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,424
Jessa was yelling at her
nightmare and woke me up.

803
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,175
You should give her Benadryl
next time.

804
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,385
Come, I'll take you up.

805
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,307
Come on, let's go.

806
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,811
Are you the man that killed
my father?

807
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,485
No, um-- No, Maya, I'm not,
but I am...

808
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,699
I made some terrible mistakes
with him and, um,

809
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,369
I'm gonna live
with those mistakes

810
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,662
for the rest of my life.

811
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,291
Let's go.

812
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,085
Hey, Maya,

813
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,087
can I just ask you,
before you go upstairs,

814
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,048
can I just ask you to tell me
about...

815
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,634
tell me about your dad's cut?

816
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,305
He got it visiting Grandpa.

817
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,851
Okay, wh--
why do you remember that?

818
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,688
Because...

819
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,024
he said he'd got it
from a nurse...

820
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,360
but the nurse was a man.

821
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,032
Yeah, yeah, sometimes nurses
can be men.

822
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,701
Did he tell you how he got it?

823
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,956
He said he was walking
in a hallway,

824
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,584
he bumped into the nurse
on a wet floor,

825
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,214
he grabbed the nurse's hand
as he fell down,

826
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,049
and when he got back up he...

827
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,052
saw he'd got a cut on his wrist.

828
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,767
Mom...

829
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,894
there was a pig restaurant...

830
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,522
in the mall, near our hotel.

831
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,776
Jessa saw the sign for it when
we were shopping there,

832
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,736
remember?

833
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,739
I don't remember.

834
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:21,865
Let's go to bed.

835
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,742
- Glory.
- Come on.

836
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,161
Hey, Glory,
do you remember this cut?

837
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,996
It was a cut,

838
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,249
he put something on it,
and that was it.

839
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,751
Goodnight!

840
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,971
<i>We gotta retrace the steps...</i>

841
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,474
<i>Find where this whole</i>
<i>horror show started.</i>

842
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,187
<i>How about sending Holly Gibney?</i>

843
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,898
<i>Can we get her on this?</i>
<i>There's nobody better.</i>

844
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,151
All these contradicting videos
and forensics.

845
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,736
<i>Sounds like there's</i>
<i>a connection.</i>

846
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,864
Do you see how strange this is?

847
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,578
<i>You need to tell me</i>
<i>what this is about, Holly.</i>

848
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,664
I'm afraid nobody's going
to believe me.

849
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,958
He didn't do it.

850
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,921
A human being cannot be
in two realities

851
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,172
<i>at the same time.</i>

852
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,551
I have no, um, tolerance,
for the unexplainable.

853
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,139
<i>If you can't get yourself</i>
<i>to really believe in this,</i>

854
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,558
you're a danger
to everyone else.

855
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,197
I think you should drop
the investigation.

856
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,366
<i>If you don't,</i>

857
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,660
<i>I feel like something very bad</i>
<i>is gonna happen.</i>

858
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,664
<i>Something bad's</i>
<i>already happened.</i>

859
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,045
<i>He's here.</i>

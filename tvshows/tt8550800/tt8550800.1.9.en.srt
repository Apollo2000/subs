1
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:33,805
You're it!

2
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:42,638
Hey, John, wait up.

3
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Boys!

4
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,347
John! George!

5
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,138
Boys!

6
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,305
Let's go.

7
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,097
Boys!

8
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,596
Who the hell is that?

9
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,138
Friend of the family.

10
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:36,472
Look. I'm not saying there's
absolutely no resemblance

11
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,138
to our guy, but...

12
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,472
You're saying
that he was with you last night?

13
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,846
From four till past midnight.

14
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,972
And why was that?

15
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:48,389
'Cause he's a witness in a...
homicide in Cherokee City.

16
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:51,097
DA asked me to come down,
get a statement,

17
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,430
and Lieutenant Sablo
rolled along,

18
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:56,472
because the staties are working
this one as well.

19
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:57,864
We just wanted
to question the man

20
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,846
in a non-threatening
environment,

21
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,472
and Mr. Bolton over there
on yonder porch

22
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:04,930
was kind enough to allow us
to use his home.

23
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:09,013
Since we're accounting for
his whereabouts, we figured...

24
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:11,763
I'm only going along with this
as a professional courtesy.

25
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,222
Sure.

26
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,347
Hey. One last question.

27
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,472
This individual
you're trying to find,

28
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,638
the perp we're looking for

29
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,138
abducted an 11-year-old boy
in Cherokee City.

30
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,763
We found him a few hours later,
tortured and murdered.

31
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,555
We talking
about the Peterson boy?

32
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:30,430
It's horrible.

33
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:34,347
O... Of course, we're not...
we're not saying that...

34
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,430
That your guy and our guy
are the same guy, but... uh...

35
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,097
you know, if we could
interview your wits...

36
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,721
you know, that could be great
for all of us.

37
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,805
Might-could arrange it.
We'll be in touch.

38
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:51,972
Okay.

39
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:54,680
- Thank you, fellas.
- Thank you. Thank you.

40
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,323
From now on, we have to edit

41
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,781
everything we say
in front of Claude,

42
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:04,222
assume that whatever Claude sees
and hears, it sees and hears.

43
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,180
And if it gets wind that we know
that it's here, well...

44
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,430
Now this thing's in town
trying to fuck my brother up.

45
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,055
You wanna keep him
out of the loop?

46
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,097
The less he knows,
the safer he is.

47
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,680
The safer we all are.

48
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,138
The world has gone insane.

49
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,721
Yeah, well,
except for me and thee,

50
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,763
and I'm not so sure about thee.

51
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:31,472
That photo, that was...
"the thing"?

52
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:33,721
I believe so.

53
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,888
- You believe so.
- Yeah, and look...

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,097
My advice to you
while you're out here,

55
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,888
you should believe so, too.

56
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,763
Let's say we find this thing,
then what?

57
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,389
Uh... Does anybody know
if it can even be killed?

58
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:12,763
Well, we... we have to assume
it can be.

59
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:13,888
Why?

60
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,638
It walks, it talks,

61
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,222
it clearly needs food
to sustain itself, so...

62
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,805
it can be killed.

63
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm with him. We just don't know
what it responds to.

64
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,347
No one said anything
about killing it.

65
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,805
We just need to contain it.

66
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:33,680
In what? Butterfly net?
Tupperware?

67
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,846
Me, I'd go with
a couple of strings of garlic

68
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,055
and a big wooden stake,
maybe a big ol' cross.

69
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:43,930
You people know anything
about stopping this thing?

70
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,222
I mean, one thing.

71
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:53,930
That's what I thought.

72
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,073
Well, what I do know is that
we need to take your brother

73
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,347
somewhere else while we can
figure this thing out.

74
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,013
Yeah. So you said.

75
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,555
What would be best if one of us
could take him somewhere else

76
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,430
while the rest of us
make some plans.

77
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:09,055
Look...

78
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:13,514
no disrespect, but we need you.
So, drop the attitude, okay?

79
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,476
- Hey.
- Morning.

80
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,264
Oh, shit.

81
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:24,972
Here, take mine.

82
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,138
- You sure?
- Yeah.

83
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,305
Thank you.

84
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,514
Hey, Claude.

85
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:34,305
Know what would do everyone
in here nicely this afternoon?

86
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,638
A little taste of heaven.

87
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,680
Hi-Way Heaven?

88
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:40,846
When was the last time
you been there?

89
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,264
I can't even remember, man.

90
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:44,930
It's on their dime, too.

91
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:48,264
Best fried chicken
for 200 miles.

92
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,721
Well then, I'll drive.

93
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,389
It's an hour there,
hour back.

94
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,430
That's with no traffic and all.

95
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,180
If I did not love to drive,
I would not have purchased

96
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:59,638
that fine piece
of machinery outside, right?

97
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,972
Get you out of the house.
Clear your head.

98
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,805
Hey, honey.

99
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,721
Hey.

100
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,013
Hey, what's going on?

101
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:15,430
Well, you know, we're...
We're... we're just...

102
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,347
we're... working on it.

103
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,972
"Working on it"?
What exactly is "it"?

104
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,430
Progress. We're making progress
on things.

105
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:24,721
Ralph.

106
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,347
You're talking in riddles.
Just tell me what's happening.

107
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,013
It's here.

108
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,805
What is?

109
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,180
Oh, Jesus!

110
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,389
Hey!

111
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:39,055
- Oh!
- Watch where you're going, lady!

112
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,180
Hang on.

113
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:49,805
What are...
What are you gonna do?

114
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:51,490
- Find it.
- You said you were just

115
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,763
gonna guard Claude Bolton,
nothing else.

116
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,365
That's what I thought, too,
but then...

117
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,229
You can't go anywhere
near this thing.

118
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,013
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

119
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:02,138
Jeannie, nobody's doing
anything but talking, so...

120
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,430
Come home.

121
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:04,680
I can't right now.

122
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,514
Jesus!

123
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,222
Do not go after it.

124
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:09,805
Please.

125
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,264
There are others to do that.

126
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,389
We're just gonna share
what we know with them,

127
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,721
then step away.

128
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,222
Love you.

129
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,763
There are no bears.

130
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:31,222
- There were in the olden days.
- How do you know?

131
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,930
'Cause I snuck in there
one night to check for them.

132
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,222
You did not.

133
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,097
If you say so.

134
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,097
I wanna go in.

135
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,264
Uh. Do you have 25 cents?

136
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,389
'Cause I don't.

137
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,763
Come on. This way.

138
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,347
Dad's gonna kill us.

139
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,930
Not if you don't tell him.

140
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,097
Cut it out.

141
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,347
It's panicked.

142
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,013
Wasn't finished transforming.

143
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,472
It wasn't ready.

144
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,430
So, why did it expose itself?

145
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,138
It's hungry.

146
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:54,888
Huh.

147
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:58,013
And now, a day later,
hungrier still.

148
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,555
Starving.

149
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:04,347
Which means it's gonna take
a run at another kid.

150
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,389
Just a matter of when.

151
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:11,721
You see how he just about
knocked that big guy on his ass?

152
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,555
I don't know. I don't eat
for a while, I get kinda weak.

153
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,180
Hopefully, the effort cost him.

154
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,430
Hopefully.

155
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,264
There's only one cemetery
within ten miles of this place.

156
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:25,013
The New Olive Baptist.

157
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:28,596
Cuco likes to hole up
near his victims' families.

158
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,180
Look, if the Boltons have people
buried there,

159
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,846
- we should check it out.
- Hm.

160
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,930
Do you have any family
buried at New Olive Baptist?

161
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,555
Do I what?

162
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:43,805
- Do you have any family buried...
- I heard you the first time.

163
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,888
No, we favor the other one.
Child of God.

164
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,180
I didn't see any second one.

165
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:52,638
Well, that's because all
the coffins,

166
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:55,097
they got flooded in the '60s.

167
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:59,055
All those dead folks,
kinda body surfin'

168
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:01,180
down the hill toward the river.

169
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:04,638
"Hey, look, there's Grandpap Joe
and he's waving at us."

170
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,888
That must have been
some sight to see.

171
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,972
Now, cups never figured out

172
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:14,013
how to wash themselves
where I'm from.

173
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,347
He's all I got.

174
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,596
Your brother?

175
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,763
That's right.

176
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,264
I hear you.

177
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,514
Well, I hope you do.

178
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,264
Hey, Ev.

179
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,222
Hey, my boys come through here
this mornin'?

180
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,222
Oh, nobody's come through here.

181
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:31,972
You're the first soul I've seen
all day.

182
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,097
Why? Are they lost?

183
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,763
Uh... They around here
somewhere.

184
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,680
I just don't...
I don't know, uh...

185
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,721
Hey, uh, I... I need to go inside
and give a look around.

186
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,389
Oh, just go on in
and grab yourself a flashlight.

187
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:46,846
All right, thanks, Ev.

188
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,930
And Emmitt, be careful.

189
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,638
People get turned around
in there all the time.

190
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,656
The grandfather
and the kid are coming in

191
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,972
to look at more mugshots.

192
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,638
They're gonna let us
talk to them.

193
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,721
There you go.

194
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
There you go.

195
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,305
Seat belts.

196
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,013
Yeah.

197
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,264
Okay.

198
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,555
Okay, I'll see you at home.

199
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:43,097
You all right?

200
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,596
We... You just got a heads up
from a Detective Schwenk

201
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,222
over in Prester County,
said that a hiker called in...

202
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,097
saying he came across the body
of a young boy

203
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,222
laying, um, in the trail.

204
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,638
Okay.

205
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,638
The boy was nude and, uh,
he was pretty torn up.

206
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:04,180
His... face was about gone
like an animal had had at it.

207
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:05,448
They're on the way
over there now

208
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,055
and wanted to know
if you wanted to come by...

209
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,097
given the...

210
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:12,888
You know.

211
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,596
No. Uh... No.

212
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:18,572
But tell them to keep me posted

213
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,805
and give them my home number
and my cell.

214
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,555
You know, when the old lady
wanted to talk to the old man

215
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:44,305
without me listening,
she'd send me on an errand.

216
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,888
Like getting chicken.

217
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,930
Cigarettes, mostly.

218
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,638
You know how fucked up
this is,

219
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,180
what we're talking about here?

220
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,347
A thing that can become
other people?

221
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,305
Oh, yeah.

222
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,472
You don't have any issue
believing that?

223
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:07,846
I'm a criminal defense lawyer.
I can believe anything.

224
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,721
Holly said this thing
knows everything

225
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,930
that comes into my head
as soon as I do,

226
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:20,305
like it's walking around
in there...

227
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,638
reading my thoughts
and seeing out of my eyes.

228
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,490
Hey, do you mind pulling over,
please?

229
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:32,514
I gotta get out.

230
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:34,430
- Yeah, hold on, hold on.
- I'm gonna be sick.

231
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,222
Fuck!

232
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,347
Ah, shit!

233
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,514
Thanks.

234
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,680
You know when you're first
coming down with a cold,

235
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,846
you ever tell yourself,
"Mind over matter.

236
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,514
I can will this out of me"?

237
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,138
- Yeah.
- It ever work?

238
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,305
No.

239
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,013
Me neither.

240
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,680
Cold, flu, virus, cancer.
It want in?

241
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,347
There's not a fucking thing
you can do about it.

242
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:31,846
Same with this thing.

243
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:35,347
It wanted in. It got in.

244
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:40,389
Fuck!

245
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,888
Herschel
and Winnifred McCallum.

246
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,430
They died three days apart.

247
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,138
Maybe it was one
of those broken heart stories.

248
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:47,305
Always liked those.

249
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:49,389
You know, one spouse dies,

250
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:50,781
and the other can't live
without them,

251
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,055
so they go a few days later.

252
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:55,430
I had an aunt and uncle
that went like that.

253
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,097
They died of influenza.

254
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,222
So, you're gonna pull
some Holly-style

255
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,514
strange genius business on me?

256
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:06,097
They called it the Spanish flu
epidemic of 1918,

257
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,721
except it started
at an army base in Kansas,

258
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,013
went out from there

259
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:12,138
and killed 50 million people
around the world.

260
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,596
Look how hard it hit this town.

261
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:19,264
Well... history be damned,
you know.

262
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:23,222
I believe they were so co-joined
at the soul, the McCallums,

263
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:26,596
that... one just decided
to follow the other

264
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,013
into whatever came next.

265
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,846
Did I say something funny?

266
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:34,305
No.

267
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,555
What are you smiling about?

268
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:38,888
Nothing.

269
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,721
Let's go.

270
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,930
When he asked me at the map
what I was looking for,

271
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,013
I said I was trying to find
the cave that had

272
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:56,846
the saber-toothed tiger
footprints.

273
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,305
Mm-hm.

274
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,138
He said he didn't know that one,
but he did know one

275
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,888
where prehistoric bears
had lived.

276
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:04,264
Mm-hm.

277
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,888
He said he'd seen
their claw marks.

278
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:10,264
And then, he said
I should see it for myself.

279
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,763
And then, we were walking.

280
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,055
Did he say anything else?

281
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,097
He was quiet after that.

282
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:28,930
Then, I heard Wanda yelling

283
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,514
and I thought she was angry
at me.

284
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,596
He has my brother! Someone!

285
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,430
Stop! Get away from him!

286
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,097
Then he pushed me away.

287
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,430
I turned around and saw Grandpa
Mike wrestling with him.

288
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:43,097
I was scared because
I didn't want him

289
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,222
to get another heart attack.

290
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,514
You know what,
you've done great, Sam.

291
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,264
Now, I just got
one last question,

292
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,805
then we're all done here, okay?

293
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,013
Did he touch you?

294
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,347
That's the first question
I asked him, he said...

295
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,638
Very important, please.

296
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,013
Sam.

297
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:00,138
Well, he shoved me.

298
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:02,389
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- That's like touching.

299
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,680
And he had his hand
on my shoulder

300
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,055
when we were walking.

301
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,347
My priority was elsewhere.

302
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,680
Did he scratch you,
maybe even just by accident?

303
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:13,930
Any scratch?

304
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,930
No.

305
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,264
Would he have hurt me?

306
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:25,097
No. No, no, no. I don't... I...
No, I don't believe so.

307
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:55,972
This makes no sense.

308
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:57,930
What doesn't?

309
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,680
Why did it run that way?

310
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,430
The caves are over there.

311
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:03,972
There's no place
to hide over here.

312
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,555
There's no light over there,
which means it's...

313
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:11,472
harder for people to give chase.

314
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,013
Hm.

315
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,726
So, that must have been
a hell of a thing

316
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,055
to confront this thing.

317
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,822
Shit, if I was 20 years younger,

318
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:52,305
I would've broken him in two.

319
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:54,680
Why'd you ask Sam
if he got scratched?

320
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:57,097
This guy have some kind
of a contagious disease

321
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,805
we need to be worried about?

322
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:02,472
It's, um... just a question
that we're required to ask

323
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,222
in, you know, cases like these.

324
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,323
Well, I'm gonna get him
checked out

325
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:07,972
- as soon as we get back.
- Can't hurt.

326
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,596
- How 'bout you?
- What, getting scratched?

327
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,514
If he did, I didn't feel it.

328
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:16,888
So, Mr. Davidson,
now that you've had some time

329
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:18,596
to sit with this,
is there anything more

330
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,430
that you could tell us
about this man?

331
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,222
Weird eyes.

332
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,888
Weird how?

333
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:37,514
Well, when I first saw him...
they seemed kinda too far back

334
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,036
in the sockets,
you know what I mean?

335
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:41,055
But he was wearing
that dumb-ass fox mask,

336
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:43,638
so I just chalked it up to that.

337
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,638
When I pulled that thing
off him...

338
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,138
he still looked like
he was staring at me

339
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,264
from under a mask.

340
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Anything useful?

341
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,305
Do you know of any bear caves
in the area?

342
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,097
And I'm born
and raised.

343
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,097
We got a Sabertooth Cave
like the boy said

344
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,638
and a Copperhead Cave.

345
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,055
We got a Red Roof and an Ahiga,

346
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,097
- but no bear cave.
- Right.

347
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:38,555
- Thanks for your time.
- Sure thing.

348
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:40,097
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

349
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:22,347
Half-dozen wings
and hush puppies.

350
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,097
Rub on medium or hot?

351
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,660
- There you are.
- All right, thank you.

352
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,323
Hey, we should be heading back,

353
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,264
this being everybody's
midday meal.

354
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:38,389
Mm-mm.

355
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,013
Midday is technically
two hours away.

356
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,930
Come on, sit down.

357
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:47,680
After all of that build up,
I'm dying for a taste right now.

358
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:49,264
All right.

359
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:53,097
You a wing man?

360
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:58,097
I am an anything man.

361
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,472
- My God.
- Right?

362
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:14,430
- This is...
- Best damn chicken in 200 miles.

363
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,888
Mm.

364
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:20,264
You don't remember me, do you?

365
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,763
Remember you? From?

366
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:26,472
Court. About eight years ago.

367
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:29,013
- Representing you?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,596
- On what charge?
- Assault and battery,

369
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,638
coming off of a bar fight.

370
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,805
- Did you win?
- In court?

371
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,305
No, in the bar fight.

372
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,472
Well, if I'd had lost,

373
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:41,305
I wouldn't have needed a lawyer,
would I?

374
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,972
How 'bout in court?

375
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,888
Ninety days in county,
mandatory AA.

376
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,389
Well, I'll tell you,
if I don't remember you,

377
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,930
consider it a compliment.

378
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:52,972
How's that?

379
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:54,888
With all
of the truly evil bastards

380
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:57,097
that I have had to stand up for
over the years,

381
00:26:57,763 --> 00:26:59,222
Claude, my man,

382
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:01,763
you just weren't bad enough
to make my hit parade.

383
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,888
Right.

384
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:13,555
John, I think we're lost.

385
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:15,680
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

386
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,638
We'll just go out the way
we came.

387
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,638
It's... It's this way.

388
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,472
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

389
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:25,680
I don't think this is it.

390
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:28,347
No, it is. It is.

391
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:39,638
Turn around. This isn't it.

392
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:56,805
John! George!

393
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:06,305
Um... We didn't come this way.

394
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,138
Boys!

395
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,888
Dad!

396
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,514
Boys?

397
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,013
- Dad!
- Can you hear me?

398
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:22,389
Dad, we're in here.

399
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,514
Daddy, help.

400
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,347
Boys!

401
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,805
John, George!

402
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,555
Dad, where are you?

403
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:32,846
Dad, can you hear us?

404
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:37,055
Dad, we're lost.

405
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:42,097
Dad, we need your help.
We're stuck.

406
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,930
- Boys!
- We're stuck, Dad.

407
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:48,430
Boys, can you hear me?

408
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:49,555
Daddy, help.

409
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,721
Dad, can you hear us?

410
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:07,430
- Dad!
- John?

411
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,430
John, can you come to the sound
of my voice?

412
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,097
Dad?

413
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,097
John?

414
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,347
You and your brother
stop movin'! Okay?

415
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,430
Stay put, I'm going for help.
Don't move.

416
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,888
Did you know about the back way
into the caves?

417
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:43,472
That itty-bitty rock split?

418
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:46,430
- Only folks who can get through there would be...
- Children.

419
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:48,222
Uh. You just asked me
if I saw them,

420
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:50,680
Emmitt, I'm so sorry,
I wasn't thinkin'!

421
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:57,031
Dara and I
can't thank y'all enough

422
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,472
coming to help us so quickly.

423
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:00,013
Our boys are lost in them caves

424
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:02,138
and we want them home with us
where they belong.

425
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:04,347
The Clark boys and a few of us
gon' go the back way,

426
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,365
the rest of y'all gon' go in
through the souvenir shop,

427
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,555
- all right now?
- Yeah.

428
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:08,721
Let's bring 'em home.

429
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,180
That's where he was last seen,

430
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,763
then he ran off toward the west.

431
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,156
If he kept heading
in that direction,

432
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,347
- he'd end up at the highway.
- No caves around there?

433
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,013
No, not one.

434
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,721
Well, the kid said it told him
about a cave

435
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:48,638
that bears used to sharpen
their claws on the rocks, but...

436
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,430
you know, no one else, you know,

437
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,305
knew what he was referring to,
so...

438
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,680
Well, that's because
they'd have to be

439
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,514
near their 90s to recall it.

440
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,514
The old bear cave...

441
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,805
has been sealed, mostly
forgotten about since 1947.

442
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:11,805
Why?

443
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:14,389
Why, indeed.

444
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:25,138
It was in that very same year,
'47, the young Weaver boys

445
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:28,222
got themselves
good and lost in there.

446
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,680
Then came the first
of the search parties.

447
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,055
Took four of my kin.

448
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,805
Honey.

449
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,638
Those boys are as good as out,
okay?

450
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:26,596
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah.

451
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,805
I can hear them over there.

452
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,180
- Where?
- There. That way.

453
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:50,305
- Hush. Shh!
- Dad?

454
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,305
It was louder before.

455
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:00,138
Boys?

456
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:01,805
Boys?

457
00:33:04,222 --> 00:33:05,264
Boys?

458
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,472
Boys?

459
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:12,472
Dad!

460
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:18,763
Boys? Follow the sounds
of our voices.

461
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,138
Dad!

462
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,888
Boys? Can you hear us?

463
00:33:23,347 --> 00:33:24,347
Dad?

464
00:33:24,888 --> 00:33:26,347
We're here, boys.

465
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,638
Dad, where are you?

466
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,930
John, George, we're here.

467
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:35,180
John? George, Daddy's coming.

468
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:43,013
You all right?

469
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,264
They all died?

470
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:52,638
Not right away.

471
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,763
But they were trapped.

472
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:58,555
No food, no water, no way out.

473
00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:02,972
So, you imagine for yourselves
what it must have been like

474
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,888
for those people
to waste away in there,

475
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:08,472
how long it would have taken
for them to...

476
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:11,013
give up the ghost one by one.

477
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:13,430
There must have been
other search parties.

478
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:15,846
Indeed, there was.

479
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,347
But the only thing any of them
could do

480
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,138
is try to figure out
the most likely place

481
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,846
where that rockfall had...
Had sealed them in.

482
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,721
See, back then...

483
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:32,222
nobody could figure out
how to get to the other side

484
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:34,805
of those rocks
without blasting it.

485
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:37,680
Then, the whole
cave system collapse.

486
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:42,180
So...

487
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:46,930
there they still lie.
Thirty-four men and boys,

488
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:51,180
including my grandfather
and his three brothers,

489
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,013
which is how come I can give you
chapter and verse on that event,

490
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:56,097
whilst most people
around here cannot.

491
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,638
I'm sorry for your family.

492
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:04,013
Yeah, you ask me where my people
are buried around here?

493
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:06,138
That goddamn hellhole's gotta be

494
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:08,430
the biggest Bolton family plot
in the state.

495
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:16,430
So, you say the system
is sealed.

496
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:19,013
So, there's no way in?

497
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,514
There's an old souvenir shop
that you had to go through

498
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:26,097
to get into the caves, but...
the state, they cemented it up

499
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,763
right after the last
of the search parties got out.

500
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,763
Now, these local shitbirds
been breaking it down,

501
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:35,138
so they can get in there,
they can get high,

502
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:37,721
make babies
with their underage sweethearts.

503
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:44,930
Can you perhaps just show me
where that is on this?

504
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:48,721
Well, no.
Not on this little dinky thing.

505
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:51,055
You gotta be able to give us
some kind of idea.

506
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:52,138
Hold on.

507
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:02,721
We found him. He's in there.

508
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:06,013
That's the good news and
the bad news at the same time.

509
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:12,948
- Right about here.
- Mm-hm.

510
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,930
Unless it's been blown away
by a strong wind this week,

511
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:19,555
and the parking lot
is right here.

512
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,013
Just a baby step away.

513
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,472
Now, there was a back entrance
that the rescuers used,

514
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:28,763
but, uh, another cave-in
coming off a little earthquake

515
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,721
we had a few years ago
took care of that.

516
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:42,013
Y'all are thinkin',
"Yeah, we got this thing now."

517
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,514
It's in the cave, waitin'.

518
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:47,888
Well,
maybe it's waiting for you.

519
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:50,638
You think of that?

520
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:54,097
Well, you know, we just have
to confirm its whereabouts,

521
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,930
and then,
we call in the cavalry.

522
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,305
We're not taking the fight
to it.

523
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:00,972
Yeah, what you gonna tell
that cavalry?

524
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,555
We don't have to say anything,

525
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,888
but the man who tried to snatch
a boy on the midway...

526
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,972
he's in that cave.

527
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:11,305
What if it gets past you?

528
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:14,763
Gets past them? Since they know
less about it than you do.

529
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,347
It gonna come for my brother
next?

530
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,638
My brother who don't know
a goddamn thing about shit,

531
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:23,680
'cause y'all don't think
that's such a good idea?

532
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:26,347
I back my colleague...

533
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:32,097
Chicken.

534
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:43,097
- I should have called first.
- Come in.

535
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:51,763
Hi, come on.

536
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,763
I didn't drive down
here in the middle of the night

537
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:56,972
just to babysit.

538
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,097
You came down here to help,
which I appreciate,

539
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,389
and this is the best way
to do it.

540
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,638
I only have today, you know.

541
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:07,013
In the morning, I have to go
back and join the real world.

542
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:09,264
Howie, we're gonna be back
in a couple of hours.

543
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:11,846
I appreciate it.

544
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,514
Hey, I'm thinking we take
two cars, if anything gets weird

545
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,805
- or if we need to split up.
- Yeah, sounds good.

546
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,365
I was
at the county building today,

547
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,472
and I ran into DA Hayes
in the hallway.

548
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,055
He asked if he could have
a word with me in private,

549
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:31,763
but since he's a plaintiff
in one of my lawsuits,

550
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,680
I told him
it wasn't a good idea.

551
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,055
You think he's gonna try

552
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,389
and talk you into dropping it?

553
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:37,614
That's the funny thing,

554
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:39,180
he didn't give off
that impression.

555
00:38:40,097 --> 00:38:41,930
He seemed much more subdued

556
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:44,097
than the other times
I've seen him actually.

557
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,097
- Kind of hangdog?
- Yeah.

558
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,972
How did you know?

559
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,138
Just a hunch.

560
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,555
Now I half wish
I had let him speak to me.

561
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:03,555
I was so angry at you
for dragging me to that meeting

562
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,389
at your so-called
investigator's.

563
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,846
I know you were.

564
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,472
To hear her spout
all that crazy shit...

565
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:13,680
felt like a setup.

566
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,347
No, I had no idea
what she was gonna say

567
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,389
until the words started
coming out of her mouth.

568
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,389
No one did.

569
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,138
But you bought right into it.

570
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:21,347
Yeah, I did.

571
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,305
I still do.

572
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,138
So do a lot of the others.

573
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:30,763
I would say to you

574
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:33,138
that they're putting themselves
in harm's way

575
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:34,389
for their convictions,

576
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,888
but then
I'd have to explain to you

577
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:37,055
the how and the why of it,

578
00:39:37,138 --> 00:39:40,972
and forgive me for saying this,
but right now...

579
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:42,930
I don't know
if I have the strength

580
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,596
to deal with your reaction.

581
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:50,013
I came over here because as
painful as that meeting was...

582
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,596
I didn't want it to destroy

583
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,721
any of the goodwill
there was between us.

584
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:02,264
You've never been anything
but kind to me and my girls.

585
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:09,389
And even though I refuse
to accept anything

586
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,430
around this... Cuco thing...

587
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,555
I just want you to know that...

588
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:23,264
I respect the sincerity
of your beliefs.

589
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:27,055
Well, thank you.

590
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:37,180
I noticed you drop
the conditional

591
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:38,305
when you talk about it.

592
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:43,680
You don't say
"If this thing is real" anymore.

593
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:45,347
"If it's trying to become
Claude,."

594
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,305
"If it's truly capable of
hopping from person to person."

595
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:51,055
Yep.

596
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,180
Guess my sense
of what's rational

597
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,888
just got tired and left town.

598
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:58,930
And how is that sitting
with you?

599
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:00,138
Oh, I...

600
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:03,763
It makes me sick to my stomach,

601
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:07,888
'cause if I have to believe
that a thing like that

602
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:10,972
- can exist in the world...
- You take small bites.

603
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,389
It's just the reality
of this thing,

604
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:19,930
it upends everything. It means
everything we ever believed in,

605
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:22,490
- everything we've come to an understanding...
- Hey, Ralph. Ralph.

606
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:23,596
What? What? What?

607
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,638
You take small bites.

608
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:28,430
You accept what you can

609
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,555
to keep your shit together
and nothing more,

610
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:32,930
until you're ready
for another bite. That's it.

611
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,347
We're talking about containing
this thing

612
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,097
- until the troops arrive.
- Yeah.

613
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,805
What if it doesn't cotton
to being contained? Then what?

614
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:48,347
Then we kill it
before it can kill us.

615
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,013
What if it can't be killed?

616
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:53,305
Yeah, we're back to that again.

617
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,347
Small bites, my ass.

618
00:42:06,347 --> 00:42:07,347
Shit.

619
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,180
What you hit that with,
gunpowder?

620
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:16,472
That take you back
to your dormitory days, does it?

621
00:42:16,888 --> 00:42:17,888
Hm.

622
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:24,555
Do you think this right?

623
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,055
What's "this"?

624
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:30,055
Not telling him that
that fucking thing's out there.

625
00:42:31,888 --> 00:42:34,138
What, do you think this is
my tenth rodeo or something?

626
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:35,555
How the hell should I know?

627
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,680
It's not right.

628
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:45,389
Listen, how 'bout we just stick
to the game plan. All right?

629
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:49,555
Thank you.

630
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,430
You mind if I, um...

631
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:56,763
scrounge around for what's left
of that heavenly chicken?

632
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:58,888
Heaven chicken. Not heavenly.

633
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:01,305
I stand corrected.

634
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:04,805
Yeah. Help yourself.
You paid for it.

635
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:26,930
Claude, this Cuco
or whatever you wanna call it,

636
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:28,596
it's coming for you.

637
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,480
Now I feel like I wouldn't be
your big brother

638
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,514
if I didn't at least tell you
what was going on.

639
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:35,264
Do you know
what you just did?

640
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:38,264
Do you know what the fuck
you just did?

641
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:44,721
What I did?
I know what I just did.

642
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:46,430
I gave you the heads up
of your life.

643
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:49,555
No, no, no. He's in my head,
Seale.

644
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:51,305
So, you just told
that fucking thing

645
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:53,472
that all those people
are coming for it.

646
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,472
You are one dumb fuck.

647
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:26,514
Nothing.

648
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:29,180
Try the statie.

649
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:33,389
Probably no signal up there.

650
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,763
Yeah. I might have fucked up
with that.

651
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,180
Seale, they're going up
against this thing for me.

652
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:13,097
Can you wait with that
until you're outside?

653
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:16,763
Sir?

654
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:19,721
You, in the back.

655
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:02,138
Funny.

656
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:03,805
Movie, please.

657
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,680
The Man Who Came to Dinner.

658
00:47:06,763 --> 00:47:10,805
Warner Brothers, 1942,
directed by William Keighley,

659
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:13,596
with Monty Woolley
and Bette Davis.

660
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:20,805
Jimmy Durante.

661
00:47:20,888 --> 00:47:24,055
And how did you like
the film, Ms. Gibney?

662
00:47:24,138 --> 00:47:28,347
- I never saw it.
- Yeah.

663
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,347
That's my girl.

664
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,846
Okay.

665
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:58,721
Let's get this thing over with.

666
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:00,888
Okay.

667
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,972
Firing a gun in there
is a really bad idea,

668
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:14,846
- you know that, right?
- No doubt, but just having one

669
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,097
makes us cowboy types
feel more secure.

670
00:51:44,347 --> 00:51:46,930
When I was little,
my father would say,

671
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:48,972
"A man knows a man.

672
00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:52,763
But an outsider knows
an outsider."

673
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:57,031
There have been
certain developments

674
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,805
in the Frankie Peterson
homicide case.

675
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:10,737
This is where it happened.

676
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:13,972
Holly...

677
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:17,264
He's feeding.

678
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:33,305
What is your name?

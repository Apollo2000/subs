00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:05,020
Tell me more.
You tell me more about those eggs.

3
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:08,337
Let me show you.
Let me show you right here. All the way.

4
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,312
And then... Watch, this is...
This is the beauty of it, okay?

5
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,145
All right.

6
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:18,671
You're dipping it in... in... in...
In the eggs.

7
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,562
What you think about
them pancakes?

8
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,395
- I just like extra syrup.
- Mm-hm.

9
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:34,130
I like
all kinds of syrup, you know.

10
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:39,296
You have to have a perfect
syrup to pancake consistency.

11
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,437
Yeah.

12
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,187
Morning. Check your emails.

13
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,354
I just sent you a few articles.
There was a similar, uh,

14
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:33,479
a child killing. Two sisters.

15
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,854
The suspect killed himself
in prison

16
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,687
and his name
was Heath Hofstadter.

17
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,354
He worked at
the Landon Senior Center

18
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,354
where Terry Maitland's
father lived.

19
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,854
In fact, the old man
was one of his charges.

20
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,687
Um...

21
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,296
Maybe that was why the police
wanted to speak to him.

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,005
Don't you think?

23
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,896
Yeah, could be.

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,437
I don't think
I'm going to be getting back

25
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,812
into that building
after what happened yesterday,

26
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,687
but there's more than
one way to skin a cat.

27
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,437
Where are you going
with all of this?

28
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:04,062
Wherever this takes me. Just...

29
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:05,937
- Just look at what I sent you.
- Yeah, okay.

30
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:08,891
I'm doing that now. I'll call you
back when I have more information.

31
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:32,270
- I thought you were a man.
- I can't see.

32
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,978
Well, that's why they call it
pepper spray.

33
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,312
Did you follow me from work?

34
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:39,854
I... I did. Uh... Uh... Please.
Can... Can you help me?

35
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:41,546
- What with?
- My eyes.

36
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,687
Is English
not your native tongue?

37
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,145
I told you I'm not talking
to reporters.

38
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,187
I'm not a reporter!
I'm a private investigator.

39
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:53,103
- Please. I think I'm going blind.
- Oh, my God.

40
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,713
- Do you have any identification?
- Ah! Right side, back pocket.

41
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,395
Get your hands away
from your face.

42
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,754
Rubbing just makes it worse.

43
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:23,020
You have a nice home.

44
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:26,462
It's called
post-divorce piss-poor modern.

45
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,354
So, tell me what you want
to know about Heath.

46
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,005
You were working with him?

47
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:35,729
For five years.

48
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,520
The papers say
that he claimed to have been

49
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:39,754
on vacation at the time
of the murders.

50
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,771
Yeah, he had that week off.

51
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,520
Told me he was going up
to his mom's place

52
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,812
up in Regis, which he probably
did for a little while,

53
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:49,062
but that didn't stop him
from coming back down

54
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:51,062
to check on his peeps.

55
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,312
That's what he called
his charges, his "peeps."

56
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,629
And, then I guess...

57
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,130
You all right?

58
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,421
No, I am not all right.

59
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,729
I know they supposedly
found his DNA on the bodies

60
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,296
and his fingerprints everywhere,
but...

61
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:17,504
five years, 40 hours a week...

62
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,604
that is a long time to work
with someone

63
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,395
and not sense something.

64
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,270
Not that this'll be
of any comfort to you,

65
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,978
but there's always been killers
like that.

66
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,187
Leading double lives for years
until, finally, they get caught.

67
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,896
And, when they do,
their kids and their wives

68
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,963
say, "We had no idea."

69
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,437
- You're right.
- Right about?

70
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,604
It's not very comforting.

71
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,504
What was Heath like on the day
he came into work?

72
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,395
Strange.

73
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,437
You know, number one,
if I had a week off

74
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,228
from that place,
you wouldn't be able to find me

75
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,963
with a heat-seeking drone.

76
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,020
Hey, what are you doing here?

77
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,379
Are you out of your mind?

78
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,421
And he said?

79
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,562
And that was strange part two,

80
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:07,270
'cause Heath is normally
a chatty Cathy,

81
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,978
but that day he gave me
a polite smile,

82
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,145
like I was some stranger.

83
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,046
- What day was that?
- March 6th.

84
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,562
You sure?

85
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:16,020
I know, because I had
a dentist appointment

86
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:18,546
that morning and it made me
late for work.

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,312
Did Mr. Maitland know Heath?

88
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:28,812
I mean, as much as that old man

89
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:29,978
can know anybody.

90
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:33,646
Heath worked the odd-numbered
suites on the B wing

91
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,312
and Maitland's in B5.

92
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,754
Did Heath have
any dealings with him that day?

93
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,354
He must have.

94
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:41,437
The reason I say this is because
one of the janitors

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,520
said he saw him come out
of Peter's suite.

96
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,312
Why would the janitor
go out of his way

97
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,546
to mention that?

98
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,812
You wanna know
something else that bugs me?

99
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,437
The cops say that they have
witnesses who spotted Heath

100
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,020
nosing around up in Trotwood,
where the girls were found

101
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:11,187
the day they were snatched,
but other folks came forward

102
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:15,020
and said that they saw him
with his mom up in Regis

103
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,354
on the exact same day.

104
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:20,729
I mean, I guess he could go
from one place to the other

105
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:23,896
and back, but...
What does his mother say?

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,212
Ernestine?

108
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,171
Makes a mom proud, huh?

109
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,854
That poor woman said
her son never left her side

110
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:44,296
that whole week.

111
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,687
And, while I know
that that's not true,

112
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,479
because I saw him at work
that day...

113
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,437
I heard that after
Heath's arrest,

114
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,978
the police were interested
in talking to Mr. Maitland.

115
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:54,296
Do you know why?

116
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:57,504
You would have to ask them.

117
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,796
I appreciate you giving me
your time.

118
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,020
Tolliver Academy in Baltimore?

119
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,854
I taught
language arts and mathematics

120
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,687
to fifth and sixth grade
students for three years

121
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:57,312
- up there.
- But no references?

122
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,103
It's hard
to get references from a place

123
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,228
that went belly up

124
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:01,771
after the dean
and half of its trustees

125
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:05,604
- went to jail for embezzlement.
- I can imagine.

126
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,145
After I moved back to Georgia

127
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,520
to take care of my mother,

128
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,812
I realized that
becoming a home-school tutor

129
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,896
would be
a lot more personally rewarding,

130
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,421
instead of teaching
30 students at a clip.

131
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:18,145
I see you received
those references.

132
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:19,937
Mm-hm. I did. I did.
All these families.

133
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:21,729
They couldn't have been
more satisfied with you.

134
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,629
I love kids and I love my work.

135
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:29,254
Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida.

136
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,437
I go where the work is.

137
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,046
But why are all three envelopes
post-marked in Atlanta?

138
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,254
What?

139
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:45,479
- Three years teaching math?
- And language arts.

140
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:47,254
- And language arts.
- Mm-hm.

141
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:52,588
Can you solve that for me?

142
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,312
You think you're the only person

143
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,421
who's tried
to come in here like this?

144
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,729
- I don't understand.
- What are you?

145
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:10,228
Some kind of reporter
for the tabs?

146
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,937
- Blogger? A vee-logger?
- Glory Maitland, I just wanna

147
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,812
- spend a little bit of time...
- Vlogger. Gloggler.

148
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,729
- With you and the kids to write a sympathetic...
- Whatever the hell they call it.

149
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:17,978
- It's a very...
- Get out of my house!

150
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:20,854
- I'm trying to help you and your family.
- Get...

151
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:22,896
Don't you want people
to know the true story?

152
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,130
Because I'm ready to tell it
for you.

153
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,671
Come here. Fuck!

154
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:47,312
That's Terry Maitland's wife.

155
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,771
Wow.

156
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:52,812
Screw them. You have every right
to live your life.

157
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,228
Okay. I should go home.

158
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,395
No. You're not going anywhere.

159
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,479
Here, look, this'll help.

160
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,562
Gotta hand it to you,
Mrs. Maitland.

161
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,713
You got some brass showin'
your face in here.

162
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,379
Excuse me?

163
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,646
Where are your kids tonight?

164
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,020
I hope you didn't leave 'em
home alone.

165
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,145
You fuck off, Rayford.

166
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,437
'Cause you never know,

167
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,520
someone might wanna
even the score.

168
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,729
Are you threatening her?

169
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,020
- Howard!
- Easy, old man.

170
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,005
- You step back.
- Get the fuck off me!

171
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,812
Okay. Pay your tab
and don't you come back, okay?

172
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,187
You got a big mouth on you.
You're gonna walk outta here.

173
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,103
You're gonna pay your tab
and if you even

174
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:32,046
glance back at her,
I'll tear you apart.

175
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,088
Sir, you okay?

176
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,646
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Easy.

177
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,588
Yeah, just give me
a second. Thank you, guys.

178
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,395
Jesus.

179
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,312
I'm so sorry.
She could've blinded you.

180
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,562
I'm fine.

181
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,354
Did she at least
give you anything

182
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,562
worth the trouble?

183
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:01,646
She confirmed
that Heath Hofstadter

184
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,020
did work there
and with Terry's father.

185
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,896
In fact, Hofstadter literally
bumped into Terry the day

186
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,520
that he visited Peter.
The both of them slipped

187
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:12,270
on a wet floor outside
the old man's room

188
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:13,646
and took each other down.

189
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,437
The facility was worried about
a lawsuit, but Terry was fine.

190
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:22,479
Because, um, you know,
Maitland's wife and daughter,

191
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:26,687
they said the same thing.
Terry bumped into some nurse

192
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,729
and, um, the guy scratched him.

193
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:35,228
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. So, anything else?

194
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,020
Just one thing. On the day
that they had the spill

195
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,312
- at the hospital.
- Yeah?

196
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,520
Heath wasn't supposed
to be there.

197
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:45,020
He went out of his way
to come in on a day he had off.

198
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:46,354
And that would've been
March 6th,

199
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,812
the day after the Williams
sisters were found dead.

200
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,171
Okay.

201
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:52,546
Talk later.

202
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,646
This time, I'd like to read

203
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,437
from the Book of Samuel,
chapter three.

204
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,604
Ralph.
How's the homicide conference?

205
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,354
I'm too old for school, man.

206
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,896
Kept falling asleep
in the lectures.

207
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,062
Listen, I was just
talking to Holly Gibney.

208
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:18,646
And I, um... I need
to take a look at the footage

209
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,978
of Terry Maitland from
the day of the murder.

210
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:25,020
It went to your office.
Can you help?

211
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:28,604
You know the drill here, man.
That's a tricky request.

212
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,604
I appreciate that, Yune,
but I would never ask you

213
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,896
if I didn't think that
somewhere on one of those tapes

214
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,337
there might be a real
game changer.

215
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,771
No. We have another angle
here, right?

216
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,629
Will you go to that, please?

217
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:04,687
Anything?

218
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:09,088
No. Now, go back
to the strip club tape, please.

219
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,978
Who'd you say you were again?

220
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,963
Just do what he says, Wayne.

221
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,421
Okay, we can move
to the next piece.

222
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:33,020
I have a staff meeting
in five minutes.

223
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,228
Yeah, no problem. Thanks.
Play it again.

224
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:36,588
You okay here, Wayne?

225
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,337
Hi, Peter.

226
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:47,963
Do you have something
I could put these in?

227
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,312
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

228
00:16:56,336 --> 00:17:00,005
- You don't have to tell me.
- Well, that's good.

229
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,729
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

230
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:04,896
about Heath Hofstadter.

231
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,296
Yeah, I remember you.

232
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:08,978
You were playing cards

233
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:11,130
with my grandmother
in St. Louis.

234
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:17,254
You had four jacks.
She had four queens.

235
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,379
The look on your face.

236
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,937
The last time you saw Heath,
do you remember...

237
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:32,296
I bet your husband
gave you a sharp smack...

238
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,796
that night, am I right?

239
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:41,270
Did Heath, uh, talk to you about
what was happening to him...

240
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,854
I told my wife
the bedroom was too cold.

241
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:49,880
So, what does she do?
She set fire to the bed.

242
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,671
It wasn't him, you know?

243
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,379
Wasn't who?

244
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:12,880
You know.

245
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,880
He really did fool
all of you, didn't he?

246
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:29,270
Turn the heat back on
and then get it boiling.

247
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,812
- Mm-hm. There we go.
- That's good, right?

248
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:36,187
Wow. That's looking good.
Yummy, yummy.

249
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,395
Now, I take the eggs
and I'm gonna go ahead

250
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,646
- and remove the yolks.
- Yeah, that's tricky.

251
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,421
I'm gonna take
these egg whites...

252
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,212
Just play the strip club again
one more time, but slow it down.

253
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,646
Show it to me
from the other angle.

254
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,838
Frame by frame this time.

255
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,520
Okay. Can you blow that up?

256
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,963
More. You got any more there?

257
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:44,796
Okay. Freeze it.

258
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,462
Can you blow that up
on the hands?

259
00:19:57,878 --> 00:20:00,671
Does that look like
he's being scratched to you?

260
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,337
Thank you. Next.

261
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,437
Thanks for seeing me.

262
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,921
You know, we've got to stop
meeting like this.

263
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,671
Why do people
have to tell jokes?

264
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,921
I've never understood that.

265
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:17,729
Is this about your car thief
or your child killer?

266
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:22,713
Alleged child killer.
And yours, Heath Hofstadter.

267
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,771
Hofstadter? That isn't mine.
That would've been two years ago

268
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,103
when I was still
working homicide.

269
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,479
I thought you were an ex-cop?

270
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:32,520
Ex-detective, thank you.
Fifteen years in.

271
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,854
I'm trying to get
to the specifics

272
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,896
of a case they had against him.

273
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,103
Hofstadter? Why?

274
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,103
Because I'm starting to think
there's a connection

275
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:40,546
between the two men.

276
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,729
Well, good luck with that.

277
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,520
The DA's office
won't let you off the elevator

278
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,604
and the squad
ain't gonna tell you jack.

279
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,254
Will they tell you?

280
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,354
- I could talk to some people.
- That would be great.

281
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,020
But only if you go out
to dinner with me.

282
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,421
I'm sorry, what?

283
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,354
You know, so that we can talk
about whatever I find

284
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:02,687
in a... in a... in a less...
I mean, in a... in a more

285
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:06,130
conducive setting to talk.
Or we could talk here. Or...

286
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,713
Here's fine. Either way.

287
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:14,088
A restaurant's fine.

288
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,796
Holly. May I call you Holly?

289
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,729
There's only one thing
that you need to know about me.

290
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:28,588
I have the strength of ten,
because my heart is pure.

291
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:24,062
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

292
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,270
Thank you.

293
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,937
Insvekataj.

294
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:33,187
Insvekataj. Are you...
Are you kidding me?

295
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,020
Where... Where are your...
Your people from?

296
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:36,687
My father was from Trinidad.

297
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:38,145
Well, so, wait, how did he...

298
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:41,395
He wound up teaching high school
in a coal patch in Pennsylvania.

299
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,228
Anthracite or Bituminous?

300
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:46,546
Anthracite, the blue coal
burns hotter, burns cleaner.

301
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:51,604
All right, let me guess, uh...
Carbon County?

302
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:55,020
Schuylkill. I had a bunch
of friends who were Litzis

303
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:57,379
and their parents would call me
"the tamsus."

304
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,005
"The dark one"?

305
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:02,588
I didn't mind it.

306
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,880
So, how did you wind up
in Chicago?

307
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,228
I needed to start over.

308
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:15,354
Why'd you need to start over?
Uh... I'm sorry, that's not...

309
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:17,270
Because my mother died.

310
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:20,421
And before that, I had...
I had to stay.

311
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,187
You were taking care of her?

312
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,796
She was taking care of me.

313
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,462
- So.
- So.

314
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:41,921
Uh... Peter Maitland?

315
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:49,270
So, okay. So, when the state
investigators found out

316
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:51,437
that Hofstadter had been
back to work, uh,

317
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:53,071
one of the days
after the murders...

318
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,812
they searched every suite
that he might've visited.

319
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:58,687
Which one is Peter Maitland?

320
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,395
- He is.
- A day later...

321
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,729
I need to talk to him.

322
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,803
They had a DNA match
with one of the girls.

323
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:10,687
But that alone wasn't enough
to seal a conviction.

324
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:14,729
- Well, what did?
- Oh, he was all over the bodies.

325
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:19,088
Saliva, blood, skin cells,
and then came the kicker.

326
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:22,254
Makes a mom proud, huh?

327
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:27,687
They thought at first
it might've been.

328
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,437
Heath's younger brother, Aaron.

329
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,228
He had just got out of rehab
a week before,

330
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:33,062
but the DNA came back,
wasn't a match.

331
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,504
So, where's Aaron now?

332
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,629
Nowhere.

333
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:39,421
He OD'ed.

334
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,921
You wouldn't believe the fallout
of those two families.

335
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:55,713
I mean, first,
was Hofstadter's mother...

336
00:26:58,169 --> 00:26:59,504
then his brother...

337
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,088
those poor Williams sisters...

338
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,479
Their grandfather had
a fatal stroke that same day.

339
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,379
Their mother tried to poison
herself a few days after.

340
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:17,504
Uh... She was on life support
for about a month.

341
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,713
They finally decided
to pull the plug.

342
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:23,379
It was like a plague.

343
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,130
You know what we forgot to do?

344
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,754
- What?
- Order.

345
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,379
Well, I'm not hungry.

346
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:38,937
How about another Coke?

347
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:42,546
No, uh, double Jack up
with a water back.

348
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,046
- I'll have the same.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

349
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,687
See that girl in the blue hair?

350
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:21,395
I went to high school
with her dad.

351
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,812
Gerard Coover, played football,
and man did that guy

352
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,729
like to put a hurt on people.

353
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:29,046
Anything I can do for you,
Detective?

354
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,046
How you been? You been okay?

355
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:36,062
Ralph...

356
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,604
is this what
the cops call "a friendly chat"?

357
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:40,854
'Cause I've had friendly chats
before and they never seem

358
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,604
to end as friendly
as they start.

359
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:45,479
I'm not here to jam you up.
Just relax.

360
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:48,270
All right, then.
Well, give me a minute.

361
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,896
There, I'm so goddamn relaxed
right now,

362
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,296
I might just pass out.

363
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:02,646
Hey, you remember that night,
when... when Terry Maitland

364
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,171
came in here all covered up
in... in blood?

365
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,005
He scratched you on your wrist.

366
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:11,088
He did?

367
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,354
Why you asking?

368
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,546
I'm just following
a few things up.

369
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:21,062
So, do you remember anything
about that night

370
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:23,729
since we talked? Anything else?

371
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:26,921
Yeah. I mean, he was only
in here for a few minutes.

372
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,046
I already told you everything
I know.

373
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:37,421
- Okay. Have a good night.
- Good night.

374
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,671
That was pretty good.

375
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,462
Okay, all right, that one.

376
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:56,088
Six hundred and ten feet,
give or take a foot or two.

377
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,796
And that one?

378
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,088
Five hundred and forty-five.

379
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,546
- Give or take?
- Exact.

380
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:09,687
- What about you?
- What about me?

381
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:10,963
How tall are you?

382
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,754
I have no idea.

383
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:21,546
- Well, what about me?
- Six-foot-one... and a half.

384
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:27,130
You feel like grabbing
a nightcap at the bar?

385
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:33,921
No. I can't. I have to work.
Believe it or not.

386
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,921
No problem. Some other time.

387
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:13,312
Man comes here from Georgia,
bumps into someone who's accused

388
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,646
- of killing two children...
- Okay.

389
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,062
Goes back to Georgia,
and four weeks later

390
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,171
is accused of a crime
just like it.

391
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,771
These men,
they knew each other beforehand?

392
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:28,046
I doubt it.

393
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,838
Maybe he caught something
from the first guy.

394
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,771
Can't catch murder.
It's not a virus.

395
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:40,937
No, it isn't, but, um...
if it was a virus,

396
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:45,103
you'd have to ask yourself,
how did the first guy catch it?

397
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:46,771
You know, who gave it to him?

398
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:48,671
Because that's
one hell of a bug.

399
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:53,588
Can I get a coffee to go?

400
00:31:56,586 --> 00:31:57,812
It's called a telephone.

401
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:59,395
Sorry, sometimes my brain
skips a step.

402
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,687
Um... I just wanted to ask,
did Heath take any trips

403
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,812
this last year?

404
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:06,171
Anything that would've taken
him out of state?

405
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,854
I mean, I don't know, uh...
first thing that comes to mind

406
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,145
is New York City for a few days
back in February.

407
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,812
When he got back,
did he tell you about the trip?

408
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,854
Yeah, just about how expensive
everything was.

409
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:20,854
- Did he say where he stayed?
- A hotel, I imagine.

410
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:25,562
Uh... Did he mention
where he went, what he saw?

411
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,520
I mean, if he did,
I can't remember

412
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,687
having never been there.

413
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:31,395
Um, you two are friends.
Uh, did he bring you back

414
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:35,270
a souvenir, a gift, a trinket?

415
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:39,421
- He mailed me a postcard.
- Do you still have it?

416
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:48,921
There you are.

417
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:52,713
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

418
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:37,937
I need to go to New York City.

419
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,103
Holly?

420
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,005
I need to go to New York City.

421
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:42,941
Why is that?

422
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:45,687
Uh... I found another
quote, unquote, child killer

423
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,937
who uh, crossed paths
with Heath Hofstadter

424
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,187
at the hotel he was staying at
where she worked.

425
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,937
- She?
- Maria Caneles.

426
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,646
She was covered by DNA evidence,

427
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,145
eyewitness accounts,
and I just need 36 hours.

428
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,604
What do you hope to find there?

429
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,395
Her. Hofstadter's dead,
Maitland's dead,

430
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:02,687
Maria is alive.

431
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,270
Do you have a location for her?

432
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:06,312
Rikers Island, awaiting trial.

433
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:08,479
Her lawyer arranged
for me to visit.

434
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:11,103
I could be there talking
with her by this afternoon.

435
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,880
Okay, I'm gonna
call Howie; He covers expenses.

436
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,212
Okay.

437
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:21,145
Attention, everybody!

438
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,646
What I have in my hands here

439
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,354
are invitations to my party
at my house celebrating

440
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:31,020
the christening of my son,
Master Jerome Parrish Collins.

441
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,771
Dress code is semi-classy,
so nothing you would wear

442
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:36,937
to go bowling in
or to kill an animal.

443
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:40,896
And gifts are welcome,
as long as it's not clothes

444
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,421
with cute words on them.

445
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:05,130
Are you mad at me or something?

446
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,896
What?

447
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,604
I was just standing there
talking at the top of my lungs.

448
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,130
You didn't even look my way.

449
00:36:13,294 --> 00:36:17,296
Oh, I'm sorry. This fucking
arrest report's got me.

450
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:19,729
Driving me up the wall.

451
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:24,270
- It's not even filled out.
- I mean, I'm working on it.

452
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:27,296
You've been staring
at that thing since I got here.

453
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:31,796
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

454
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:35,254
- Jack.
- No, I'm just hungover.

455
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:38,729
If you don't make it
to my baby party...

456
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,254
I'll be there.

457
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:45,796
I will be there. Guaranteed.

458
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:48,088
Nana Gracie.

459
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,754
It's gonna be okay.

460
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:14,546
- Ma'am we're here.
- Just give me a minute.

461
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:29,254
I'm blocking the lane.

462
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,254
I understand. Just...

463
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:37,130
Miss, please,
I can't get another ticket.

464
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:34,729
Hey, Ralph. It's Don.

465
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:38,005
We have a kid just walked in,
says he needs to talk to you.

466
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,171
He won't give me his real name.

467
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,504
Okay, what you want me
to do with him?

468
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:52,880
Give me Howie's address,
I'll make sure he gets there.

469
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,479
Hey, you would think judge...
The giant judge...

470
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:33,687
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,228
When are you gonna
take me out dancing?

472
00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:37,145
Wait a minute.
He can't dance.

473
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,729
- No?
- I'm the brother with the moves.

474
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:40,187
- Oh!
- You wanna go with me.

475
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:41,978
Brother, come one.
Forget dancing.

476
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:44,187
How about I take you out
for a nice lobster dinner

477
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:46,437
and maybe afterwards
we go shopping, huh?

478
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,145
- Shopping for a wedding ring?
- Whoa.

479
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:50,354
Maybe. All right.
Don't tease me.

480
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,479
I won't tease you.

481
00:40:52,503 --> 00:40:54,145
- I'm in love.
- You can't afford a ring.

482
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:55,546
Don't tell her that.

483
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,212
Keep it moving, ladies.

484
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:58,337
Report to
the visitors' entrance...

485
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:09,296
You first.

486
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:11,228
My name's Holly Gibney.

487
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:13,395
I hear you're some kind
of investigator from Michigan.

488
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:14,646
That I got.

489
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,921
Ohio, well, Chicago. Working
on a murder in Ohio. Dayton.

490
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:22,187
My lawyer said you know
something about me and that boy

491
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,978
I never touched, never met,
never saw a day in my life.

492
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,812
- I might.
- You might?

493
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:33,838
Jesus Christ, I would set myself
on fire before I hurt a child.

494
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:40,796
- Is he...
- No.

495
00:42:41,252 --> 00:42:43,103
Do you recognize him?

496
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,687
- Maybe.
- He was staying at a hotel

497
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,228
you were working at in February.

498
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:47,604
So were a dozen other people.

499
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,005
He said he met a girl.

500
00:42:49,836 --> 00:42:52,228
- Was it you?
- I worked the lounge.

501
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:54,379
You know how many guys hit on me
a night?

502
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:56,379
Just look again.

503
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:58,504
Take your time.

504
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:06,270
I don't know.
There was this one guy.

505
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,312
He looks kinda like him.
He kept trying to get me

506
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,187
to go out with him.
You know, like the kinda guy

507
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:12,479
that keeps going at it
until you wanna beg for mercy.

508
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:14,270
So, I told him I would meet him
for breakfast

509
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:17,812
just to get him to stop asking.
I'm not even into guys.

510
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:20,588
Next morning, I changed my mind,
blew him off.

511
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,604
For all I know,
he's still sitting there,

512
00:44:05,628 --> 00:44:07,729
waiting for me to show up.

513
00:44:07,753 --> 00:44:10,354
- Why, what about him?
- His name is Heath Hofstadter.

514
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:13,978
He was arrested for the torture
and murder of two young girls...

515
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,921
in Ohio, last month.

516
00:44:17,544 --> 00:44:19,046
What's that got to do with me?

517
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:26,437
He didn't do it.
He was innocent.

518
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:29,395
Everyone in this goddam place
is innocent. Just ask.

519
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:33,354
No. He was innocent like you.
They found his DNA on the bodies

520
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:35,437
just like they found yours
on the boy,

521
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,395
and there were witnesses
who put him with the girls

522
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:39,062
just like they were witnesses
who fingered you.

523
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,228
Then how is he innocent?

524
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,520
Because just like you,
there were other witnesses

525
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,812
who placed him in another town
the day of the murders.

526
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:46,270
Yeah, I was in Newark
with my cousin,

527
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:49,020
she took video and everything.
They didn't care.

528
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:51,270
He had no criminal record.
No psychiatric history.

529
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:54,687
Until he was arrested,
not one of them had a clue

530
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:55,729
that he could do such a thing.

531
00:44:55,753 --> 00:44:57,562
You ask anyone in the PJs
about me,

532
00:44:57,586 --> 00:45:00,062
I never missed a day of work
or a day of school.

533
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:02,228
I went to St. Raymonds
with my grandma

534
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:05,103
every week right up until
the day I was arrested.

535
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:08,062
I didn't kill that poor boy.
I didn't kill anybody.

536
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:09,604
I am in this place because,
for some reason,

537
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:12,312
God wants me here.
It's not for me or anybody else

538
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,838
to know his will, but as long
as I keep him close...

539
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:27,270
You said "was."
What happened to him? He dead?

540
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:29,046
He killed himself in prison.

541
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,312
My grandma thought
something like that

542
00:45:32,336 --> 00:45:35,437
was gonna happen to me too.
When I first got here,

543
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:38,228
these women around here
tried to get at me.

544
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,354
But I grew up with
five brothers, three uncles,

545
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:42,854
and one father,
and none of them was angels,

546
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:46,462
so... these bitches learned
real quick to leave me be.

547
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:51,254
You know about what happened
to my uncle and my father?

548
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:11,713
You're family
with Maria Caneles?

549
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,880
- She's my daughter.
- My niece.

550
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:20,880
I'm the grandfather
of the little boy she killed.

551
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,896
They wouldn't even let me
go to the funeral.

552
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,437
I know.

553
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:42,520
I'm innocent,
just like they were.

554
00:46:42,544 --> 00:46:43,880
I know that, too.

555
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:50,062
Look, I can't tell you anything
else about this guy

556
00:46:50,086 --> 00:46:53,270
'cause I never saw him again,
but...

557
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:54,395
if what happened to me

558
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:56,020
happened to him,
then you are right,

559
00:46:56,044 --> 00:46:58,812
- he didn't do it.
- Do you have any idea who did?

560
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:00,921
Let's go. Let's wrap it up.

561
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:02,754
You know, don't you?

562
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,937
If I say his name,
they will send me

563
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,687
right from here
to a mental hospital.

564
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:11,103
Maria, please let me help you.

565
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:13,671
You can't help me. No one can.

566
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:17,629
Because what he does
can never be undone.

567
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:45,604
I came here
because I lied to you

568
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,729
the last time we talked,
and it's been bothering me

569
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:52,838
- ever since.
- Okay. You lied to us about...

570
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:58,171
I knew that parking lot
because I left the van there.

571
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,270
Okay.

572
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:03,963
And I didn't tell you
about the man who took it.

573
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:06,562
Okay.

574
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:11,479
- I was too scared to tell you.
- Scared of being in trouble?

575
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:13,337
No, I was scared of him.

576
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,937
He caught me looking at him
and I was afraid

577
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,270
he'd do something to me.

578
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,379
Did he say anything to you?
Run after you?

579
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,838
He didn't have to.

580
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:34,687
Hey, Merlin,

581
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,046
can you describe
what he looked like, or...

582
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:48,354
Um... You could, um...
could try to draw him.

583
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:54,254
How's that? Care to try that?
Okay. Good man.

584
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:11,629
You should listen to her.

585
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:15,062
Maria Caneles?

586
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:18,062
Whatever her name is.
You can't help her.

587
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:19,978
You don't even know her.

588
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:23,270
Doesn't matter. I heard
what she was trying to tell you

589
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:26,062
and I thought maybe you needed
some help to understand it.

590
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,896
What I do know
is that Maria is innocent. Why?

591
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,312
Because there are two others...

592
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:34,395
- Holly! Do you believe in God?
- Of course.

593
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:37,896
- He's the explanation.
- Explanation for what?

594
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,437
For, uh, everything in this
world that ever happened to me

595
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:43,145
that I don't understand,
that I never will.

596
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:45,978
- And the devil?
- What about him?

597
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,270
Do you believe he exists?

598
00:50:48,294 --> 00:50:50,646
Well, if I believe in God,
I guess I do.

599
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,896
Well, no, I definitely do.

600
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,687
- One devil or many?
- Many.

601
00:50:56,711 --> 00:51:00,604
Right. How do I know you're not
one of them?

602
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:03,812
A devil? Um... Uh...

603
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:06,005
Do you need to see
my driver's license?

604
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:13,479
When you were a child,
who were you told would come

605
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:17,771
for you if you misbehaved,
if you didn't go to sleep?

606
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:23,771
Uh... Jumbee.
My great grandmother was from...

607
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:27,978
The old country.
For me, in Cuba,

608
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,896
I was told El Cuco would come.
My grandmother,

609
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,337
when she was a child,
was told the same.

610
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:37,854
Her grandmother,
before they left Spain,

611
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:40,020
was told the same.

612
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:43,504
Back, and back,
and back it goes.

613
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:53,130
El Cuco?

614
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:04,546
Uh... Sleep child, sleep now...

615
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,646
El Cuco, Jumbee,
met an old Russian woman once

616
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,354
who called hers Baba Yaga.

617
00:52:17,378 --> 00:52:19,520
- Uh... The Boogeyman.
- If you like.

618
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:22,479
All the old cultures,
we had the bad habit

619
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:25,520
of turning truth
into fairy tales.

620
00:52:25,544 --> 00:52:29,604
When we tell our children
about El Cuco, we say,

621
00:52:29,628 --> 00:52:33,646
"If you misbehave, it'll take
you away and eat you."

622
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,103
What we should tell them is,

623
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:39,796
"It doesn't matter either way;
It takes what it wants."

624
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:45,020
You... You keep saying "it."

625
00:52:45,044 --> 00:52:49,921
It can look like a person
if it needs to be, but it's not.

626
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:51,754
It's not?

627
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,103
This day and age,

628
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:57,729
we find it so difficult
to believe in anything

629
00:52:57,753 --> 00:52:59,130
that we can't explain.

630
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:02,796
- Not me.
- Not you?

631
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,479
The woman you visited...

632
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:11,812
I heard her say that her father
and uncle were killed.

633
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:14,228
Was this before or after
the child was murdered?

634
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:15,978
A few weeks after
she was arrested.

635
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,771
And the little boy,
who else in his family has died

636
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,337
- since they found him?
- His mother.

637
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:23,671
Why?

638
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:30,103
Because it is also known
as El Glotón Para Dolor.

639
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:34,937
The Grief Eater.
It takes the child itself.

640
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,312
But after, it likes to linger,

641
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:41,854
because it craves the pain
of the ones left behind.

642
00:53:41,878 --> 00:53:46,145
If the child is its meal,
the suffering of the family

643
00:53:46,169 --> 00:53:47,880
is its dessert.

644
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:01,713
I'm not a good drawer,
but here you go.

What?

647
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:16,546
What?!

648
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,796
What is happening to me?!

649
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,896
Heath Hofstadter
never laid a hand

650
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,025
on those girls.

651
00:59:27,044 --> 00:59:29,546
And... And Terry Maitland
didn't go near that boy.

652
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,854
If you give me a chance
to come on board,

654
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:34,604
I'll show you
what an asset I could be.

655
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:36,713
What can you tell me
about the barn that night?

656
00:59:37,586 --> 00:59:38,896
Okay,
so tell me what I'm looking at.

657
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,896
- Looking for.
- For.

658
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,937
Looking for.
What am I looking for?

659
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,479
- Hiding places.
- For who?

660
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:46,437
Could be a who.
More likely, a what.

661
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,379
I think you should drop
the investigation.

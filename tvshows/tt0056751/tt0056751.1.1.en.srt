2
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,117
Wait in here please,
Susan. I won't be long.

3
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,017
Good Night.

4
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,552
- Not gone yet?
- Obviously not.

5
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,318
- Ask a silly question....
- I'm sorry.

6
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,643
It's all right.
I'll forgive you this time.

7
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,089
Oh, I've had a terrible day.
I don't know what to make of it.

8
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,852
Oh? What's the trouble? Can I help?

9
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:36,229
Oh, it's one of the girls:
Susan Foreman.

10
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:37,990
Susan Foreman?

11
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,294
- Oh ho. She your problem too?
- Yes.

12
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:41,303
And you don't know
what to make of her?

13
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,005
No.

14
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,136
- How old is she, Barbara?
- Fifteen

15
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,384
Fifteen...she lets her
knowledge out a bit at a time,

16
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:50,271
so as not to embarrass me:
that's what I feel about her.

17
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:53,776
She knows more science than
I'll ever know. She's a genius! 

18
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:56,699
- Is that what she's doing with history?
- Something like that.

19
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,336
So, your problem is whether
to stay in business

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,773
or hand over the class to her.

21
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,523
- No, not quite.
- What then?

22
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,258
Ian, I must talk
to someone about this,

23
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,151
but I don't want the girl
to get into trouble.

24
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,778
And I know you're going
to tell me I'm imagining things.

25
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:10,139
No, I'm not.

26
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,843
Well, I told you how
good she is at history.

27
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:15,757
 I had a talk with her, and
I told her she ought to specialise.

28
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,177
Well, she seemed quite interested

29
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,100
'till I said I'd be willing
to work with her at her home.

30
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,291
Then she said that would be
"absolutely impossible"

31
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,762
as her grandfather
didn't like strangers.

32
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:27,822
He's a doctor, isn't he?
It's a bit of a lame excuse.

33
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,121
Well, I didn't pursue the point.
But then recently,

34
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,417
her homework's been so bad.

35
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,273
Yes, I know.

36
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,903
Finally, I was so irritated
with all her excuses,

37
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:37,252
I decided to have a talk
with this grandfather

38
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:38,749
of hers and tell him to take
some interest in her.

39
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,302
Oh, did you indeed?
And what's the old boy like?

40
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,803
Well, that's just it. I got
her address from the secretary

41
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,976
76 Totters Lane - and I went
along there one evening.

42
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,660
Oh Ian, do pay attention!

43
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,238
Sorry. You went along
there one evening....

44
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:55,153
Well, there isn't anything there.
It's just an old junkyard.

45
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,610
Well, you must've gone
to the wrong place.

46
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,308
Well that's the address
the secretary gave me.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,868
Well the secretary
got it wrong then....

48
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,396
No. I checked.

49
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:04,164
There's a big wall on one side,
houses on the other,

50
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:05,658
and nothing in the middle.

51
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,127
And this 'nothing in the middle'
is No. 76 Totters Lane!

52
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:11,210
Mmm....

53
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,420
that's a bit of mystery.

54
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,248
Well, there must be
a simple answer somewhere.

55
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,092
Well, what?

56
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,268
Well, we'll have to find out
for ourselves, won't we?

57
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,002
Thank you for the "we".

58
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:21,442
She's waiting in one of the classrooms.

59
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm lending her a book
on the French Revolution.

60
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:26,059
What's she going to do - rewrite it?
Oh, all right!

61
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:28,919
What do we do?
Ask her point blank?

62
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:30,610
No. I thought we could drive there,

63
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,226
wait 'till she arrives and
see where she goes.

64
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:34,683
Oh....all right.

65
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,827
Well, that is, if you're
not doing anything.

66
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,827
No, I'm not. After you...

67
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:00,889
Susan?

68
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,128
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Miss Wright!
I didn't hear you coming in.

69
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,902
- Aren't they fabulous?
- Who?

70
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,494
I-It's John Smith
and the Common Men.

71
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,111
They've gone from 19 to 2.

72
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:09,770
Hmm.

73
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,418
"John Smith" is the stage name
of the honourable Aubrey Waites.

74
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,468
He started his career as Chris Waites
and the Carollers, didn't he, Susan?

75
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,536
You are surprising, Mr. Chesterton.

76
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,319
I wouldn't expect you
to know things like that.

77
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,914
I have an enquiring mind....
and a very sensitive ear.

78
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,475
Thank you.

80
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,229
- Is that the book you promised me?
- Yes.

81
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:33,544
Thank you very much.
It will be interesting...

82
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:36,252
- I'll return it tomorrow.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

83
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:39,131
- Keep it until you've finished it.
- I'll have finished it.

84
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,854
Oh, where do you live, Susan?

85
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,995
I'm giving Miss Wright a lift.
I've room for one more..

86
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:47,315
Er....no thank you, Mr. Chesterton.
Er....I like walking through the dark.

87
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,610
It's mysterious.

88
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,454
Be careful, Susan. There'll
probably be fog again tonight.

89
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:52,764
Hmm.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,282
- See you in the morning.
- I expect so.

91
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:57,013
- Good night.
- Good night.

92
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,933
Good night, Susan.

93
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:21,430
That's not right...!

94
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,507
Over there!

95
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:31,709
Lucky there was no fog.
I'd never have found this.

96
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,323
Well, she doesn't seem
to have arrived yet.

97
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,131
I suppose we are doing
the right thing, aren't we?

98
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:41,054
- You can't justify curiosity.
- But her homework....

99
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,010
Bit of an excuse, really,
isn't it? I've seen far worse.

100
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,349
The truth is, we're both
curious about Susan,

101
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:48,487
and we won't be happy until
we know some of the answers.

102
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,833
Well, you can't just
pass it off like that.

103
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:54,020
If I thought I was just being
a busybody, I'd go straight home!

104
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,948
I thought you agreed
she was a bit of a mystery!

105
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,073
Yes, but I think you'll find

106
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,310
there's a very simple
explanation to all this.

107
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,354
Well, I don't know how
you explain the fact

108
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:02,661
that a teenage girl does not know

109
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,896
how many shillings
there are in a pound.

110
00:07:05,022 --> 00:07:06,899
- Really?
- Really!

111
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,138
She said she thought we
were on the decimal system.

112
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,682
The decimal system?

113
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:16,505
- I'm sorry, Miss Wright.
- Don't be silly, Susan.

114
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:18,146
The United States
has a decimal system.

115
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,096
You know perfectly
well that we do not.

116
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,729
Of course - the decimal
system hasn't started yet!

117
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,429
I suppose she couldn't 
be a foreigner...

118
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,797
no, it doesn't make sense!

119
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,739
Nothing about
this girl makes sense.

120
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,375
For instance, just the other day,
I was talking about chemical changes

121
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,481
I'd given out the litmus paper
to show cause and effect....

122
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,336
....and she knew the answer
before you'd started.

123
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,529
Well, not quite.

124
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,216
The answer simply
didn't interest her....

125
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,199
Yes, I can see red turns
to blue, Mr. Chesterton, but

126
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,902
that's because we're dealing
with two inactive chemicals.

127
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,338
They only act in relation
to each other.

128
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,560
But that's the whole point
of the experiment, Susan.

129
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,893
Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it?

130
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,111
Well, I-I'm not trying
to be rude, but...

131
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,353
couldn't we deal with
two active chemicals?

132
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:59,311
Then red could turn
blue all by itself 

133
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,898
and we could get on
with something else.

134
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:05,366
I'm sorry. It was just an idea.

135
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:09,907
She means it. These simple
experiments are child's play to her.

136
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,436
You know, it's almost
got to the point

137
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,643
where I want
to deliberately trip her up.

138
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,732
Yes...something like that
happened the other day.

139
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:20,703
I'd set the class a problem with A,
B, and C as the three dimensions....

140
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:23,303
It's impossible unless
you use D and E!

141
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:26,174
D and E? Whatever for?

142
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:28,392
Do the problem that's set, Susan.

143
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,632
I can't, Mr. Chesterton!

144
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,030
You can't simply work
on three of the dimensions!

145
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:33,872
Three of them? Oh.

146
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:36,335
Time being the fourth, I suppose.

147
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,133
Then what do you need E for?

148
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,849
What do you make
the fifth dimension?

149
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,291
Space...

150
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,475
Too many questions
and not enough answers.

151
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,534
Too stupid...
or just doesn't know.

152
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,733
So, we have a fifteen-year old girl

153
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,034
who is absolutely
brilliant at some things

154
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,351
and excruciatingly bad at others.

155
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,225
There she is!

156
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:08,139
Look, can we go in? I..I hate
to think of her, alone in that place.

157
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,131
If she is alone.

158
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,746
Look, she is fifteen....
she might be meeting a boy.

159
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,446
- Didn't that occur to you?
- I almost hope she is.

160
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:16,566
What do you mean?

161
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:19,614
Well, it would be so
wonderfully normal.

162
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,488
It's silly, isn't it?
I feel frightened....

163
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,426
as if we're about to
interfere in something

164
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,455
that is best left alone...

165
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:35,912
Come on, let's get it over with.

166
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,579
Well, don't you feel it?

167
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,549
I take things as they come,
come on.

168
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,435
What a mess.

169
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,725
I'm not turning any of
this stuff over to find her....

170
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,695
Over there?

171
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,493
- Blast! I dropped it!
- What?

172
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,323
The torch!

173
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,862
- Well, use a match!
- No, I haven't got any.

174
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:36,015
- Oh, never mind.
- Susan?

175
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,837
Susan? Susan?

176
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,688
Susan?

177
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,264
Susan!

178
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,707
Mr. Chesterton and Miss Wright!

179
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,095
Can't have got out
without us seeing her?

180
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,296
Ian...look at this!

181
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,873
Well, it's a police box!

182
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,641
What on earth's it doing here?

183
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,538
Well, these things are
usually on the street....

184
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,595
Feel it! Feel it!

185
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,606
Did you feel it?

186
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,346
It's a faint vibration....

187
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,236
It's alive!

188
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,998
It's not connected to anything,

189
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,945
unless it's through the floor.

190
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:31,155
Look, I-I've had enough.
Let's go and find a policeman.

191
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,305
Yes, all right....

192
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,587
- Is that her?
- That's not her....

193
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,427
Quick!

194
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,027
There you are, Grandfather!

195
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:57,039
- It's Susan!
- Shh!

196
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,719
- Excuse me....
- What are you doing here?

197
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,752
Uh, we're looking for a girl.

198
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,207
- We?
- Good evening.

199
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:12,223
What do you want?

200
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,979
Um....one of our pupils, Susan
Foreman, came into this yard.

201
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,514
Really? In here? Are you sure?

202
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:20,813
Yes. We saw her from
across the street.

203
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,590
One of their pupils. 
Not the police, then....

204
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:23,636
Er....I....I beg your pardon??

205
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:25,666
Why were you spying on her?
Who are you?

206
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,159
We heard a young girl's
voice call out to you....

207
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:31,538
Your hearing must be very acute.
I didn't hear anything.

208
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:33,040
It came from in here!

209
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,694
- You imagined it.
- I certainly did not imagine it!

210
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:36,760
Young man...

211
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,858
Is it reasonable to suppose that

212
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:42,173
anyone would be inside
a cupboard like that, hmm?

213
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,098
Would it therefore be

214
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,130
unreasonable to ask you
to let us have a look inside?

215
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:49,094
I wonder why I've never
seen that before.

216
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,009
Now, isn't that strange?

217
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,547
Pretty damp and dirty...hmm...

218
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,208
Won't you help us?

219
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,574
We're two of her teachers
from the Coal Hill School.

220
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,961
We saw her come in and
we haven't seen her leave.

221
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,437
Naturally, we're worried....

222
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,248
Have to be cleaned...Mmm?

223
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,255
Oh, I'm afraid it's none
of my business.

224
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,299
I suggest you leave here.

225
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:10,325
Not until we're satisfied
that Susan isn't here

226
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:13,154
and, frankly, I don't
understand your attitude....

227
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,794
Oh, yours leaves
a lot to be desired.

228
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,275
- Will you open the door?
- There's nothing in there!

229
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,613
Then what are you
afraid to show us?

230
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:20,571
Afraid?

231
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,992
Oh, go away!

232
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,792
I think we'd better go
and fetch a policeman.

233
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,673
- Very well.
- And you're coming with us.

234
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:28,549
Oh...am I?

235
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:33,332
I don't think so, young man.
No, I don't think so...

236
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,201
We can't force him!

237
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,028
But we can't leave him here!

238
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,934
Doesn't it seem obvious to you
he's got her locked up in there?

239
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,040
Look at it!

240
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,957
There's no door handle...

241
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,602
must be a secret lock somewhere.

242
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,981
That was Susan's voice.

243
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,445
Of course it was!

244
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,858
Susan...Susan? Are you in there?

245
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,788
It's Mr. Chesterton and
Miss Wright, Susan!

246
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,804
Don't you think you're being
rather high-handed, young man?

247
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,410
You thought you saw
a young girl enter the yard.

248
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,276
You imagined you heard her voice.

249
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,305
You believe she might be in there.
It's not very substantial, is it?

250
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,031
But why won't you help us?

251
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,723
I'm not hindering you.

252
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,012
If you both want to make
fools of yourselves,

253
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,030
I suggest you do
what you said you'd do.

254
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,192
Go and find a policeman.

255
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,394
While you nip off quietly
in the other direction.

256
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,881
Insulting.

257
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,066
There's only one way in
and out of this yard.

258
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:18,686
I shall be here when you get back.

259
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:19,966
I want to see your faces

260
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,647
when you try to explain away
your behaviour to a policeman.

261
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:24,984
Nevertheless,
we're going to find one.

262
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:25,846
Come along, Barbara.

263
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,363
What are you doing out there?

264
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,146
She is in there!

265
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,527
Close the door!

266
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,772
Barbara!

267
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:44,564
Close the doors, Susan.

268
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,953
I believe these people
are known to you.

269
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:57,310
They're two of my schoolteachers!
What are you doing here?

270
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,416
Where are we?

271
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,032
They must have followed you.

272
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:01,458
That ridiculous school

273
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,279
I knew something like
this would happen

274
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,836
if we stayed in one place too long.

275
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,081
But why should they follow me.

276
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,935
Is this really where
you live, Susan?

277
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,052
Yes.

278
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,161
And what's wrong with it?

279
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,181
But it was just
a telephone box....

280
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,192
Perhaps.

281
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,113
And this is your grandfather...?

282
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:16,211
Yes.

283
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,549
Well, why didn't you tell us that?

284
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,228
I don't discuss
my private life with strangers.

285
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,281
But it was a police telephone box.

286
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,699
I walked all round it!
Barbara, you saw me!

287
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,093
You don't deserve any explanations.

288
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,652
You pushed your way in here,
uninvited and unwelcome.

289
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:30,093
I think we ought to leave....

290
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,360
No, just a minute.

291
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,343
- I know this is absurd....
- Dear, dear, dear,

292
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,690
- this is very....
- but I feel...

293
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:35,781
I walked all around it!

294
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,047
It's stopped again,
you know, and I've tried...

295
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,242
Hmm?

296
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,984
Oh, you wouldn't understand at all.

297
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,322
But I want to understand!

298
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:44,345
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

299
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,254
Oh by the way Susan, I've

300
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:49,167
managed to find a replacement
for that faulty filament.

301
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:53,445
Bit of an amateur job, but
I, er, I think it'll serve.

302
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,548
It's an illusion. It must be...

303
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:00,910
What is he talking about now?

304
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,158
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,460
You don't understand,
so you find excuses.

306
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,151
Illusions, indeed?

307
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,357
You say you can't fit
an enormous building

308
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,119
into one of your
smaller sitting rooms?

309
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:12,915
No.

310
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,864
But you've discovered
television, haven't you?

311
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:15,494
Yes...

312
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,140
Then by showing
an enormous building

313
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,867
on your television
screen, you can do what

314
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,570
seemed impossible,
couldn't you?

315
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,879
Well...yes, but I still don't know....

316
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:25,393
It's not quite clear, is it?

317
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,242
I can see by your face
that you're not certain..

318
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,635
You don't understand.

319
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,995
and I knew you wouldn't!
Never mind.

320
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,918
Now then, which
switch was it...?

321
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:33,810
No, no, no....

322
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,039
Ah yes, that is it!

323
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,447
The point is not
whether you understand...

324
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,628
What is going to happen to you, hmm?

325
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,561
They'll tell everybody
about the ship now.

326
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:45,628
The ship...?

327
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,830
Yes, yes, ship!

328
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:49,293
This doesn't roll along
on wheels, you know.

329
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,073
You mean...it moves?

330
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:52,489
The TARDIS can go anywhere.

331
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:55,905
TARDIS? I don't
understand you, Susan.

332
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,003
Well, I made up the name
TARDIS from the initials.

333
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,480
Time And Relative
Dimension In Space.

334
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,775
I'd thought you both would
understand when you saw

335
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,406
the different dimensions
inside from those outside.

336
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,066
Let me get this straight.

337
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:10,710
A thing that looks like a police
box, standing in a junkyard...

338
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,076
it can move anywhere
in time and space!?

339
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:13,592
Yes!

340
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:14,613
Quite so.

341
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,219
But that's ridiculous!

342
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,314
Why won't they believe us?

343
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,643
Well, how can we?

344
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,744
Now, now, don't get
exasperated, Susan.

345
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,111
Remember the Red Indian.

346
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,630
When he saw the first steam train,

347
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,932
his savage mind thought
it an illusion too.

348
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,157
You're treating us like children!

349
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,129
Am I?

350
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,190
The children of my
civilisation would be insulted.

351
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:33,522
Your civilisation?

352
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,524
Yes, my civilisation.

353
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,822
 I tolerate this century,
but I don't enjoy it.

354
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,912
Have you ever thought about
what it's like to be wanderers

355
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,436
in the fourth dimension?

356
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,993
Have you?

357
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,677
To be exiles? 

358
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,963
Susan and I are cut off
from our own planet,

359
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,117
without friends or protection.

360
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,213
But one day...

361
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,098
...we shall get back.

362
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,608
Yes, one day....

363
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,430
one day.....

364
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:03,479
It's true. Every word of it's true.

365
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,792
You don't know what
you've done coming here....

366
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:08,396
Grandfather, let them
go now, please!

367
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,352
Look, if they don't
understand, they can't...

368
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,240
they can't hurt us at all!

369
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,165
I understand these people
better than you...

370
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,917
their minds reject things
they don't understand...

371
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,171
No.

372
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,050
He can't keep us here...

373
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,449
Susan, listen to me,

374
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,648
can't you see that
all this is an illusion?

375
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,481
It's a game that you and your
grandfather are playing, if you like.

376
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:32,480
But you can't expect
us to believe it.

377
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,571
It's not a game!

378
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,353
But, Susan....

379
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:35,787
It's not!

380
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,817
Look, I love your school.
I love England in the 20th century.

381
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:42,963
The last five months have
been the happiest of my life....

382
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:47,015
But you are one of us. You look
like us, you sound like us....

383
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,535
I was born in another time.

384
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,741
Another world.

385
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,590
Now look here Susan, you...

386
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,601
Oh come on, Barbara,
let's get out of here.

387
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,800
No, you two can't get out.
He won't let you go.

388
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:05,179
He closed the doors
from over there. I saw it...

389
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,427
Now which is it...?

390
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,554
Which is it?

391
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,201
Which control operates the door?

392
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,850
You still think it's all an illusion....

393
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,296
I know free movement

394
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,842
in time and space is
a scientific dream

395
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,941
I don't expect to find
solved in a junkyard!

396
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,331
Oh, your arrogance is nearly
as great as your ignorance!

397
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:24,095
Will you open the door?
Open the door!

398
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,712
Susan, will you help us?

399
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,768
I mustn't!

400
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,395
Very well then.

401
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,886
 I'll have to risk it myself.

402
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,965
I can't stop you...

403
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,267
Oh, don't touch it! It's live!

404
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:37,875
Ian!

405
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,113
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

406
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,986
Grandfather, let them
go now! Please!

407
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,102
And by tomorrow we
shall be a public spectacle.

408
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,134
 A subject for news and idle gossip.

409
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:47,612
But they won't say anything....

410
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,461
My dear child, of course they will.

411
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,025
Put yourself in their place.

412
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:54,073
They're bound to make some sort
of a complaint to the authorities

413
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,533
or at the very least
talk to their friends.

414
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,119
If I do let them go, Susan, you
realise of course we must go too.

415
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,293
No. Grandfather,

416
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,955
- we've had all this out b....
- There's no alternative, child.

417
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,993
I want to stay!

418
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:09,439
Look, they're both kind people.
Why won't you trust them?

419
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,183
All you've got to do

420
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,655
is ask them to promise
to keep our secret and....

421
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,530
It's out of the question.

422
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,082
I won't go, Grandfather.

423
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,069
I won't leave the 20th century....

424
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,944
I'd rather leave the TARDIS and you!

425
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:21,204
Now you're being
sentimental and childish.

426
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,215
No, I mean it.

427
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,005
Very well.

428
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,962
Then you must go with them.

429
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,202
I'll open the door.

430
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,478
Are you coming, Susan?

431
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,453
Oh no grandfather, no!

432
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,281
Let me go!

433
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:34,694
No!

434
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,073
Get back to the ship's side!

435
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,164
Hold it...

436
00:20:38,305 --> 00:21:38,931

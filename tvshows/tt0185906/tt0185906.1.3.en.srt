2
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:34,830
I never thought I'd get through D-Day,
let alone the next phase.

3
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,245
I thought I'd be killed instantly.

4
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,246
I thought one of two things:
a quick death…

5
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:44,544
or I'd come through
without a scratch.

6
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:50,882
I think everybody had fear. I think
there's people that can handle fear.

7
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,677
I think I was probably one of them.

8
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:59,980
I think I was just as scared
as anybody else, except I could think.

9
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:04,690
It's a feeling you would
not let yourself down…

10
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:09,361
and you would not let your comrades
or your unit down.

11
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,658
We all had fear, but we all
had training to know…

12
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,123
you try to handle your fear…

13
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:23,337
and work to accomplish
what you're supposed to be doing.

14
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,686
Hey, it looks like what's-his-name.

15
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:21,104
You know, from 1st Platoon?

16
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:24,110
–Our 1st Platoon?
–It sure does.

17
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,405
Blithe.

18
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,912
Hey, Blithe.

19
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,075
Blithe!

20
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,211
Keep moving! Get down!

21
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:57,722
Thought that was you.

22
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,479
You alone?

23
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,905
You're the first familiar faces
I've seen.

24
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:10,025
I ain't surprised. They dropped us
all over the peninsula.

25
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,818
We've been fighting with the 502nd
since we got here.

26
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:15,952
You?

27
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:20,413
Oh, I've been…

28
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,961
trying to find Easy.
–Join the club.

29
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,642
Spread out!

30
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,817
Hey, fellas.

31
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:55,202
–Look who decided to show up, Floyd.
–Hey, Luz.

32
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,010
–Thought we'd never find you.
–You okay?

33
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:00,952
–Get a load of this. Like it?
–It's real?

34
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,795
–Of course.
–You like this?

35
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:07,413
Oh, nice. That's a beauty, sarge.

36
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,299
It's a hell of a poncho.

37
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,382
My Luger's gonna put you all
to shame when I get it.

38
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:20,134
How was your jump?

39
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,180
–Missed the DZ.
–Yeah, that goes without saying.

40
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:28,521
–I guess so.
–Got any souvenirs to trade?

41
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:35,450
They're all ticking, unlike their
previous owners. Got anything good?

42
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,197
Not yet.

43
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,918
So have we lost anybody?

44
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:50,549
Burgess took one in the face.
Wynn got pinked in the behind.

45
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,630
–They're gonna be okay.
–That's good.

46
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,215
–Run into Lt Meehan on your travels?
–No. Why?

47
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:01,188
Company HQ's still missing.
They think the plane went down.

48
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:05,178
–They say he's gonna turn up.
–I ain't holding my breath.

49
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,813
–Who's in command?
–Winters for now.

50
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:09,978
Lt Welsh is 1st Platoon.

51
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:13,274
–Easy Company on the road!
–1st Platoon!

52
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:17,988
–Platoon! Move out!
–On your feet. Let's go, 1st Platoon!

53
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:22,623
–Easy's moving out. On your feet.
–Let's go!

54
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:27,003
–Stand up, let's go! Here we go!
–Today, people!

55
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:31,833
Listen! It'll be dark soon. Light
and noise discipline from here on.

56
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,512
No talking, smoking or grab-fanny
with the man in front of you.

57
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,800
–Where we headed to?
–We're taking Carentan.

58
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,222
Sounds like fun.

59
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,358
It's the only place where armor from
Omaha and Utah Beach can head inland.

60
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:50,439
Until we take Carentan, they're stuck.
Taylor's sending the whole division.

61
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:55,231
“Remember, boys, give me three days
and three nights of hard fighting…

62
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:57,489
and you will be relieved.”

63
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,484
Lieutenant, I'll take point.

64
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,786
Hoobler will be lead scout.

65
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:06,328
–Blithe, glad you could join us.
–Thank you.

66
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,503
1st Platoon, fall in behind
Fox Company.

67
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:14,049
2nd and 3rd Platoons, follow us.
Shake a leg.

68
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,172
“Another thing to remember, boys:
flies spread disease.

69
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,385
So keep yours closed.”

70
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:10,477
Don't wake Jerry.

71
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,285
–Damn it.
–What?

72
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:33,961
–We lost F Company, sir.
–Again?

73
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,463
–We lost F Company.
–Again?

74
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:42,385
–Blithe, Skinny, guess what.
–Pass the word to hold up.

75
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:47,682
–Take Blithe and go find F Company.
–Yes, sir. Come on, Blithe.

76
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,491
Shit.

77
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,960
–Did you send somebody?
–Hoobler and Blithe.

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,328
Why are we stopped?

79
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:13,748
This is about officers crapping out
on their training, Nix.

80
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,632
Come on. Let's get this show
on the road.

81
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,261
Dang mosquitoes.

82
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,650
What is it?

83
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,570
–Flash.
–Thunder.

84
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,620
–I can hear you across the field.
–You F Company?

85
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,792
That's right.

86
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,536
Where you all been?

87
00:10:56,716 --> 00:11:00,416
Blithe, go tell the lieutenant
we found F Company.

88
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:06,099
–I'll find out where these yokels are.
–Hey, who you calling a yokel?

89
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:19,771
He's dead, private.

90
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:24,612
–Did you find Fox Company?
–Yes, sir.

91
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:31,040
Thought he—
I thought he had me.

92
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,340
–Fallschirmjäger.
–Paratrooper?

93
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:39,469
Division thinks there's a regiment
of them holding Carentan.

94
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:42,130
Well, there's one less to worry about.

95
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:44,886
That's edelweiss.

96
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:48,306
That only grows in the Alps
above the tree line.

97
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:53,981
He climbed up there to get it. It's
said to be the mark of a true soldier.

98
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:18,425
Take the 1st straight up the middle.
We have to move quickly.

99
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:21,631
I'll be right behind you
with 2nd and 3rd.

100
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:39,734
–Go!
–Let's go, 1st, let's go.

101
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,686
Go, go! Go!

102
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,528
Fire!

103
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:54,824
–In the ditch! Down! Down! Down! Down!
–Incoming!

104
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,460
–Goddamn it.
–Where the fuck is everybody?

105
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:08,300
–Where'd everybody go?
–I have no idea!

106
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:13,011
Let's go, Easy!
Get those MGs moving, will you?

107
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:16,198
–Get them out of there!
–They're in the open!

108
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,604
Go! Go!

109
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,861
Get them going, Buck!
Follow me, Easy!

110
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:26,282
Move out! Move out, men!

111
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,571
Go!

112
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:32,282
Move out! Move out!

113
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,828
Get yourselves out of that ditch!

114
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,335
We have men getting killed
out there, Blithe!

115
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:44,831
Move! You got no cover there! Go!

116
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:48,760
Spotter! Upstairs window! Left!

117
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,177
Follow me!

118
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:55,015
Get out of those trenches!

119
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:59,223
–Down, down, down, down!
–Incoming!

120
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,772
That's an MG42!

121
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,979
–Medic up!
–No! Stay down! He's shot!

122
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,275
Get out of the dirt! Nazi!

123
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,257
There's one in the upper—

124
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,550
–Medic!
–Pull him back!

125
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:36,889
Ah, shit!

126
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,444
Sniper! That-away! Second floor left!

127
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,328
Ah, shit!

128
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:04,506
I need some covering fire.
Ready, Luz?

129
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:10,174
Okay, I'm out.

130
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:20,311
Guarnere! Clear that sector
on the right!

131
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,347
Hey, up with me!

132
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:31,033
–Shit!
–Move, Luz! Here! High!

133
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,277
You okay, Shifty?

134
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:36,738
We gotta take that warehouse!

135
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,245
Shifty!

136
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,664
Hammer those windows.

137
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,751
Let's go! Move! Go! Go!

138
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:53,427
Start clearing these buildings.
Two to a house.

139
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:58,394
Second two. Go! Go!

140
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:03,062
Houses on the right!

141
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,108
Check them and clear them!

142
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:19,994
Turn left! Bring it up!

143
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,206
Smash it.

144
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,463
Grenade! Luz, come on, Luz.

145
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,132
–Come on!
–Close behind.

146
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,249
Shit!

147
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:06,251
They got us zeroed! Spread it out!
Spread it out!

148
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,461
–They got us zeroed!
–Go now!

149
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:11,835
–Get out of the street!
–Get out of there!

150
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,502
They got us zeroed!

151
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,764
Get out of there! Go! Go!

152
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,639
Get the hell out of the street! Move!

153
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,936
Let's go! Go! Go!

154
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,065
–Take cover!
–I need a hand over here!

155
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,459
Medic!

156
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,920
–Move over!
–Through the window!

157
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:11,644
Come on. Let's get you out of here.
Come on, boy!

158
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,737
Move! Move! Move!

159
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:20,159
Get out of the street! Go! Go!

160
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:29,081
Lip!

161
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,925
Hey, buddy.

162
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:47,138
You're okay, Lip. Everything's
where it should be.

163
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:49,224
Come on. Upsy-daisy.

164
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:55,146
–Check up front.
–Get Tipper up here with the bazooka.

165
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:59,107
–Check across the front.
–Move on one!

166
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:24,181
Hello? Anybody there?

167
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,232
Tipper! Tip!

168
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:45,242
Tipper! Answer me! Tip!

169
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:51,535
–Joe? That you?
–Looking good, Tip.

170
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:56,126
Looking real good. Come here, buddy.
You gotta sit down. Come on.

171
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:59,136
Easy, easy. There you go.
There you go.

172
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:07,060
Ah, Jesus.

173
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:21,114
You hang in there, buddy. We're gonna
get you fixed up, all right?

174
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:25,788
Okay. Guys, you wanna give me
a hand here? Come on.

175
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:30,124
Take the left flank!
Take the left flank!

176
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,455
Got a bad one.

177
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,542
Padre!

178
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:44,018
–In the name of the Father, the Son—
–You see what I'm seeing?

179
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:48,684
—is now and forever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

180
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:52,847
–Crazy fools, the Irish.
–You should know.

181
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:01,232
Smokey, the window. Let's go!

182
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:28,220
–Morning, sir.
–What's your name, trooper?

183
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,843
Farnsworth from Able Company,
501st.

184
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,361
We got it clear from here all the way
to the north of them Krauts.

185
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:39,269
Tell your CO 506 secured
all positions south of you.

186
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:42,152
Sir, I'll tell him. Come on, let's go!

187
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,277
Lieutenant Winters.

188
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,702
–Yes, sir?
–Is it safe to cross now?

189
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,659
–What's that, sir?
–Is it safe to cross?

190
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,383
–We wanna move the wounded.
–Yes, sir.

191
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,169
Okay.

192
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,384
Come on. Let's get them out of here.

193
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,445
There she is.

194
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:21,486
Plasma drip.

195
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,408
You're lucky it was a ricochet.

196
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:28,412
–Just caught a piece of it.
–Stupid.

197
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,908
–What?
–Nothing.

198
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,323
Walking wounded to the rear.

199
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,332
–You gonna be able to stay off it?
–Doesn't look that way.

200
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,995
Well, you gotta try, huh?

201
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,131
What've we got planned?

202
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,922
Well, we expect a counterattack.

203
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,468
Carentan's important to them.

204
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,204
–Any idea when?
–We're not waiting around to find out.

205
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:55,512
Battalion wants us to head east,
set up a defensive position.

206
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:00,145
With the flooded fields,
it's the direction they'll come from.

207
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:05,523
–You gonna be all right?
–Yeah.

208
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:08,737
Good.

209
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,628
What's wrong with Blithe?

210
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,965
Well, nothing. Except he can't see.

211
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,920
–He can't see?
–So he says.

212
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:44,189
Blithe?

213
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,650
It's Lieutenant Winters.

214
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,196
What happened?

215
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,073
I don't know, sir.

216
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,701
Well, things… They just
kind of went black on me.

217
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,340
–What, you can't see?
–Not a thing, sir.

218
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,380
I can't see a thing.

219
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:12,849
Well, you just take it easy, Blithe.

220
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,387
I'll get you out of here.
Get you back to England.

221
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:20,890
It's gonna be okay.

222
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,855
Sir…

223
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:31,904
I didn't wanna let anyone down.
–No.

224
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:35,787
Just take it easy.

225
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,537
It's okay, son.

226
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,641
Sir?

227
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,852
–What is it?
–Thank you, sir.

228
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,899
I'm okay.

229
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,694
Yeah, I'm okay.

230
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:12,109
I'm okay. I think I'm okay.

231
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,746
You can see?

232
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:19,748
God, I don't know what happened.

233
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:23,213
I think— I think I'm okay.

234
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,672
All right.

235
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,889
Well, stay a little while longer
and make sure.

236
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:35,757
And then you can report
back to your platoon.

237
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,479
Yes, sir.

238
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,946
Now can we get that bandage on?

239
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:55,867
Yeah.

240
00:25:56,831 --> 00:26:01,244
–Berlin by Christmas is how I see it.
–Yeah, you're full of it.

241
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:06,414
Oh, God. This Kraut cheese
tastes like—

242
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,509
–It stinks.
–Bread's stale too.

243
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,469
Give me that.

244
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:16,763
The way we came and took over? Don't
seem like Jerry's got much fight left.

245
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:19,481
Don't get hit in the face when Jerry
throws in the sponge, all right?

246
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:22,855
You mark my words, Mal:
Berlin by Christmas.

247
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:26,191
Enjoy it while it lasts.
We're moving out soon.

248
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:29,650
Out of town, lieutenant? Already?

249
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,697
That's right.

250
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:41,410
Don't they know we're just getting
settled here?

251
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,916
Nice, Groucho.

252
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:50,380
–What?
–Real smart.

253
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:54,212
You're taking your life
in your own hands. Right?

254
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,597
I told you. I didn't see it.

255
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,564
What, Speirs shooting the prisoners,
or the sergeant in his own platoon?

256
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:03,574
–I didn't hear that!
–He shot one of his own?

257
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:06,769
Supposedly, the guy refused
to go on a patrol.

258
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,937
Who knows if it's true?

259
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:11,939
Well, I know a guy…

260
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:16,493
who said an eyewitness told him
Speirs hosed those prisoners.

261
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:18,951
Why? What for?

262
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,580
On D-Day.

263
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:26,378
Speirs comes across these Kraut
prisoners digging a hole…

264
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,837
under guard and all.

265
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:32,673
He breaks out a pack of smokes,
passes them out.

266
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,680
He even gives them a light.

267
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:41,266
Then, all of a sudden,
he swings up his Thompson and:

268
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,896
He hoses them.

269
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,559
I mean, goddamn!

270
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:52,947
He gives them smokes first⁈

271
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:56,534
–That's why I don't think he did it.
–You don't?

272
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:57,941
I heard he didn't.

273
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,512
No, it was him, all right.

274
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,049
But it was more than eight.
More like 20.

275
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,972
Hell of a shot.

276
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:24,222
All except one guy,
who he left alone.

277
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:31,357
From what I heard, he took that last
105 on D-Day practically by himself.

278
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,818
–That I saw.
–On his own?

279
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:37,158
I don't care if any
of the other stuff's true.

280
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:41,276
–Grab your smokes and gear.
–What do you think?

281
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,033
I don't know.

282
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:46,541
Gonna take everybody's word.
I didn't see it.

283
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,839
Let's go! 1st Platoon! Weapons on me.
We're moving out.

284
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:55,135
On your feet! Tactical columns!
Flankers out!

285
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:57,296
Flanks up!

286
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,683
–That means you, Private Blithe.
–Come on, bud. Get up.

287
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:04,808
You want the bread?

288
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,990
Hey, Luz.
How far are we going?

289
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,293
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. I don't know.
Until they tell us to stop.

290
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,463
High ground. There's high ground
up ahead.

291
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:39,210
Okay, genius.
Answer me this then:

292
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:44,467
Why is Easy the only company who's
either at the front of an advance…

293
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,729
or, like now, exposed
at the edge of the line?

294
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:50,810
–To keep you on your toes.
–No.

295
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,523
We're never in the middle…

296
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:56,862
and we're the fifth of nine
of this regiment.

297
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:01,195
–Able through Item. Think of it.
–See there? You see that—

298
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,694
Incoming!

299
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,793
Contact right! Get in the hedgerow!

300
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:15,423
See what I mean⁈

301
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:19,921
Bring it around!

302
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:26,055
Right there!
Sergeant More! Stay low!

303
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,347
Luz, get down here with the radio!
Sergeant More! On me!

304
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,354
Go, go, go!

305
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:18,112
What have they got to sing about?

306
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:21,908
Flash!

307
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,702
Thunder.

308
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:27,571
Catchy tune, ain't it?

309
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:32,458
–Hey, lieutenant. What's the news?
–Same as it was this afternoon.

310
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:37,311
–They're in their hedge, we're in ours.
–Spell me a minute, sir?

311
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:40,304
You gonna let Blithe get some sleep?

312
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:43,548
–My back teeth are floating.
–Get back ASAP.

313
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,929
You can count on me, sir.

314
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:59,602
How you doing, Blithe?

315
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:01,773
I'm okay, sir.

316
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:05,408
What happened
at the aid station today?

317
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:12,036
Doc Roe, he called it
hysterical blindness.

318
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,746
No, thank you, sir.

319
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:22,130
You know what they said in basic:
Dehydration's a soldier's worst enemy.

320
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:23,846
Here.

321
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,853
It's a game, Blithe. That's all.
We're—

322
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:38,980
Hell, we're just moving the ball
forward one yard at a time.

323
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:41,692
Nothing but a game.

324
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,481
What is, sir?

325
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:50,286
This. The whole thing.

326
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,251
No. Thank you, sir.

327
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:56,917
Just a game.

328
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,168
Harry.

329
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:15,439
S2 said the Germans only left
a company to defend Carentan.

330
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:21,277
–The rest pulled out last night.
–I knew that town was too easy.

331
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:26,153
They regrouped south of town.

332
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:30,624
May have been going to a counterattack
when we ran into them here.

333
00:33:30,664 --> 00:33:32,822
Strength unknown.

334
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:38,209
They want the town back.

335
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:40,874
And we're in their way.

336
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:46,009
If they don't come before then,
we're attacking at first light, 0530.

337
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,718
I'll tell the men to fix bayonets.

338
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:53,055
Not much of a limp.

339
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:56,143
–I'll survive.
–How is it?

340
00:33:57,024 --> 00:33:58,732
Hurts.

341
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,562
War is hell.

342
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:21,164
Smith, wake up.

343
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:25,212
Come on, Smith. Get up.
It's your watch.

344
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,010
It's your watch.

345
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:30,306
Easy, Smith. It's me, Talbert!

346
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:34,096
What are you doing⁈
That's Talbert!

347
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,097
–I didn't—
–Goddamn!

348
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,684
–Gosh!
–Medic!

349
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:43,311
I didn't mean to.
He looked like a Kraut.

350
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,895
–Can you breathe?
–I can breathe.

351
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:48,317
–Look at me.
–Yeah, I can breathe!

352
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,450
You're gonna be fine.

353
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,586
What the hell is that?

354
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:09,420
Sounds like it's coming
from 3rd Platoon.

355
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:13,601
Don't you wanna get some sleep?

356
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:18,438
I don't think—
I don't think I can.

357
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,513
Then go take a look.

358
00:35:57,937 --> 00:36:01,353
–Flash.
–Thunder. Thunder!

359
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,975
Lieutenant Speirs, sir.

360
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:06,477
Where you going, private?

361
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:09,359
Check out the noise, sir.

362
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:13,067
I just came from there.
Everything's under control.

363
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:22,744
Got some nervous privates
in your company.

364
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:24,664
We do, sir.

365
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,591
Yeah, we do. I can vouch for that.

366
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:31,175
They just don't see how simple it is.

367
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,182
How simple what is, sir?

368
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:47,569
Just do what you have to do.

369
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,781
Like you did on D-Day, sir?

370
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,201
Lieutenant…

371
00:36:57,247 --> 00:37:03,997
Sir, when I landed on D-Day, I found
myself in a ditch all by myself.

372
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,962
I fell asleep.

373
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:14,425
I think it was the air-sickness pills
they gave us.

374
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:23,522
When I woke up, I didn't
really try to find my unit…

375
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,190
to fight.

376
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,568
I just—

377
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,616
I just kind of stayed put.

378
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,409
What's your name, trooper?

379
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,073
Blithe, sir. Albert Blithe.

380
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,498
You know why you hid in that ditch,
Blithe?

381
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,300
I was scared.

382
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:54,930
We were all scared.

383
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:02,722
You hid because you think
there's still hope. But, Blithe…

384
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:06,977
the only hope you have is to accept
that you're already dead.

385
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:13,487
The sooner you accept that, the sooner
you'll function as you're supposed to.

386
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:18,818
Without mercy. Without compassion.
Without remorse.

387
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,283
All war depends upon it.

388
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:42,428
Got any smokes? You want
some of this candy? No?

389
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:44,477
The outpost got ammo.

390
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:47,981
–Here you go.
–We don't know what they've got.

391
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:51,650
They may be a weaker force,
maybe more paratroopers.

392
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,905
–You know how they can be.
–Fire and maneuver.

393
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:57,787
That's the name of the game:
Fire and maneuver.

394
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:02,738
Dog and Fox companies will be on
our left flank with us. Any questions?

395
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,952
–Let's make them holler.
–It's 9:30 at night back home.

396
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,708
–Must be—
–Mortar!

397
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,417
–Incoming! Everybody in the hole!
–Take cover!

398
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,465
Down, down, down, down!

399
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,597
Get that OP in!

400
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,218
Tell them to hold.

401
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:26,514
All Easy stations.
Easy 6, hold in position.

402
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,854
Go! Lock and load!

403
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,024
–Easy Red 6!
–Medic!

404
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:41,360
I've got mortars across my line.
No infantry yet. I'm pulling the OP in.

405
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:45,573
Right stake plus 15. Charge three!

406
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,245
Range, 600.

407
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:50,333
Load! Fire!

408
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:54,255
Up and load! Fire!

409
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:01,092
–Come on!
–Come on! Move it! Hurry!

410
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:07,647
Watch for silhouettes on the horizon!

411
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,940
Find your target. Muzzle fire!

412
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:16,029
–Nail it! Keep low!
–Watch the horizon!

413
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,653
Keep low! Go! Go! Go!

414
00:40:19,326 --> 00:40:21,947
Perconte!

415
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,206
Get your men in order!
Stay low.

416
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:28,541
Pour it on them, Perconte!
To your left!

417
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,917
Keep going! Keep going!

418
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:32,713
Keep it up!

419
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:36,753
I want fire superiority!

420
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:41,139
Guarnere, keep them pinned down!
Keep firing!

421
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:46,179
Sergeants, reverse! Cover the crest
of that hill!

422
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,565
No!

423
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,112
No!

424
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:22,880
Where the hell did they come from?

425
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,393
Okay, pull back!

426
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:36,904
Holy shit! There goes our left flank!

427
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:40,239
–Sir, Dog and Fox are pulling back.
–What?

428
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,614
Who gave that order⁈

429
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,540
Keep firing! Stay low!

430
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:59,173
Stay low. Keep firing, Perconte!

431
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:04,804
Come on, Blithe. Stand up!

432
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,803
Get up on your feet, soldier.

433
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,769
Get up, Blithe.

434
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:14,849
That's right, Blithe. You can do it.

435
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:19,603
Fire your weapon, Blithe.

436
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:22,616
Hit those goddamn Germans, Blithe!

437
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:24,907
Rip it at them, Blithe!

438
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:39,917
Keep firing! Let them have it!

439
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:43,213
Keep firing! Don't slack it off!

440
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,381
Let them have it, Blithe!

441
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:50,227
Pour it on them, Blithe!

442
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:53,598
The left flank! Watch your left flank!

443
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:56,479
Fire!

444
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:00,273
Fire!

445
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:05,530
Krauts over there!
Keep the line of fire up here! Move it!

446
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,785
Blaze spray!

447
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:20,290
Let's go, McGrath! On me!
Shift your fire right!

448
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:25,968
Down! Down!

449
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,808
Get together!

450
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:40,025
Come on! You're gonna get me killed,
lieutenant.

451
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:45,485
I knew you'd get me killed!

452
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,032
–Wait until I tell you!
–I can't!

453
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,076
–Hold your fire!
–No, that's too close.

454
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,741
–Bitch! Son of a bitch!
–Too close!

455
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:10,892
Medic!

456
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:13,138
Come on!

457
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,556
Now fire, McGrath! Fire!

458
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:19,733
–Yeah!
–Yeah!

459
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,612
–Covering fire!
–Covering fire!

460
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:30,620
–Keep firing south!
–Fire!

461
00:44:30,788 --> 00:44:32,496
You hit a home run, huh?

462
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:38,546
–Smith, I've been hit!
–I got you!

463
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,124
Get me out of here!

464
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:47,251
Medic!

465
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,129
Randleman!

466
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,468
You okay?
Move it! Move it!

467
00:45:04,572 --> 00:45:06,826
–Rounds complete!
–Rounds complete!

468
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:10,449
–Skip! More ammo! Go! Go!
–I'm on my way!

469
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,656
Medic!

470
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,119
Medic!

471
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:30,963
Jesus, what was that?

472
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,013
Shermans!

473
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:39,931
Well, hello, 2nd Armored.

474
00:45:47,115 --> 00:45:49,487
That's right, you sorry asses! Run!

475
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:53,112
The cavalry! Come on in!
The tanks!

476
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,621
Oh, you beautiful babies, you!

477
00:46:00,879 --> 00:46:04,923
Let's go! Pour it on them!
Let them have it! Come on!

478
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:13,635
–Look! Shermans!
–About damn time.

479
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:31,070
Come on!

480
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:14,951
Come on.

481
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:18,614
Come on.

482
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:12,343
Hey, buddy.

483
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:15,049
Hey, buddy, you okay?

484
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:18,592
Looks like you fellas
had a heck of a fight.

485
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:39,451
Move forward on the right flank.

486
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:41,156
We need to know what's in there.

487
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:44,495
–I don't know who to send.
–Ask for volunteers.

488
00:50:45,124 --> 00:50:47,531
I hate asking for volunteers.

489
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,283
Then pick them.

490
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:54,664
Need to take a look at that farmhouse.
Who wants to go?

491
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:03,509
I'll go.

492
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:06,009
Anybody else?

493
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:10,898
Martin, Dukeman, you just volunteered.

494
00:51:12,276 --> 00:51:14,185
I'll be the lead.

495
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:17,481
Blithe's lead scout. Move out.

496
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:33,588
Harry, what exactly are you doing
with your reserve chute?

497
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:39,095
–You been hauling it since we jumped?
–Gonna send it to Kitty from England.

498
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:49,763
Silk. It'll make a good wedding dress,
what with rationing and all.

499
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,526
–I never would have guessed.
–What? That I'm so sentimental?

500
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:03,784
That you think we'll make it
back to England.

501
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,763
Okay.

502
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:35,189
Here we go again. Covering fire!
Covering fire!

503
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,985
Go! Go!

504
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,399
Come on!
Hang in there, Blithe.

505
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,326
Keep moving! Down!

506
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,372
–Medic up!
–Top window right!

507
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,824
Hang in there.

508
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,954
Medic! We need a medic down here!

509
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,673
Cease fire! Cease fire!

510
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:05,636
Take it easy, Blithe. Take it easy.
Come on, Duke. Come on.

511
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,097
Coming through. Give me room.

512
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,300
Get out of my way. I got it.

513
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,266
–What happened?
–Sniper.

514
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,975
All right, I got you. Nice and easy.

515
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,906
They're pulling us off the front line.

516
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,817
Now?

517
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,113
To a field camp north of Utah Beach.

518
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,825
Hot food and showers.

519
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,663
Then back to England.

520
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,261
–Where's medical supply?
–Third tent on the right.

521
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,196
Harry.

522
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:15,997
–How's the leg?
–Stiff. Sore.

523
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:20,711
–They want me to take it easy.
–Yeah, you should.

524
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,255
Talked to Colonel Sink.

525
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,180
Said he appreciated Easy
holding the line.

526
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,850
Said General Taylor was pleased.

527
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:40,068
That's why I came to France,
to please General Taylor.

528
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,439
Yeah.

529
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:55,843
In acknowledgment of the blood
shed serving your country…

530
00:54:56,002 --> 00:55:00,711
it is my honor to present you
with the Order of the Purple Heart.

531
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,632
Thank you, sir.

532
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,808
How many does that make?

533
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:21,765
Two? Three?

534
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:26,442
–You have no shame.
–Hey, I got one hole in my shoulder…

535
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,996
a second in my calf.
Then there's the boil on my shin.

536
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,609
And he only gets one.

537
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:03,440
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

538
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,022
This is great!

539
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:41,722
–She fancied me, Alton.
–In your dreams, buddy.

540
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:44,564
–Whoa! Jesus!
–Jesus!

541
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,538
It's good to be alive!

542
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:06,962
–Jesus Christ, that sure was close.
–Missed by a mile.

543
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:10,961
Hey, Bull, come over here.
Bull, come over here.

544
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:13,925
–I got a seat for you.
–Hey, Hoobler.

545
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,673
–Be quiet.
–“The Night of the Bayonet.”

546
00:57:16,894 --> 00:57:21,935
The night was filled with dark and cold
When Sgt Talbert, the story's told

547
00:57:22,024 --> 00:57:24,313
I don't like this.

548
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:26,857
Pulled on his poncho and headed out

549
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:30,279
To check the lines
Dressed like a Kraut

550
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:33,860
Why is everyone in such a hurry
to get back, huh?

551
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:35,827
We don't need you anymore.

552
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:40,749
Upon a trooper our hero came
Fast asleep, he called his name

553
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,080
“Smith, oh, Smith! Get up! It's time
To take your turn out on the line.”

554
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,591
–Do you know what he's talking about?
–The night of the bayonet.

555
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:56,018
–Whatever that is.
–But Smith, so very weary

556
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:58,596
Cracked an eye, all red and bleary

557
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:03,396
Grabbed his rifle, he did not tarry
Hearing Floyd, but seeing Jerry

558
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:07,065
–Oh, my God.
–Way to go, Smithy!

559
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,147
“It's me”, cried Tab, “Don't do it!”
And yet Smith charged, with bayonet

560
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:15,246
–He lunged, he thrust, high and low
–Come on!

561
00:58:15,286 --> 00:58:18,406
And skewered the boy from Kokomo

562
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,416
I'm heading back to barracks.

563
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:24,543
–You Heffron?
–Yeah.

564
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:27,204
–Where you from?
–Who's asking?

565
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:30,252
–You from Philadelphia?
–South Philly.

566
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:33,759
I could tell.

567
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,678
–Seventeenth Street.
–Yeah? Front Street.

568
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,058
Come here. Sit down.

569
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:44,640
–Know a guy named Johnny Waylon?
–Yeah, I know Johnny.

570
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:48,684
Since you didn't qualify
for a Purple Heart…

571
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:52,440
we've taken matters
into our own hands.

572
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:55,530
Tab, this is for you.

573
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,453
–A souvenir.
–That's right.

574
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,948
–Congratulations!
–I could have shot him a dozen times.

575
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:08,378
I just didn't think we could
spare a man.

576
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:19,256
Couple of announcements, men.

577
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,592
First— Listen up.

578
00:59:21,811 --> 00:59:27,482
First, the training exercise scheduled
for 2200 has been cancelled.

579
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,521
Secondly…

580
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:33,530
all passes are hereby revoked.

581
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:36,902
We're heading back to France,
so pack your gear.

582
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:40,411
We will not be returning
to England, boys.

583
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,827
Anyone who has not made out a will,
go to the supply office.

584
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:49,204
Trucks depart from Membury at 0700.

585
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:52,003
As you were.

586
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,472
Hello?

587
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,340
Hello?

588
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:06,316
Good morning, Mrs Lamb.
Sorry to be so early.

589
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:08,930
–That's all right, private…?
–Malarkey.

590
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:12,109
–Come in.
–Actually, it's Sgt Malarkey now.

591
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,651
–I just got promoted.
–Oh, lovely.

592
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:19,200
I expect you want your laundry.
I heard the trucks all night.

593
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:23,195
–The Yanks must be off again.
–For good this time.

594
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,038
I'm sorry to hear that.

595
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,294
Two shirts, two pairs of trousers.
Two Bob and tuppence, please.

596
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:35,754
I can't—

597
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,222
Thank you.

598
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:45,469
Would you like a cup of tea?
The water's boiling.

599
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:48,766
No. No, thank you.
I'm in a hell of a—

600
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:53,519
Bit of a hurry.
But thank you anyway.

601
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:57,107
–Oh, private?
–Yes, ma'am?

602
01:00:57,575 --> 01:01:00,659
Lieutenant Meehan's one of yours,
isn't he?

603
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:04,078
I hope he hasn't forgotten
his laundry.

604
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:13,210
–I'll take it.
–Thank you.

605
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:28,767
You couldn't be a dear and help me
with a few others, could you?

606
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,065
Uh, let's see.

607
01:01:31,442 --> 01:01:37,065
Sergeant Evans, Private Moya,
Blowzer…

608
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,110
Gray, Miller…

609
01:01:41,953 --> 01:01:43,530
Owen…

610
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:47,825
Collins, Elliot…

611
01:01:48,626 --> 01:01:50,204
Blithe.

612
09:00:00,000 --> 09:00:01,000
⬄24000÷1001⬄

612
09:00:02,305 --> 09:01:02,568

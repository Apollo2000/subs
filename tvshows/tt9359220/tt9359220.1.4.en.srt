The more you help us,
the better it's going to be.

637
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,800
I started by dealing a bit of weed
to my friends.

638
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,440
Just to get some cash to buy clothes,
go out, pay for tattoos.

639
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,120
Hugo, too?

640
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,000
No. Too shit scared of his dad.

641
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,480
But we were always together.

642
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
So...

643
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,000
- weed turned into other things.
- Uh-huh.

644
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,000
Nothing hard,
just party vibes, you know?

645
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,320
Then one time a friend suggests

646
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,520
I supply these parties in the woods
outside the city.

647
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Exclusive, invite-only kind of thing.

648
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,160
Full of minted people.

649
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,280
You figured you'd make a fortune.

650
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
So what went wrong?

651
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,800
I ticked a load up front. We ended up
smashing half the drugs ourselves.

652
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,200
And the rest we gave away to girls.

653
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,720
A lot of hot girls there.

654
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,800
And you're left with no money or drugs.

655
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,680
And a dead best friend.

656
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,840
You think these drug dealers murdered Hugo
as a warning to make you pay up?

657
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
That is quite a stretch, Isak.

658
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,280
I know it was them. 'Cause they killed
my other friend in the same way.

659
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
What?

660
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
My dog.

661
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,680
Someone killed your dog?

662
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,240
At one of these parties.

663
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,240
I lost Doobie and went back
to search the next morning.

664
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,680
Found what was left of him
a couple of miles away.

665
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,440
Why take your dog to a party?

666
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,120
Protection... I took him everywhere.

667
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,280
Wh-Why do you think
it's the same people who murdered Hugo?

668
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,440
'Cause they did it with a grenade.

669
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,080
- Did you report this?
- I was shit scared.

670
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I'm sorry.

671
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,160
Who was hosting these parties?

672
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,760
A rich guy called Gustav Munck.

673
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,680
[KURT] Gustav Munck?

674
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,120
- [ISAK] You heard of him?
- Rings a bell.

675
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320

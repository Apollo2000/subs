Detective Kurt Wallander.

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm looking for Tomas Von Rosen.

630

Well, you've found him.
Uh, what can I do for you, Detective?

631
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,440
Talk to me about something that happened
a long time ago, at boarding school.

Oh... That?

- Well, it was nothing.
- That's not what your medical report says.

[CHUCKLES]

I take it
you didn't go to boarding school?

It's hard for outsiders to understand,

- but...
- [DOOR CHIMES]

...this kind of thing happened a lot.
Excuse me.

[KURT] Wh-Wh-What kind of thing?

640
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,200
There's a hierarchy.

641
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,560
Older boys, uh...

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,440
play pranks on the younger ones.

643
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,840
This was no prank.

644
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,720
This was torture.

645
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm sorry, I can't talk about it.

646
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Why?

647
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,880
Were you made to sign something?

648
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,320
I'll be right there.

649
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,200
Because I don't want to.

650
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,320
Now please, leave me alone.

651
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,440
We're in the middle of an investigation,

652
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,840
and what you know
could make the difference.

653
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,560
So, please... I understand it's...

654
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,560
difficult to talk about

655
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,160
and painful to go back there.

656
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,200
Yes... it is...

657
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,400
when you've spent a lifetime
trying to forget.

658

[KURT] You have a choice.
You can save lives.

More people are suffering like you did.

660
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Fine.

661
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Um...

662
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,280
At the beginning, it's the usual stuff.

663
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Put a pillow over my head,
beat the shit out of me.

You know, while you're suffocating.

665
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,720
They stripped me naked...

666
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,520
tied me to a chair with these...

667
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
thick ropes...

668
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,880
took turns kicking me.

669
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,160
Then they got bored and left.

670
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,480
All except one.

671
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
He had a crowbar...

672
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
and...

673
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,200
he said he wanted to see
how far he could go...

674
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,280
without... me dying.

675

[VOICE QUAVERING]
And, when I couldn't take it anymore...

676
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
he just sat there.

677
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,720
He just sat there...

678
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,360
and watched me...

679
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
suffer.

680
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,120
And this person was Gustav Munck?

681
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
No...

682
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,800
not Gustav.

By all rights,

I should've dominated
live competition,

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,060

or me, or if I didn't like
the way he carried himself...

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,209
If I decided for whatever reason
that he wasn't worthy,

58
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,180
a dark rage would come over me.

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,189
And this rage became the driver.

60
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,149
All the strategy, patience,
and practice would vanish,

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,219
and I would begin obsessing
about total destruction.

62
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,999
Some kid could fail
to look me in the eye

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,170
Some kid could fail
to look me in the eye

64
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:03,069
while shaking my hand
at a tournament in the fall,

65
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,059
and I would carry it until
facing him again in the spring.

66
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,140
But then, while I was trying
to destroy him...

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,220
I'd forget to win.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,229
I would play bold moves
designed to intimidate,

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,109
show him that he wasn't
as smart as me... or as brave.

70
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,019
Leave voids in my defense.

71
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,149

at the end of the game,

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,199
my opponent's arm
would be raised in victory

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,179
while I sat,

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,119

that he would never live
to testify to

89

or confirm in court.

90

Are Walter and the kids

Nobody's gonna starve,

finally accepted who I am,

It was tough on both of you.

Yeah, so I kind of just
gave her everything.

Didn't shelter it
or put it in a trust.

190

Didn't shelter it
or put it in a trust.

191
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,019
Just sort of heaved it

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,999
Practically started

- It sure is.

195
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,179
The guy she remarried...

196
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,089
He's got control

what he's gonna do with it.

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,149
Yeah.

200
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,149
What were you hoping to get to?

201
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,099
I-I don't have a number.

202

I just want them
to be taken care of.

203

- Yeah.

207
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,219
Thought I was going to take care
of that in the next 10 years.

210
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,169
- For all the family?
- Big ladder.

211
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,219
But there's a way
to make it happen.

212
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,229
To guarantee it.

213
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,110

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,059

It'll require deception.

And your final weeks and months,
they won't be your own.

220
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,189
Are we talking about
breaking the law?

221
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,079
Because I-I can't spend
one minute in jail.

222

it best that my office

from here forward.

You know, the only thing
I can't figure

234
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,049
is if the AG's fear
of negative publicity

235
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,109
is because she's planning
a Senate run

236
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,129
or a return
to the private sector.

to take a recommendation.

244
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,039
I know.

245
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,039
And I would do the same thing
were I sitting in her office.

the place they signed on to,

that their deals should be void.

They can't win, right?

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,079
Not likely. But with the current

No, but we can't have
the perception

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,199
that the real talent
at Axe Capital

I'm not putting

you that this lonosphere venture
is doomed.

Check, sir.

317
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,069
It is the love
God has instilled in us

318
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,029
that has been our refuge,

319

that has sustained us

322
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,999
- there was love.

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,199
And it is love that turns us
back to dust,

324
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,999
saying, "Go back,
oh, child of earth."

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,170
saying, "Go back,
oh, child of earth."

326
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:35,039
It is love that sweeps us away
like a dream.

327
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,209
<i>Your honor, our argument is</i>

328
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,179
simple and straightforward.

329
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,139
My client provided
emergency medical care

330
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,019
to Christina Grunwald.

331
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,029
Mr. Stearn met
the young lady's father,

332
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,199
learned of her desperate
medical condition,

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,179
had the resources at
his disposal to save her life,

334
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,069
and was moved to action.

335
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,159
I ask, uh, you to

336
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,999
look at this photograph

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,010
look at this photograph

338
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,079
and tell me that,

339
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,099
if you were in a position
to save this child's life...

<i>♪ serious music ♪</i>

341
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,189
wouldn't you do it
just because you could?

342
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,029
Mr. Stearn had no idea

343
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,059
that medical treatment
had any link

344
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,130
to alleged inside information.

345
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:23,029
I ask you to consider the wisdom
of putting altruism itself

346
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,999
on trial.

347
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,229
May I?

348
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,179
- Mr. Connerty.

349
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,000
The people are
fully prepared to prove

350
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,159
The people are
fully prepared to prove

351
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,019
benefit was provided
in the form of medical expenses

352
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,079
to the tune
of some 211,000 dollars.

353
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,039
And that, as a direct response
to insider information

354
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,089
provided to Mr. Stearn.

355
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,069
Further, we can demonstrate

356
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,029
that Axe Capital
used this information

357
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,219
to gain
an 89 million dollar profit.

358
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,200
An 89 million dollar return.

359
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,119
On a 211,000 dollar...

360
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,000
- investment.

361
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,040
- Investment.

362
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,229
Altruism is not on trial here,

363
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,180
but the fairness of
the financial markets is.

364
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,199
The US Attorney's office has
made a considered decision

365
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,169
to pursue and prosecute

366
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,179
precisely this new brand
of criminal.

367
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,129
They are bastardizing
the fair market

368
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,129
upon which this country
is built.

369
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,000
Passionately executed,
Mr. Connerty,

370
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,069
Passionately executed,
Mr. Connerty,

371
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,179
but the humane gesture of
providing medical treatment

372
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,049
for an afflicted child
as material benefit,

373
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,099
begs that a jury learn
the unknowable...

374
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,149
That is, what lay
in Mr. Stearn's heart.

375
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,009
I deem it best
that the court grants

376
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,009
defense counsel's motion
for dismissal.

377
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,189
Your honor,
I vigorously protest.

378
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,229
Nonetheless, my decision stands.

379
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,209
And I further advise that
you and the <i>Southern District</i>

380
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,999
reconsider the deployment
of government assets

381
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,029
reconsider the deployment
of government assets

382
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,119
in the settling
of personal scores.

383
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,010
This session is adjourned.

384
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,069
<i>He said "personal scores"?</i>

385
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,199
He used those words?

386
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,199
- Direct quote.

387
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,129
Motherfucker.

388
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,159
How goddamn comfortable
in your seat do you have to be

389
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,999
to do that?

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
To do that?

391
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,079
Should we start clearing
the Axelrod files or...

392
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,149
Tomorrow.

393
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,219
What you need to do now
is take the day, at least.

394
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,229
- Come back ready to go.
- I can hang in here...

395
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,199
Go!

396
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,049
Breathe in some fall air.

397
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,999
I'd like to imagine someone
is doing that today.

398
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,089
Might as well be you.

399
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,019
I bet Dollar Bill
is doing exactly that

400
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,140
with a giant fucking smile
on his face.

401
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you gonna do?

402
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,079
What are you gonna do?

403
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,049
Well, we've lost the Axe case.

404
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,189
Wilcox cut
the Dollar Bill thread.

405
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,230
We need to get circular
with our thinking.

406
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,030
Turn the impediments
into our own blockers.

407
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,060
Don't worry.
I know what I'm talking about.

408
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,209
He wanted to see me?

409
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,219
He did, but not right now.

410
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,999
This about those
Ionosphere traitors?

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,149
This about those
Ionosphere traitors?

412
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,199
Quislings?

413
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,049
Don't answer that.

414
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,209
So, Deb...

415
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,059
Don't.

416
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,099
I make stupid money,

417
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,999
and I'm ready
for a relationship.

418
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,199
I make plenty,
and I'm out of your league.

419
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,119
You're right.

420
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,019
Guys around here avoid you like
you're a dangerous fighter,

421
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,139
because you're
a triple threat...

422
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,079
Power, speed, <i>and</i> footwork.

423
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,069
So give me some credit
for stepping up.

424
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,080
Credit for the honesty.

425
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,169
If you have dinner with me,
I'll buy you a Mini Cooper.

426
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, see?

427
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,209
Oh, see?

428
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,049
See? You smiled.

429
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,079
And you know and I know
that a smile

430
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,199
is a gateway to
multiple convulsive orgasms.

431
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,209
I smiled because I'm too long
for a Mini,

432
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,019

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,119
And now let us take a moment

482
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,069
to appreciate
the beauty of nature,

483
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,150
which Donnie loved so well.

484
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,129
- Amen.
- Amen.

485
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,089
And now,
according to Donnie's wishes,

486
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,000
we drink and have a good time.

487
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,069
We drink and have a good time.

488
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,000
Walter.

489
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,019
Donnie said,
and I'm quoting here,

490
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,209
"Have them all bury my picture
in autumn leaves,

491
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,069
and as they do,

492
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,039
they should make a wish
for the world...

493
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,020
That has nothing to do
with the financial markets."

494

<i>♪ acoustic guitar

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
<i>♪ acoustic guitar

496
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,119
The paint was about
eight layers thick and hard,

497
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,999
but I scratched it.

498
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,069
And beneath the layers?

499
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,079
Wilcox.
Greasy muck on his shoes.

500
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,129
Talk to me.

501
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,079
Well, I looked at
his sentencing history,

502
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,000
and about seven years ago,

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,130
and about seven years ago,

504
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:32,169
there's a significant
pattern shift.

505
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,219
Suddenly, he becomes

506
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,109
the toughest hanging judge
on the federal bench,

507
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,109
but not on white collar crime.

508
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,059
- Oh, no?
- No, not on white of any kind.

509
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,049
He lets the white guys skate

510
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,079
if he thinks you have access
to lawyers or press

511
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,159
or other noisemakers.

512
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,129
But poor Black and Latino
boys from the hood

513
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,089
get slapped
with all kinds of time.

514
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,039
Uh-huh. Now is that racism,
or is there money somewhere?

515
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,109
Well, I did a deep dive
on his financial history,

516
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,159
and seven years ago,
he joined an investment group.

517
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,999
One of their holdings...
Baldinger Prison Systems,

518
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,169
One of their holdings...
Baldinger Prison Systems,

519
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,199
a privatized
for-profit prison company.

520
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,100
They charge inmates a dollar
a minute to use the phone...

521
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,049
And then soak the government
with a 300% markup.

522
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,039
They net 17,000 dollars a year
per prisoner.

523
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,049
Wilcox is building his business
from the bench.

524
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,119
Exactly.

525
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
And he's doing it
to poor kids...

526
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:22,059
with public defenders

527
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,179
who are far less likely
to file an appeal

528
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,999
and far less able to win one.

529
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,169
Jesus Christ.

530
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,079
Where is the money going?

531
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,000
It bounces into the Caymans,
but it winds up in Dominican,

532
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,209
It bounces into the Caymans,
but it winds up in Dominican,

533
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,070
where he has a condo.

534
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,149
This is great work.

535
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,099
And he's fucking
his Dominican housekeeper.

536
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,069
- I'm gonna get you back

537
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,019
from Eastern and make you happy.

538
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
- I'd like to be happy.

539
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,099
Fuck. Really?

540
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,039
Pretty grown-up, huh?

541
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,000
If I live to a hundred,
I wouldn't be this grown-up.

542
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,999
You want anything?

543
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,149
You want anything?

544
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,090
I'm fine. Thanks.

545
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,149
This isn't from Ikea, is it?

546
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,229
No.

547
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,999
But it works the same way.

548
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,040
But it works the same way.

Dad. What are
you doing here?

559
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,099
I was going through some things,

560
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,139
and I came across this.

561
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,039
It's your Indian Head penny
collection.

562
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,099
Thought you might
get a kick out of it.

563
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,000
You came all the way out
to Brooklyn to give me

564
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,119
You came all the way out
to Brooklyn to give me

565
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,229
my penny collection?

566
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,099
No, I'm meeting Perry
and Richie at Luger's later.

567
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,190
I thought, as long as
I'm over here...

568
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,189
Oh, fuck it.

569
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,219
This isn't the year that
I start choosing my words

570
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,189
to avoid offense.

571
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,169
- Just when I got my hopes up.

572
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,179
Okay, you want delicate?
How about this?

573
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,089
Perhaps it's time to be
more careful

574
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,189
about how you process and react.

575
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,110
- It's a critical time.

576
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,059
And here's
the less delicate way...

577
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,100
Stop... fucking... up!

578
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,029
Insightful.

579
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,189
This must be how Ali felt

580
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,229
when Angelo Dundee
whispered in his ear.

581
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,060
Do you know what the press
is saying about you?

582
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,229
Didn't bother checking.
I have a general idea.

583
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,049
Well, they are clubbing you
like a baby seal.

584
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,179
It's time that you got out
in front of this.

585
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,049
You are a target

586
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,109
for the Attorney General now.

587
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,000
Maybe it's time
you got out of there...

588
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,149
Maybe it's time
you got out of there...

589
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,109
before you get fired.

590
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,079
And do what? Hmm?

591
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,000
Go over to Horvath?

592
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,069
Maybe I get
on my hands and knees

593
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,169
and crawl up to Westport,
drum up some business

594
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,999
defending Bobby Axelrod
or his friends. Huh?

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,159
I didn't show up here
with just my rod in my hand.

596
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,119
No. You brought coins.

597
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,109
And I have an idea.

598
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,119
Go ahead.

599
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,199
Take a year off.

600
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,999
Move the family up to the farm.

601
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,229
Move the family up to the farm.

602
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,079
Mount Kisco?

603
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,039
It's beautiful.

604
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,149
Wendy can open a practice.

605
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,159
God knows there are plenty
of bored housewives

606
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,119
that could use her help.

607
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,229
And you write a book.

608
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,229
In no time,

609
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,079
you will have established
residency.

610
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,089
Ahh.

611
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,029
Patrick Esposito's
congressional seat.

612
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,169
Oh.

613
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,999
- Patrick is tired.

614
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,150
- Patrick is tired.

615
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,229
I talked to him.

616
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,020
He'll step aside.
You'll be a shoo-in.

617
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,029
Congress.

618
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:13,119
Boy, that sounds like fun...
535 stooges and blowhards,

619
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,029
some of whom even believe
in science.

620
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,060
Well, you'll stand out.

621
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,209
You know, if you had listened
to me in the first place

622
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,219
and <i>hadn't</i> blown up
the deal with Axelrod,

623
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,080
we would not be in this spot,
would we?

624
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,169
"We"?

625
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,229
We?

626
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,209
No. You don't get
to do that.

627
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,169
Not anymore.

628
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,139
Let me be delicate now.

629
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,069
The game has changed, and you
haven't changed with it.

630
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,009
Your advice
is no longer welcome.

631
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,069
So the next time
you wanna waltz in here

632
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,209
with your "I told you so"
routine,

633
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,120
do us both a favor
and stay the fuck out.

634
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,229
Four million dollar rip on DKA,
up 2% in our first week.

635
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,039
There are tips,
and there are tips.

636
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,229
You plan on
telling us where you got it?

637
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,149
You'll hear the next one
yourself.

638
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,999
He's here.

639
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,070
He's here.

640
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:32,209
Dollar Bill,
Mr. Hundred Cent.

641
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,149
Billy Buck Buck, motherfucker!

642
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,189
I should've known.

643
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,009
Everyone's been talking about
your brawl with Axe.

644
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,229
Fucking prick.

645
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,029
I keep my mouth shut,
risk doing time for him,

646
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,310
and then he treats me like that.

647
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,189
Look at this.

648
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,139
Little shop that could.

649
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,089
And from the acorn
grew the mighty oak.

650
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,999
No doubt,
all-star team like this.

651
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,010
No doubt,
all-star team like this.

652
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,000
Could always use one more.

653
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Champagne?

654
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,010
I'll take
one of those Heinekens.

655
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,159
- What do you say?

656
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,039
We can talk after
the first of the year.

657
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,120
I am contractually owed a bonus.

658
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,109
Meantime, want some more candy?

659
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,179
Yeah.

660
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,000
You know how Penn Consol's been
rising on takeover rumors?

661
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,159
You know how Penn Consol's been
rising on takeover rumors?

662
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,059
I've been watching that.

663
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,039
Behind the scenes?
There's a bidding war.

664
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,119
It is fucking on.

665
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,009
Sure?

666
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,200
I am not uncertain.

667
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,209
- Come on in, Chuck. Sit down.

668
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,050
I can deliver this on my feet.

669
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,099
Know that
if this "urgent meeting"

670
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,999
is to slam me for my ruling
on the William Stearn case,

671
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,040
is to slam me for my ruling
on the William Stearn case,

672
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,219
you should proceed to
the other side of that door

673
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,209
and tell it to the doorknob.

674
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,209
Whit, that's a closed case.

675
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,039
Forget "Dollar" Bill Stearn.

676
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,099
No, this is about
Daquan Forrester.

677
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,149
You remember Daquan, the first
offender kid dealing pot

678
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,189
he bought in New Jersey
his senior year of high school

679
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,029
that you slapped with 15 years?

680
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,199
What about him?

681
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,149
It's about Julio Lopez.

682
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,109
Remember him, too?

683
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,169
11 years for credit card fraud

684
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,999
because he bought a PlayStation?

685
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,040
Because he bought a PlayStation?

686
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,149
<i>♪ Tense music ♪</i>

687
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,159
This won't do anyone any good.

688
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,089
Some of those are your cases,
your office.

689
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,079
How did I miss it for so long?

690
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,129
You know,
all those middle class types

691
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,049
walking out
of your courtroom free.

692
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,059
All those Black and Latino kids
going upstate for 20 years.

693
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,019
I am no racist.

694
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,009
Oh, no.
That's selling you short.

695
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,020
You're worse...
A racist and a profiteer.

696
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,129
You want proof? Wait for it.

697
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,999
Baldinger Prison Systems.

698
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,170
Baldinger Prison Systems.

699
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,099
There's no way
to reopen those cases.

700
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,029
I can draw a straight line
to you and your partners,

701
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,069
your offshore bank account,

702
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,999
and even your little
girlfriend, Maribel Solarte,

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,139
at your condo in Punta Cana.

704
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,149
Theories and accusations.

705
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,109
After I've spent a lifetime
on the bench,

706
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,189
until I got splinters
in my ass and all for...

707
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,039
a civil servant's wages.

708
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,999
We both know they're not
just accusations, Your Honor.

709
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,120
We both know they're not
just accusations, Your Honor.

710
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,079
What do you want?

711
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,159
You will resign immediately

712
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,180
for undisclosed
personal reasons.

713
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,129
And there will be a little party
and tearful goodbyes,

714
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,039
and you will stride off
into private practice.

715
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,199
Or the FBI could come in here

716
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
and give you
a far different reception.

717
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,999
You... won't prosecute?

718
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,059
You... won't prosecute?

719
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,179
No. You do it that way,

720
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,129
and the Southern District
declines to prosecute.

721
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,089
Because if we did, you would dig

722
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:13,039
those badger teeth and claws
of yours in and fight.

723
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,169
It would take two years,
and you would go to jail,

724
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,159
but the Southern District
believes

725
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,229
that your swift departure would
be best for the justice system.

726
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,100
Oh...

727
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,230
And shame on you.

728
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,129
Hi.

729
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,119
Hi.

730
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,010
How you holding up?

731
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,090
Funeral arrangements
were a welcome distraction.

732
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,130
I brought a casserole,
just like it was the '50s.

733
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,019
This Secret Santa project
looks overwhelming.

734
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,029
- Do you need a hand?

735
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,059
Help is literally on the way.

736
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,049
Lara's taking over
the whole operation.

737
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,179
Oh. So good of her.

738
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,009
She's been great.

739
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,140
Both of them, really great.

740
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,999
You're in
a... complicated position.

741
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,129
You're in
a... complicated position.

742
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,219
Yeah.

743
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,029
It was... hard on Donnie,

744
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,069
not being able to tell you.

745
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,179
- What do you mean?

746
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,109
I just mean his privacy,
you know.

747
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,069
It meant a lot to him.

748
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,139
Did other people know?

749
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,019
Hey.

750
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,039
Hey.

751
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,200
I've got a big truck outside.

752
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,000
- Oh, do you need me to move?
- If you wouldn't mind.

753
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,149
- Oh, do you need me to move?
- If you wouldn't mind.

754
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,229
It's so good of you to take over
the Secret Santa thing.

755
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,189
Yeah. We were pretty close.

756
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,069
And closer in troubled times.

757
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,219
That's the true test
of friendship.

758
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,209
Yes, it is.

759
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,230
What are you doing here?

760
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,059
I'm saying hi to Walter,

761
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,229
seeing if he needed anything.

762
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,090
He's taken care of.

763
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,999
I see. Well, I figure,
at a time like this,

764
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,070
I see. Well, I figure,
at a time like this,

765
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:32,149
the more the merrier.

766
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,139
At a time like this,
a family pulls together.

767
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,139
That's what Axe Capital is...
A family.

768
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,079
One I'm part of, too.

769
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,109
Of course you are.

770
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,170
We're fine.

771
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,120

00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,149
Hey.

808
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,159
Christmas coming
a little early this year?

809
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,139
This is Donnie's
Secret Santa project.

810
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,179
I took it on.

811
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,029
- We're elves.
- Slave elves.

812
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,159
Gordie.

813
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,059
Pretty big job here, boys.
You want some help?

814
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,000
What are you doing?

815
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,170
What are you doing?

816
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,029
I'll get a half a dozen interns
from the office.

817
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,039
They'll knock this off in
no time. They're Ivy Leaguers.

818
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,149
- Yes.
- Conference.

819
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,139
You two keep wrapping.
Remember, there are

820
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,059
more presents in the other room.

821
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,109
This is one of those
teachable moments

822
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,149
that we talked about.

823
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,129
The idea is that we do something
with our own hands

824
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,149
to benefit the less fortunate,
as a family.

825
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,110
Is this a teachable moment
for me or for the kids?

826
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,069
All right, I'll wrap.

827
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,999
And, Bobby...

828
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,040
And, Bobby...

829
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,999
I ran into Wendy
at Walter's today.

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,079
And?

831
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,059
She was probing Walter
for information.

832
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,999
Is that right?

833
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,119
It made be wonder about
her continuing value.

834
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,999
We're vulnerable,
and so are they.

835
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,150
I trust her.

836
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,999
- Mmm.

837
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,179
Thank you.

838
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,219
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

839
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,099
- Mmm.
- You didn't have to come.

840
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,139
Oh, of course I did.

841
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,999
Wouldn't be seemly otherwise.

842
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,120
Wouldn't be seemly otherwise.

843
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:03,089
Boy, you know what I love
about this cake?

844
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,069
- What?
- Sour cream.

845
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,089
It's just like my grandmother
used to make.

846
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,049
Gives it a little... tang.

847
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,169
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

848
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,209
You like a little tang
every so often, don't you, Whit?

849
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,049
- Sure, Chuck.
- Yeah.

850
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,089
It's a really nice crowd.

851
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,119
I think I'll say a few words.

852
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,009
No, that won't be necessary.

853
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,999
I love to speak.

854
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,129
- Uh...

855
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,119
- Ladies and gentlemen?

856
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,000
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment?

857
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:33,189
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment?

858
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,019
Thank you.

859
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,019
Hmm.

860
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,139
Justice.

861
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,069
Rooted in truth,
watered by tenacity,

862
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,209
and flowering in wisdom.

863
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,180
May be the single most beautiful
expression of humanity.

864
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:59,059
For a man to dedicate his life
in its pursuit

865
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,000
rings of a certain nobility.

866
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:03,999
Rings of a certain nobility.

867
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,189
And this day we gather
to acknowledge that nobility

868
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:13,139
in the Honorable Whit Wilcox.

869
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,049
Devoted servant of justice

870
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,019
and one of its most

871
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,110
industrious sentinels.

872
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,039
- Congratulations, Judge Wilcox.

873
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,000
And thank you
for your noble service.

874
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,099
And thank you
for your noble service.

Hello, Judge.

881
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,129
You're going to jail.

882
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,230
You may even own it.

883
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,999
You're a <i>fucking</i> liar.

884
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,200
You're a <i>fucking</i> liar.

885
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:02,999
I said the <i>Southern</i> District
wouldn't prosecute.

886
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,189
I can't speak for Eastern.

887
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,119
- You'll be coming with us.

888
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,209
You have the right
to remain silent.

889
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,069
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

890
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,159
in a court of law.

891
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,149
Twenty-eight percent
of our goddamn fund

892
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,189
by the time we dug ourselves

893
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,029
- out of the position.

894
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,009
Was there ever even a real
takeover being considered?

895
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,040
Who cares? It's over.

896
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,080
How are we gonna explain
this to our investors?

897
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,000
Nice space.

898
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,149
Nice space.

899
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,099
Edgy.

900
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,080
Mind if I take a seat?

901
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,199
Going forward,
you might want to consider

902
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,999
vetting your information
a little better.

903
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,160
Lesson learned.

904
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,059
I could take pleasure

905
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,129
in watching you three
circle the drain,

906
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,149
but I am a practical man.

907
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,099
And there was a reason that
I hired and trained all of you

908
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,009
in the first place.

909
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,000
So... here's what
I'm prepared to do.

910
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:03,129
So... here's what
I'm prepared to do.

911
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,169
I will seed lonosphere...

912
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,159
Stupid fucking name,
by the way...

913
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,079
With 250 million dollars.

914
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,199
That should keep the lights on.

915
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,089
You'll be required to sign

916
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,189
non-compete
and non-solicitation agreements.

917
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,159
We will enter into
a revenue share agreement.

918
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,009
The current rate for seed money
is 20 to 25%,

919
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,089
- so why don't we call it 40?
- 40?

920
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,999
Swallow that and wash it down
with this.

921
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,169
Swallow that and wash it down
with this.

922
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,029
You will provide
total transparency.

923
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,109
I want your trade files
sent to my office every night.

924
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,229
There will be a limit

925
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,079
on how much outside capital
you can raise.

926
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,180
At no time can you manage
more than 999 million dollars.

927
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,179
There will be no buy-out
to eliminate

928
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,139
the revenue share agreement

929
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,079
and no lock-up on my money.

930
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,099
I can pull the plug at any time.

931
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,999
That's the deal.
No negotiation.

932
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,060
That's the deal.
No negotiation.

933
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:04,229
I'm counting to five,
and then it's off the table.

934
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,060
- One...
- We'll do it.

935
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,169
<i>♪ Pensive music ♪</i>

936
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,180
Wise.

937
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,110
And I'd better see you
at the funeral.

938
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,159
I, uh, I don't go to funerals.

939
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,169
I can't bring myself to.
I-I skip 'em.

940
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,079
I send mountains of flowers
and food to the wake,

941
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,999
convince myself
that's the right thing to do.

942
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,160
Convince myself
that's the right thing to do.

943
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,229
If I were asked why, I'd say,

944
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,029
"Well, we wanna remember him
how he was,"

945
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:10,089
or some other bullshit.

946
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,049
Truth?

947
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,039
I like to keep moving so I don't
have to think about it.

948
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,219
More truth?

949
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,089
I'm not the type to grapple
with it all.

950
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:22,089
But...

951
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,130
There was no way that
I was gonna skip this one.

952
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,999
Because Donnie...

953
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,109
Because Donnie...

954
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,999
grappled with all of it.

955
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,099
He was courage.

956
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,190
And... hope.

957
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,999
And his intelligence
and his kindness

958
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,179
made me wanna be
all those things, too.

959
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,190
As it did all of you.

960
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,020
I am so angry that he's gone.

961
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,009
So glad that while he was here,

962
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,060
I was one of the lucky few
who knew him.

963
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,070
I admired Donnie Caan.

964
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,150
And I am proud to have
called him a friend.

965
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,999
Let's do this. Donnie.

966
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,159
Let's do this. Donnie.

967
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,140
To Donnie.

968
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,129
<i>Why you working from home today?</i>

969
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,129
I went to a funeral
and got kicked out...

970
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:46,020
by my wife.

971
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,220
I needed the quiet.

972
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,179
The Judge Wilcox arrest...

973
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,129
Mm-hmm?

974
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,170
- Slick move.
- Mm.

975
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That wasn't it. It was
just the opener, right?

976
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:03,070
That wasn't it. It was
just the opener, right?

977
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,069
You got rid of an impediment,
but that's not enough.

978
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,219
You're putting in
your own blocker.

979
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,999
You wanna put someone
in that seat...

980
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,029
Someone who'll owe you,
not someone who's compromised.

981
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,030
Just a more... willing ear.

982
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,159
The person
needs to be qualified.

983
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,229
He or she needs to check out

984
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,130
gold stars across the board.

985
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,109
It's a Senate appointment,
the Judiciary committee,

986
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:37,059
so it won't be immediate,
but it won't be long either.

987
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,059
Yeah, you're almost there.

988
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,170
Hmm.

989
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,050
Adam DeGiulio?

990
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,059
And then he's out of your way
at the AG's office, too.

991
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,209
And maybe he leaves a friendly
behind in his place.

992
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,119
Wow.

993
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,139
Don't get too excited
by how good it sounds.

994
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,000
Everything's gotta fall
<i>just</i> right.

995
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,999
Everything's gotta fall
<i>just</i> right.

996
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,069
And the odds
of that happening...

997
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,029
Still, you're playing
the game again. Clear-eyed.

998
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,159
Oh, that I am.

999
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,069
Drink?

1000
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:15,070
No. I'll... I'll keep mine
clear, too.

1001
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,129
You all right?

1002
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,029
Sad.

1003
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,109
Yeah. Good guy.

1004
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,219
One of the few people at work
who were remotely interesting.

1005
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,140
Tell me about it.

1006
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,030
And... he was our gay guy.

1007
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,169
That make a difference?

1008
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,139
Yeah.

1009
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,090
These days,
it's great to have a gay.

1010
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,130
You are a complete
goddamn animal.

1011
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,230
I ruined his life.

1012
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,219
Say again?

1013
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,999
Donnie.

1014
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,219
I was able to patch him up,

1015
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,119
keep him in a game
that made him miserable.

1016
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,079
If I just...

1017
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,999
let him fail, get fired,
he would've been better off.

1018
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,150
Let him fail, get fired,
he would've been better off.

1019
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:32,069
He could've made the life
he wanted.

1020
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,179
That's kind of a stretch, Wendy.

1021
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,059
Oh, he would've been
so much happier

1022
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,059
if he'd returned to academia.

1023
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,149
Give me a break.

1024
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,059
College professors are broke
as fuck and bitter, too.

1025
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,019
They certainly don't leave
40 mil to their families

1026
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,129
when they knock off.

1027
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,059
Now, what...

1028
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,009
is <i>really</i> going on,
Dr. Rhoades?

1029
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,100
Is it a little case
of projection?

1030
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,999
Donnie walked with 40?

1031
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,169
Donnie walked with 40?

1032
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,079
Hyperbole.

1033
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,070
Just making my point.

1034
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,049
Right.

1035
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,229
Worst part of my job,
I'll tell you that.

1036
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:16,169
- Ari.
- Hey, Bobby.

1037
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:20,039
Thank you, Dr. Gilbert,
for the excellent care,

1038
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,030
for trying so hard.

1039
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,200
Walter, we're gonna take off.

1040
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,229
A messenger's
gonna stop by tomorrow.

1041
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,199
You'll have all the info.

1042
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,159
Any problems,
you have the number, right?

1043
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,169
Yes.

1044
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,089
Thank you.

1045
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:45,029
<i>I</i> should be thanking <i>you.</i>

1046
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,179
I took him away from you.

1047
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,189
He should've been
with his family, with you.

1048
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,029
No. You pulled him
out of a dark well,

1049
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,159
made him himself again.

1050
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,999
Got him reaching for
that final piece of life

1051
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,130
Got him reaching for
that final piece of life

1052
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:04,129
instead of watching it go.

1053
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,180
Oh, honey.

1054
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,999
It was a good send-off.

1055
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,130
It was very Donnie.

1056
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,079
So nothing to worry about
on the Secret Santa front.

1057
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,139
I really couldn't have that
around the house.

1058
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,999
Donnie loved doing it so much.

1059
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,049
He kept saying, "I just
wanna make it to Christmas

1060
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,999
so I can be Santa
one more time."

1061
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,219
so I can be Santa
one more time."

1062
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,089
He'd see them get the gifts

1063
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:37,090
and beam straight through
New Year's.

1064
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,070
He just didn't make it.

1065
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,009
Okay. I'll meet you
in the waiting room.

1066
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,100
Okay.

1067
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,999
Ari? How is he?

1068
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,039
Ari? How is he?

1069
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,129
It's not contained,
and it's spreading quickly.

1070
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,180
I'm not into the calendar game,
but... two, three months.

1071
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,099
That's a shame.

1072
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,229
He is a candidate for
a drug trial in Pittsburgh

1073
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:15,019
that's been yielding some
pretty interesting results.

1074
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,129
Such as?

1075
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,179
Slowing growth down,
buying time, really.

1076
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,139
How much?

1077
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,229
Three or four months more, six.

1078
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,069
I can get him in,

1079
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,219
but it is
a pretty rigorous course.

1080
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,000
So... kind of rough

1081
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,059
So... kind of rough

1082
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,099
for a guy who's been through
a lot already.

1083
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,010
It can be.

1084
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,059
Maybe we shouldn't bring it up.

1085
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,149
You think? I...

1086
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,179
Well, I mean,

1087
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,120
what kind of quality of life
will he have?

1088
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,150
Best not to bring it up then.

1089
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,169
- Yeah.

1
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,136
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,387
You guys here...

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,887
Bobby Axelrod's spare fucking apartment.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,136
With goddamned Van Goghs on the walls.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,220
I can house your paintings in
a permanent tax-free state.

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,970
I'll store replicas,
so you can hang the originals.

7
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,637
Hey. One other thing
you can help me with.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,845
You know my new artist... Tanner...

9
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,595
- Yeah.
- He's not working.

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,929
You know what? Let me talk to him.

11
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,178
I'll see what occurs.

12
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,136
- What's on your mind?
- Bobby Axelrod.

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,887
Specifically, an application he
submitted for a bank charter.

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,637
We would like you to stall the approval.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,770
And then deny it.

16
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,011
Dad. What happened? What's wrong?

17
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:32,428
Nothing to worry about.

18
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,595
His kidneys. Renal failure.

19
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,303
How serious are we talking here?

20
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,470
They think he'll need a kidney
transplant in order to...

21
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:39,612
survive.

23
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:07,595
Fuck me...

24
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,011
You and me both...

25
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,303
Who's gonna go try and persuade
'em to walk away?

26
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,261
Lucky for me,
I was sleeping on my good side.

27
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:43,387
I rolled you over.

28
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,720
Wow.

29
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:03,470
You... uh...

30
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,303
That's good. You got me.

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,095
Don't do that.

32
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:13,804
Why?

33
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,720
Figure drawing,
it's art school "technique."

34
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,512
Copying.

35
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,178
It's like a rock band
doing a cover song.

36
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,303
I love a good cover.

37
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:23,230
You kind of can't beat

38
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,428
Manfred Mann's version of
"Blinded by the Light."

39
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,512
Yeah, well, you don't remember
anything else they did.

40
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,804
Well, I love this.

41
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,845
For what it reveals
about how you see me.

42
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,762
For what it reveals about us.

43
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:40,929
I want to keep it.

44
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:47,095
I-I don't, um,
want this stuff out in the world.

45
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:49,512
It won't be out in the world,
it'll be with me.

46
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:57,387
It feels like I'm the one who's
naked and under the covers.

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,178
That's why I want it.

48
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:02,220
I brought it out of you.

49
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,804
Now sign it...
and get back in here with me.

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,011
So Bobby Axelrod wants to be a bank.

51
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:21,929
But before we can ascend the heights,

52
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,220
we need your beatific blessing.

53
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,470
Mm.

54
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,136
So I am here as his banking sherpa.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,553
To guide him through the craggy terrain

56
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:29,303
of the approval process.

57
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,303
Not least because of
the close relationship

58
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,053
you and I have, Madame Chairwoman.

59
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:35,178
Madame Chairwoman,
I need a letter from the SEC,

60
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,970
supporting my bank.

61
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,553
To allow me to fight for consumers

62
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,261
the way that I fight for my investors.

63
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,679
Like a ravening mountain lion.
Whose only prey is value.

64
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:45,470
Not according to the United
States government's prosecutors.

65
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:48,428
They say your prey is the
entire financial system.

66
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,103
And that when you're done with it,

67
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:53,095
not even the buzzards can find
anything left on the bone.

68
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:56,595
I was targeted.
By a vengeful individual.

69
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:59,011
He pursued me publicly, relentlessly...

70
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:00,970
oh, and wrongfully.

71
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,178
- Mm.
- And he lost.

72
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,762
His job. His standing.
His highest aspirations.

73
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,178
As people who line up
against me tend to.

74
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,345
And all the charges were dropped.

75
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:12,762
Yeah, in the end, the system worked.

76
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,345
As I have faith it will now.

77
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,345
Yeah, but we regulators
aren't big on faith.

78
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,637
We look at the record.

79
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,011
That is why Axe Cap plucked me

80
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,845
from your tender regulatory bosom.

81
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:27,345
Wait. So you're why he deserves
a clean bill of health, Spyros?

82
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:30,428
You know how I intuitively
located every speck

83
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,929
of financial dirt when
I was in-house for you?

84
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,470
How I harvested them
and laid them at your feet,

85
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,970
winning the title 'Mr. Roomba?'

86
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,261
Well, I have brought
these skills to Axe Cap

87
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:43,136
and vacuum cleaned every crevice.

88
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,595
We called you Mr. Roomba
because you sucked.

89
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,053
And snuck up on us. And creeped us out.

90
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:51,637
Haha, I certainly miss
the jocular banter...

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,595
And I see that you're
still parading around

92
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,512
in that knockoff Mensa pin.

93
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,345
I had wondered why you
were suddenly sporting that.

94
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:58,887
Was that your gimmick at the SEC?

95
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,595
You're a mountebank Mensa member...

96
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,136
I can assure you, this is...
this is very real...

97
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,428
Do you know why they
formed the Stock Exchange?

98
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,929
To keep out a crook,
a market manipulator.

99
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,428
William Duer.

100
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:12,220
Gave us our first panic in 1792.

101
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,595
But I guess you feel that we
could have skipped the effort

102
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,261
if we had you and your hoovering skills.

103
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,929
Look, I would, uh,
gladly smash in Spyros's head

104
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,470
with the Stock Exchange gavel if
that'd make you feel better...

105
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:23,679
Wouldn't make me feel worse...

106
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,595
But this isn't about him.

107
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,804
This is about the bank
that I'm trying to build.

108
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,804
The difference it will
make to our industry,

109
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:32,929
- to the economy.
- Mm.

110
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,303
You want to talk about why they
really formed the Exchange?

111
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:37,136
It was a club, not a cleanup.

112
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,387
A bunch of Francophiles
with mops on their heads,

113
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,303
who gave themselves the
sole right to trade...

114
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,428
at a commission that they set.

115
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,095
What we call price-fixing these days.

116
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,512
That's the gang that you're part of.

117
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:52,053
Now, I hate clubs, but if I have
to join one, I make it better.

118
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,470
And I make the clubhouse bigger.

119
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,845
And that's why you want
to give me this letter.

120
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:03,178
Sure, I'll write it myself.

121
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,428
On behalf of my 'gang.'

122
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:09,303
But it will warn the FDIC
and the Federal Reserve

123
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,762
that you have been a
regulatory armageddon.

124
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:16,053
Doesn't take a Mensa member
to see that they'd be crazy

125
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:18,679
to grant you a goddamned bank charter.

126
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:20,699
Gentlemen.

127
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:35,095
Did the SEC
bless you like a newborn?

128
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,303
Are we a bank?
We saw the Chairwoman leave

129
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:38,845
and have been waiting
to see you ever since.

130
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:40,261
I want my mahogany desk.

131
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,011
Settle for some fucking plywood.

132
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,595
One word: Spyros.

133
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,470
Second word: dickweed.

134
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,762
You blow the hunt, you don't get
to escape back to the cave.

135
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,136
Just an opening salvo,
we can find our way into...

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,845
Bad enough to wear this if it were real.

137
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:56,679
But a fucking fugazi?

138
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,512
I would have passed the test...

139
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,845
- Oh, my God.
- ...if I had had time to take it.

140
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,720
You actually want people
to think you're in Mensa?

141
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,011
Oh, Spyros,
you should really work on this.

142
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:07,970
Alright. Enough.

143
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,887
The world is arrayed
against us right now.

144
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,720
Against me.

145
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,553
I want to know what the rest of
you can do to show your value...

146
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:17,261
either by outperforming
or changing our footprint

147
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,136
to help make this bank happen.

148
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,428
You better have some fucking answers

149
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,887
the next time I ask...

150
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,470
because silence will
not be acceptable then.

151
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:30,720
There's an opportunity here.

152
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:32,679
To give Axe what his own team can't.

153
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,387
Sure. They're distracted

154
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,637
between becoming a
bank and earning and...

155
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,428
We show him we are where he should

156
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:40,387
put his investable cash...
not into some bank.

157
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,261
We make more money as he makes more.

158
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,470
We earn his loyalty, too.

159
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,845
That's not a trio that
should be seen together

160
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:53,095
unless something's seriously fucked.

161
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:01,887
It seems the liberty of our
tax haven is threatened.

162
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,095
We got a painting problem.

163
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:11,804
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

164
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,178
You have a right to inspect,
not to remove.

165
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,428
Gotta get it out the
box to see what it is.

166
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:19,428
Well, will you wrap your meat
hooks with some kid gloves?

167
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,261
These are priceless works of art.

168
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:24,428
If they are damaged
even in the slightest,

169
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,261
an entire generation of youth

170
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,470
would be robbed of the
joy of their beauty.

171
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,387
Perhaps we can come to an
agreeable accommodation...

172
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,970
for the children.

173
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,720
For your children.

174
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,470
They didn't want money in their pockets.

175
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:46,053
Most dangerous thing in the world:

176
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:47,303
government employees who
don't hate their jobs

177
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:48,804
enough to take a bribe.

178
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,303
Doesn't seem to me like
a random fucking search.

179
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,845
Seems like it's targeted.

180
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:56,428
How did they even know
to go art hunting?

181
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:01,428
Axe-associate Danny Margolis
is something of a promoter.

182
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,261
This time it was him
trying to sell billionaires

183
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:06,303
on parking their paintings
with him, tax free.

184
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,136
You're saying he's using Bobby Axelrod

185
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,470
as his celebrity endorsement?

186
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,136
Along those lines.

187
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,470
- That's the inventory.
- Ah.

188
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,053
We could go after the whole concept,

189
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,887
try to get him on tax fraud.

190
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,095
Something poetic about taking
him down the same way as Capone.

191
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,512
But the laws on freeports are murky.

192
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,678
It's too much of a gamble...

193
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,595
I can't have us bring a case
just to have freeports upheld.

194
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,345
But this...

195
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,470
I see actual fraud here.

196
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,095
Van Gogh. What about it?

197
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,845
I'm fairly certain I've
seen this painting,

198
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,178
up close, in one of Axe's apartments.

199
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:41,178
Standard rich folk practice
is often to store the original

200
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:42,679
- and hang a replica.
- No.

201
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,512
There's a feeling you get
when you're in the presence

202
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:47,095
of the real thing, a work for the ages.

203
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:50,011
There's a weight to it, you know?

204
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,553
I do. You felt that?

205
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,804
I did.

206
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:57,095
I didn't like it at the time.
But I'm starting to now.

207
00:09:57,178 --> 00:10:00,428
So how can one painting
be in two places at once?

208
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,053
It's my bad.

209
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,220
I thought it was a
business could be grown.

210
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,345
Not just your bad.

211
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,512
No. I brought you into this.

212
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,804
Also, I brought you into this.

213
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:15,595
If it was a business could be
grown and there's extra cream,

214
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,887
you're not the only
one who should wind up

215
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,553
light and sweet, fucko.

216
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:21,345
Alright. Let's not catalogue
all the internecine ways

217
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,220
you've fucked me and each other.

218
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,470
I'm cataloguing.

219
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,970
The replicas are in the freeport.

220
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:28,553
They can't be there when someone

221
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,720
who actually knows about art comes back.

222
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,387
In theory, the paintings in a freeport

223
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,512
are meant to keep circulating.

224
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,720
Port to port.
That's how you avoid taxation.

225
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,011
Sort of like the Stones in '72.

226
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:43,512
Good. Well, then let's make that
international tour a reality.

227
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,220
The real ones can't be back in my place.

228
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:48,929
I need to get with Hall
and disappear them.

229
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:53,929
Marithane.

230
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,887
You want a value multiplier, it is one.

231
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,303
What does it do?

232
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:59,595
What you need it to...
brings us back to the future.

233
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,428
And brings us um, like, filthy lucre.

234
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,428
That's like what you
guys would say right?

235
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:08,136
Instead of just: "We can make a
good percentage on our money."

236
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,595
You'd say: "Grab some filthy
dirty lucre" or something?

237
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,220
Anyway, this is a way to do that.

238
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,720
What does it actually do?

239
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:17,929
Harvests methane bubbling
to the ocean surface.

240
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,720
Whale farts? Please tell me
we're talking about whale farts.

241
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:22,095
Cracks in the seafloor.

242
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:23,970
- Right.
- How did you find it?

243
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,011
I built a toy, a social media scraper.

244
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,762
Analyzes the online
behaviors of leading VCs.

245
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,220
Basically, it tracks who they
suddenly decide to follow.

246
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,011
Interest in Marithane
is hockey-sticking.

247
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,470
Competition will be real.

248
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,679
We should get in there fast.

249
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,470
Lauren, set the pitch.

250
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,303
Ah!

251
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:47,595
Auspicious timing.

252
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,887
I was about to call you
to contact your doorman to let me in.

253
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,303
Now you can just do it.

254
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,011
For the purpose of?

255
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,387
Oh, Kevin left his Nintendo
thing in your apartment.

256
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,804
He really wants it for tonight.

257
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,261
Mind if I go up and rummage around?

258
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,178
- Oh, Chuck.
- Mm?

259
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,887
Must be going for shared-custody
father of the year.

260
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,428
Since you dropped everything,

261
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,470
in the middle of the day,
to find a doll.

262
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,887
Oh. Not a doll. Game.

263
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,011
And you know from separations.

264
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,303
It's as if you've forced your
kids to live in a gypsy caravan.

265
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,512
Least I can do is
recover the missing item.

266
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:27,470
- Or buy two of everything.
- Sure.

267
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,220
Is this a Chateau Haut-Brion?

268
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:33,512
It is. 2010.

269
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,053
Not normally a day drinker.

270
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,011
But I've always wanted
to taste this vintage.

271
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,929
King of wines, wine of kings...

272
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,095
Why it's my house red.

273
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,303
Would you mind spotting me a taste?

274
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,428
Alright, Chuck...

275
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:51,220
I'll keep looking for
the game if that's okay.

276
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:09,970
Yeah, I'll, uh, check
the bedroom he uses... in a minute.

277
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,720
Ah!

278
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,387
If it isn't the Dutch master himself.

279
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,804
"Noon - Rest From Work."

280
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,303
Hard to believe it's in private hands.

281
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,470
You know what I believe
Van Gogh is telling us?

282
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:23,512
Hmm?

283
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,053
Time to get back to our own work.

284
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,261
You know, it's hard to imagine
living with a piece like this.

285
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,637
I mean, I'm sure you're aware of

286
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,261
the forty-million- dollar elbow...

287
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,053
when Steve Wynn was
selling it to Steve Cohen

288
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:38,845
and accidentally poked a new
nostril in Picasso's "La Rêve."

289
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:40,220
Yeah. Well aware.

290
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:41,762
Both Steves felt bad about that one.

291
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:42,929
- Mm-hmm.
- And of course this one's worth

292
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,887
- a fuck of a lot more than forty.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,011
Which is why I only hang replicas.

294
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,261
Smart. Oh. I'd do the same.

295
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,428
Since I'm all elbows.

296
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:51,804
Oh! Fuck.

297
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,679
- Geez...
- Fucking clumsy of me...

298
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,637
But why so protective of a replica, Bob?

299
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,845
I'm happy to wipe it off.

300
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:04,303
Guess it...
Guess it almost seems real to me.

301
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:07,845
I should probably move them...
move them all out of here,

302
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:11,220
to a place where there's
no risk of clumsy guests.

303
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,762
Yeah. I like to pretend too.

304
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,470
You know, right now I'm pretending

305
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:17,804
I got guys downstairs,

306
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,762
watching everything come in and out,

307
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,804
all night long if I have to.

308
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:30,804
Well, that is a truly profound Brion.

309
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:34,053
But you're right...
time to get back to work.

310
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:39,011
Oh, and, uh,
let me know if that game ever turns up.

311
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,845
Hey. Where are you?
I got a major fucking problem.

312
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,303
Rhoades. I know.
He moved first and fast.

313
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:55,428
- Looking at options.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:58,387
Well, send me a restoration
and cleaning crew, now...

315
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,011
A Seurat, a Degas, multiple Van Goghs,

316
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,095
all on the fucking manifest...

317
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,970
Don't tell me that lucky
bastard has a Bob Ross, too,

318
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,679
or I'll really hate on the guy.

319
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:13,845
Keep a watch on the building...
front, back, and side doors.

320
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,637
Nothing in or out.
And you know your part.

321
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,845
Yep. Get a subpoena,

322
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,178
so we can have an authenticator

323
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,095
test the fuck out of those canvases.

324
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:23,762
We prove they're real,
we nail Bobby Axelrod on tax fraud.

325
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,387
Like an elbow through the bank charter

326
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,011
he's undoubtedly still pursuing.

327
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,637
That'll make me warm and
tingly in all the places.

328
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,136
Really will, Karl. Really will.

329
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,053
I'm surprised by the aggressiveness

330
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,220
of the sudden interest in our company.

331
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:41,845
It's warranted, but leaves me
with almost too much choice.

332
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,595
We are here to alleviate that burden.

333
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,845
You need a partner,
to help with your hardware expenses.

334
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:48,053
Each ship is like a startup of its own.

335
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,887
And with this much methane,
there's always a chance that...

336
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,220
One of them could go up
like a Molotov Cocktail?

337
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:56,220
- Yeah.
- We can provide you cash.

338
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:59,303
But looking at you,
I sense you need more than that.

339
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,887
You need... what is it,

340
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,053
the thing you're not saying,

341
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,387
the thing at the corner of your mind?

342
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,820
That would bring you some ease.

343
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,011
What will help you,
the human being, be your best.

344
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,512
How can we be that for you right now?

345
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,387
No one's asked that.

346
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,136
Let us do more than feel your pain.

347
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,470
I am having an issue.

348
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:24,345
A former employee walked out the
door with a piece of our tech.

349
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:25,720
Now, I don't want to sue...

350
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:26,929
The bad press and expense.

351
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:29,011
Yes. But he's out there with my tech.

352
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,261
You need him knocked out of the game...

353
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,637
Excuse me.

354
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,595
- You next?
- I am.

355
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,553
- Still prize efficiency?
- You know I do.

356
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,470
Then come with me.

357
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,053
No reason not to do a head-to-head.

358
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,470
Old friends here.
We might as well pitch together.

359
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:58,220
In fact,
I can even do Oscar's pitch for him...

360
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm not saying the world's
divided into makers and takers.

361
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,595
I'm just saying: I'm a maker.

362
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,136
A product guy.

363
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,804
I've been in your shoes.

364
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,136
It can be scary.

365
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,428
And you're right to be scared.

366
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:15,637
There are bad people,
like Bobby Axelrod, out there.

367
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,929
And he corrupts everything he touches.

368
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,470
Including Taylor Mason.

369
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:21,637
Did I miss anything?

370
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,679
My charm?

371
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,303
I have missed that.

372
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,220
But no one spends more money
on green tech than big energy.

373
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:30,136
They have the resources,
the market is compelling them

374
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,637
to evolve, and yeah...

375
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,887
in many cases they've broken
the window needs fixing.

376
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,011
But Axe Cap has deep investments
and influence with them.

377
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,261
So what Oscar would call
corrupting influence,

378
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,762
I call the strategic partnerships

379
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,720
that will take you to tomorrow.

380
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,637
Well, um, that was compelling.

381
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,136
I apologize.
I didn't come prepared for this.

382
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,929
But I will be prepared going forward.

383
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:53,345
Not really what they want to
hear from their VC, is it?

384
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,512
You know, I don't mind the pinch,
but I don't like looking.

385
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,345
Why is that?

386
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:07,512
It represents your
life force flowing out.

387
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,804
Thank you.

388
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,387
Taking it to the lab now.

389
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,470
We should have results
for you by end of day.

390
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,345
I don't want to do this.

391
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:30,762
You do. You're honored.

392
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,053
Replace the blanks in this sentence

393
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,679
with two three-letter words
made from the same letters:

394
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:42,053
"The woman decided to blank
the beast where he lay

395
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,512
rather than blank him home."

396
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:48,512
She decided to blank...

397
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,970
it's a three-letter word?

398
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:51,595
Yeah, like this one:

399
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,637
F-U-K off so we can
all get back to work.

400
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,553
The words are gut and tug.

401
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,387
The questions are biased.

402
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,887
How are they biased?

403
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,053
You're asking them in a biased way.

404
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:06,303
You know the answer... or you don't.

405
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,804
I know the answers to questions

406
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:09,512
that you haven't even thought of yet.

407
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,095
- Okay.
- Just hit me

408
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,345
with another Mensa-type-mindbender.

409
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:22,387
If FL=6 and HX=15, what does ES equal?

410
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,595
Fourteen.

411
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,970
- That's right.
- It's a conspiracy.

412
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,929
Actually it's just the numbers of places

413
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,345
between the letters in the alphabet.

414
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,679
I cannot achieve genius
surrounded by jealousy.

415
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,095
You know we have a problem.

416
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,804
He failed the SEC meeting.

417
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,679
He's doomed to fail the Mensa exam.

418
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,470
In another man, this double ego bruise

419
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,136
might induce self-examination
or humility, but...

420
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,679
He's gonna lash out!

421
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,011
He'll red-flag all our trades

422
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,804
like the insecure,
vindictive douche he is.

423
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,178
Maybe he'll pass.

424
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,178
Maybe we're all just
underestimating him.

425
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,387
No, I've been quizzing him all day.

426
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,220
We're properly estimating him.

427
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:09,011
Thought you should know,
your ex is using your kids

428
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:10,595
as pretext to tear apart my property

429
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,095
like Keith Moon at a Holiday Inn.

430
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,929
The thing about him being my ex?

431
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,220
I don't need to apologize
for him anymore.

432
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:20,595
Someone else's past is a
thorn in our side right now.

433
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,929
- Oscar Langstraat.
- Hmm.

434
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,887
He's getting in the way of
Mase Carbon's latest play.

435
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,011
How's Taylor responding?

436
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:34,428
They seem ready to stomp
him like Big John Studd.

437
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,470
This happen to be a
Nico Tanner original?

438
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:42,178
Signed, no less.

439
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:43,720
You pose for this,
or was it from memory?

440
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:45,178
Why don't you call him and ask?

441
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,095
No, it's just it's the
first work I've seen of his

442
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,011
since I helped set up
his whole new life.

443
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,553
Now I know why he's
been so distracted...

444
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:51,804
You're about to get bounced out of here.

445
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,428
Well, since you're in there,

446
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:56,053
maybe you can see when I can
expect some art out of him.

447
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,804
Something that looks a little
bit more like Implosion.

448
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,387
You aware of Wendy and the artist?

449
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:28,637
As of now.

450
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,345
Let me worry about all things painted.

451
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,762
While you focus on
getting that bank charter.

452
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,220
Mm. Good idea.
With one small adjustment.

453
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:38,136
I'll focus on the art and the charter.

454
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,095
The freeport is the fucking bank.

455
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:41,637
It's Chuck's way of blocking it.

456
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,053
If I'm hit with tax charges,

457
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,428
you think the SEC will ever come around?

458
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,929
They're not coming around now.

459
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,095
Unless someone forces them to.

460
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,178
Krakow already shook us off.

461
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,762
Well this time we're tightening the rope

462
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,679
and digging in the spurs.

463
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,178
Anyone could have designed that toy.

464
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,970
But anyone didn't. You didn't.

465
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:08,679
Too simplistic.

466
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:12,011
Microchip was simple;
pasteurization too.

467
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,970
Both changed the world.

468
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:16,387
Not always about the degree
of technical difficulty,

469
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,261
sometimes it's about
insight and initiative.

470
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:20,595
No to the duh.

471
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,261
I showed that shit when I figured out

472
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:24,220
how to dump Mase Cap out
of non-green investments.

473
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,345
Oh, so this is a workplace

474
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,929
where it's cool if you
just bring it once?

475
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,553
I thought the idea was
to bring it every day.

476
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:36,178
Uh huh.

477
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:39,720
Yeah. So there's no chance that I'm a...

478
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,303
Okay.

479
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,178
Thank you for letting me know.

480
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:49,804
I'm not a match.

481
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,929
For Senior.

482
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:53,387
Damnit.

483
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,679
And why the hell aren't
you outside Axe's?

484
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,512
I got the McCluskey visit.

485
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,762
Pulled me from sitting on
the Don at the hospital.

486
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,679
Did everything short of busting my jaw.

487
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,387
- Who pulled you?
- New York's finest.

488
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,136
Showed me paper and everything.

489
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,345
Crap.

490
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,136
Yeah.

491
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,762
Sorry about your blood.

492
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:14,220
Uh...

493
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,929
You heard?

494
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,804
That you inserted yourself
into my fucking case?

495
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:21,762
Wanted you to get the
particulars straight from me.

496
00:23:21,845 --> 00:23:23,845
The Axelrod tax fraud case is mine.

497
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,845
That's criminal behavior in Manhattan.

498
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,553
Literally my dominion.

499
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:29,178
The case straddles the line.

500
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,845
So you applied for a subpoena...

501
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,095
Mm-hmm. Before you did.

502
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,887
And I got it. What does that tell you?

503
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,345
You are well-connected
at the courthouse.

504
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:38,595
And backed by the governor.

505
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:46,095
Maybe this is the rare case
we could collaborate on?

506
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:49,887
I don't need your Axelrod
hard-on accidentally poking me.

507
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,220
I don't need you at all.

508
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:53,970
The apartment is now secured by NYPD.

509
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:57,345
The art authenticator's coming
in from Boston tomorrow.

510
00:23:57,428 --> 00:24:00,053
But, hey,
I'm just handling the criminal case.

511
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:04,720
As always, Chuck, you are free
to follow up on any civil angle.

512
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,762
That looks like a woman
who just took from us.

513
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,845
Ah. You look like a woman
who's gonna help me take back.

514
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:17,178
We need to find a way to leverage Gramm.

515
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,720
Get her to leave Axe to me.

516
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,220
Looking for something professional?

517
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,970
Yeah. Let's start there.

518
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,762
I'm off to see Charles Senior.

519
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:25,053
My best to the old man.

520
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:27,470
That is what he demands.

521
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,261
I'm happy to keep you company.
But shouldn't your wife...

522
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,762
There are no women in the house.

523
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:00,845
I sent Roxanne to her people
until I get my strength back.

524
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,512
She married a virile bull,
not an invalid.

525
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:06,387
She loves you.

526
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,303
She can look at you and see you.

527
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:12,345
Love only makes the weak blind.

528
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,095
The staunch see with striking clarity.

529
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:16,804
Oh.

530
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:21,011
That must be why Sonny Crockett
always wore those shades, huh?

531
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:26,970
Listen, Dad, uh,

532
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:31,261
since the family has been
more inclusive of late,

533
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,804
now might be a good time to reach out

534
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:37,804
to any previously unreported bastards.

535
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:42,470
Just welcome them into
the ever-growing fold.

536
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:44,261
What bastards?

537
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:46,178
There are no such issue.

538
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:50,053
Comments like that are
how rumors get started.

539
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:52,512
And inheritances get diluted.

540
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,845
Ah, shit.

541
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:03,011
You're not a match, are you?

542
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,887
I'm not. No.

543
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,095
Yeah. Of course you don't have
my blood flowing in your veins.

544
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:14,178
If you did, you'd be
goddamned President by now.

545
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:16,136
Or the fucking Pope.

546
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,387
No, your arteries must
be filled with the same

547
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,428
watery gruel as your
mother's pinhead brother.

548
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:25,345
That's not okay to say about
somebody with microcephaly.

549
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:29,220
Or maybe anybody ever.

550
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:31,053
Do you know they...
they used to have a rating system

551
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,762
for mental infirmity?

552
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,679
We're all too polite for it now.

553
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,053
But that list told it
like it goddamned was.

554
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:40,220
A cretin was without a
thought in their head.

555
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:43,387
An idiot had the intellect
of a two-year-old child.

556
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,095
An average imbecile got up to seven.

557
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,512
And a moron could be as clever

558
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,220
as a feeble-minded twelve-year-old.

559
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,387
You pick your fucking title.

560
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:55,595
Good talk, Dad.

561
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,929
I'm sorry you're scared.

562
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:10,887
I'm sorry I didn't match.

563
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,845
And, uh,

564
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:16,929
I'm sorry for insinuating
there are bastards.

565
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,053
They didn't match either.

566
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:38,762
The D.A.'s subpoena establishes

567
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:41,595
that none of the art can
be moved until it's tested.

568
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,512
Can we move the prosecutor?

569
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,136
Nah. Gramm's immovable.

570
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,595
She made that clear over our
first plate of plantains.

571
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,387
Who will she use to authenticate?

572
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,428
The NYPD prefer a fellow named Hemlock.

573
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:55,095
They say the man can smell pigments.

574
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:56,929
They retained him on this case.

575
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,387
The aesthete will be here tomorrow.

576
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,720
At which point he'll authenticate

577
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,387
the canvases in your apartment.

578
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,553
At which point I'll be fucked.

579
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,512
Is it too late to pay the taxes?

580
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:07,804
Oh, come on...

581
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,804
- I'm just...
- Goodness, what a question...

582
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,553
Yes. Even if I were willing.
Which I'm not.

583
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,887
I've got an idea.

584
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:22,804
Orrin, that's your cue to
get the fuck out of here.

585
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:27,136
My wife, my third house,
and my law license thank you.

586
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,011
If only Bruce Cutler had a
friend like Bobby Axelrod.

587
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:40,970
What if we get Biblical.

588
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,136
That Old Testament, Hebrew lightning.

589
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,220
Hmm.

590
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:48,970
To smoke 18 canvases across
six thousand square feet,

591
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:52,512
even if I can hide the origin,
make it look electrical...

592
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:54,345
we'd be taking out the whole unit,

593
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:55,679
maybe half the building.

594
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:57,804
Well. That's a wide fucking range.

595
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,679
I can't make the fire
big enough to do the job

596
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:02,512
and small enough to be easily contained.

597
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:05,637
Then there's the variable
of the firefighters.

598
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,679
Will they get hurt? Will others?

599
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,512
Not hurting any firefighters.

600
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:12,512
Or destroying all that beauty.

601
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:15,178
Oh. That, too.

602
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:21,011
Houdini's Water Torture.

603
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,970
He was chained up in a
locked box filled with water.

604
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,387
We use the same move on the paintings

605
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,553
that he used to escape?

606
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,512
Wait, uh, didn't he die in that box?

607
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,845
Yes, which is where you're going

608
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:36,220
unless you figure out a way to fix this.

609
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,679
Margolis,

610
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:44,345
who else did you pitch the freeport to?

611
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,387
Uh...

612
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:50,053
Axe, if it were up to me,
you'd have ATMs in every ass crack.

613
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,470
But the SEC is an independent agency.

614
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,053
One that hates meddling,
loves leaking to the press.

615
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:56,720
Précisément.

616
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,345
This is the kind of thing
that leads to hearings,

617
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,595
investigations, public thrashing,

618
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,178
I need to be careful.

619
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,553
As careful as you've been
storing your Frank Stellas?

620
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:08,720
Where is all your art, by the way?
I don't see much of it here...

621
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:10,720
Margolis gave me a tip
about your freeport.

622
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,595
I assumed he gave you a taste...

623
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,970
Yeah. I don't care about any of that.
Not today.

624
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:16,595
But I should tell you,

625
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,428
there is gonna be a
freeport crackdown...

626
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,095
widespread.

627
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:21,387
Shit.

628
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,720
That's gonna cost me stacks.

629
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:24,929
Fucking IRS.

630
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,595
They have no respect for authority.

631
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:30,261
You got a workaround?

632
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,553
Not at the moment.

633
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:34,387
But I can help you offset your loss

634
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,261
by augmenting your collection.

635
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:39,428
You willing to part with
something from your own?

636
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:41,095
I can do you one better.

637
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:44,512
Get you a one-off, a singular commission

638
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,095
that's worthy of your greatness.

639
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,313
A portrait?

640
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,512
Nico Tanner, first and only.

641
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:53,387
Mm. He's gotten hot thanks
to you and Mike Prince.

642
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,470
Didn't know Tanner did
representational work.

643
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,762
Ah. Few have seen it.

644
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:59,136
But I happen to know it's good.

645
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,303
- Fucking great, actually.
- Hmm.

646
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:05,470
But I need you to rip a letter
on my behalf out of the SEC

647
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,637
and grease the skids to a charter.

648
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,929
For the original glamor shot? Sure.

649
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,303
But none of that Cubist bullshit.

650
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:15,345
I don't want my left
eyeball next to my nutsack.

651
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:24,637
How am I back here again?

652
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:28,470
My guess... you need something again.

653
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,178
Yes, for my father.

654
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:35,845
For you to take a blood test.

655
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,595
To see if you're a match.

656
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,220
What's the point, Chuck?

657
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:44,428
Oh, none really,
just saving a man's life.

658
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:46,303
What could be more pointless than that?

659
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:51,136
Even if I am the right blood type,

660
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,845
and then the right tissue type,
and then I cross-match,

661
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,053
and then a team of nephrologists
green-flags me onto the track,

662
00:31:57,136 --> 00:31:59,387
your father's not getting my kidney.

663
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,637
I'm hanging onto them in case
our kids or my family need one.

664
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,762
Do you know our kids' blood types?

665
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:07,303
Don't even fucking think about it.

666
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,345
You see that?

667
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:13,220
You are still the only one

668
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:16,553
that actively stops me
from turning into him.

669
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,512
You'll never be him.

670
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:23,387
Yeah. I used to be sure
that was a good thing.

671
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,428
The reason I didn't
measure up to my father

672
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,053
was 'cause I didn't want to.

673
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:29,261
Good. He's warped.

674
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,053
Yeah? Is he?

675
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:33,887
I look around now and
he's the one who's happy.

676
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,804
He's the one surrounded
by loving family.

677
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,553
Maybe the reason I didn't measure up...

678
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,553
is because I couldn't.

679
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,845
I was too different.

680
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,720
On a cellular level,
I was a different and lesser man.

681
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:56,387
I'll hand it to him.

682
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,512
He wired you in a way

683
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,136
even I could never quite untangle.

684
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,762
You're racked with guilt.

685
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:06,261
Because I can't help him.

686
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:08,136
Or because you don't want to.

687
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:12,929
Wait. You think that I want him to die?

688
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,136
I think, maybe, you need him to.

689
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,804
Where should we begin?

690
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:19,637
From the way he let your uncle
'make a man of you, '

691
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,178
to the way he let you
know he'd tried her too.

692
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:23,270
Yeah. The hooker?

693
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:24,762
The sex worker. Yes.

694
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:27,178
That's what we must call them now?

695
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,595
I'm not gonna get into the semantics
of this with you right now.

696
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,970
Ask your colleagues who are
trying to make that fact law.

697
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,637
Or your girlfriend.

698
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,804
She's a renowned expert.

699
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,136
I need your library.

700
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:45,720
Thank you.

701
00:33:48,553 --> 00:33:49,970
Is this for your class?

702
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,804
Uh, no. It's for yours.

703
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:54,804
The one you're about to teach me.

704
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,470
On prostitution.

705
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:58,136
Sex work.

706
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,095
Call it sex work,
because that's what it is, work.

707
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,553
Uh-huh.

708
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,261
Prostitution suggests
something criminal,

709
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:06,220
immoral... deviant.

710
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:07,804
Why the hell isn't it deviant?

711
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:09,887
Come at me.

712
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,136
Why?

713
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,762
Are you bringing a case on this?

714
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:16,053
No. It's more that the, uh, D.A. isn't.

715
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:18,679
She's quietly pushing decriminalization.

716
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,345
Good for her.

717
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:23,845
The Nordic Model is doing great
things to decrease stigma,

718
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,720
redistribute responsibility.

719
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:27,845
Why should the workers be
punished and not the patrons?

720
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,970
Yes, that's the stuff.

721
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:34,178
Make your best argument...
and then help me shred it.

722
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:37,261
I don't like this game.

723
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,387
This is my life's work.

724
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,011
I'm... I'm well aware it's not a game.

725
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:45,345
I need the D.A. off my turf.

726
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:48,804
That may require trampling on hers.

727
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,720
Have you ever even met a sex worker?

728
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,679
A long time ago, my father...

729
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:54,804
I don't want to get into it.

730
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:59,178
Just, please, help me argue
that the D.A. is hurting women.

731
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:00,887
When she's not?

732
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,595
You get to shift the Overton Window,

733
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,136
and sex workers can just
fall off the fucking ledge?

734
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Cat, I could have come here
and lied about my motives...

735
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:11,679
but I didn't. I was honest.

736
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:13,220
That's new for me.

737
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,428
Well, then be honest about this...

738
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:18,053
Are you going to crack down,
or is this really just a threat?

739
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,220
Yes. Of course it's just a threat...

740
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,220
which I have to mean.

741
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:25,720
Otherwise it's not a very good threat.

742
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:32,053
Then I have to mean this one, too...

743
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:33,845
You can threaten the D.A.,

744
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,053
but if you make good on that threat,

745
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:38,053
your library privileges will be revoked.

746
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,053
Along with all the other privileges.

747
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:42,762
Capisce?

748
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,136
Good.

749
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,762
Read my book.

750
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:54,261
I blew your number out of
the water on Marithane.

751
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:55,428
2x'd you.

752
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:56,762
That's an overpay.

753
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:59,387
A substantial overpay.

754
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,929
In part to help cover the
costs of their patent issue...

755
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:04,762
but mainly to make a fucking point.

756
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,178
To you...

757
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,387
You'll do this every
time we go head-to-head.

758
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,720
It's my new mission.

759
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,136
This isn't how you normally do business.

760
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,387
Or speak.

761
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,762
You're exceptional.

762
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:16,011
You merited an exception.

763
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:20,387
I have learned, in dealing with people,
to be disarming.

764
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,845
I smile, I'm polite,
because I was loved as a child

765
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:27,136
and am genuinely a decent human being.

766
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,178
But somewhere during
my early Oakland days,

767
00:36:30,261 --> 00:36:33,345
I built an affinity for
the silver and black.

768
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:34,970
The Raiders.

769
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:37,804
So when I'm in... it's win, baby, win...

770
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,428
and when we don't,

771
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,970
we beat the shit out
of the opposing fans.

772
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,011
Don't make me do that to you.

773
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,086
_

774
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:48,553
Liquid courage, don't fail me now.

775
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:53,053
It's like we're all being tested.

776
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:55,387
For a horrible disease.

777
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,512
Oscar went over-the-top.
I can't outspend him.

778
00:38:08,595 --> 00:38:10,220
He has an open lane to
the hoop on Marithane.

779
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,637
Rather he bought himself one.

780
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,220
Fuck.

781
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:16,595
I need your help.

782
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:19,387
If he overpays his way
to victory every time...

783
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,929
which he damn well can afford to...

784
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,261
Then our burgeoning
enterprise is finished.

785
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,929
What kind of help are you looking for...

786
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:28,762
emotional, personal...

787
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:30,845
The Axe kind. How would you load Axe up

788
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,095
to deal with an existential threat?

789
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:35,261
I wouldn't need to.
He registers all threats as existential.

790
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,220
So I either try to stop him or at least

791
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:40,136
point him away from civilians.

792
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,303
How can I approach this like
Axe without becoming him?

793
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,929
Never known anyone to put on the
suit without it changing them.

794
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:53,303
But if anyone can, I suppose it's you...

795
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:57,553
Model the will, the aggression...

796
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:59,762
but temper it with your
own fundamental advantage.

797
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:01,070
A moral compass?

798
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:04,220
The ability to accurately
weigh reward vs. jail time.

799
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,178
You know what you need now?

800
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,387
I need Hard Bob.

801
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,178
That's a tight flight time.

802
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,887
He's a tight flyer.

803
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,303
But the imprecision
of the shift change...

804
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:22,845
Maybe that's where our boys come in.

805
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,428
I have not felt this excited
to be part of something

806
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:28,178
since I donned a girdle
for the 124th Edition

807
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,011
of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.

808
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:31,970
I've seen the pictures.

809
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:36,720
The paperwork's ready to be filed, yes?

810
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,220
It's great fucking pie.

811
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:44,303
But I know you just didn't want company.

812
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:47,929
True dat, double true,
as the wise men once said.

813
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,303
I need you to paint something for me.

814
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,387
I thought that's what I was doing.

815
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,220
Yeah.
A little fucking slowly, by the way.

816
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:55,720
But this is different.

817
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:58,512
A portrait of the sitting
Treasury Secretary.

818
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,929
Come on, man.
I-I don't... I don't do portraits.

819
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,345
Well, I think we both know otherwise.

820
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:05,011
I've seen otherwise.

821
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:06,804
♪ You're so nice ♪

822
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:09,178
Right. Yeah. Well, that was nothing.

823
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:10,970
And it's none of your business.

824
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:12,929
Eh, well, your 'nothing' is world-class,

825
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,887
and it's more than good
enough for Todd Krakow.

826
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,178
Who's that?

827
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:18,637
He signs your money,
now you get to sign him.

828
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,011
Which'll get you even more
copies of his signature.

829
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:27,178
Thanks.

830
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,470
Hey, Anthony.

831
00:40:34,553 --> 00:40:36,887
So, I'm sitting over there,
eating with one artist,

832
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,679
and I'm thinking to myself,

833
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:42,053
"My favorite artist isn't
getting paid enough."

834
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:44,178
- I'm talking about you.
- No. I'm fine.

835
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:46,345
No. Your pizza, Anthony,

836
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:48,553
is way too good for only
the hundred or so people

837
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,553
who are lucky enough to
get in here every night.

838
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:52,136
And what about the people who can't?

839
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,136
What about the ones who
can't get into New York?

840
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,679
Shouldn't they have some of this, too?

841
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,845
I agree.

842
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,095
Who are you?

843
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:00,845
Call me Manz. I'm Anthony's cousin.

844
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:02,553
Business manager.

845
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,303
What do you got in mind?

846
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:07,136
The freezer section. We start there.

847
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,178
Best frozen pie ever.

848
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,720
Then sauce. Gelato.

849
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,512
We roll out the complete line.

850
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,178
The whole Una food experience...
but at home.

851
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:18,011
But if you're his business manager,

852
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:20,136
why don't you have him
going in this already?

853
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,136
'Ey I tried. I got him
to open up a second location.

854
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,762
You know just this business
or you know business?

855
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:28,679
Graduated Stern. 4.2 weighted.

856
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:32,011
What's in it for you?

857
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:33,970
We partner.

858
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:35,595
I stake it.

859
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,345
This gets big and we get
bought by a major conglomerate.

860
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:40,261
It'll be what they call a
'liquidity event.'

861
00:41:40,345 --> 00:41:41,929
Because people like your cousin here...

862
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:43,512
the best in the world at what they do...

863
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:45,261
deserve to get rich.

864
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:47,303
And I'm here to make that happen.

865
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:50,178
I like it.

866
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,512
And I've got some ideas.

867
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,637
- Okay?
- Okay.

868
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,011
Okay. We'll be talking.

869
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:02,053
Happy to be joining
the Langstraat family.

870
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,804
There's a hole in the universe
where Alderaan used to be.

871
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,929
As if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror.

872
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,303
What did you do?

873
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,220
You have your patent back.

874
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:13,970
And your employee... if you want him.

875
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:17,220
Which is a gift I am giving you,
whether I'm your VC or not.

876
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:27,011
I'm confident he'll be a good boy now.

877
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,637
Can I help you?

878
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,345
I'm Hard Bob Beaufort,

879
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:33,804
from the Bureau of
Industry and Security.

880
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:36,387
I understand you're
something of a bullshitter.

881
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,845
And I brook no bullshit.

882
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:44,387
Oscar, I'm sorry. How do you not go with

883
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,220
someone willing to do that for you?

884
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,929
Well, because if they're willing
to do that for you today,

885
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:52,804
they're willing to do it to you later.

886
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,178
But that's not something
you can hear from me.

887
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,762
You'll just have to
learn that for yourself.

888
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:58,637
Oscar, Al Davis is dead.

889
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,929
And the Raiders haven't
won anything in a decade.

890
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,428
So go back to the bay.
And heal, baby, heal.

891
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:13,011
Madam D.A. Enjoy your dumplings.

892
00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:14,762
Thank you.

893
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:25,720
Ah, yes, the famed
Red Farm Pac-Man dumplings.

894
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,178
Fitting for someone who
gobbles up my cases.

895
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:30,720
Your cases are almost as delicious.

896
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:32,762
Which is why I want this one back.

897
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:34,411
No chance.

898
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:37,929
Let's see if I can shift your thinking.

899
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:39,553
Hmm?

900
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:42,887
My number one priority as
the State's top law man

901
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,011
is now fighting the scourge of
what you like to call sex work...

902
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:48,470
but which I am going to link,

903
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,970
very publicly, to sex trafficking.

904
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:53,303
Human bondage.

905
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:55,637
And I will make it look
like I'm stepping up

906
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,136
because you failed to.

907
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,095
Trying to scam the optics.

908
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,136
I don't give a fuck about the
people keeping score at home.

909
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,595
But you do care about the women.

910
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:08,595
I mean, sure, a few men,
but mainly women.

911
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:11,428
And, of course, children.

912
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:13,595
You care about what happens

913
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,303
when they're placed in the system.

914
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,178
You care about them
dealing with the incarceration,

915
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:19,261
the stigma,

916
00:44:19,345 --> 00:44:21,595
the damage.

917
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,595
'Cause that's what
I'm gonna do to 'em...

918
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,679
incarcerate them, stigmatize them

919
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:28,095
and fucking damage them.

920
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:31,303
Do you see this urchin?

921
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:35,095
Her ID says her name
is Inge and she's 18.

922
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:37,178
I promise you,
she's far younger than that...

923
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,762
and I have no idea
what she calls herself.

924
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:43,178
I do know that not long after
she reached these shores

925
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:47,220
and this city,
she found her way to a massage parlor.

926
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:49,762
Where she was caught up in a sting,
under your watch.

927
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:52,220
You let her go.
And you know what happened?

928
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:55,679
She flourished. At this very moment,

929
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:57,804
she's working towards
her high school diploma.

930
00:44:57,887 --> 00:45:02,136
What do you think happens
to the next Inge...

931
00:45:03,274 --> 00:45:05,011
under my watch?

932
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:08,804
- I may have misjudged you.
- Mm.

933
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:11,512
Thought you had a limit
on how you use your power.

934
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:14,345
No. When it comes to the
particular agenda I am pursuing,

935
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:17,178
I will do it Rudy Giuliani-style.

936
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:19,470
I will prosecute with a crazy eye

937
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,720
and absolutely no sense of boundaries.

938
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,428
Besides,
I didn't put these women in this place.

939
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,595
They put their own lives up for sale.

940
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,512
And now those lives hang in the balance.

941
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:30,345
Will you ransom them back?

942
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,679
Or will you place Dutch paintings

943
00:45:32,762 --> 00:45:35,303
and Scandinavian values above the life

944
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:38,220
and liberty of women most at risk?

945
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,929
Wow, Chuck.

946
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:44,637
Okay.

947
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,762
Taking the missiles out of Havana.

948
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,720
You can have your fucking art case.

949
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:54,011
Thank you.

950
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,887
Mmm. Delicious.

951
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,595
Enjoy your noonday repast.

952
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,970
Uh, hold up.

953
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:13,303
Alright, clear out, boys.

954
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,679
Get ready to authenticate.

955
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:40,970
Mr. Rhoades, I was born ready.

956
00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:43,053
Like Eliot Ness with an MFA.

957
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,720
I have a PhD.

958
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,261
Well. Get ready
to shove it up Axelrod's...

959
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:07,095
Chuck. Another midday drop-by.

960
00:47:07,178 --> 00:47:08,762
I'd say you were wasting my taxes.

961
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:11,220
If I didn't have such
giant fucking deductions.

962
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:12,929
The fuck is this bacchanalia?

963
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:14,595
Just a little day drinking.

964
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:19,637
I'm afraid these paintings no
longer belong to Mr. Axelrod.

965
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,095
They're hanging in his apartment.

966
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:24,845
Actually, this is no longer
a private residence at all.

967
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:28,011
Your family foundation. You didn't...

968
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,470
These works,
every impeccable inch of them,

969
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:32,845
are now the proud possession

970
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:34,804
of the Axelrod Charitable Foundation.

971
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:37,720
Which maintains and runs this museum.

972
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,220
It's a real feather in our cap.

973
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:41,553
Uh-huh.

974
00:47:41,637 --> 00:47:44,303
A private art museum... for replicas.

975
00:47:44,387 --> 00:47:45,845
Course not.

976
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,261
These are as real as I am standing here.

977
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:50,720
And they got here, how exactly?

978
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:52,303
We've been watching, day and night.

979
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,470
I guess not every angle.

980
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,804
Whoops.

981
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,261
Don't make 'em like they used to.

982
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:05,428
- Hey!
- Fuck you!

983
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:07,387
- Whoo!
- Come back here!

984
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,345
Huh?! Come and get me!

985
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,720
Let's get him!

986
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,345
Let's go!

987
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:23,845
Go, go, go!

988
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:25,261
Come on! Keep moving!

989
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:26,512
Got it.

990
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,679
Hurry up. Hurry up.

991
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:34,595
Okay, come on. Careful.

992
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,595
Why? They're empty anyways.

993
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:38,929
You can check the security footage

994
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:40,387
from the neighboring roofs.

995
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,512
Tough to move paintings this big,

996
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:42,679
had to innovate.

997
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:44,553
Might be facing an FAA fine.

998
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:46,345
But, oh, well.

999
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:49,095
I should have done the whole
museum thing many years ago.

1000
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:51,845
Share the majesty instead
of hoarding it for myself.

1001
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,095
And I want thank you,
Chuck, for the impetus...

1002
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:55,720
and opportunity.

1003
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:57,553
I need to take a closer
goddamned look...

1004
00:48:57,637 --> 00:48:59,845
Sure. But it will have to wait.

1005
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:02,136
Museum hours are over for the month.

1006
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,512
Wonderful collection!

1007
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:05,679
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1008
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:08,220
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1009
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:29,387
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1010
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:37,970
After Fischer beat Spassky...

1011
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:39,512
Reykjavik, '72...

1012
00:49:39,595 --> 00:49:42,303
he described his chief
moment of pleasure

1013
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:46,261
as seeing his opponent's ego break.

1014
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:50,178
I want you to know,
as a newly-minted Mensan,

1015
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:53,136
that I feel no need to break you.

1016
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,387
I see no Cold War between us.

1017
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,512
I always knew you had it in you.

1018
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:19,970
Should I intentionally
leave one or two wrong,

1019
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:21,595
so he knows he wasn't punked?

1020
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,136
If he were thinking that clearly,

1021
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,095
he'd have the real pin already.

1022
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,470
It's a silly little trinket.

1023
00:50:29,553 --> 00:50:31,053
Proves nothing, of course...

1024
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:32,720
besides the company of

1025
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:36,720
Asimov, Carol Oates, Geena Davis.

1026
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:38,970
Well. I hardly need to wear it...

1027
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,303
Oh, you know what?

1028
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:44,804
I will, why not...
in the name of learning!

1029
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:48,095
And don't let this bauble, this curio,

1030
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:52,178
remind you of the
yawning gap between us.

1031
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,845
But I will be mindful.

1032
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,637
And I will be here.

1033
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,887
As a mentor.

1034
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,887
A teacher.

1035
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,220
A guide.

1036
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:10,720
I am never doing another nice thing.

1037
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:13,679
I say that every day.
But we are who we are.

1038
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:26,679
How do I look?

1039
00:51:26,762 --> 00:51:28,553
Not great.

1040
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:30,220
Good.

1041
00:51:30,303 --> 00:51:32,220
Two stopped-up urinals in my gut,

1042
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:35,637
if I get a compliment I
know I'm a fucking goner.

1043
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:38,512
I had my blood typed.

1044
00:51:39,237 --> 00:51:40,595
We're not a match.

1045
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,762
You did that for Chuck?

1046
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:47,303
I did it for your grandkids.

1047
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:52,136
And for myself, too, maybe.

1048
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,011
Second worst thing about dialysis,
after the bedpans?

1049
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:01,303
Turns everyone into a
goddamned Hallmark card.

1050
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:04,261
People want to say what
they've been meaning to say.

1051
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:06,136
How about: Here's a fucking kidney?

1052
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,178
All I've got is: They're doing
wonders with xenotransplants.

1053
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:11,887
I'm a little rough on my Greek.

1054
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,720
Pig kidneys.

1055
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:15,220
You're already pig-headed.

1056
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:17,679
I don't see why you wouldn't
want a kidney to match.

1057
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:19,387
I'd rather die.

1058
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:21,929
You might.

1059
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:25,136
One thing I know about the Greeks,

1060
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:27,970
the great tragedies

1061
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:31,261
rarely featured death scenes.

1062
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:33,512
Plain left that shit offstage.

1063
00:52:33,595 --> 00:52:37,845
They just did not find it interesting.

1064
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,261
Living...

1065
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:42,428
that's the real drama.

1066
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:44,637
The real classroom.

1067
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,136
Plenty of lessons left to teach.

1068
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:53,136
You're worried about Willow.

1069
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,845
Good God no.

1070
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:57,762
She won't even remember me,

1071
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,053
and she'll have her mother

1072
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,637
to fill her full of whatever.

1073
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:07,679
But Chuck...

1074
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:10,136
if I'm not here

1075
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,553
to push him, to mold him,

1076
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:18,136
who knows all the ways
he'll fuck himself up.

1077
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,762
You got me there.

1078
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:30,720
It got ugly.

1079
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:32,512
I got ugly.

1080
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:34,470
I went halfway to Ed Exley.

1081
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:36,637
Didn't know I had it in me.

1082
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:41,762
You won.

1083
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,970
For the moment.

1084
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:46,428
Did you make good on your threat?

1085
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:51,470
Good.

1086
00:53:51,553 --> 00:53:53,804
Would you have really
followed through, though?

1087
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:56,387
It's possible something inside me

1088
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,011
would have caught, backed down.

1089
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:02,188
I truly don't know.

1090
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:03,345
Would you have?

1091
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:05,303
Yup.

1092
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:07,553
Which would have been unfortunate.

1093
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:09,595
Because then

1094
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,136
we couldn't have enjoyed

1095
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,387
this.

1096
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:23,470
Is, uh, this a reward,
or to teach me a lesson?

1097
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:24,679
Both.

1098
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,220
Neither.

1099
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,887
Whatever we want to make of it.

1100
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,762
Come on.

1101
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:37,470
I'm sorry Axe saw it.

1102
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:41,178
You know, I didn't show it to him,

1103
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:42,762
I didn't try to show it to him anyway...

1104
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:46,345
I know you meant no harm,
but harm is coming.

1105
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:50,387
It's open!

1106
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,095
I'm ready for my close-up.

1107
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,136
Hello?

1108
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,220
Hey. You know what,
we should all do dinner...

1109
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,345
Me, you, Tanner.

1110
00:57:19,428 --> 00:57:22,136
Maybe I'll bring someone, too...

1111
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,136
Well...

1112
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,136
The art world's been good to me lately.

1113
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,595
It's gonna get me my bank charter.

1114
00:57:31,387 --> 00:57:32,804
I'd like to show my appreciation.

1115
00:57:34,804 --> 00:57:36,637
That'd... That'd be great.

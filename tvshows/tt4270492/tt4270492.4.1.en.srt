00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:09,035
The case you'll be bringing is:
obstruction of justice.

3
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:11,326
Against the Attorney General.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,535
We need the icebreaker now.
We need Grigor Andolov.

5
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:17,952
[Taylor] International criminals are
unstable bedrock for a cap raise.

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,618
You don't think taking his money
was at least worth a discussion?

7
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:20,994
There was a discussion.

8
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,035
He said I was off the raise team.

9
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:25,702
[Foley] This is an object lesson.

10

[Chuck] of your fortune
on cheap steel deals.

19
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,118
It's not only illegal,
it's fucking dangerous.

30

and I will give it to Taylor.

32
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,368
[Taylor] A new kind of organization.

33
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,201
And you can make more than you do now.

34

I carry cash to and from the track,
to the garage and back.

164
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,702
My wife, look, the kid loves jewelry,

165
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,493
I need to know that we can
move freely and safely.

166
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:06,493
Mr. Brogan, do not get
a permit to carry a handgun.

167
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,493
You asked for my counsel,
that's my counsel.

168
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:10,201
No. I'm not here for your counsel.

169
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,410
You're supposed to be
a power broker now, right?

170
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:12,792
So broker some power.

171
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,869
Tap your relationship with
the Police Commissioner.

172
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,994
Unless, when they canned your ass,
you lost all your pull.

173
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,910
- Is that what this is?
- [chuckles] Please.

174
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,994
My favor bank is chock-full.

175
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:26,660
How's this:
I happen to have in my possession,

176
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:28,702
a Park-Anywhere Permit

177
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:31,994
direct from the Mayor's Office.

178
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,952
You can pull right up wherever
you're going, nice and safe,

179
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,577
no one will ticket your car.

180
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,660
You park on the sidewalk and
cops will have to walk around it.

181
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,118
Cops already walk around my car.

182
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,952
I have an ex-cop driving it.

183
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,535
I know a carry permit is
almost impossible in New York.

184
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,994
Yes. Toughest in the country.

185
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:52,035
Only ex-cops and ex-feds
gain concealed carry permits

186
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,118
- in New York City...
- And guys hooked up on high.

187
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,410
Which is what I figured you were.

188
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:58,493
But now it's clear, you're not.

189
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,452
[sighs]

190
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:02,994
[dramatic music]

191
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,785
[door opens]

192
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,744
Teva's about to announce,
you poised, Dollar Bill?

193
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,744
Aye, Captain.

194
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,285
If América Móvil gets whacked,
the peso goes with it, Ev...

195
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,869
I'm Everready.

196
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,785
Personal foul on the play:
Using your own nickname.

197
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,201
Hey, Rudy, where are you landing on Rio?

198
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,452
I'm seeing weakness
in Australian ore, so...

199
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,452
[chuckles] You're the
only weakness I'm seeing.

200
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,994
[Rudy] Wait, what?

201
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,618
Over in the kitchen
before the open you said

202
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,284
they were expanding their rail capacity.

203
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,869
- Yeah.
- So I thought they must be

204
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:29,910
expanding their CapEx and would
be down for a quarter or two...

205
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:31,285
That was your mistake: thinking.

206
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,827
Hey, what's the rumpus?

207
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,160
- I was...
- Nothing.

208
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:38,243
I want you two in sync like
incestuous ice dancers.

209
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,326
My thong's already riding up my crack,

210
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,076
I don't need you up there too, Axe.

211
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,493
Oh, that's exactly where I am.

212
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,243
That goes for all of you.

213
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,827
So give, Bonnie.

214
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,702
Fine.

215
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,493
They're expecting shipments
of 360 million tons.

216
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,243
The information is fucking out there.

217
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,869
[dramatic music]

218
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,452
Do you know why Ovi scores so much?

219
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,577
'Cause Backstrom shares the puck.

220
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,702
Yeah, but when he does,
Ovi goes bardown.

221
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,660
This lame loses the
puck between his legs,

222
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:12,869
or airmails it into the goddamn glass.

223
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,910
So I fire him,
and he never fucks up again...

224
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,910
- Right, Rudy?
- [Rudy] That's right, Axe!

225
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,660
And you signed your non-compete,
didn't you?

226
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:20,285
[Rudy] Of course!

227
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:21,577
Good.

228
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,493
Rudy, you're fired.

229
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,577
For,

230
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,452
for misreading Bonnie's information?

231
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:36,118
That and for fraternizing.

232
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,744
With our sworn fucking enemies.

233
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,910
Taylor Mason Capital picnic?

234
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:43,076
I accepted that invitation
a long time ago...

235
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,952
before.

236
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,660
- No one talked shop...
- Everyone else here declined.

237
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,076
Or didn't even fucking respond.

238
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,827
Public execution.

239
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,201
Power move.

240
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,076
Whose bits aren't hard, huh?

241
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,410
Gross.

242
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,785
This is a new day for Axe Cap,

243
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:01,410
so we will all share our information

244
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,160
or we won't be a part of it.

245
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,076
Get with it, or get fucked, people.

246
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,410
- So you're firing me too?
- No, he fired you.

247
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,035
I'm seconding it.

248
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,869
Go.

249
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:17,577
We now live in a universe
split down the middle.

250
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,702
You got to pick sides.

251
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,160
If you're not on mine, you're gone.

252
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,952
That was bracing.

253
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,118
I'm headed off to the
land of milk and honey.

254
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,577
Or their embassy, at least.

255
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,035
You sure you don't want to come along

256
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:31,326
and help me deal with the
sovereign wealth fund?

257
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,285
This is my sovereign wealth fund.

258
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:35,577
You really sure you want
me to deal with the royals?

259
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,368
Competition is probably
sending their top dog.

260
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:41,118
Oh, believe me,
they're not sitting down with Taylor.

261
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,035
They would never see someone like them.

262
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,410
And the sovereign money
is pledged to us already.

263
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,535
This is just about setting terms.

264
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,994
But that's the hard part.

265
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,535
Nobody's paying full freight anymore.

266
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,660
Wags, it's bad enough that
we had to go 2 and 20.

267
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:53,452
We gotta make our stand there.

268
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,368
We might as well be
running a mutual fund.

269
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:58,785
You go deliver this message
and get us our terms.

270
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,452
- Jawohl, kommandant.
- And cut that shit out.

271
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,285
Whatever you say, amigo.

272
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:07,243
I, Bryan James Flynn Connerty,
do solemnly swear...

273
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,994
[Judge Wailand] That I
will support and defend

274
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,577
[Judge Wailand] the Constitution
of the United States...

275
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,035
...that I will support and defend

276
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,118
the Constitution of the United States...

277
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:18,076
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

278
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,994
...against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

279
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:23,994
Our boy looks good up there, doesn't he?

280
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,535
Like he was born to it.

281
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:30,410
No one's born to it,
Ms. Sacker, not even you.

282
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,285
He had to kill for it.

283
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:34,869
'S what makes it worth something.

284
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,201
As you will likely find out one day...

285
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:39,727
So help me God.

286
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,577
So help me God.

287
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,577
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

288
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,952
[applause]

289
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,952
Thank you so much, Your Honor.
Thank you.

290
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,410
[sighs]

291
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,910
You finally made it.

292
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,035
Yeah. Long time coming.

293
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,535
First order of business?

294
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:06,326
Something I've been giving
a lot of thought to.

295
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,326
- I want to go after...
- Mr. U.S. Attorney,

296
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:14,076
I would love to borrow
you for a New York minute.

297
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,035
Mr. Attorney General.
I just want to say thank...

298
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,243
Yeah, faith bestowed. New beginnings.

299
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:21,076
Debts of gratitude. Fresh opportunities.

300
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,577
All those wonderful things.

301
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,535
Let's just consider that
covered, shall we?

302
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,827
- Okay.
- Move on to sloppy inheritances.

303
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,035
Cleaning up messes that came before.

304
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:31,904
We're talking about Chuck?

305
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,118
We are.

306
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:36,076
We get one chance to firewall
ourself off from his tenure,

307
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,410
and this is how we're gonna do it...

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,326
You can't get Brogan a gun permit?

309
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,326
[Senior] Pathetic.

310
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,118
Uh, we live in New York City,
Dad, not Beaumont, Texas.

311
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,785
Gun permits are quite hard to come by.

312
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:55,535
I sent that man in to you
because he is important

313
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,285
[Senior] in the very
city in which we live.

314
00:12:57,368 --> 00:12:58,577
And state.

315
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,368
With all the benefactors you will need.

316
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:04,368
- You sent him to me? Hmm?
- Who the fuck else?

317
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,118
You need to go on the offensive.

318
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:10,410
Because everyone else is
lining up against you.

319
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,660
Tell him, Ira.

320
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:15,201
- Hello, buddy.
- Your father is correct.

321
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,910
Most of your major cases are

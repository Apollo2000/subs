1
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,681
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

2
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:09,083
I sure as hell will testify
about what Chuck Rhoades did

3
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:12,269
and that Charles Rhoades Sr.
was steering his own money

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,282
and Chuck's money was
directly involved...

5
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,022
Stop.

6
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:17,591
I'm willing to pay you 30
million to tell the truth.

7
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:18,971
You'll give my people a statement

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:21,329
laying out how Rhoades did what he did.

9
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:23,597
How much do I use?

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,033
Just trace amounts on my signal.

11
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,069
Give up your so-called license to trade.

12
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,636
That is the only angle.

13
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,572
I can't be seen to be guiding the firm.

14
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:32,973
It'll all be up to you.

15
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,575
<i>The gaming license?</i>

16
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:36,888
<i>They're announcing soon,
and there's sure to be a bounce.</i>

17
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,945
My cash happens to be tied up

18
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,281
in a few real estate deals right now.

19
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:42,683
Let me guess.

20
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:43,917
Kingsford?

21
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,487
"The first ship to make a
manned mission to Mars."

22
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:50,323
I haven't stayed in bed
past 5 a.m. since 2001.

23
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,859
I had my man follow them.

24
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,961
Look at that morning-after glow.

25
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,999
Why don't you reach out, talk to him?

26
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,367
If there's any reaching out,

27
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:01,902
it should be from the other side.

28
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,437
What, you want me to initiate,
for Christ's sake?

29
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,639
They're in this.

30
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,708
I can't look away from it anymore.

31
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:33,264
Ira Schirmer showed us to the well.

32
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,767
But all we had to do was look down

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,503
to see the thick crude on our boots.

34
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:42,105
We tracked the size of your position.

35
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,442
Matching that of your son's trust.

36
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:47,711
The timing of the additional
investment corroborates

37
00:01:47,814 --> 00:01:49,480
Mr. Schirmer's affidavit:

38
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,917
Chuck directed you to invade the trust.

39
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:55,553
He baited Axelrod, he is complicit

40
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,388
in the sabotage of the Ice Juice IPO.

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,157
Don't say a thing

42
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,193
until they say the magic word.

43
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:11,634
We are prepared to offer you immunity.

44
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,703
That's the one.

45
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,905
In exchange for your cooperation.

46
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:21,444
Alternatively.
Perjury carries five years.

47
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,980
Tell me: You have that to spare?

48
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,724
_

49
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,907
Connerty knows what Schirmer was
trying to say in our interview

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,242
and is chasing it down.

51
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:57,112
I wouldn't be surprised if
he talks to your father.

52
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,514
Or already has.

53
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,182
That's disquieting.

54
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:03,751
Will your father hold
up under questioning?

55
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:07,287
He's a free-radical.

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,557
Not taking my counsel at the moment.

57
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,960
Then you have a real
and unsolvable problem.

58
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:17,164
So I have to get my
father to keep quiet.

59
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:20,901
And you need to remind Connerty
he has a fucking day job.

60
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,233
This is some
advanced real estate play.

61
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,369
Let the Saudis keep 432 Park.

62
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,905
This is the real prize.

63
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,840
The last burial plot in Manhattan.

64
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:05,144
And all the time to enjoy it.

65
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,947
Only 350,000,

66
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,616
and this cool slice of earth is mine.

67
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,588
Well... and long
may it remain unoccupied.

68
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,725
Mr. Axelrod.

69
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,805
We have eyes on the three
labs in the Tri-State area

70
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,328
capable of production and storage

71
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,697
- of the Ice Juice toxicant.
- FBI is interviewing

72
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,199
the lead techs at each of them.

73
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,167
- They'll be onto ours soon.
- By the time

74
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,470
they get to our lab,
make sure there is no lab.

75
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,904
Got it. What else?

76
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,806
Dake is protecting Rhoades.

77
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,374
Ira Schirmer saw it firsthand.

78
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,644
He also saw that Connerty,
if properly armed, won't let up.

79
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,346
You have the Schirmer affidavit?

80
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,648
Deliver it tonight?

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,350
Go arm him, gents.

82
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,792
<i>This is Charles Rhoades.</i>

83
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,629
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

84
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:20,483
You RSVP'd no, you hate reunions.

85
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,652
"The dead are more
present than the living,"

86
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,787
- I think you put it.
- Changed my mind.

87
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:32,561
Connerty's aware of my
father's involvement,

88
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,030
he's trying for details.

89
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,243
Hard to convince your
father to protect you

90
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,800
when you're not talking to him.

91
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:38,600
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:41,236
So, uh, Yale reunion,

93
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,404
here we come.

94
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:45,107
- They're giving him an award.
- Right.

95
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,777
Twenty-fifth and 50th
are the same night, so he'll be there...

96
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,778
He quite enjoys the
presence of the dead.

97
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,746
Makes him feel victorious.

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,385
You're gonna convince him.

99
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,586
For me.

100
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,189
For us.

101
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,424
Our family, yes.

102
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:03,559
We are.

103
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,360
Together.

104
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:38,258

<i>World-Aid is poised to provide</i>

107
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,612
<i>solar-powered, air-conditioned tents</i>

Bobby Axelrod.

111
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:06,886
Oscar Langstraat.

112
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,955
- I know who you are.
- Good to finally

113
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,923
- meet you in person, Bobby.
- You too.

114
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,591
So you, um,

115
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:14,960
you flew in private
to worry about a cure

116
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:16,795
for overheated Southern Africa?

117
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:19,598
Well, my plane
runs on recycled corn oil,

118
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,699
so it's all good.

119
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,801
Ah. That's what I have
my masseuse use too.

120
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,741
You're not as bad at
this as the articles say.

121
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,442
- At what?
- Small talk.

122
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,011
But I can see it's work for you.

123
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:35,046
Look, these charities

124
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,482
have basically become
feel good machines.

125
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,152
You gave ten mill. They'll say thanks.

126
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,088
They'll ask again. You'll give again.

127
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,722
But at the coming board meeting

128
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:46,957
I'm pitching a drastic shift.

129
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,661
I think that World-Aid
should<i> own</i> the company

130
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,095
that makes the solar panels.

131
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,097
- Rayveon Solar.
- Right.

132
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,533
That way,
when the panels go into wide use,

133
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:57,902
World-Aid itself profits from it,

134
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:59,870
grows, becomes self-sustaining.

135
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,138
Venture Philanthropy.

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,540
There's some of that
disruption you're famous for.

137
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:04,909
Disruption works.

138
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,977
It's uncomfortable but effective.

139
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,122
- Like rolfing.
- I don't know.

140
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,381
You might be able to sell that
shit out by the Bay, but...

141
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:14,451
Venture Philanthropy is the future.

142
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:17,587
I sought you out because
I want your support

143
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,155
when I bring this to the board.

144
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,958
My support isn't gonna help.

145
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,593
The folks on the World-Aid board,

146
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,562
they aren't in it for the future.

147
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:28,064
They like the access and
the status it gives them.

148
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,966
And they don't want to lose it.

149
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:33,303
Their risk tolerance is exactly zero.

150
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,205
Coach Tikhonov in Lake Placid.

151
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,975
That's a sport ball analogy, right?

152
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,343
Ok.

153
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:41,878
The future hurts.

154
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,479
But only once.

155
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,415
Denying it stings forever.

156
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:48,818
Like Shelob in Cirith Ungol.

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,321
Oh, that's a Middle
Earth/fantasy analogy, right?

158
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:53,689
Ok.

159
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,624
But the board doesn't take to outsiders

160
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,160
telling them how to do their job.

161
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,799
I bear an unpleasant communiquי:

162
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,401
Due to your legal entanglements,

163
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,903
the chairman has asked that<i> I</i> represent

164
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,840
the Axelrod Foundation
on the dais... in your stead.

165
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,541
I remember a time when ten million

166
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:16,778
got you on the main stage...

167
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,580
Go ahead, Ayles.

168
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,451
And there it is:

169
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,286
The only person the board mistrusts

170
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:28,456
more than someone like you, is me.

171
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:33,294
But I'm still on the board.

172
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:35,229
So I'll consider your proposal.

173
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,314
Good day to you.

174
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,117
I come bearing tithe. And a lot of it.

175
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,386
And is this gift unencumbered?

176
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:02,790
Once I get what I came here for,
use it how you'd like.

177
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:06,427
I want to secure the available
burial plot, for all time.

178
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,362
I'm afraid there is no
available burial plot.

179
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,064
Who snaked me?

180
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,467
An individual who had a prior
relationship with the Church.

181
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,739
I don't suppose you could tell me who...

182
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:20,907
Sorry.

183
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:28,581
<i>I knocked on your office door.</i>

184
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:29,849
<i>You weren't there.</i>

185
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:32,852
It's all one big office, Oliver.
Committed as we are.

186
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:35,521
So you must be
interviewing that lab tech?

187
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:36,656
<i>Later.</i>

188
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,925
I'm about to interview
another prime suspect.

189
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,260
Are you? Don't get waylaid.

190
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:42,962
Axelrod is the bullseye.

191
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,399
And the green ring around it, too,

192
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,567
whatever that's called.

193
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:49,935
The single bull.

194
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,070
Yeah.

195
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:54,239
That's Axelrod. The single bull.

196
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,920
Mr. Rhoades.

197
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:17,428
Brace a man while he's grooming himself,

198
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,764
hope the intimacy makes
him feel vulnerable.

199
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,900
An admirable tactic, Bryan.

200
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,802
This is a respectful courtesy call.

201
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,771
I'm letting you know,
before<i> anyone</i> braces you:

202
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:31,009
We're aware of your involvement
in the Ice Juice IPO.

203
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,311
I've known Ira Schirmer for years.

204
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,446
As my son's college roommate,
then lawyer.

205
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:38,048
So I threw a little capital
behind the boy's venture.

206
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,950
Not much more to it than that.

207
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,552
Yeah, that's how it'd look

208
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,921
if Ira weren't prepared to testify

209
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,223
about what really went on.

210
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:50,193
Well, I guess, you wait

211
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:52,662
for someone to embarrass himself,
he will.

212
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,965
We just need you to
confirm what Ira said:

213
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,834
Chuck directed you to invade his trust

214
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:02,039
and knowingly participated in
the sabotage of the company.

215
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,677
You must think I'm a physical moron.

216
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,812
That's Victorian for retard, understand.

217
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,848
- Mm.
- You want me to testify

218
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,450
against my son. At my peril.

219
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:17,453
And you don't even tender
the reach-around of immunity?

220
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:20,356
- If I had that to offer...
- You would have.

221
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,560
But you don't.
Which is too bad for both of us.

222
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:28,097
Maybe I'm as tired as you
are of my son's moves.

223
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,401
Maybe I'd even like to burn him down.

224
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,837
But we are a long way from that.

225
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,608
Now...

226
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,177
if you want to continue this,

227
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,112
we can do so in there.

228
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,283
Otherwise, I'm done with you.

229
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,994
Why does this keep happening to me...?

230
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,032
<i>I want you to introduce Taylor</i>

231
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,390
- to Rayveon Solar.
- The solar panels...

232
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,935
If we can make the
World-Aid board invest,

233
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,704
that stock will go through the roof.

234
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,772
So we need to be in position.
It's gonna be huge.

235
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,674
And I want it in the
main fund when I'm back.

236
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,476
- Then it'll be done.
- I can't be seen

237
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,679
as steering Taylor,
so put it in front of them. But don't.

238
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,715
What if we have Ayles do it?

239
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,316
Dress it up like it's charity.

240
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,118
He's the most subtle man we've got.

241
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah, but what if Taylor

242
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,321
senses you're behind it?

243
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,090
Will they steer away?

244
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,625
Well, all depends on what
has the stronger pull:

245
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,494
fear or money.

246
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,195
We'll find out when we find out.

247
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,897
Eventually, all comes clear.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,633
Speaking of eventuality...

249
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,468
somebody got cozy in my forever-bed

250
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,270
before I had the chance to secure it.

251
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:47,040
Can I use your team of ninjas
to help me find out who?

252
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,111
You know they're kind of occupied
with bigger shit right now.

253
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:59,418
But... what could be bigger
than your eternal resting place?

254
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,321
Go ahead.

255
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:03,790
<i>The countdown clock is</i>

256
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:06,626
<i>T-minus eight hours to launch</i>

257
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,629
<i>on tech titan Craig Heidecker's
first ride into space</i>

258
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,664
<i>and to the International Space Station.</i>

259
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,367
<i>This is the first stage in
Heidecker's ambitious plan</i>

260
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:17,203
<i>for an eventual manned mission to Mars.</i>

261
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,504
<i>Heidecker acquired...</i>

262
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,373
And the papers want
to know whose shirts he wears.

263
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,809
How did we ever think
to short that smile?

264
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,211
His charm is a liability.
It means people believe

265
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,280
whatever he tells them.
And he believes it, too.

266
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,515
It ends up having a
washing machine effect.

267
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,752
The stock will, pardon me, skyrocket

268
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,888
once he hard-docks at the Space Station.

269
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,922
Size it down?

270
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:38,990
Farpoint scrubbed the
last three launches.

271
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,859
Guidance and navigation each time,
no corrections found.

272
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,761
Another scrub sets them back two years.

273
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,299
Stock will dump, and they'll be
extra cautious with the CEO aboard...

274
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,466
Size up on the short.

275
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,402
I will. Can I be honest?

276
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,370
I'll be honest.

277
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,138
I'm rooting for him to get there.

278
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,509
I am too.

279
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,579
First step is the ISS.
Next, space colonization.

280
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,414
My bet is against his business model.

281
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:04,648
Not his vision.

282
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:05,683
Right on.

283
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,384
You give, we match!

284
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,420
During the GiveBack Charity Drive.

285
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:14,057
The largesse of Axe Capital
on display, base to tip.

286
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,693
Unless you don't give.

287
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:17,894
In which case we're
matching thin fucking air.

288
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:19,697
- The e-mail was received.
- I gave.

289
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:20,631
I saw the amount.

290
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,734
If that's giving,
I weep for the women in your life.

291
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:27,104
The Axelrod Foundation means well.
But is intrinsically inefficient.

292
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,207
I put my resources to good use,
when I find a deserving outlet.

293
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,641
Or are you not asking?

294
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,009
No, no, I get it.

295
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,847
Everyone from your prom date to PETA
coming to you with palms outstretched.

296
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,750
That's always the way it is
when you make your first score.

297
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,753
But Sean Ayles and what he does
with the Axelrod Foundation

298
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,654
is different.

299
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,556
Time you two thumb wrestle.

300
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,808
Who, in the name of goodness, is that?

301
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,143
That's the Bear Jew.

302
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,462
Savage.

303
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,964
Yes, he is.

304
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,600
For the cause.

305
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,301
As are we.

306
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,204
What's up?

307
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:37,538
Uh...

308
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:43,011
Seems that the disrespect
shown you at the tent demo

309
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,814
was symptomatic of an
entrenched ill-will.

310
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,450
They plan to hold a vote to
remove you from the board.

311
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:51,852
You had to know this was in the offing.

312
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,521
Also,<i> you</i> had to.

313
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,222
Is this a matter of public persona?

314
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,791
- Because there are ways to...
- No.

315
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,860
This is not a rehab play.

316
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:03,431
There are other reasons that
I need to stay on that board.

317
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,632
The vote, traditionally,

318
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,634
happens in absentia of
the person being removed.

319
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,837
I am unconcerned with tradition.

320
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,173
Off to lunch with your CIO.

321
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:17,845
Seems they're dubious of the
Axelrod Foundation's efficacy.

322
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:21,148
Look, I'm stuck here watching
skulls get crushed on TV,

323
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,984
so I need Taylor crushing
skulls on my behalf.

324
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,687
Make them see the efficacy
of the Foundation.

325
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,458
More specifically make them
see the play on Rayveon Solar.

326
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,062
Use all your powers
and all your skills...

327
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,876
Mick Nussfaur.

328
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,277
The fucking ambulance chaser?

329
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:53,379
Yes. New York's top
personal injury lawyer.

330
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,981
We can leverage. Has a girlfriend

331
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,782
- his wife doesn't know about.
- Wife is ill.

332
00:17:56,884 --> 00:17:58,650
Girlfriend's family rich and powerful.

333
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:01,420
Her parents have a
mausoleum in Green-Wood.

334
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,589
This I can and will work with.

335
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:04,690
Bill me for your time.

336
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,892
Axe offered to cover.

337
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:09,395
I hope you're as good to
each other as he is to me.

338
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,572
Our lab tech.

339
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:23,875
The one we had as likely
supplying the toxin...

340
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,845
He boarded a flight for a far off land.

341
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:35,252
It seems "later" was too late.

342
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:41,325
I told you what to focus on, you didn't.

343
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,396
Get on those remaining accomplices.

344
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:55,172
<i>I'm aware of your
skepticism of what I do.</i>

345
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,241
Philanthropy is a cesspool.

346
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,542
The charities you give to

347
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,811
are blind to the problems
they aim to solve.

348
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,979
Even Bill Gates. He gave malaria nets.

349
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,048
And people used them as herring nets.

350
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,750
Only they were coated in chemicals.

351
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:07,951
So coastal West Africa

352
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,454
ends up with depleted
and inedible fish stocks.

353
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,322
They<i> asked</i> him to stop helping.

354
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:14,758
Axe is forensic

355
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,961
and demands maximum
efficiency in all pursuits.

356
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:21,097
Look at the World-Aid solar
tent initiative in particular.

357
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:24,000
Twenty million people on the
verge of famine in Africa

358
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,501
due to the rising temperatures.

359
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:28,836
Both they and their
barley must be kept cool.

360
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,906
This is a real answer.

361
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,209
I'll review the brief.

362
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,346
And it is sent.

363
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,028
Mr. Wagner.

364
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,429
Reading your medical report,

365
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:57,599
I expected you to be
wheeled in on a gurney.

366
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:01,136
This isn't yours, it's a ploy...

367
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,805
I needed to see you and
didn't want you forearmed.

368
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:06,008
Oh, so this is adversarial?

369
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,576
I hope it's mutually advantageous.

370
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,545
I come to you, not with physical injury,

371
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:14,348
it's true, but with a lifetime
of spiritual harm done.

372
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,317
Not my racket.

373
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,053
Unless there's one third
commission on salvation.

374
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:20,287
I think not.

375
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,758
Then talk in a language I
might understand, or leave.

376
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,459
I'm here for the burial plot.

377
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,461
To suggest that you move on.

378
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:30,064
If you know that I maneuvered
my way into getting it,

379
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,733
then you have to know that
I'm not about to let it go.

380
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:35,369
I'm offering you something better.

381
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:39,606
I've secured you a prime
patch at Green-Wood.

382
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,341
P-7 tract.

383
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,478
That's not an offer. That's a threat.

384
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:48,148
To what, expose my side piece?

385
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,983
I know you care for her.

386
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,519
Care for her? I love her.

387
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:55,121
Tits made to fit in a
nice sized martini glass.

388
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:57,657
I'm sure you've seen pictures.

389
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,759
And this way, you can lay together

390
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:02,862
in her family's mausoleum.

391
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:05,265
I had to ensure others would be moved,

392
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,100
all under cloak of secrecy,

393
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:09,235
so that no one would
know about any of it

394
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:10,770
until you were gone.

395
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:14,306
What's the rest,
you're gonna tell my wife?

396
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,575
I'm trying to protect her.

397
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:18,277
So I have something you want
and you're coming for it.

398
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,245
That's an average Wednesday for me.

399
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,247
The cuticles.

400
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,149
You do that while getting fellated?

401
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,885
Long as I nut, who cares?

402
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,054
Are you offering to
fellate me for the plot?

403
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,521
'Cause that's a hard no.

404
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,094
Look, man,

405
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:38,830
I have fucked up a lot in life.

406
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,632
I want to do death right.

407
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,934
Wagner, you're not my problem

408
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,104
on either side of the mortal plane.

409
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:47,672
How's this: The plot is yours.

410
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,675
If you take immediate occupancy.

411
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,745
Otherwise, be the fuck from my office.

412
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,324
Legend is, King Cole

413
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:10,428
is releasing his royal
air under that robe.

414
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,029
That's why he smiles.

415
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,499
Because the jesters have to take it.

416
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,801
It's a gesture of respect

417
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,370
that we alerted you in
advance of your removal.

418
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,406
And what a kindness that is.

419
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,610
Yet it's of a different style
than the one I showed you.

420
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,713
My support of our worthy cause.
My fucking ten million.

421
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,882
Look, Bobby.
It's your board-appointed right

422
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,150
to appear at the meeting.

423
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,452
But you know how things leak.

424
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:40,023
I wouldn't want you to be
portrayed as desperate and begging.

425
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,896
I'm a problem for you.

426
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,665
Your board thrives in the dark,

427
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,701
slurping up the fringe bennies...

428
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,203
the five star lunches, the golf junkets,

429
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:58,708
the safaris under the guise of
"fact finding missions."

430
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,044
My presence shines an unwanted light,

431
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,947
'cause I'm someone who
actually works for a living.

432
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,249
The conduct of the board,
under<i> your</i> direction,

433
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,118
will be found out.

434
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,854
And nothing will change.

435
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,923
Because that's how
it's been for all time.

436
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,925
Mm.

437
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:21,863
A little cronyism greases
the wheels of the machine.

438
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:25,634
And no T-shirt Billie
with the law on his tail

439
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,602
is going to change that.

440
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,574
Fart in my fucking presence

441
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,143
and your reign will meet a swift end.

442
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:42,017
<i>We'll return to the frolic,</i>

443
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,987
but a few awards must find
their deserving recipients.

444
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,825
The first is a
Distinguished Service Award.

445
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,260
Given to an individual

446
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:56,264
who has exemplified the<i> Lux et veritas</i>

447
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,966
that guides this institution:

448
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,968
Mr. Charles Rhoades.

449
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,377
My remarks would pale

450
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,748
beside those of someone
who knows him best.

451
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,616
So.

452
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:19,386
A surprise guest to present this award.

453
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:23,290
US Attorney for the Southern
District of New York.

454
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:27,794
Mr. Chuck Rhoades Junior.

455
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:42,075
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

456
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,210
Uh...

457
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:46,913
It was a short walk for me to get here.

458
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:51,884
My 25 year reunion is
happening 100 yards east.

459
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:53,020
So...

460
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:57,790
But in truth...

461
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:02,695
it's been a short walk for me
to get most anywhere in life.

462
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:07,699
My father, Charles Rhoades,
made sure of this.

463
00:25:07,802 --> 00:25:11,703
He had me at 25 years old.

464
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:14,940
An age at which I was
finishing law school.

465
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,910
Drinking as I pleased.

466
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:20,212
Chasing women,

467
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,213
if not always catching up.

468
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,385
But my father stepped up and sacrificed

469
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,854
the remaining years of
his life as a young man,

470
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:34,793
to ensure that I got the<i> right</i> start.

471
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:37,261
And as I grew,

472
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:41,432
he taught me to recognize
and seize opportunity.

473
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:45,336
The value of loyalty and alliances.

474
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,107
The obligations of privilege.

475
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,443
In essence,

476
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:55,446
he gave me the key to the
workings of the world.

477
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,884
He handed me<i> every</i> advantage.

478
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:04,855
And his sense of duty has carried forth.

479
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:11,061
The Distinguished Service Award.
To a distinguished man.

480
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,762
A life of service.

481
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,499
Come get this thing, Dad.

482
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,202
Oh.

483
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,165
Dad.

484
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,705
You played those heart
strings like Orpheus.

485
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,376
To no avail.

486
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:03,845
And on this hallowed ground,
the site of my greatest conquests,

487
00:27:03,947 --> 00:27:08,917
you have the impertinence
to show your weakest self.

488
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,856
Connecticut Hall.

489
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,726
I fucked three girls in there once,
in a 24 hour period.

490
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:20,395
One in the can.

491
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,131
You screwed a girl in a dorm bathroom?

492
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,301
No, sonny.

493
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,972
Well. That was before AIDS.

494
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:32,273
Wouldn't have stopped us.

495
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,741
Fact that it stopped your
generation says it all.

496
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:37,377
We forged ahead, damn the torpedoes.

497
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:42,416
I should have known better.

498
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:45,485
The sentimental approach was
never going to work on you.

499
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:51,724
I realize I may endure the
consequences of what I've done.

500
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:53,827
May go down.

501
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,063
And if you are unable to protect me...

502
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,165
I want to know that
you'll protect Kevin.

503
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,135
Be the man in his life.

504
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,705
My speech was under false pretenses.

505
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,907
But there was truth in it.

506
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,378
You were a role model.

507
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:18,384
The boy will be looked after.

508
00:28:18,486 --> 00:28:19,452
Ok.

509
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:23,188
But please,
none of that Uncle Maurice shit.

510
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:26,358
We walk in together.

511
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:29,427
You collect your wife.

512
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,465
Some people find you impressive.
So you will shake a few hands.

513
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,867
Then leave.

514
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,140
<i>Manticore-2 sits ready to launch.</i>

515
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:46,911
Last scrub was T-Minus 8.

516
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:49,014
<i>T-Minus 10 seconds.</i>

517
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:52,650
It's gonna happen...

518
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:56,854
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

519
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,161
<i>And we have liftoff.</i>

520
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:40,597
<i>We're now standing by for updates...</i>

521
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:42,098
Who's gonna say it?

522
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,104
Fuck it. I'll say it.

523
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,175
Farpoint is gonna<i> tank!</i>

524
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:56,912
It's payday on that beautiful short!

525
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,117
You didn't put a banana
in his tailpipe, did ya?

526
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,089
Yeah! Fuck, yeah!

527
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:34,015
Hey.

528
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:38,419
Craig Heidecker died.

529
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,860
His... it, exploded.

530
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,165
Well isn't that a shame...

531
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,534
A real goddamn shame.

532
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,709
I'm sorry, Wendy.

533
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,115
For your loss.

534
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:14,187
Mr. Rhoades,
I wanted to introduce myself.

535
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,890
- My son was...
- Excuse me.

536
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,492
My son was on the law review with you.

537
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,063
He admired you greatly.

538
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,099
As the manager of the factory,

539
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:29,935
you know the placement of
the surveillance cameras.

540
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,472
But not well enough to avoid them all.

541
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:35,808
We have you pissing in the soup.

542
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,977
And people's lives were
placed in jeopardy.

543
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,280
Which puts your freedom
in that same position.

544
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,281
I was told they weren't in any danger,

545
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,916
that a doctor was consulted.

546
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,718
A doctor?

547
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,021
Trace amounts, he said.
Keep it as safe as can be.

548
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,424
The man who instructed you.
Describe him.

549
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,326
Fifties.

550
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:55,861
Bald.

551
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,529
Glasses...

552
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:59,231
Medium nose.

553
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:06,104
And like that. Work begets results.

554
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:09,441
I looked closer.

555
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,976
Pierced the firewall
on Senior's position.

556
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,979
And its size matches that
of a trust in Chuck's name.

557
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:17,548
Question is:
did Senior violate the trust?

558
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,450
Or was he directed to do it?

559
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:22,787
Hm.

560
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,252
Important questions, no doubt...

561
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,658
The only ones that fucking matter.
And about time we got the answers.

562
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:30,128
Can't look away from it anymore, Oliver.

563
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:34,232
Perhaps an exploratory meeting
with Rhoades Senior then.

564
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,567
I may have already done that.

565
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:37,468
Ah.

566
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,103
He's gonna require immunity to come in

567
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:41,105
and I'm gonna offer it.
But I need your sign off.

568
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:43,407
Or furnish me a fucking
reason you'd refuse me.

569
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:44,842
In writing.

570
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:47,510
Offer it.

571
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,894
Bourbon in a cup.

572
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,342
Thanks.

573
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,713
So you knew.

574
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:28,584
- Had me followed.
- No, no.

575
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,387
But my father did.

576
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,656
And he told me.

577
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,892
Took pleasure in it.

578
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,829
Chuck... It...

579
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:44,400
It was a symptom of...

580
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,702
disarray in our marriage.

581
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,138
I caused that disarray,

582
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:54,276
and it has since been ordered.

583
00:33:57,815 --> 00:34:01,283
And we're going to leave it at that?

584
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:04,452
This won't come back around later.

585
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:07,956
It leveled me, Wendy.

586
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,557
That's the truth.

587
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:16,197
Broke parts of me I didn't know existed.

588
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,636
But that pain focused me,

589
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:24,271
on priorities both work and home.

590
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:27,574
So I'm glad for that.

591
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:29,877
And if it does rise,

592
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:34,381
I will do my best to bring it
to you in a civilized manner.

593
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,567
Ahh.

594
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:59,038
I told you about my first time.

595
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:01,841
- With the junior...
- Yes.

596
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:04,244
Yes. Wasn't so.

597
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:07,413
She was my first amateur.

598
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:11,217
Uncle Maurice took me to a brothel

599
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,887
on my fourteenth birthday.

600
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,454
So young.

601
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:17,089
That's practically Kevin's age.

602
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:18,323
Yeah.

603
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:25,765
I was as ashamed as I was nervous

604
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,600
as I was excited.

605
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:33,438
And Uncle Maurice swore it
would be between me and him...

606
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,509
but when I got home,
my father was waiting up for me.

607
00:35:37,611 --> 00:35:40,078
And he knew all about it.

608
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,948
Told me<i> he'd</i> picked Ginger for me,

609
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,119
that he<i> knew</i> she'd get
the job done right.

610
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,521
Take me "'round the world."

611
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:52,557
You discovered he was unfaithful.

612
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,058
Mm-hmm.

613
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,696
And it was the first time

614
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:01,800
my father ever said he was proud of me.

615
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,746
So... how was Ginger?

616
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,685
Well, Dad was right about that.

617
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:25,199
Yeah. She took me 'round the world.

618
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,724
Ohh.

619
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,329
- Yeah?
<i>- It's happening.</i>

620
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:34,297
<i>Your father is being brought in.</i>

621
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,132
<i>All on the record now.</i>

622
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,001
<i>You'd better prepare yourself.</i>

623
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:50,145
Connerty's got my father.

624
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:52,147
Hm.

625
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:55,317
This evening was a misstep.

626
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:59,088
I should know the man by now.
Anticipate his reactions.

627
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,590
Not act on what I hope them to be.

628
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:04,493
You do know your father.
And how he responds.

629
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:05,827
All too well.

630
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:07,696
That's right. I do.

631
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:09,465
And you need to use that.

632
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,367
Exploit it.

633
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,762
_

634
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:21,510
Just occurred to me.

635
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:25,680
We only sup when
difficulties are at hand.

636
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:28,316
But perhaps this time is different?

637
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,720
My father's going to serve me up.

638
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:37,423
So you may need a new
horse for the governorship.

639
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:41,661
Well, only so
if you're willing to surrender.

640
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:45,264
- Are you?
- I am not, willingly.

641
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:48,735
But circumstance may cost me it.

642
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:51,047
I have tried

643
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:53,906
almost all manner of appeal.

644
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,941
Almost all...

645
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,313
Well, then I believe Joe
Scolari can be of help.

646
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,182
Your father's Kingsford land

647
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,851
is in the good state senator's domain.

648
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:09,487
Which presently works
in your father's favor.

649
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,456
But that can change.

650
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:18,496
To do so, however,
would be a move you cannot walk back.

651
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:23,568
So, are you sure?

652
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,908
<i>Craig Heidecker's wristwatch</i>

653
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,043
<i>contained 456 pieces.</i>

654
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,744
<i>Inside a 38 millimeter case.</i>

655
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:36,681
Hand assembled by one horologist
over the course of a year.

656
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:39,584
Some of the pieces are
invisible to the naked eye.

657
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:42,286
It's precise to plus or minus
point-five seconds a day.

658
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:46,123
As close to faultless
precision as possible.

659
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,025
That's how he lived.

660
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,594
I know how he lived.

661
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,898
We, uh...

662
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,400
worked together. Briefly.

663
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:05,242
Look, he understood

664
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:08,112
precision is an objective, not an end.

665
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:10,614
It's what gets one as near
to perfect as possible.

666
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:15,518
But perfection is unobtainable.

667
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,053
That's hard for you to accept

668
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:20,724
because in some areas
it is within your grasp.

669
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,092
Math is perfect.

670
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,016
And he did the math.

671
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,795
A thousand times a day,
a thousand days in advance.

672
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,397
Before he put his life inside
that vessel. I am sure.

673
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,400
But there's always "X." The unknown.

674
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,669
A buildup of oxygen
in the aluminum liner.

675
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,871
Can't be solved for. He'd know this too.

676
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,040
And he decided the risk was worth it.

677
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,408
The success of that mission

678
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,577
would determine the
viability of his vision:

679
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,412
To make the universe hospitable.

680
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,947
Because we'll need it to be.

681
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,950
I knew the risk was too great.

682
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,385
The signs read this way.
And I bet against him.

683
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,190
He wanted to save our lives...

684
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,159
I profited off his death.

685
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,397
You lost a hero and
were rewarded for it.

686
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,832
These things are in conflict.

687
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:10,372
But conflicting emotions
require<i> we</i> resolve the conflict.

688
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,607
Can they be resolved?

689
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,042
One emotion has to prevail.

690
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:16,545
Otherwise you languish
while the dispute carries on

691
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,880
and you miss opportunities.

692
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:24,518
It's normal to feel two things at once.

693
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,921
But when you're here.

694
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,490
Mind the truth that makes you money.

695
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:39,132
I brought pie. So to speak...

696
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,867
Seeing as we'll be neighbors.

697
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:41,968
Oh, it's you.

698
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,837
The plot is spoken for.

699
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:44,971
Nussfaur?

700
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:46,840
I heard you're on your ass.

701
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:49,310
You can't afford a
choice patch like this.

702
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:51,812
That's fucking hilarious,

703
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,980
considering my wire
has already been sent.

704
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,215
Is that right?

705
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,084
Just here to sign.

706
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:59,152
You can kiss my red eye on my way out.

707
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:02,689
Things I'm hearing,
I'd check the wire if I were you...

708
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,758
Knock yourself out.

709
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:12,965
It... appears his...
your deposit has been retracted.

710
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:15,401
There's insufficient funds.

711
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:16,902
That's bullshit!

712
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:19,405
I keep 350 in my car ashtray.

713
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:21,040
Sir, if you can't pay...

714
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:23,042
I can and I did.

715
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:24,544
Probably over extended.

716
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:27,813
His marriage is collapsing
like the walls of Jericho.

717
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:29,915
Where'd you get that crap?

718
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:32,985
I read about you being outed
with your mistress on Page Six.

719
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,420
May I?

720
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,357
Shit!

721
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:41,293
I'll have you hoisted by your
scrotum for this, Wagner.

722
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:46,531
So now you have a vacancy.

723
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:50,469
And now you don't.

724
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:56,841
<i>You leave boards all the time.</i>

725
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:58,643
Yeah. When<i> I</i> fucking choose to.

726
00:41:58,745 --> 00:42:00,845
I don't choose to leave this one.

727
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,613
So you're not gonna go gracefully.

728
00:42:02,715 --> 00:42:04,482
I am going into that room,

729
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:06,384
and I am gonna play duck duck goose.

730
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:08,953
I'm gonna remind each and
every fucking one of them

731
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,389
how I've personally enriched them.

732
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,057
And I am calling in the return.

733
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,160
There's little to be
gained by instigating foes.

734
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,430
Then they will be taught there
is no strength in numbers.

735
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:20,898
Fats McCarthy,

736
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,267
he killed 22 Germans and captured fifty.

737
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,136
A half-kilometer of a
trench by his own hand.

738
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:27,738
I can take this fucking board.

739
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,540
So you're an army of one?

740
00:42:29,642 --> 00:42:31,675
And fortified.

741
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:37,681
There<i> is</i> a toxicity

742
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:39,783
that comes with being
charged with a crime.

743
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:42,953
Sure, it may matter
to people in finance,

744
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:45,222
but their reputations
are buttressed by money.

745
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,824
Philanthropies<i> only</i>
have their reputation.

746
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:50,893
And you are a threat to theirs.

747
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,496
It's like academia.
Everything's a big fucking deal,

748
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:55,498
because the stakes are so small...

749
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:02,339
So this is where we live now...

750
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,473
in retreat.

751
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,608
We fall back. We preserve.

752
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:07,910
We defend.

753
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:16,285
It'll pass when you clear your name.

754
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:18,855
But for now, you need to embrace

755
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:22,324
the victory of self-awareness.
Because out in the world,

756
00:43:22,426 --> 00:43:24,460
you might keep taking losses for awhile.

757
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,129
That's where you're at.

758
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:33,101
We both are.

759
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:52,120
I'd like to push the final
item to the top of the agenda.

760
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:54,955
Changing the agenda
requires a unanimous vote.

761
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,224
I'll expedite: you don't have it.

762
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:00,928
Fine.

763
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,630
First order.

764
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:05,199
Oscar Langstraat,
one of our most important donors,

765
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:08,503
would like to address
the board regarding a...

766
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,938
Venture Philanthropy initiative.

767
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,339
Thank you.

768
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,341
I value your good works.

769
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:18,712
But organizations must change,
because the world is changing.

770
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:22,349
Venture Philanthropy,
conducted with precision and care,

771
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,683
is that change.

772
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,185
We'll need those tents in here,

773
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,054
you keep pumping in the fucking hot air.

774
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:29,823
There'll be no crosstalk.

775
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:32,692
So<i> I'll</i> just talk.

776
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,195
Venture Philanthropy can work.

777
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,499
But it requires a rigorous
level of oversight.

778
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:42,101
This group isn't built for that.

779
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:45,638
Then what are we built for, Axelrod?

780
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,107
Listen, Langstraat,
I'd love to let you burn them,

781
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,676
in the name of burnishing your own rep.

782
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:54,080
But I cannot let you hurt the
people of sub-Saharan Africa

783
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:57,550
just so you can be part of yet
one more cutting edge movement.

784
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:59,152
Wake up, Axelrod.

785
00:44:59,254 --> 00:45:02,020
Cystic fibrosis is on the
verge of being treatable,

786
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:03,856
or even curable, thanks to VP.

787
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,357
They've created a way

788
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,860
to earn the money they need for research

789
00:45:07,962 --> 00:45:10,062
instead of endlessly fundraising.

790
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:13,966
Look. Don't try
and reinvent who we are, here.

791
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:17,602
There is a reason for
the tried and true...

792
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:20,372
it may not be perfect, but it works.

793
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:24,876
Look, you will make fools of yourselves.

794
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:27,412
A 50 million dollar
investment in Rayveon Solar

795
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:31,183
would allow the people to bypass
Africa's failed electric grid

796
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:34,318
in the way cellphones
bypassed its phone lines.

797
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,321
They'll be able to power homes,
businesses, indoor farms...

798
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:38,857
Like the bard says:

799
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:42,460
save the bold moves for
the brilliant players.

800
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:44,562
That ain't you.

801
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:47,832
And it sure as shit isn't anybody
sitting around this table.

802
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,834
Spoken like the overpaid
day trader you are.

803
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:55,272
So says the fucking
Northern California pipe dreamer.

804
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,974
Don't do it, people.

805
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:03,514
Mr. Langstraat's
proposal goes to a vote.

806
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:06,383
Those in favor of establishing a fund

807
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:08,619
for the purpose of venture investment.

808
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:11,021
As I, for one, certainly am...

809
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,160
You're making
a bigtime fucking mistake...

810
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:23,400
The motion passes.

811
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:28,538
As will, I expect, the next.

812
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,306
I motion to remove Robert Axelrod

813
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:33,443
from the World-Aid Consortium
Board of Directors.

814
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:34,777
Those in favor.

815
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,817
The Board thanks you
for your contribution.

816
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,701
To what do I owe the pleasure of a visit

817
00:46:59,803 --> 00:47:02,471
from the only state senator who matters?

818
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:06,808
I felt it was only right
to let you know personally:

819
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,477
The Kingsford land

820
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:12,814
may need to be reassigned
as a conservation area.

821
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:18,086
Eastern elk need all
the help they can get.

822
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:22,490
Delicate species,
require a certain habitat.

823
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:26,561
Whereas a casino, like a fungus,

824
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:29,230
will thrive in any dank climate.

825
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:36,836
If the casino moves,
my land up there is worthless.

826
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,307
This is some overreach
of the canton, Joe.

827
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,149
Eastern elk need all
the help they can get.

828
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:51,084
Delicate species.

829
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:53,252
Require a certain habitat.

830
00:47:57,784 --> 00:47:59,357
_

831
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:01,661
We are prepared to offer you immunity

832
00:48:01,763 --> 00:48:04,396
in exchange for your cooperation.

833
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:08,867
Alternatively.
Perjury carries five years.

834
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,637
Tell me: You have that to spare?

835
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,750
Ira is a liar.

836
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,257
A disgruntled, failed investor.

837
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,294
I touched my son's money
because I saw a win.

838
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:38,095
I believed it was within the scope

839
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:41,098
of my power as Trustee.

840
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,901
Chuck was my victim.

841
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:47,972
And we were both victims
of Bobby Axelrod.

842
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:49,759
Do you know what happens

843
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,542
when that statement gets
rebutted in open court?

844
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:56,346
I don't want to put you in jail,
sir, but I will.

845
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:11,195
We've both loved this man...

846
00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:14,130
you as his father, me as a sort of son.

847
00:49:14,232 --> 00:49:17,834
But it's time to do what's right.

848
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:26,442
I would've thought that
my son trained you better

849
00:49:26,544 --> 00:49:28,778
than to rely on emotion,

850
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,549
when only true fortitude
will get the job done...

851
00:49:38,256 --> 00:49:40,923
You have my statement, buckeroo.

852
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:57,072
Well. I gave you your shot with him.

853
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:59,441
Now, pick back up
on the other witnesses.

854
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:11,152
Do you carry this model?

855
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:13,288
The 5270R in rose gold.

856
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,556
We do have one.

857
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,199
Perpetual Calendar chronograph.

858
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:27,668
Silvery Opaline dial.

859
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,670
Day, month and leap year in apertures.

860
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,940
Moon phase...

861
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:35,943
Sapphire-crystal case back
with hinged dustcover.

862
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,746
Fold-over clasp in 18 karat rose gold.

863
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,184
164,400 dollars.

864
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:45,719
You're welcome to try it on...

865
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,020
I'll take it.

866
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:55,829
Nice piece.

867
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,964
I'd forgotten what
your voice sounds like.

868
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:00,533
Because I only heard it
through Wags. Ayles.

869
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:03,036
You had them work me on
the tent initiative...

870
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:05,138
The message was received.
I saw the play.

871
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,506
Well enough to act on it?

872
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,475
I bought a basket of
solar to obscure it...

873
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:11,076
ten names... including Rayveon.

874
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:12,144
Good.

875
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,079
The board approved the venture fund.

876
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:17,350
Rayveon Solar is churning panels
out of Shenzhen right now.

877
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:18,902
Your play all along.

878
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,420
Get the board to expand the initiative.

879
00:51:20,522 --> 00:51:22,789
Axe Cap reaps the win on manufacturing.

880
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,325
Your aim is true. So is mine.

881
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:26,558
Heidecker.

882
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,061
Farpoint stock price went
the way of its founder.

883
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:30,229
Our short paid big.

884
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,401
About halfway through your screed,
I realized:

885
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:37,837
You weren't insulting me.

886
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:39,104
We were dancing.

887
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:41,740
Well, I couldn't
rid myself of my toxicity

888
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:43,342
so I aimed it.

889
00:51:43,444 --> 00:51:45,744
For my benefit. They hate you so much,

890
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:48,112
they forgot that they hate me too.

891
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:50,181
Thank you for throwing the vote my way.

892
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:51,616
My pleasure.

893
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:52,751
Oh, I imagine it is.

894
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:54,720
I'm guessing you laid a healthy position

895
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:57,322
in Rayveon Solar in
advance of the outcome.

896
00:51:57,424 --> 00:51:58,957
Oh, no, I don't trade equities.

897
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:00,058
I do.

898
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,194
Oscar, my CIO, Taylor Mason.

899
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:09,334
Did you buy in yourself?

900
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:10,768
I don't burn from both ends.

901
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:13,571
It's in the interest of my
brand to be above reproach.

902
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,406
Well, I don't have that luxury...

903
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:16,507
or burden.

904
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:18,909
The fund really is to
World-Aid's benefit.

905
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,044
They'll never know
the good you did them.

906
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,314
To the good we've done.

907
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,483
And will do.

908
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,725
Do you know why Ethiopians eat this way?

909
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:37,560
Shared? In the center?

910
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:41,432
It's to foster a sense of community.

911
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:42,265
Keep everything in the open.

912
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,067
So everyone sees how much is available.

913
00:52:44,169 --> 00:52:46,303
And everyone knows they
got their fair share.

914
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,171
It keeps everyone honest...

915
00:52:48,274 --> 00:52:50,673
We've all done well today.
All got our portion.

916
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:53,175
But you two might be better
suited to a steakhouse.

917
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:55,077
Where everyone has his own plate.

918
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,816
Plenty such establishments
in Mountain View.

919
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:01,951
And I'd be happy to host.

920
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,287
You two would find fruit
in our humble valley.

921
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:07,890
I'll leave this to you two to carve up.

922
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:57,939
I'm proud of you, son.

923
00:53:59,976 --> 00:54:01,509
You did what was required.

924
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:05,613
Fucked me good.

925
00:54:05,715 --> 00:54:06,681
Damn the torpedoes.

926
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:49,188
Bravo, Wags.

927
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,860
As the epitaph shall read.

928
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,595
I thought this was a vanity play.

929
00:54:56,697 --> 00:55:00,566
But. More a matter of legacy.

930
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:01,800
Some people frontload,

931
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:04,603
establish their legacy early in life.

932
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:07,272
I've left mine to the end...

933
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:10,676
Or hopefully it's only the middle.

934
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:12,711
Who knows?

935
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,047
Heidecker knows.

936
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,315
Fuck, 33.

937
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:18,550
Too soon.

938
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:21,420
No, dying in your thirties is "tragic."

939
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:23,355
As is forties.

940
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:26,191
Sympathy dissipates from there.

941
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:29,727
Fifties is "such a shame."

942
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,263
Sixties is "too soon."

943
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:32,931
Seventies... "a good run."

944
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:36,668
And eighties is "a life well lived."

945
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,271
Nineties...

946
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:45,543
That's a fuckin' hell of a ride.

947
00:55:57,957 --> 00:55:59,623
Don't get too comfortable.

948
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:05,329
A hell of a ride.

949
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:20,500

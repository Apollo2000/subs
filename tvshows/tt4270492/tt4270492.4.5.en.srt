About us.

00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,387
Foley is terminal.

00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,512
He didn't see a doc
until it was everywhere.

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,011
So I'm proud of all of you
put through college

7
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:19,762
by the memorial foundation
so far.

This development
is my legacy.

10
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:26,553
This would be a disaster
and create a possible scandal.

11
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:28,720
It's all you say it is, Dad.
Let's do something with this.

12
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,804
I...In my private life...

13
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:33,178
In the confines
of my happy marriage...

14
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:36,261
with my consenting wife...
practice sadomasochism...

15
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,428
I am done
hearing you talk.

16
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:41,720
By day's end,
you will be the presumptive

17
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:44,970

goddamned State.

18
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,053
Congratulations, Chuck.
Can't wait to work together.

Bravo.
Thank you. Uh...

50

It's an honor
all around-

51
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:13,887
Wendy's first night out
in a month.

52
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,178
Well, the chance
at a perfect pizza-

53
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,637
in total privacy-
was too much to pass up.

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,929
Privacy? If the only way I could
eat this pizza was naked,

55
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,845
in the middle of Times Square,
I would.

56
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,178
Yeah. You would.

57
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,887
You might even
prefer it.

58
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,512
The problem is, you'd be sure
to undress me, too.

59
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,845
Whether I wanted it
or not.

60
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,679
You're doing this,
here?

61
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,011
You did it.

62
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:42,011
It's really only
the ones we love, huh...

63
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,470
That make you want to kill them?
Hmm.

64
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:47,178
Exactly.

65
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:51,428
See.

66
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,136
Yes.

67
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,303
But even that you know
the story ahead,

68
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:58,679
there's no starting from zero
for me anymore.

69
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,387
Used to be.
Mm. Mm.

70
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,929
I could say:
I'm Wendy.

71
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,512
Go from there.
I could add Rhoades,

72
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:07,720
and to someone in finance
it meant one thing,

73
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,679
to someone
in government another.

74
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,136
If I'd say Dr. Wendy Rhoades,
it meant something else.

75
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,637
Still holds.
All that still holds, yeah-

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,553
-Or I could say:
I work at a hedge fund...

77
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:17,679
- Uh-huh. -...and we're off
in a different direction.

78
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:22,011
But I was the one
to decide the what and when.

79
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,470
Build a relationship.
Now?

80
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,637
They just know...
all of it.

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,345
Everybody does.

82
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,220
Chuck was in
a tough spot.

83
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,637
Yeah, there wasn't many moves
he could make to win,

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,970
so he chose
the one-

85
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:37,261
Yeah. He did.
He chose.

86
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,387
And now I can't
walk down the street.

87
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,261
And I'm no longer
a blank slate

88
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:45,387
for the guys I'm supposed to
treat, inspire, change.

89
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,220
There's this giant
thought bubble

90
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,011
just sitting there
between us.

91
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,261
And it features me
with whips and chains.

92
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:57,011
When I misplay
something publicly

93
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:59,053
and I feel like
everyone's staring at me,

94
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,428
I take comfort
in this fact:

95
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,970
most people are self-absorbed
narcissistic assholes.

96
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,929
So they might revel in your shit
for a minute,

97
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,762
because it
distracts them from theirs.

98
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,762
But after that minute,
they're gonna forget about you,

99
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:15,970
just go right back
to their own shitpile.

100

Few million dollars,

I never wanted
Grigor Andolov's money.

176
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:03,553
I lobbied against it once.
But then I took it on.

177
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,512
And it sustained us
like an internal organ

00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,345
and now, without it,
we're gutted.

And it's not just about
his money.

180
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,345
When our reduced AUM
goes public,

181
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,970
our investors
will be wondering

182
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,136
about our stability
and flowing out with him.

183
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,762
I still look at you like Vincent
Vega did Jules Winnfield-

184
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,178
the smartest
and toughest fella in the room.

185
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,929
Thank you,
Mafee.

186
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,970
But I really don't need people
telling me how smart I am.

187
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,762
I don't feel very smart
at the moment.

188
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:25,261
I built
a turbo engine here

189
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,095
and the nitrous tank
blew up in my face.

190
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,637
So we've learned
that lesson

191
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,845
and now:
we do the thing you do best.

192
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,428
Both of you. Go invest
in undervalued equities.

193
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,470
Let me do
the thing I do best:

194
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,178
create the most
helpful environment

195
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,595
in which
for you do it.

196
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,887
Yes.
To that end, I have made a move.

197
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,428
Investor Relations.

198
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,387
You know
how Winston Wolfe

199
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,512
solved
dead body problems?

200
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,679
This one solves
dead balance sheet problems.

201
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,095
Is she super young,
early 20s,

202
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,387
too hip for this business?
Mm.

203
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,387
In that case,
I think she's already here...

204
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,053
Welcome, Lauren...

205
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,720
Lauren Turner,
this is Taylor Mason, your boss.

206
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,637
Pickle juice?

207
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,595
Best hangover cure
I have found.

208
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,428
And I have searched.

209
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,929
Don't worry,
this is not where I shine.

210
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,887
This is where
I store up energy

211
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,470
so that
I can shine later.

212
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,387
What-
What do you need, boss?

213
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,053
A Grigor-sized replacement.

214
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,345
Those don't exist.
Not for you.

00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,011
Not today.
Fuck.

216
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,053
Don't sugarcoat it.
I'm ready to kill.

217
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,845
Just not sure who...

218
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,512
There aren't
a lot of institutions

219

I can think of one.
Right here in the City.

222
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,470

223
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,011

They were.
But not lately.

226
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,428
They are allocating
up to three point one billion

and health fund.

And are currently
hearing pitches.

229

Is that correct?
It is.

touch him again.

I'd be sending you anything

323
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,512
but a hearty
'how's my ass taste?'

324
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,679
As you
must surely know,

325
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,679
since you are loitering
outside my chambers,

326

328

00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,553
too far.

336
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,845
I took a pay cut
and came over here from SDNY

337
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,679
specifically
so I could punch

338
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:52,637
some wrong-doers
in the face.

339
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
No one's stopping you.
Who's stopping you?

340
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:57,136
The State of New York,
which ironically

341
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,303
grants the AG very few powers
by statute.

342
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:02,845
Yes. But the rest of my armament
is granted by executive order.

343
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,470
As in
the governor...

344
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,136
Well apparently he woke up
with morning wood

345
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,470
and decided to jam it
right up our hind quarters.

346
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,428
I went to file
for a records subpoena

347
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,345
on Taylor Mason
like you asked,

348
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,345
and the clerk
refused to issue it.

349
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:17,804
Seems we have no authority
at all, currently.

350
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:21,136
I know
where this started.

351
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,762
Half-crow, half-cowboy,
all sonofabitch.

352
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,428
Who else?

353
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,845
I've been
checking around.

354
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,887
I haven't gotten answers
from all parties yet-

355
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,470
Who else?
This is something

356
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,387
you should really
let me be thorough on.

357

-Rush to judgement's

You're the only one
John Rice cashed out.

360
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,053
Fuck.
I'm sorry, fré.

361
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:49,887
You being 'sensitive'
is intolerable.

362
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,428
Stop it.
Oh, thank God!

363
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,053
Let me do it.

364
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,220
Let me loose the hounds of hell
on this ingrate,

365
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:57,428
this near-millennial
scumbag.

366
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,970
I will flay his skin
from his bones

367
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:02,970
and I won't stop
until...

368
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,804
Is the idea
that if you get here real early

369
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,345
and don't
turn the lights on,

370
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:15,887
no one will come
looking for you?

371
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,053
Oh, did I forget
to turn on the lights?

372
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:22,470
No.
You didn't forget.

373
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:24,095
I didn't.

374

Yet you walk in.

375
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,887
Well,
I need you.

376
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,679
Something
you should have thought about

377
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:31,887
before taking
Chuck's side.

378
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,470
Oh.
I was taking your side.

379
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:36,428
'Cause it's not healthy
for you

380
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,053
to be in a place of shame
or disgrace. No reason to.

381
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,470
This all hurts you,
actually.

382
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:41,929
How am I supposed to do
what I do?

383
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:43,220
No way.

384
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,762
This makes you better.

385
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,053
This makes you
more of an exotic species

386
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,261
they need to impress
with their alpha dog energy.

387

where we talk about me.

But thank you.

389

John Rice.

391
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:04,512
Kid walked in here
and handed me back my money.

392
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,011
Only you?

393
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,345
No. Not what he said,
but yes.

394
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,762
Is it the rejection
or the embarrassment?

395
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,595
Normally,
a guy takes

396
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,512
what I consider to be
an aggressive line against me,

397
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,345
I cut him down
like the Mongol hordes.

But this time you don't feel
the hot anger,

Once I caught the harmonic
frequencies on the lathe,

482
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,053
the cuts got finer.

483
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,595
It'll hold up
to wind tunnel tests,

484
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,637
I just need to rent the tunnel
to be sure.

485
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,970
Here...

486
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,053
Materials. Equipment.
Expenses that need to be covered

487
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:38,303
to get us
to a place

488
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,303
where aerospace firms
will be believers.

489
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:41,720
Buyers.

490
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,845
Not the best time.

491
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,303
I'm trying to get money
flowing in not out.

492
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,970
Why?
Because it's been flowing out.

493
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:51,845
Flowed.
Like a geyser.

494
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,011
Why is that
such a problem?

495
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:54,553
I'm not
being simple.

496
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,053
I want
to understand.

497
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,261
I need size.
To do what I do.

498
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,095
The margins on the trades
are small

499
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:00,679
so we rely on the amounts
being big,

500
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:02,178
to pull down
real profit.

501
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,720
I'm not interested
in being boutique.

502
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:05,553
I didn't want
to say,

503
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:07,428
because I'm impressed
with what you've built.

504
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:08,804
And the culture.

505
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,804
But there are
other things you can do

506
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,220
at the highest level.
Not just make money.

507
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:16,261
This is about your old boss-
Axelrod, isn't it?

508
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:17,929
About making more money
than him?

509
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,470
That's right.

510
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,804
More than anyone else
on the Street too-

511
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,553
in absolute returns.

512
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,387
And to do it again next year.
And the year after.

513
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,136
I get it,
you're a competitive animal.

514
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,887
I guess I didn't expect
such...machismo from you.

515
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,679
I might find your effort
at exploring my true purpose

516
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,345
a little more affecting
if it didn't feel like

517
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:36,428
the purpose you wanted me
to pursue instead was yours.

518
00:22:36,512 --> 00:22:38,387
Sorry.

519
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,553
I'll keep refining
the CNC program...

520
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:43,303
until you're ready.

521
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,178
Axe.

522
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,637
Hey. Uh...

523
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,887
I know
why you gave the money back.

524
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,220
I fucked up.

525
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,428
Should have done more
than said hi

526
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,762
each time I checked in
on my account.

527
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,845
Please.

528
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,261
Your father.

529
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,428
He was a mentor to me
at the old firm.

530
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,845
I was supposed to
stand in,

531
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:32,428
try to fill
that role for you...

532
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,345
Yeah.
Not that anyone could.

533
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,053
He used to take you fishing.
Yeah.

534
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,512
Sun Valley.

535
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:42,136
Fly fishing for, uh,
rainbows and monster browns.

536
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,553
Yeah. What about salt water?
You ever do that?

537
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:46,845
Out in the deep water...
Dad? No. Never.

538
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,970
Strictly, uh-
Strictly rivers.

539
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,929
Let me take you.

540
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,470
Let's hit it.

541
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:55,261
Yeah. Okay.
When?

542
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:57,387
Now.
Axe-

543
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,720
Stripers aren't running,
but we can still chunk for them.

544
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,345
And blues
are always a great fight.

545
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:02,804
All that to get me
to keep your money?

546
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:04,512
Nah, forget about that.
That's done.

547
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:06,095
You make plenty of money,
I make plenty of money.

548
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,220
This is about
doing right.

549
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:11,720
About re-upping a job
I slacked on.

550
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:14,470
Come on, let me do
what I pledged to do.

551
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,303
As your father
did for me.

552
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,887
Come on.

553
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,428
Okay.

554
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:26,136
Yeah.
Fuck it.

555
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:39,053
Don't remember you ever
actually shopping, Dad.

556
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:41,553
My little blue helper.

557
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,220
I can't send the girl
to pick it up.

558
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:45,553
Hard to explain
when your mother confides in her

559
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:48,762
that we haven't coupled
since Tony Orlando last charted.

560
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:50,303
No son should hear
that kind of-

561
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:51,804
You should,
Sonny.

562
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:54,261
Look around.

563
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:56,720
What do you see?

564
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,762
Pantyhose and deodorant.

565
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,303
Before there was a Duane Reade
on every corner,

566
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:03,011
this,
and places like it,

567
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:05,178
is where history
got made.

568
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:07,428
This was
Toots Shor's place.

569
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:10,428
Chaplin came in
for the steak.

570
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,595
I once witnessed
Shor himself

571
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,303
drink Jackie Gleason
under the table.

572
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:19,595
But more importantly,
half the Albany power brokers

573
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,053
enjoyed cocktails
and rubbed shoulders

574
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:25,637
with mobsters
and Broadway stars in here.

575
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,762
This is where you met
Black Jack Foley.

576
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:29,220
Right there.

577
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:30,762
At the bar.

578
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:33,011
And you dragged me over here
to, what?

579
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,428
Uh,
pour one out for him?

580
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:35,762
That's not why-

581
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,470
Dad, I'm pretty
fucking busy.

582
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:38,762
Are you?

583
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:41,011
Because as I
understand it,

584
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,595
you've been spayed and neutered.
Well, I plan to-

585
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,136
Whatever it is,
it won't be enough.

586
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,011
The first time
that I met Foley,

587
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:53,887
he told me about
this alderman

588
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,095
who could barely
tie his own shoes.

589
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,136
Rumor had it
he was inbred.

590
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,553
But Jack Foley had it
in his mind

591
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:03,345
that the mayor of Utica
needed to be replaced-

592
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,303
wasn't toeing the line,
so to speak.

593
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:06,804
Let me just
skip to the end.

594
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:09,053
So Black Jack
took this idiot alderman

595
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,887
and made him mayor.

596
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,845
Oh, you are awfully smug
for a man with no real clout.

597
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,720
Anyway, one day,
as I'm getting out of the car,

598
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:19,303
they are
cutting the grass

599
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:21,053
across the street
from my country place-

600
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:24,053
and you know
who is pushing the mower?

601
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,470
The former mayor.

602
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:27,845
Yes.
Of course he is.

603
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,845
I'm in it, Dad,
trying to get back my authority.

604
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,553
Aim higher!

605
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,178
Don't just get
your juice back, Sonny.

606
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,679
Send a fucking message.

607
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:41,428
The Mayor wasn't toeing
the line,

608
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:45,595
so Foley
made him a lawn boy.

609
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,762
You've got to show them
what you do with power.

610
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:54,387
Now, for longer than
he was your enemy,

611
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,679
Black Jack Foley was
in your corner.

612
00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:00,929
So take this one last lesson
from him...

613
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:04,512
Make them fear me.

614

he's found a way

He did it.

and his cabal

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,512
Yeah, you look like
Benjamin Button.

642
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:25,178
So, Rudy-what was the name
of that, um...

643
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:27,136
apparatus he had?

644
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,053
Ah,
the fleshlight.

645
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:31,345
The repository for all of
the sadness of the male world.

646
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,762
And whose...
model was it?

647
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,220
I believe he had
the Lisa Ann.

648
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:38,512
She is a first ballot
hall of famer.

649
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:39,720
You buying someone
a gift?

650
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,387
You're password hunting.

651
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:49,011
I need to look at
his social media.

652
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,303
Rudy's?

653
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,136
He'll be the easiest
to get into.

654
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,053
I tried to get a keystroke log
from IT,

655
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:55,887
but they erase
every two weeks...

656
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,762
Chuck opened up
a part of my private life

657
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:59,178
when he made
that speech.

658
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:01,345
Made me vulnerable.

659
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:03,762
Any employee's vulnerability
is a threat

660
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,470
to Axe Cap
and our business.

661
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:08,011
So I need to know
what our enemies are saying.

662
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:09,470
They're saying plenty.

663
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,011
Other firms.
I went down a rabbit hole.

664
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:15,011
But Rudy is in contact
with our chief enemy, so...

665
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:17,470
'Password is no longer valid'.
He changed it.

666
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,887
May I?

667
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,553
Nicole Aniston.

668
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:28,053
Blair Williams.

669
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:30,261
No. Wait.

670
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:35,512
Cory Chase.

671
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:36,887
If you're
a Lisa Ann fan,

672
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,428
you're
a Cory Chase fanatic.

673
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:39,929
She's a national treasure.

674
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:44,428
Oh, hey-
uh, Benjamin Button

675
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:47,095
at the beginning
when he's old and crusty,

676
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:50,053
or at the end when he's got
the baby smooth skin?

677
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,220
Right?!

678
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,136
Rods and bait
are on board...

679
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:12,637
We gonna
do this right?

680
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:15,637
Won't get any service
out there anyway.

Oh.
Fuck that.

687
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,637
Let's talk about
the real stuff.

688
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,095
Your Dad.

689
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,804
You know, I used to
get my ass out of bed

690
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,929
at 4:30
every morning.

691
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:44,970
No matter what,
he always beat me to the office.

692
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,929
One morning, he's yea deep
slinging Asian long bonds-

693
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,136
yelling at everybody
to bring him a coffee,

694
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,804
not realizing it was only 6am
and no one's in yet.

695
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,970
No one but you.
Fuckin' right.

696
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,679
So you
made him coffee?

697
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:00,970
What am I,
his secretary?

698
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,595
Oh. He didn't drink
the office swill anyway.

699
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,303
I went out
for it.

700
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:06,929
Light and sweet.

701
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:09,679
He was impressed
that I'd paid attention

702
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:12,178
to the stuff
that didn't matter...

703
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,428
because of course
it matters.

704
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:16,220
Everything fucking matters.

705
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,387
So I should pay attention
to the details?

706
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,178
And watch your six.

707
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:22,512
Same rules for investing,
cards-

708
00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:25,720
And women-
Exactly...

709
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,095
He was
a hell of a gin player.

710
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,804
The partners would play
for five cents a point,

711
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,845
and he'd rough them
all up.

712
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:36,595
I used to love
watching that.

713
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:45,637
You got your meeting
with the smoke eaters.

714
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,011
How?
Johnny Utah's.

715
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:50,845
You wanted to know.

716
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:52,679
So, shots
and a mechanical bull?

717
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:55,679
And my group of pretty,
personable young friends, yes.

718
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:57,679
Those are
the raw materials,

719
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,345
but what I make of them
is the art.

720
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:03,762
And I suddenly understand
why I now employ an IR person.

721
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:05,387
Now,
onto the meeting itself,

722
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,845
a bit
of forewarning.

723
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,387
Everyone is getting
a half hour.

724
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,303
We got ten minutes.

725
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,011
The last slot before the
board breaks up for the season.

726
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:14,303
It's a mercy fuck.

727
00:32:14,387 --> 00:32:15,970
These guys
didn't want to see you

728
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,261
because you came up
under someone they hate.

729
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,011
If they buy MaseCap,

730
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:23,220
it'll be because you sold them
a better story.

731
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:26,679
A story about you that they like
more than they hate Axe.

Where is...everybody?

736
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:58,845
Conference room.
On what-

737
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,720
Whatever it is,
I'm not needed.

738
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,261
And neither are you.
Or you'd be in there.

739
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,136
I think you might have
forgotten to-

740
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,679
You will be called
when and if needed.

741
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,011
Here's what
we're gonna do.

742
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:30,929
Times of tragedy call for
silence and sustenance.

743
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,512
Hear hear.

744
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,303
And what
I want to add is-

745
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,762
Times of tragedy

746
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:39,720
call for silence
and-

747
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:47,220
Well, we will all miss
Black Jack.

748
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:51,387
He was like
a father to me.

749
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,470
He was the type of man
I always wanted to be.

750
00:33:54,553 --> 00:33:56,679
A breed
that has been dying...

751
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:58,720
And now has died.

752
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:02,512
This is
a real loss.

753
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:05,095
But it's also...
a new day.

754
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:07,804
For just
as he was not your father,

755
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,136
his vendettas
do not live past him.

756
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,720
You are free
to vote your conscience

757
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,095
and your interests.

758
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,762
And to once more
embrace me.

759
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:19,053
Especially when
to do otherwise

760
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:21,428
would not be
in your interests.

761
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:27,220
Some conscientious members
of my investigative team

762
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:30,011
have collected
this list of misdeeds

763
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,679
by the State Assembly.

764
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,804
I see...
Mm.

765
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:37,053
This is unfortunate.
It is.

766
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:42,136
Especially since
you're on it.

767
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,428
Now, I can go and build
all these cases

768
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:47,136
and hand them to the press
and the Feds-

769
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,929
the US Attorney himself
greeted me on my own steps

770
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:52,303
my first morning-
inviting this.

771
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:56,053
Or, if you will substantiate
this information,

772
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,804
I could take
a different path.

773
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,178
Ignore these violations-

774
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:02,845
by you
and your closest confederates-

775
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:06,220
so long as you all vote
to restore my powers.

776
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:12,053
Times of tragedy
call for-

777
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:14,970
Yes.
Silence and sustenance.

778
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:20,136
And a new spirit
of cooperation.

779
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,804
Okay.
Keep on him.

780
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,220
Keep on him.
Where is he?

781
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:31,345
- Here we go.
- You got him.

782
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:32,720
Oh, he's fighting.
He's a fighter.

783
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,428
Get him tight on the line.
Bring him in.

784
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,887
Good.
He's a beaut!

785
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,845
Bring him in.
Yeah, he's fighting...

786
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,261
All right.
You got him?

787
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:43,804
I got him.
Whoo!

788
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,387
Aah!
Nice.

789
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,220
- Oh, my God. Look at that.
- Yeah!

790
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:50,595
That's huge.

791
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:56,428
Whoo!
Nice fish.

792
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,512
You want to eat him, or let him
go to fight another day?

793
00:35:58,595 --> 00:35:59,929
Throw him back.

794
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,804
Ah. A true sportsman.

795
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:06,970
Want a beer?

796
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:09,011
Yeah.

797
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:25,970
Ahh.

798
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,970
You know,
before you call timeout,

799
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,220
you might want to check
with Chris Webber.

800
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:32,387
Sometimes,
there are none available.

801
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,929
Mm.
Here we go.

802
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,512
Oh, no.
You want to hear this.

803
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:37,220
That's why you really
came out here.

804
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:39,011
To have me
talk some sense into you.

805
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,637
The way
your dad would have.

806
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,887
I know how it is.

807
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,720
You have your ideas,
your information,

808
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:46,303
your strategies.

809
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:50,053
And it all makes sense
up to a few hundred million.

810
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:53,595
And then you get to a billion
and you think:

811
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,720
how do I deploy
all this?

812
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:58,512
You know?
Will it work at this size?

813
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,220
Is my analysis
solid enough?

814
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,011
And where's my edge
gonna come from?

815
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,595
So you scan
the horizon,

816
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,011
you throw yourself
against the questions,

817
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:08,679
and new strategies,
on the new scale,

818
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,804
present themselves.
And you just get bigger.

819
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:14,387
It's the biological imperative
for guys like us.

820
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,929
Is it, though?

821
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:18,762
What else would it be?

822
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:20,512
Chasing?...

823
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:22,345
When I think
about managing,

824
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:23,679
much less making,
another billion-

825
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:25,637
and not feeling
that good about it-

826
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,011
I just want to go Natalie Wood
off the side of this thing.

827
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,762
That's another
solid reference.

828
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,929
You know
your history.

829
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:35,261
You got
some philosophy.

830
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:37,512
The money that I spent
to educate you

831
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,387
did not go
totally to waste.

832
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,345
The best education, though,
is living it.

833
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,595
Don't imagine what it's like
to run two billion.

834
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,261
Or five.
Or ten.

835
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,053
Just fucking run it.

836
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:50,470
Why do you think
I staked you?

837
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:51,804
To be nice?

838
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:53,428
That's what school
was for.

839
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:56,303
That's what
the Christmas presents were for.

840
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:57,637
The investment?

841
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,762
It's 'cause
I saw something.

842
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,512
A work ethic.

843
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,387
Pride. Hunger.

844
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,720
But now I'm seeing something
I don't like.

845
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:07,929
Contentment?

846
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,720
Fear.
The mind-killer.

847
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:13,804
I'm not afraid,
Axe.

848
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:15,178
Good.

849
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,804
Should I tear up
the check?

850
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:19,845
Got it
in my pocket.

851
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,887
Maybe not yet.

852
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,136
Should we call it?

853
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,804
Sure.

854
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:48,595
Oh.
You're fucking kidding me.

855
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,470
Maybe it's the fuel line?

856
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,178
What,
on each of the engines?

857
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,261
Nah.
We got a short somewhere.

858
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,553

We need a tow.

Vanquisher.

It'll- It'll be

Uh. Keep us updated on
your position if you drift.

867

But we're jammed up-

Make it a hundred.
I need to get the fuck in.

Sorry, Vanquisher,

I might take my fund

That was the point.

When I got old enough,

920
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,887
I heard all the stories

921
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:57,804

When I was

Radical. Worth millions.

939
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,637
But taken from him
by the company he worked for.

940
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,303
He never saw a penny, never got
his name on the patent,

00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:15,929
never got anything...

except fired,
as soon as it was convenient.

They stole his contribution

944
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,970
He never saw it coming.

945
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:26,136
Never paid attention
to where he was vulnerable.

Every other manager
walking through that door

is probably pitching you
investment strategy.

949

Giving you value, small cap,
hedge, bond, sector, global.

950
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,595
But they're not paying attention
to where you're exposed.

951
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,470
Or to what's stalking you.

Death.

Seventy percent of your members

fifty-two percent

961
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:04,553
are their contribution
and value.

962
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:08,136

Sorry, Governor,

When I made them aware
that I was aware

988

there was a sudden willingness

Yeah. In return
you bury it all.

He was a Caesar.

And what did they do
at the funeral of a Caesar?

1013
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:33,428
At the funeral
of Gaius Julius Caesar,

1014
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:35,053
a man stood at the rostrum

1015
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:39,011
and called out criminals
and conspirators.

1016
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:42,303
Those in the senate
that would sully Caesar's city

1017
00:46:42,387 --> 00:46:44,637
and dishonor his legacy.

1018

they had done in the senate,

1021
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:01,845
they set upon them,
tearing some apart,

1022
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,303

from the city.

A few bugs,

but it'll be ready when

Good.

I've decided I will help you

Would you have done it

Yeah!
So, we caught two blues,

1143
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,011
a few sea bass
and a nice striper...

1144
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:01,470
You know,
we did a bit better.

1145
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:05,428
Of Rice's billion,
we put 741 million into play...

430 of it,
including your 100 and change,

1147
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,303
came on board...

1148
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:15,303
The rest exited
and is in the ether...

1149

Vanquisher, uh,

A loss for him
was a win for us today.

00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:32,011
I never thought I'd be part of
a real life Wannsee Conference.

1153
00:53:34,136 --> 00:53:36,679
Or that
it would be so much fun.

God, I wish I saw
the look on his face.

Yeah, yeah!

1159
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,595
You're back
above ground,

1160
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:01,136
finally letting the team
see your face.

Turns out you and Rebecca

But also right.

You weren't
making more of it?

No, sir.

The thinnest
Google search reveals

1166
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:14,303
that people
are fucking obsessed-

1167
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:17,178
they want to know
what whips I use,

1168
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:19,011
what bustier I wear,

1169
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:21,595
what Chuck sounds like
when he squeals.

1170
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:23,679
I'll admit to wondering
about two of those.

1171
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:25,345
Kind of like
a stuck pig.

1172
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,261
Mm.
Not that one-

1173
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:31,136
The thing is: as I read it,
it stopped mattering.

1174
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,011
Stopped really being
about me.

1175
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:34,762
Stopped having anything
to do with me.

1176
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:36,845
Because I don't know those
people. And they don't know me.

1177
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:39,512
So you snapped
the computer shut and moved on?

1178
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:41,178
I think you know
I did not.

1179
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:44,053
I had Rudy's
sad social media password,

1180
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:46,762
saw what the Mason Capital folks
were saying.

1181
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:49,804
How bad?

1182
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:53,345
About what
you'd expect.

1183
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:58,053
Gifs, photoshops of my head
on Dita Von Teese's body.

1184
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:00,845
Mm.
Everyone piled on.

1185
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:02,512
Except Taylor.

1186
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:04,220
Oh. Taylor stayed
above the fray?

1187
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:05,845
No.
More than that.

1188
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,428
Told them to stop.

1189
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,595
That someone my age
shouldn't be mocked

1190
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:11,845
for getting her kicks
however she needed to.

1191
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,136
Wow.
Yeah.

1192
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,762
I guess
it makes sense.

1193
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,261
After
the whole thing broke,

1194
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:17,887
they were the only one
to reach out.

1195
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,679
They reached out?

1196
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:22,762
I didn't take their call,
of course. But they tried.

1197
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:24,220
Taylor really did that...?

1198
00:55:24,303 --> 00:55:25,512
Yup.

1199
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:27,136
Guess they think
I'm so pathetic

1200
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,637
as to no longer pose
a threat.

1201
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,261
No, that is the act
of an open and evolved person

1202
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:33,929
who understands
vulnerability...

1203
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,470
Lame.

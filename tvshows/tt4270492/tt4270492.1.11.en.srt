1
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:09,513
Previously on "Billions"...

2
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:11,481
- Cancer?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,017
- Shit.
- Pancreatic.

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,085
Walter and the kids gonna have enough?

5
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:17,955
Nobody's gonna starve, but
I could've done better.

6
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:19,389
Forty million.

7
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,191
What if we could get you there?

8
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:24,094
It won't be simple. It'll
require deception.

9
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:25,595
And your final weeks and months,

10
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:26,896
they won't be your own.

11
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:29,533
Bobby Axelrod used Donnie
to feed us information

12
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:32,936
that he would never live to testify to.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,106
Donnie's gone.

14
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:40,242
How long you figure it's been
since we've had a session?

15
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:41,578
I made some decisions.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,779
You shuttered it.

17
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,447
Selling the farm, too.

18
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:45,682
You know, if you had

19
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:46,950
listened to me in the first place

20
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,484
and hadn't blown up the
deal with Axelrod,

21
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:50,720
we would not be in this spot, would we?

22
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:54,623
The game has changed, and you
haven't changed with it.

23
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,226
Your advice is no longer welcome.

24
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:00,896
It was hard on Donnie,

25
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:02,565
not being able to tell you.

26
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,467
Did other people know?

27
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,635
Hey. What are you doing here?

28
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:08,837
He is a candidate for
a drug trial in Pittsburgh

29
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,572
that's been yielding some
pretty interesting results.

30
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:13,341
Kind of rough for a guy who's
been through a lot already.

31
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,977
It can be.

32
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,712
Maybe we shouldn't bring it up.

33
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:28,656
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

34
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,671
What the fuck?

35
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:46,806
- Mafee wants to see you.
- I just waved him in.

36
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:48,374
He wanted me to ask you permission.

37
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:49,976
Permission for what?

38
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,012
He comes in here all the fucking time.

39
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,614
Door's always open. You know that.
I love Mafee.

40
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,215
He wants to talk about BioLance.

41
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,651
Oh. Well, in that case, fire him.

42
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:00,119
Yeah. He said that you said he's
not allowed to bring it up.

43
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,622
No, he can, if he wants to get fired.

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,223
Right, but if he doesn't bring it up,

45
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,924
he thinks you're gonna lose 400 million.

46
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,560
And since he's executing the trade...

47
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:10,029
He thinks I'll fire him then.

48
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,731
Sticky. I can see how that's sticky.

49
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,467
Can he come in?

50
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,635
Of course. I love Mafee.

51
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,708
It's okay?

52
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,376
We'll see.

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,413
Axe, special announcement call

54
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,950
from BioLance is in nine minutes.

55
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,686
I've been losing sleep over
it, and I sleep like a bear.

56
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,321
Brown or polar?

57
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,522
Which hibernate?

58
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,191
They all... hibernate.

59
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,092
They're bears.

60
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,861
Then both, but not lately.

61
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,263
Uh-huh.

62
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,599
I can pare our position before the call.

63
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,834
We can still make 10%.

64
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,036
If we hold and I'm right,
what do we make then?

65
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,537
We double our money.

66
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,673
If we were a benchmark
fund, ten would be great.

67
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,241
But we are no benchmark fund.

68
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,410
I'm just afraid we're gonna lose.

69
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,513
All my research is telling me
that approval is a coin flip.

70
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,381
Right. Do Ben Kim and
all the other analysts

71
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,250
agree with you?

72
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,518
To a man.

73
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,324
First, I told you yesterday
and the day before

74
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,891
that I understood the risks.

75
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,261
I've done the channel checks.
I've done the homework.

76
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,396
BioLance's inhibitor is
gonna be lights out.

77
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:22,465
Six other companies have
inhibitors in the works.

78
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,568
Only one's gonna win
approval and market share.

79
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,371
That's why I think we
should wait, get in later.

80
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,440
Oh. Second, you're fired.

81
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,943
I'm fired?

82
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,611
That's what he said.

83
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:38,314
We're already in BioLance.
That's where the win is.

84
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:41,384
I-I just don't see what
the difference maker is.

85
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,586
I'm the difference maker.

86
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,290
I tried.

87
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,058
You tried.

88
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:52,228
And now I'm fired.

89
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,897
Goodbye, Mafee.

90
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,601
The next voice you hear

91
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,604
will be the BioLance
CEO, Brooks Wellever.

92
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,306
- So you all know

93
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:07,042
how important the development
of our SGLT 2 inhibitor

94
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:10,179
for treatment of Type 2
diabetes is to this company,

95
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,713
how deep our investment has been.

96
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,649
And I wish I had better news.

97
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,985
We were just notified by the FDA

98
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,286
that we were denied approval.

99
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,824
We estimate a time
horizon of five more years

100
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,025
to complete fixes.

101
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,827
But at our current burn rate of cash,

102
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,528
we only have three years
of operating ex...

103
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,560
What's the damage?

104
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,228
Stock is halted until the morning,

105
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,763
but there are no bids in sight.

106
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,733
- It's gonna be ugly.
- Shit.

107
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:09,769
430 million dollar loss.

108
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:11,070
Could turn into twice that.

109
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,996
What are you doing?

110
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:40,632
You fired me.

111
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:42,501
You know never to listen
to me about shit like that

112
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,370
between 9:30 and 4:00.

113
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,171
How could I fire you?

114
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:48,340
I love you, Mafee.

115
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,794
- Hey.
- Wendy.

116
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:13,498
Oh, I am so glad
you're thinking about us.

117
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,066
Hey, Roma wants to give
you the tour herself.

118
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,036
How are you?

119
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,138
Work is a happy place now.

120
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,474
Come on. I'll introduce you.

121
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,709
Great space.

122
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:28,312
I have an eye for it. Even
better one for talent.

123
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,414
I knew that as soon
as you snagged Maria.

124
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,449
She's a perfect fit.

125
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,886
We value fit, culture, more than most.

126
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:39,056
That's why 60% or so
of our PMs are women.

127
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:42,626
Makes it easier to practice
socially responsible investing.

128
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:43,860
Is that the mission?

129
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,595
The mission is profit.

130
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:48,031
But me and a few of the senior partners,

131
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,265
we came up at a time

132
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,635
when Wall Street was all cock and balls

133
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,603
...and no brains.

134
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:56,372
We try to practice with a
little less ego around here

135
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,910
in a more collaborative,
inclusive environment.

136
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,146
But it's a delicate balance.

137
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,580
You don't want a bunch
of guys running around

138
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,949
with sawed-off shotguns,

139
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,283
but you don't want scented candles

140
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,052
and an aversion to risk either.

141
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,421
That's for fucking sure.

142
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,022
We need someone to curate that balance,

143
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,458
someone who's been through the wars,

144
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,526
who's seen the other side.

145
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,628
You want me to make
your people assassins.

146
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,129
We want them to be able

147
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:23,532
to access that mentality when needed,

148
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,000
with great accuracy.

149
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:27,636
Yeah. Assassins. It's
kind of my specialty.

150
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:28,938
I know.

151
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,638
No other performance
coach in the industry

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,207
would be a better fit.

153
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,476
And you're already an investor.

154
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,379
We need you,

155
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:39,781
and you wanna be here.

156
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:44,286
I'm curious. Why do you
think you know what I want?

157
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,154
I mean, it's a hard thing
to know even about oneself.

158
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:50,725
I'm a stock picker and
an instinct trader.

159
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,093
Am I wrong?

160
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,263
Look.

161
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,399
We believe there's a better way.

162
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,736
Life doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.

163
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,405
Go. Think.

164
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,640
Let me know.

165
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,454
Brownstone off the Promenade.

166
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,457
Sometimes I forget which
caste you belong to, Chuck.

167
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,692
Ah.

168
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,895
This is a hell of a reminder.

169
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:29,796
And where'd your dad
practice internal medicine?

170
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,332
The rough side of Highland Park? Huh?

171
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,869
I have to admit you surprise me,
even for a man in your position.

172
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,303
There's not many who could cast a spell

173
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:39,605
and make a federal judge disappear.

174
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:42,608
There are no other men in my position.

175
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,179
For I also know

176
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:49,882
the name being nominated in
committee to replace Wilcox.

177
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:51,151
Ah.

178
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:54,887
And let me be the first
to congratulate you.

179
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,056
Thank you.

180
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:00,159
It's as it should be. You happy?
You should be happy.

181
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,527
I'd be laughing like Hank Kingsley

182
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:03,095
if I were in your Florsheims.

183
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:04,329
"Hey, now!"

184
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,866
Hey, these are Ferragamos.

185
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,768
I like to laugh, too.

186
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,802
But lately...

187
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,838
- Yes, lately.
- And I worry.

188
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,241
With you out of the AG's office,

189
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:18,410
she'll be even less
likely to look kindly

190
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:19,878
on the work I need to do,

191
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,313
especially when it diverges from...

192
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:24,550
Whatever whim she and the
White House might have.

193
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:25,850
Mm.

194
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,186
I was wondering when the
actual tat would come.

195
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,320
Or is this the tit?

196
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,856
When it comes to picking
your replacement,

197
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,960
I need someone who'll
look out for me in DC.

198
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:37,629
So you wanna pick?

199
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:41,265
I know a few likely candidates.

200
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,402
I'll need you to foam the
runway for that replacement

201
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,736
on your way out.

202
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,372
Is this really still about Axelrod?

203
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,374
What, he's that much of a
burr under your saddle?

204
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,543
It's about justice.

205
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,078
Of course.

206
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,149
If, as you say, my name's
already been put forth,

207
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:01,752
I'm not sure what
leverage you still have.

208
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:04,187
I wanted to tell you this in person

209
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,591
to see exactly how badly you want it.

210
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:10,227
It would be brutal to
have it get this close

211
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:11,862
only to stall in Judicial Committee.

212
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,732
The Senate is so polarized these days.

213
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:17,634
Judgeships get held hostage for...

214
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,436
months, years.

215
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,371
Are you saying you can guarantee
I sail through committee?

216
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:22,972
"Guarantee" is a word

217
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:26,343
that amateurs use in politics.

218
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:29,912
But I can make it so
that Senator Vandeveer

219
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:34,017
takes you by the hand and
drags you to the bench.

220
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,753
And what I have to do to get that done

221
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,054
will not be pleasant.

222
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:41,791
It'll be quite odious, so
I need your assurance.

223
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,064
I'll do it.

224
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,667
But about Axelrod and finding
a way to leg back in...

225
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,135
Let... let me be

226
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,770
General Bradley to your Patton

227
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,005
and advise you to practice restraint.

228
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,676
Ah. Oh, it was good advice
when Omar Bradley gave it.

229
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,911
Safe.

230
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,213
And one of them died

231
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,514
a well-respected and admired general,

232
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,349
and the other one died a legend.

233
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:11,252
You name my pick for replacement.

234
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,421
I'll lock in your appointment.

235
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,159
And then I'll worry about
the rest from there.

236
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:20,261
I won't lie. Having a
Michelin chef in house,

237
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,164
it would be an excellent
recruiting tool.

238
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,532
What do you think?

239
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,033
Oh. It's a great kitchen.

240
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,735
Love the La Cornue.

241
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,004
But I would really miss,
you know, real people...

242
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:33,241
"gastros" who light up when they
eat something really special.

243
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,776
You go private serving
guys that might just have

244
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,878
- ...whatever for lunch...
- Mm.

245
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,849
You could lead the effort
to expand our horizons.

246
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,251
Don't let her off the hook, Lar.

247
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,453
I won't. We'll talk soon.

248
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,422
Yeah, thanks.

249
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,726
You know, when people
ask you what you think,

250
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,393
you don't really have to tell them.

251
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:54,894
I could've said a lot more.

252
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:59,533
Give him some fucking space!

253
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,203
Give me a sec.

254
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,806
Hey.

255
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,743
Something wrong?

256
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,378
Bad day.
Something happened.

257
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,413
Something serious?

258
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:16,916
I can't make it to Lilly's tonight.

259
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,584
Really?

260
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,889
What happened?

261
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,259
I blew a read. Badly.

262
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:29,562
And I know the reason
wasn't in the numbers.

263
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,365
It was in here. I'm gonna fix it.

264
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,800
Wendy?

265
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,803
I don't like it.

266
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,005
This isn't three years ago, you know.

267
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,008
She's at odds with you, with
herself, over this battle.

268
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,442
You can't trust her.

269
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:47,012
Well, she's the only one who can
give me what I need right now.

270
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,215
I know.

271
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,119
She's gonna ask you about Donnie.

272
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,025
You new here?

273
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:01,225
Maybe.

274
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,227
Nice.

275
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:07,031
Now all we need is a pole.

276
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,833
I can't cook for a bunch of animals

277
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,303
who will eat anything, shit
on anything, fuck anything.

278
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,672
Don't be ignorant. That's
just a stereotype.

279
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,213
Okay, you hate the place. Fine.

280
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,282
I was just trying to help
with your situation.

281
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:25,416
Well, I wouldn't have a situation

282
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,650
if it weren't for this place.

283
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,152
Well, you probably wouldn't
have your own kitchen

284
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,721
for another ten years either.

285
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,156
Look, I'm sorry.

286
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,724
But what happened to
my badass big sister

287
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,592
who says what she wants and
doesn't waste two shits

288
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:36,860
on what the world thinks of her?

289
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,062
I'm right here in front of you.

290
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,297
When's the last time you even hung out

291
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,898
in the old neighborhood?

292
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
What are we supposed to do,

293
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,637
Go back to fucking McCrory's
and shoot pool with the guys?

294
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,574
And the night takes shape.

295
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
So?

296
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,748
We break it down.

297
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,917
Put it in boxes.

298
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,186
Well, this is where we get off, Dale.

299
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,754
This tight little team can handle it.

300
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:07,122
FBI doesn't do clerical?

301
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,792
Not on this one. It's, uh, too sad.

302
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,461
Yeah, since it's over,
I'm supposed to start on

303
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:13,596
this synthetic marijuana
thing up in Orangeburg.

304
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:15,231
Oh, it's not over.

305
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:18,334
When it starts going back
into boxes, it's over.

306
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:24,406
The FDA adverse reporting
database flagged 20 cases

307
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,376
of acidosis associated
with similar SLGT2s.

308
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,543
It was in the file.

309
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:30,946
Yeah, we didn't fuck up. He did.

310
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,055
- Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:45,994
Hey, thanks for coming back.

312
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:49,364
Hope you didn't get all the way home.

313
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,766
Where were you?

314
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,935
I'm here now.

315
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,611
Hey, everybody, you can go home. Thanks.

316
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:10,952
I made a mistake today
that I shouldn't have.

317
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:12,320
It could cost me a billion dollars

318
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:14,254
after we've sifted through the wreckage.

319
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,790
That's quite a mistake.

320
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,727
I need an adjustment.

321
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:22,062
You're finally ready for a real session.

322
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,097
Yeah.

323
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,866
If I talk it through with you,

324
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,568
sharpen my focus,

325
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,669
I'll be able to start
digging out tomorrow.

326
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,438
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, I already know

327
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,741
the reason I made the
mistake was mental error.

328
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:37,978
Now I just need to find out
why I wanted to make it.

329
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:43,283
This might take a while.

330
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,463
Hey.

331
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,831
Carrie?

332
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,833
Uh...

333
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,935
I was waiting for Wendy.

334
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,936
Yeah, she called, said you
were both gonna be out.

335
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,637
Yes, I have things to do.

336
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,907
I thought she was in
with the kids tonight.

337
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,377
Must've gotten
our signals crossed.

338
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,312
Her thing sounded kind of last-minute.

339
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,647
Okay.

340
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,152
Must've had this on silent.

341
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,254
Uh...

342
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,990
the kids are already in their rooms.

343
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,960
Eva's asleep. Kevin might
want another story.

344
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,929
Uh... would you mind
cleaning up the dog food?

345
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,731
Thank you.

346
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:33,866
See you later.

347
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,515
Tell me about today.

348
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,717
If you're successful enough,

349
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,787
people think you can do anything,

350
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,056
and then you start to believe it, too.

351
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,425
You mean you do.

352
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,529
I'm not Superman. That's what
I'm trying to get across.

353
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,631
But today?

354
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,634
I might've forgotten.

355
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:49,004
It's hard not to engage in
a little magical thinking

356
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,273
when everyone else is looking at you

357
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,441
like you're some combination

358
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,943
of Warren Buffet and God above.

359
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:56,179
I don't buy that.

360
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:59,782
Magical thinking is...
if I clean the house,

361
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,718
then school gets canceled tomorrow.

362
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,219
And this?

363
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:07,990
I'm not wishing or guessing,
and I'm not usually wrong.

364
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,892
And when you are, you take
your medicine and move on.

365
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,827
It's what makes you great.

366
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,329
But today, your own words,

367
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,730
you missed something.

368
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,535
Somehow the idea that all the guys...

369
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:22,537
I asked Mafee,

370
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,940
and the moment he said
that everyone else agreed

371
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:30,112
that it was the wrong move,

372
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:31,679
I had to stick it out,

373
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:34,115
had to prove that I was
the difference maker.

374
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,250
To who?

375
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,185
Mafee? Danzig?

376
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,453
Of course not.

377
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,023
I agree. They all idolize you already.

378
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:44,592
It wasn't about proving
anything to any of them.

379
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:48,996
Look, you want me to fix

380
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:51,064
the part of you that makes money.

381
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:54,335
But it is attached to the rest, so...

382
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,570
Like I said, this is gonna
take a little while.

383
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,442
Why do I hate
these guys so much?

384
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:04,678
Well, they're criminals.

385
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,913
And they're a lot richer than you.

386
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,492
Are we really doing what we're doing...

387
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:23,129
...for the reasons we say?

388
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,599
Well, you mean, does making
these arrests, dealing fines,

389
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,868
actually do anything
to keep markets fair?

390
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,273
When
you put it like that...

391
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:38,277
This kid I went to school with,

392
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,712
Jim Gagne...

393
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:42,081
most brilliant guy I've ever met.

394
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,949
Gagne was a double major

395
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,852
in chemical engineering and pre-med.

396
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,221
I felt like he was gonna cure cancer.

397
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,558
Well, cancer's still
going last I checked.

398
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,326
He's no scientist.

399
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,629
He works the medical
sector for Spartan-Ives,

400
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,231
made 20 million last year.

401
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,634
Society's fucked when that happens.

402
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,236
Incentives all out of whack.

403
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:07,606
So someone has to do something.

404
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,976
And we use laws and fines and jail.

405
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,277
We try.

406
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,420
Got this made 'cause I was
so fucking proud of Chuck

407
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,756
for pushing back.

408
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,728
It's Axe's settlement check,
but I forgot to give it to him

409
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,697
by the time it came
back from the framer,

410
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,032
with the, uh, Donnie of it all.

411
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,968
I'm gonna leave it on his desk.

412
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,746
I know where Chuck keeps his stash.

413
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,183
Come on.

414
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,584
Sounds dangerous.

415
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,621
Let's talk about you for a sec.

416
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,590
That's not how this works.

417
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,025
We've never done anything
the way it works,

418
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,662
and we're not exactly starting tonight.

419
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,731
How are you handling everything?

420
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,469
I wanna know before we go on.

421
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,205
Grant me this indulgence.

422
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,544
The Donnie thing threw me, to be honest.

423
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:29,418
There's an empty space in
the world without him.

424
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,954
The fact that...

425
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,323
I missed it.

426
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,824
This man, this...

427
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:39,628
patient of mine, dying.

428
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,129
And he wouldn't let me in,

429
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:43,865
despite whatever was going on with him.

430
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,668
And you.

431
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,404
People withhold crucial
information all the time.

432
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,874
We learn to manage our expectations

433
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,910
about those close to us, don't we?

434
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:58,479
So they don't turn into mistrust or...

435
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:01,116
paranoia.

436
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,750
When I was young, I figured if I was

437
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,820
truly there for my patients,

438
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:09,524
I could get them to be
truly open with me.

439
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:12,026
I quickly learned that's not
the case, but you still hope.

440
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,361
Really?

441
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,496
That's what you were thinking
about when you were young?

442
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:18,333
Fuck. You chose the right line of work.

443
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:22,502
I was just thinking about
getting rich and getting even.

444
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:23,737
Have you?

445
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,439
Yeah. Mostly.

446
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:27,741
Does it make everything all better?

447
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:29,343
Why doesn't it?

448
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:32,813
Because the world isn't simple.

449
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:35,015
Like with Donnie.

450
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,084
You keep going back there.

451
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:40,354
I don't think we can ignore
that you missed today,

452
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:43,523
for the first time in
forever, right after he died.

453
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,226
Okay, go ahead, doctor.
You connect those dots.

454
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:49,295
Well, you used the words.

455
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:51,431
Getting even.

456
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:54,501
- When I was a kid.
- And today?

457
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,735
Bombing the trade,

458
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,937
were you somehow evening
the score for Donnie?

459
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:02,441
What does that even mean?
Donnie was a friend.

460
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:05,044
Everyone here matters to me,

461
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:07,180
and I go out of my way for all of 'em.

462
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:10,516
That's why I got him
the best medical care.

463
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:13,185
The same as when Mick Danzig
gets tackled on his lawn

464
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:17,055
with a machine gun in his fucking hands,

465
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,358
I'm the one who pays off the cops

466
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,059
to make the problem go away.

467
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,597
That's what I do here.

468
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,199
I take care of my people,

469
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,801
and they know that.

470
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,770
And so should you by now.

471
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,009
So are you ready to tell me

472
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,743
who you were trying to
prove something to?

473
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,881
Yeah.

474
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,116
Should we say it in unison?

475
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:46,918
And were you trying to prove

476
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,221
you were a difference
maker for good or bad?

477
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:53,525
Were you trying to reward
or punish yourself?

478
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:57,796
Come on.

479
00:23:57,798 --> 00:23:59,130
Where you going?

480
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,367
- We're not done!
- Come on!

481
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,841
God, that was awful.

482
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:12,109
You don't even go there anymore.

483
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,277
You're a Michelin chef.

484
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,578
You live in Bushwick with the hipsters.

485
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,879
The only reason we ever went there

486
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:17,048
is 'cause they didn't check IDs.

487
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,483
God! What were you thinking?

488
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,985
I just... I thought we could
do something like we used to,

489
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:24,788
before everything was all
work and you were all...

490
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,158
Then let's do something. Better.

491
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,693
Where else did we used to go?

492
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:31,361
Nowhere I wanna go now.

493
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:33,997
- After you got your car...
- Oh, that fucking Fiero.

494
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:38,068
Man, we'd just drive around, joyriding.

495
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,836
Then let's go joyriding.

496
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:43,073
Come on. Come on! Come on.

497
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,713
I thought I might not see
you here for a while.

498
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:54,484
Well, I may have been...

499
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:56,452
overly harsh with you before.

500
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,589
"Overly harsh"?

501
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:01,757
I don't know. I'm...

502
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,360
I'm getting up there in years.

503
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:05,661
I don't really, uh,

504
00:25:05,663 --> 00:25:09,298
understand these things anymore.

505
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,433
I don't even know why you're here.

506
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:16,905
There is a favor I need.

507
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:19,308
Ah...

508
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,210
Now we get to it.

509
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,814
What can I help you with?

510
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,182
I need a Senator

511
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:30,118
on the judiciary committee

512
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,354
to push through a nomination.

513
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:35,690
Your Senator.

514
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:38,693
And I'm supposed to just...

515
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:41,996
materialize Marcia Vandeveer?

516
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,832
A United States Senator?

517
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,268
And get her to do what you want?

518
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,469
I know that you and Marcia...

519
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:49,970
I must still know how the game works

520
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:52,773
to be able to do something like that.

521
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:56,677
I must've spent a lifetime

522
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,047
building relationships,

523
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:01,615
collecting chits.

524
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:03,984
Whatever law and order issue
that she's running on,

525
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:07,655
my office will make it a priority.

526
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,824
Accommodations will not be necessary,

527
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:13,193
not necessary at all.

528
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:15,762
She owes me a favor.

529
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:18,365
She'll be happy to sit with you.
I'll just give her a call.

530
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,700
Well...

531
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,536
as long as it's not too much trouble.

532
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,975
Anything you'd like to say to me?

533
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:31,410
Thank you, Dad.

534
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,548
And?

535
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,621
I'm sorry.

536
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,758
There's the boy.

537
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,965
No.

538
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:00,573
-  - Whoa!

539
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:05,210
Oh! Unbelievable!

540
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:07,378
I'd have given 30 to one odds
you'd miss with the phone.

541
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,982
Then you're definitely
not seeing the market.

542
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:11,149
I can do a phone.

543
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,450
It's gotta be bigger than a phone now.

544
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,139
Do you remember our first building?

545
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:37,975
Ooh! Globe would've
gone through the floor.

546
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:40,344
Okay, double or nothing.
I wanna do a computer.

547
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:41,746
Oh, my God. You're like
Kobe firing up shots

548
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:42,980
when he's two for 18.

549
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:44,982
No doubt in your mind the
next one's going in.

550
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,785
Kobe? Steph Curry. Jordan, maybe.

551
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:48,953
Don't give me Kobe.

552
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:50,821
Shooter's gotta shoot.

553
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:53,056
Unwavering belief in
our own capabilities.

554
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,858
It's essential to a point.

555
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,726
Keeps us functioning at a high level.

556
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,328
Until it isn't, right?

557
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,331
Maybe your self-image is creating...

558
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,533
a blind spot.

559
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:06,036
We're not on a break, are we?

560
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,271
No.

561
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,407
Why couldn't I have seen it before?

562
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,009
Well, let's assume your blind spot

563
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:15,244
usually works for you.

564
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:17,346
It's fairly essentially
if you don't feel

565
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,648
indestructible like Superman.

566
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,817
How are you gonna risk
billions every morning?

567
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,852
But it's not working for you now.

568
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:24,020
So you need to figure out

569
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,854
what part of your self-image is false.

570
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,990
And then you either need to
live up to it or lose it.

571
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:32,195
Interesting word... "false." Like, uh...

572
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:35,130
when someone knows that they
have to tell a lover goodbye.

573
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,499
But they can't quite do it,

574
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:39,268
so instead, they sleep
with them one last time.

575
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,103
Then they have their
own unspoken goodbye,

576
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:44,707
not letting on that
everything's changed until...

577
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,241
after the night is over.

578
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:51,479
I'm not sure that's what
we're discussing here.

579
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,148
No, maybe not.

580
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,649
But it came to mind, so I said it.

581
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,318
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

582
00:28:57,922 --> 00:28:59,588
In a sense.

583
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:03,090
Something I said?

584
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,958
Let's go outside.

585
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,731
Mm.

586
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,353
- Sorry, that was...
- So cliché.

587
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,021
Oh, the worst!

588
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,491
Oh. You think Chuck's ever had sex here?

589
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,860
- Oh, time to leave right now.
- Ohh. Oh, God.

590
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:45,365
Oh!

591
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,166
- Oh.
- Oh.

592
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,469
I still wanna do something dangerous.

593
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:53,338
Hey, Nancy. Church Rhoades.

594
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,940
Looking for Wendy.

595
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,709
Wondering if you knew
what she was up to.

596
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:00,012
Maybe her phone died.

597
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:04,150
Uh, anyway, when you get this,
let me know if you know. Thanks.

598
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,362
We'll have, uh, another Bulleit.

599
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,630
All right, same thing.

600
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:21,633
Splash of soda and, uh, little,
uh, little lemon zest.

601
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:22,934
Oh! Will you bring us two?

602
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:24,202
For sure.

603
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,070
I was beginning to think
you were a no-show.

604
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:30,508
I'm beginning to wish I no-showed.

605
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,076
I don't see the appeal.

606
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,081
See it now?

607
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,850
Oh, Christ. Ira.

608
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:41,819
Don't make indict you for child porn.

609
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:44,154
She's of age. She just sent that to me.

610
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:45,790
God bless these 23-year-olds.

611
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:46,924
They grew up with porn.

612
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:49,059
And daddy issues.

613
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:50,695
Maybe granddaddy issues in your case.

614
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:52,996
Ow.

615
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:55,366
What do you talk to a 23-year-old about?

616
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:57,167
Taylor Swift?

617
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:58,401
Did you meet her on Tinder?

618
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,570
Actually, I did.

619
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:03,707
How do you do it? I mean, get 'em to...

620
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:06,376
swipe left or right or
whatever on a mug like yours.

621
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,945
You put the Porsche in the Tinder photo.

622
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:10,981
You can't be subtle on Tinder.

623
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,282
- Mm. Thank you.
- Wow.

624
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,250
Mm-hmm.

625
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,618
How'd it go?

626
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,119
Not as bad as you thought, I'm sure.

627
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,355
Mm.

628
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:20,557
Worse, I think.

629
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,392
I believe that he used "I told you so"

630
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,260
in all its myriad constructions.

631
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:26,162
I understand how it must

632
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,898
make you feel to have to
ask for a favor like that.

633
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,969
But everyone has a roof. Accept it.

634
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,503
A roof?

635
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:36,172
Those two years I was in Russia,

636
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,773
it was right after the wall came down.

637
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:40,709
There was money and crazy women.

638
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:42,411
The Wild West of capitalism.

639
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:45,681
Anyway, in Russia, you had to
pay someone to protect you,

640
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,083
either the cops or the mob, and
then they were your "roof."

641
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:51,353
- Mm.
- That's what they called it.

642
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,088
You're down right now. It's
not a moment for pride.

643
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,991
It's a moment for, uh...

644
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,593
consolidation.

645
00:31:57,595 --> 00:32:00,729
Positioning, a little security.
Senior's your roof.

646
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:03,098
- Everyone needs a roof.
- I may need one.

647
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
It doesn't mean I have
to fucking like it.

648
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:06,768
Yeah, but if you don't have a roof,

649
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,870
you can't be surprised when
it starts raining on you.

650
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:10,772
Well, it's like the man sang,

651
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:13,341
"it may be the devil
or it may be the Lord,

652
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:16,544
but you're gonna have to
serve somebody," right?

653
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:18,213
Hey.

654
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,114
Hi.

655
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:23,918
Think about that.

656
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,420
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

657
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:27,422
Tyler, go to the bar. I'll...
I'll find you later.

658
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,223
Okay.

659
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:33,294
How are you able to keep
it so light, brother?

660
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,930
In law school, you were just as
weighted down as the rest of us.

661
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:38,198
Light. Heavy.

662
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,534
- Who even thinks in those terms?
- Mm-hmm.

663
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:41,668
Weekends and on Wednesdays,

664
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,037
I'm with my kids and I'm one way.

665
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,605
And when I'm not, I'm here,
or somewhere like it.

666
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:47,808
Otherwise, what? Watch
harness racing on TV?

667
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,311
No, you should know that that's rigged.

668
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,478
They can shift the results

669
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,779
just by dinging one wheel of the sulky.

670
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:54,781
I don't actually bet
the fucking trotters.

671
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,149
Where are you, fella?

672
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:57,484
'Cause you're not here.

673
00:32:57,486 --> 00:32:58,885
It's one thing if I check my phone.

674
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:00,754
Could be some girl telling
me she just turned 21.

675
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:02,255
What the fuck are you doing?

676
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:05,959
Wendy.

677
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,226
I don't...

678
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:12,966
I'm not sure where she is tonight.

679
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:15,601
Ah.

680
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:17,370
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

681
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,272
And, uh, it doesn't feel like

682
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:22,942
a "we're just out of
pocket for a minute."

683
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,111
There's some kind of
continental drift going on.

684
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,447
Worse.

685
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,883
Tectonic collisions.

686
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:36,154
You know, no offense, man, but...

687
00:33:36,156 --> 00:33:39,592
all of this is not for me.

688
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,793
So it scares the shit out of me

689
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,362
that it could be where I'm heading.

690
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,601
It's
not really for anyone,

691
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:52,904
tell you the truth.

692
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,272
No one chooses it.

693
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:57,009
Even if they think they do
when they walk out the door.

694
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:00,444
it's... not what they think it'll be,

695
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,514
especially after the first few months.

696
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:06,518
Everything I said to you about
the young girls is true.

697
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,153
They're wild and free and...

698
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:11,322
they'll lick your dirty
places and smile.

699
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:14,992
But the one thing they are not is...

700
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:17,395
my Elizabeth.

701
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,662
Or Wendy.

702
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,134
I know.

703
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:27,171
I remember nights with
Liz, and she'd be asleep,

704
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,341
and I'd have all these things
that I'd wanna tell her.

705
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,509
Then I wouldn't wake her up.
I'd just sit with it.

706
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,278
And...

707
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,414
by morning, they'd be gone.

708
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:41,484
Plowed under with the routine.

709
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:44,755
If I could get one of
those nights back...

710
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:48,724
I'm not saying I'd give up
all these nights, but, uh...

711
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:55,231
Yeah, I probably have a few
things like that I should say.

712
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,267
Then why the fuck are you
still sitting here with me?

713
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:02,738
'Cause one thing's for sure,
you got absolutely no game.

714
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:08,243
I never cried over Donnie, you know.

715
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:13,015
You wanted to?

716
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,585
I think I should have, maybe.

717
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,553
Last time you did?

718
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,022
- Oh, I don't know.
- Sure you do.

719
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:23,425
Let's turn here.

720
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:26,861
I like to wander from time to time.

721
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:30,732
It's our little expeditions
that keep me around.

722
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,934
Digging in the dirt,
getting under the process.

723
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:36,572
But I was supposed to be home hours ago.

724
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:38,673
Last time you cried.

725
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:45,046
Fuck. Okay.

726
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:47,582
You know what really nails me?

727
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:52,954
These YouTube videos,
soldiers coming home,

728
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:55,756
surprising their kids at school.

729
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:59,427
Even better... baseball game.

730
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:01,795
So the guy subs for the catcher.

731
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:04,565
Kid goes to the mound,
he gets ready to pitch.

732
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:07,368
He throws one. He hasn't noticed.

733
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,937
And the catcher goes to the mound,

734
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,606
takes off his mask, kid sees him,

735
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:17,044
and the dad just wraps him in a hug.

736
00:36:17,046 --> 00:36:19,747
I have no idea why, but if I
stumble across one of those,

737
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:22,315
I am gone.

738
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:25,185
Does it feel good after?

739
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:27,887
Yeah, it does.

740
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,724
Jesus. Nobody knows that, not even Lara.

741
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:34,628
It's okay for that to be private.

742
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,263
Do you know what's going on?

743
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,397
You're not gonna tell me

744
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:39,199
it's because my dad never came home?

745
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:40,700
Well, I think that might be in there,

746
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:44,904
but I think we resolved a bunch of that.

747
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:48,141
No, I think about the mask itself.

748
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:50,276
I think about what it means that
the dad pulls off the mask,

749
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:54,346
and he's not only seen
but loved for who he is

750
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:58,517
underneath that hard metal exterior.

751
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:03,055
Well, that guy's a hero.
He deserves the love.

752
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,456
And you?

753
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:10,996
What happens when you take it off?

754
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:16,134
Will you still be loved?

755
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:18,836
By the guys here, your kids, Lara?

756
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:21,906
What if you're not perfect?

757
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,175
What if you miss one every few years?

758
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:26,911
Yeah.

759
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,614
What then?

760
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,351
Let's stay with Donnie a minute more.

762
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,433
Yeah. Can't feel the road in this.

763
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,035
And you can't hear the fucking engine.

764
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,104
Are we going somewhere?

765
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,940
Nah.

766
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,242
We're just gonna joyride.

767
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,816
No.

768
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,659
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

769
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,094
Oh, my God.

770
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,729
Fuck, yeah.

771
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,502
You know, I think you're
right about me, Lu.

772
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,872
I'm not your ballsy big sister
who doesn't give two shits.

773
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,807
The old me would've told
Bobby to go fuck himself

774
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,677
for blowing me off to talk
to Wendy Rhoades all night.

775
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,612
So why didn't you?

776
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,782
Because I'm different than who I was.

777
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,818
Improved, supposedly.

778
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,087
You didn't need that kind of improving.

779
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,357
I do need something, though.

780
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,397
What?

781
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,198
What do you want?

782
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,738
I tell you,

783
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,141
this beats hitting the mall
and shoplifting earrings.

784
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,677
Mm.

785
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,514
God, we'd always end up
at that stupid mall.

786
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:16,150
Remember when Mom
bought us scratch-offs,

787
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:18,051
and we agreed if either of us won,

788
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:19,252
we'd go on a shopping spree?

789
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:20,454
Yeah.

790
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:22,189
You kind of won.

791
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,030
We've now gone as far as we possible can

792
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:31,932
without getting to it.

793
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:37,971
Donnie.

794
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,276
Fine. Donnie.

795
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,345
But first, tell me what
you've put together.

796
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:48,514
I know you used him as a shield.

797
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:51,751
I don't know how exactly.

798
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:54,286
And I know you left his
family well off afterwards.

799
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:56,288
That's all true.

800
00:39:57,826 --> 00:40:00,827
So you should feel great.

801
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,529
You saved your kingdom

802
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,965
and rewarded richly the
knight who fell on his sword

803
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,199
so you could do it.

804
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,869
A king who does not mourn that knight

805
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:13,339
and that goes on
building his own castle.

806
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:17,343
Oh, so that's why you
missed on the trade.

807
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:18,844
You loved him,

808
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,880
so subconsciously, you're
punishing yourself.

809
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:26,752
I stole from him.

810
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,857
His time,

811
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,725
Without his permission.

812
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:36,695
Doctor presented me with
a chance to get Donnie

813
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:39,731
some experimental treatment, not a cure.

814
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:46,271
But it could've extended his life a...
few months...

815
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:51,675
and maybe long enough for
him to have seen Christmas.

816
00:40:53,713 --> 00:40:58,348
But also maybe long enough for
him to testify against me.

817
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,184
And...

818
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:02,520
I stopped that from happening

819
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,988
because it didn't suit my purposes.

820
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,457
And I'm punishing myself

821
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,159
because I cannot believe
I have the capacity

822
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:12,162
to do that to someone I care about.

823
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:18,268
That's your fear?

824
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,003
That even when you care about someone,

825
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:21,638
you can use them for your own ends.

826
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,041
If that is true, I don't
like what it says about me.

827
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:25,976
It may be true,

828
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,312
but that's not what this is.

829
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:31,714
You're punishing yourself
because you're understanding

830
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:36,118
that you didn't care about Donnie.

831
00:41:37,422 --> 00:41:40,256
Not really.

832
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:42,692
That's what scares you.

833
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,695
Yes.

834
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,733
When I heard about Donnie's death, I...

835
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,972
I felt relief.

836
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:59,107
And all the rest... the
sorrow, the sadness...

837
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:01,710
it was... it was buried way down.

838
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:04,112
Like it didn't exist at all.

839
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:05,580
That's right.

840
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:11,686
So the question you've been
afraid to ask out loud,

841
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:13,688
but have been whispering
to yourself ever since,

842
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,324
do you wanna ask it?

843
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,893
- Do I have to?
- I think you do.

844
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:21,796
I can't say it for you.

845
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:31,171
Well, people who have the
capacity to feel nothing...

846
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:36,576
...they call them sociopaths.

847
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:41,315
Is that what I am?

848
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:44,851
What do you think?

849
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,822
I don't know.

850
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,327
This is how - you manifest guilt.

851
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:55,428
If you didn't have it,

852
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,130
you wouldn't have lost the money,

853
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:58,932
you wouldn't be punishing yourself.

854
00:42:58,934 --> 00:43:03,737
But it is a... crucial time.

855
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:08,474
Your switch plate is removed,
your wiring is exposed.

856
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:11,444
Your blue ones go where your red
ones should, that's for sure.

857
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:14,213
A normal person wouldn't
engage in the behavior.

858
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:17,583
A sociopath wouldn't give a shit.

859
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:19,552
You're somewhere in between.

860
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:22,755
You are practiced at
turning off your feelings.

861
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:25,024
Do it enough, it's a pattern.
Keep going, they die.

862
00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:28,126
So it's either fix it...

863
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:34,199
...or close yourself back
up and see what happens.

864
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:06,564
Thank you, Anil.

865
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:09,100
Really, thank you. I know this is weird.

866
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:12,136
Anytime.

867
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:14,271
Just keep it open till we're done.

868
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,573
- Okay.
- Holy shit, Lar!

869
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,142
Yeah, holy shit.

870
00:44:26,452 --> 00:44:28,986
-  Don't know what to say,

871
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:32,322
- Bright.
- So cool.

872
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,739
- Key part breaking the law?
- What?

873
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,275
- Never mind. Come on.
- Ooh!

874
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:54,043
-  Don't wanna lose control,

875
00:45:00,152 --> 00:45:01,984
What we did
tonight was pretty heavy.

876
00:45:01,986 --> 00:45:05,121
There might be aftershocks.

877
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:07,356
Yeah, I know.

878
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,693
You did to me what I do to companies.

879
00:45:10,695 --> 00:45:13,262
Took me apart, put me together again.

880
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:19,702
You seem tired.

881
00:45:19,704 --> 00:45:21,770
Or are you just disgusted
at what you heard?

882
00:45:25,276 --> 00:45:29,578
Take this away with you.

883
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,614
You are a difference maker,

884
00:45:32,616 --> 00:45:34,416
but you're not a god.

885
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:38,319
Pancreatic takes everyone.

886
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:40,055
It's like the market.
It does what it wants.

887
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:44,659
And no magical thinking was
ever gonna change that.

888
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:49,698
So no, I'm not disgusted with you.

889
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,467
For whatever reason, when
it comes to you, that's...

890
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:55,403
that's just not on the table.

891
00:45:57,307 --> 00:45:59,073
You know, some of your wires

892
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:00,941
aren't where they should be, either.

893
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:08,182
I can't argue.

894
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:12,452
Is that why you've been
looking at other shops?

895
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,859
That's what you've been
drilling for all night.

896
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:22,029
Where were you thinking about?

897
00:46:22,031 --> 00:46:25,733
Was it Insight? Point One Four?

898
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:28,968
No, Zenobia.

899
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:35,542
Yeah, Zenobia.

900
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,612
You think you'll be different there?

901
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:41,047
Fixed?

902
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:44,316
Working in a simpler, safer way

903
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,120
will allow you to step
back from the edge?

904
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:52,324
That's for a different session.

905
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:08,374
Wait. Pull over here.

906
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:10,643
Kill the lights.

907
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:16,072
Take me back to the city.

908
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:14,662
Enter.

909
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:20,200
-  They'll cut your
wrists  -

910
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:24,271
Mr. Martinez.

911
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:28,842
It's been a long time.

912
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,478
Yes, it has.

913
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:37,817
I can only assume

914
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:40,186
you've been a wretched...

915
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,623
...speck of shit.

916
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,603
Red.

917
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,339
Red!

918
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,442
I'm sorry.

919
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,444
Did I not pick up the body language?

920
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:06,879
- It's been a while.
- No. Fuck!

921
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:09,881
No.

922
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,483
It's me. I can't.

923
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:15,454
I, uh...

924
00:50:15,456 --> 00:50:17,957
I didn't get permission.

925
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:22,761
You didn't get permission from Mrs.
Martinez?

926
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,097
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

927
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:31,369
- I don't know.
- Go get permission.

928
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:33,137
Yeah, it's not so simple.

929
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:36,708
Does Wendy not role-play anymore?

930
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,178
The workshop went so well.
She was a fucking all-star.

931
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,812
It's like she's...

932
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,352
She's intractable.

933
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:51,289
And she's so...

934
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,957
So distant.

935
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:55,360
Chuck...

936
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:58,596
You guys should go see someone.

937
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,397
You can both come here if you want.

938
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,868
Who the fuck are you?

939
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,469
What the fuck you doing, man?

940
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:07,337
What the fuck?

941
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,008
Asshole was taking pictures.

942
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,244
Give me that. Give it to me!

943
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:23,553
You've been following me all night?

944
00:51:25,057 --> 00:51:27,090
Oh, my God. I can't be here.

945
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:28,658
I gotta go.

946
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,292
Must've been some party.

947
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:09,698
We didn't go. We made our own.

948
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:13,301
How are you?

949
00:52:15,773 --> 00:52:18,306
I feel young again. Wanna go to prom?

950
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:20,475
I know better than to
go with the bad boy.

951
00:52:20,477 --> 00:52:21,909
Do you?

952
00:52:21,911 --> 00:52:24,379
Maybe.

953
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:29,717
I cry sometimes.

954
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,852
At sentimental things.

955
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:36,023
Commercials.

956
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:37,792
And I don't tell you.

957
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,798
Okay.

958
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:51,906
I'm glad that tonight helped,

959
00:52:51,908 --> 00:52:55,409
but don't ever fucking
do that to me again.

960
00:52:57,246 --> 00:52:59,179
I don't think I will.

1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,208
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,291
Lara?

3
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,290
Boys?

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,999
Ice Juice.
I can take it over.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,959
Just need the cash.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,332
You know my money's
in a blind trust.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,040
Congratulations. All the
analysts now answer to you.

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,833
If I fill in those blanks,
I have to put my name on it.

9
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,833
We've long suspected

10
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,499
criminal activity
at Axe Capital.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,582
You have nothing on Axe Cap
and even less on me.

12
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,583
Hey, hey.

13
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,624
I tried calling.

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,916
Phone's been off.

15
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,583
I'm going to go put
the boys to bed.

16
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:41,040
I am so close to getting Axe.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,541
You will get him...
on something else.

18
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,582
Sandicot is a circle.

19
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,374
It leads right back to you.

20
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,875
I think I'll get Axe
on something else.

21
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,041
Everybody pays.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,833
Yes, yes, yes.

23
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,749
I understand, Terry.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,749
And that's why
if I get paid on time next week,

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,374
which, when you're a contractor,
you never really know.

26
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,999
But then, of course I pay you,
Terry, right away,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,249
first fucking thing I do.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,332
That's a relief.

29
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,541
Isn't it, Johnny?

30
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:45,833
A sweet relief.

31
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,582
Some guys, no matter how
well-intentioned they may be,

32
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,582
hmm, they can't see to find
the money when it's owed...

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,833
which leads to uncomfortable
conversations like this one.

34
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,374
Terry,
I'm well-intended.

35
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,416
You're a good guy, Slayton.

36
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,666
And I-I'll
tell you something.

37
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,958
I never considered myself
a bad guy, hmm?

38
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,916
Do you think I'm a bad guy?

39
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,625
No.
Good.

40
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,750
Ohh!

41
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,124
Wives.

42
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,958
They got all the leverage.

43
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,332
So I had to do something
to even the score.

44
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,833
See, now you have
a compelling reason to pay me

45
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,082
when she wants
to pay the credit cards.

46
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,290
Yes.

47
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,624
I do.

48
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,541
I owe you, Terry.

49
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,124
And I'm gonna
make things right...

50
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,083
no matter what I have to do.

51
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,666
Was a time folks in your job
had the sense

52
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,500
to duck my fucking call
until you had good news for me.

53
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,749
Remind me
the next time I forget,

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,124
there is no one in this business
who won't sell you out

55
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,332
if they think there's
a fucking nickel in it.

56
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,833
I find that
strangely reassuring.

57
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,165
Eliminates the possibility
of disillusionment.

58
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,499
Yes. Yes.
Let the idealists

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,416
and romantics
get their hearts broken

60
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,165
while the hard-bitten
pragmatists...

61
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,374
Wow.

62
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,499
You have something you really
don't want to tell me about.

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,458
What happened?

64
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,541
They shoot Sonny
on the causeway?

65
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,958
Otherwise, spit it the fuck out.

66
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,792
Boyd was right.

67
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,249
I just hung up
with Patriot Bank.

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,207
After a wet and hot road show,

69
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,040
they are taking out
the Ice Juice IPO.

70
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,874
Press is getting loaded up
with the story as we speak.

71
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,542
Shit.

72
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,791
They think it's a winner?

73
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,707
They do.
There's more.

74
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,207
Charles Rhoades Sr.
Did take

75
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,541
an Uncle Miltie-sized position
in the company.

76
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:56,124
I've run through it
with the primes all over town,

77
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,165
theirs, ours, the other guy's,

78
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,999
and with analysts
at the big three,

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,290
as well as our own people.

80
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,040
They all agree with Patriot.

81
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,041
- Fundamentals?
- Solid.

82
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,624
The projections are real.

83
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,749
They're rolling out
the IPO soon.

84
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,624
Everyone thinks it's gonna work.

85
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,874
No one sees a short play
we can make.

86
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,749
I don't see an avenue of attack.

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,874
Personnel?
The fucking lawyer,

88
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,791
Ira Schirmer, represented
Rhoades at your deposition.

89
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,750
He's got a board seat.

90
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:23,624
Rhoades' father
and his closest confidante

91
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,416
have both jumped headfirst
into a business... together?

92
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,250
And you amble in here to tell me

93
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,666
that I have no way to wreck it?

94
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:31,874
Fuck.

95
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,458
This is Sonny on the causeway.

96
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,707
Top sheet
says Charles Rhoades Sr.

97
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,582
Is a high-net-worth
individual. He has

98
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,207
multiple business holdings,
mostly in real estate.

99
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,582
But at the moment,
it seems he's largely illiquid

100
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,416
because of some new
cash-intensive

101
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,041
real-estate investments.

102
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,416
Fucker's house-poor?

103
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,791
Houses.
City co-op, Hamptons place,

104
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,457
a hobby farm in Mount Kisco,

105
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,249
an ocean-front spread
in Florida.

106
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,416
And upstate, he bought up
half of Kingsford.

107
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,290
But he won't be able to flip
that land for a real profit

108
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,833
until the casino is in and open.

109
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,874
And so the question is...

110
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,582
Yes. Where did he get the
capital for the juice company?

111
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,374
I did a forensic look,
and I cannot find the source.

112
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,582
Which means there's no
institutional money

113
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,791
behind the purchase
of his share of Ice Juice.

114
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,458
It had to be a personal loan
of some sort.

115
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:26,959
Okay. Good.

116
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,834
Thank you, Taylor.

117
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,332
So, Rhoades Sr.
Got his money for Ice Juice

118
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,499
from a personal loan.

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,958
Had to be someone
very close to him

120
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,165
to lend him that kind of jack.

121
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,458
Maybe a little too close.

122
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,874
You know those poison-tip arrows
that certain tribes use

123
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,207
that go through one guy
and kill another?

124
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,165
This might be like that.

125
00:05:59,166 --> 00:05:59,875
Yeah.

126
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,999
Golden frog poison.
Mm.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,749
I tried to smoke it once.

128
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,457
Shaman jumped across the tent
to stop me.

129
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,999
And glad I am that he did.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,416
Otherwise, I would have to enact
this rich pageant

131
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,667
without your good
and wise counsel.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,040
The deal goes out
at $18 dollars a share tomorrow.

133
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,374
Holy shit!

134
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,332
I'm worth $125 million dollars.

135
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,374
Yeah, you may well be
soon enough,

136
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,541
but don't allow yourself
to feel it just yet.

137
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,040
That clouds the thinking

138
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,874
at the exact moment when
you need to be clear-headed.

139
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,624
Is that gonna clear my head?

140
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,374
Hey, scotch this good,

141
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,833
make a Mongoloid
think like Einstein.

142
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,250
Oh, God, no.

143
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,958
Jesus, Dad.

144
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,916
We're in my house, son.

145
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,999
There will be no nod to this
Billie Jean King PC bullshit.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,582
It's just wrong, you know?
No.

147
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,624
Some things are just
actually wrong.

148
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,290
Ah...
You two, not tonight,

149
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,582
not the night before
my IPO comes out.

150
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,624
Quite so, Ira.

151
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,791
Congratulations.

152
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,500
Absolutely.
To that.

153
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,749
I'm very happy for you both that

154
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,958
this venture's off to
such an auspicious start,

155
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,749
but I do advise caution...
You brought us together.

156
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,791
Whatever happens,
you share in it.

157
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,290
Oh, I do.

158
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,416
My emotions are
all tied up in it, for sure.

159
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:15,207
When the market closes tomorrow

160
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,624
and we have ridden this thing
all the way up,

161
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,916
that $125-million number
might be...

162
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,999
conservative.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,541
Yes.

164
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,707
Don't quit your day job.

165
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,708
Too late.

166
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,583
You didn't.

167
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,541
Not all the way, but close.

168
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,999
I'm selling my share of the firm
to my partners.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,749
It's been a long time coming.

170
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,457
Tomorrow is liberation day.

171
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,707
You never tally your sheet
until the lockup period is over,

172
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,082
but even I have to admit
it does feel great.

173
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,958
You did a good thing here, son.

174
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,625
You absolutely did.

175
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:49,290
I hope that's true, Dad.

176
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,500
I really do.

177
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,374
Is this...

178
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,291
Weird?

179
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:03,833
I was gonna say
"feeling as right to you,"

180
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,541
but, uh...

181
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,749
Mm. Sorry.

182
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,374
I mean making a habit of these
husband/wife booty calls.

183
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,624
Oh. "Booty calls."

184
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,041
I feel
I'm finally a man of my time.

185
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,666
How do you think
I engineer a cup of Stumptown?

186
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,290
Not by heading down
to the kitchen.

187
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,833
You need to slip out
before the kids are up.

188
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:35,916
It's not fair to give them
a false sense of hope.

189
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,249
False?

190
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,542
That's gonna leave a mark.

191
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,457
You look like my guys at work.

192
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,624
What's so interesting?

193
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,290
Pre-trading news
on the juice IPO,

194
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,416
and it is good news.

195
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,792
Oh, so exciting for Ira.

196
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,582
Not just Ira.

197
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,624
Nobody knows this, not even Ira,

198
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,624
but, uh...
I'm in it, too.

199
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,207
In it?

200
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,041
That's right.

201
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,457
Why?

202
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,249
'Cause it's a winner.

203
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,666
And you know this because...

204
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,207
Because I saw it...

205
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,499
exactly what would happen
with this company

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,833
and what it would do for me.

207
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:25,999
I've only seen three things
that clearly in my life.

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,040
One was my first time
actually arguing in court.

209
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,207
I knew it was my calling.

210
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,833
Second was when I met you...

211
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,541
and I knew it was my destiny.

212
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,207
The third...

213
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,082
was this.

214
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,959
Wow.

215
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,082
Ah.

216
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,125
That is some statement.

217
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,834
Well, good luck, then.

218
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,207
Where's Mom?

219
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,083
Downstairs.

220
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,457
Good morning!

221
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,332
Hi.

222
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,959
Do you need me?

223
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,000
No. No.
I'll see you later.

224
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,249
Ugh!

225
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,792
Finish it.

226
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,374
You saw you had to
give him something,

227
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,833
an opportunity...

228
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,874
and you used it against him.

229
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,500
Well-done.

230
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,332
We hear someone's
getting shanked today.

231
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,666
I'm sorry?

232
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,249
Your review of the analysts.

233
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,499
Ah. Yes. Here's my breakdown
of each analyst's performance.

234
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,874
I've ranked them.

235
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,666
And if we want to follow
the old GE model

236
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,582
of removing
the bottom ten percent,

237
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,290
it does unfortunately mean
someone has to be let go.

238
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,499
And you can see,
from the bottom box, who.

239
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,999
So, I'll tell HR, and...

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,416
Wait a sec.
You're doing it off the chart?

241
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:43,582
The chart makes it clear.

242
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,582
And right before bonus time.

243
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,666
That's cold,
even by my standards.

244
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,791
Yeah.

245
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,582
That's not how we do it here,
on paper, not like that.

246
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,874
Asymmetrical returns, right?

247
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,874
Not just in the stocks,
but in our people, too.

248
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,707
I need you to sit down
with each one of them.

249
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,667
I want you to probe
for their strengths

250
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,874
and for their weaknesses.

251
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,707
I want you to figure out
who's gonna outperform your data

252
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,499
and who has already had
his best year.

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,707
Sitting with everyone
so they can equivocate

254
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,040
and explain away what's already
been shown clearly

255
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,416
seems inefficient.
Taylor, I know you come

256
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:17,290
from analytics, and I know that
the numbers are where you live,

257
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,416
but got to learn
the other piece, too.

258
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,541
There's a small group
who can do the math.

259
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,874
There's an even smaller group
who can explain it.

260
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,541
But those few who can do both...

261
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,249
they become billionaires.

262
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,708
From a man who knows.
Well-said, sir.

263
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,916
Okay.

264
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,416
I'll do the meetings.

265
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,332
And that's when you shank 'em!

266
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,374
I am not shanking anyone.

267
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,040
Well, call it what you will,
but we all know

268
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,749
you got to shank someone
to earn respect on the yard.

269
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,916
How many jailhouse movies
did you two watch growing up?

270
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,666
We didn't have computers.

271
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,416
You run your department
as you see fit.

272
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,082
- But...
- Yeah.

273
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,582
You got to look
right into their eyes

274
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,458
as the life drains out of them.

275
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,749
And have fun!

276
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,457
I remember the first time
I shitcanned someone!

277
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,375
It tasted as sweet
as the Mata Hari's armpits.

278
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,457
Okay, you are logged in.

279
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,624
So, this will track
any equities you enter,

280
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,249
moment-by-moment updates,
newsfeed.

281
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,207
You know you don't have to
pay for this.

282
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,874
You could just go
to Yahoo Finance

283
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,834
and hit "refresh"
every few seconds.

284
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:38,375
- I am aware. We set?
- Yep.

285
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,125
All right.

286
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,916
Klaxon Auto Group.

287
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,624
Belgian company.
Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,958
Big seller in Europe and Asia
trying to break in here...

289
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:50,917
until recently.

290
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,332
Yeah.
I read some stories about it.

291
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,833
Pump the brakes,
and nothing's there.

292
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,541
Big recalls and fines,
corporate cover-up.

293
00:13:58,542 --> 00:13:59,791
Bit out of our jurisdiction, no?

294
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,082
No.
The company was robust.

295
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,165
The whole street was long,
except Bobby Axelrod

296
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,666
happened to be short
just before the news broke.

297
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,500
As always.

298
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:13,666
You have anything
proving criminality?

299
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,791
I'll leave that to
the super sleuths of Southern.

300
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,707
That's a natural alliteration.

301
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,749
Nice.

302
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,791
Now, the surface looks smooth,

303
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,332
but there's got to be
criminality underneath.

304
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,165
So fire up the Mystery Machine.

305
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,041
Thanks, Spyros.

306
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,125
We'll give it a look.
Keep me posted.

307
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,833
Can we dig into this one,
open up a case?

308
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,207
Sure.

309
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,541
Listen, it's nine-thirty.

310
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,959
Opening bell.

311
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,541
And they're off.

312
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,207
Ice Juice,
trading under the symbol ICEJ,

313
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,000
already pushing north of 20.

314
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,165
Oh, uh, I see I have coffee.

315
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,999
Cappuccino, actually,
but you don't.

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,416
I can run down
and get you one...

317
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,040
or a green tea, genmaicha,
or whatever you might...

318
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,582
I have broken down
and ranked each analyst

319
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,124
in the following ten categories,

320
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:52,332
performance, process,
360-degree workflow,

321
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,958
quality of models,
culture fit, team mentality,

322
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,707
sheer number of fresh ideas,

323
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,165
stubbornness, in both
its good and bad shadings,

324
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,374
value/skew tendencies,
that is, do you

325
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,999
look for low-risk, large-skew
opportunities, and bias.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,624
Do you get anchored to old names
that aren't working?

327
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,958
And then I created
an 11th category,

328
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,666
which I am calling desire.

329
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,874
That is where we will start
our discussion this morning.

330
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,124
So, if you would,

331
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,917
please talk about your desire
to remain at Axe Capital.

332
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,958
I grew up in Idaho.

333
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,874
We had a business club
in the ninth grade,

334
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,541
mock investment accounts.

335
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,290
By tenth grade,
I was running money

336
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,124
in an e-trade account for
the principal of my high school,

337
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,958
the guidance counselor,
and the asshole gym teacher.

338
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,082
Gym teacher?

339
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,749
I kept his
in a separate account,

340
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,165
made sure it nose-dived
the day after graduation

341
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,040
'cause... fuck that guy.

342
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,124
So, your anger at a person
in a higher station

343
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,166
led you to take punitive action
and book a loss.

344
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,999
You gonna fire me
for being honest?

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,207
What gives you
a distinct advantage

346
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,833
over all the other
capable people here?

347
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,750
Brain power...

348
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:04,040
sheer mental capacity.

349
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,958
You are that
far beyond the rest of us?

350
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,582
Well, not you.
I don't mean you.

351
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,749
So, you're both
wildly egotistical

352
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,416
and scared of conflict.

353
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,165
No. I'm...

354
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,499
I asked my father,

355
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,749
and he said to project that I'm
not at all worried about this.

356
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,707
Interesting approach, Pununzio.

357
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,500
Please don't fire me.

358
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,624
This just got here from the SEC.

359
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,499
Axe Cap research on Klaxon Auto.

360
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
Uhh.

361
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,207
Hmm.

362
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,040
You look at this,
a strong company.

363
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,707
There's very few short positions
out there.

364
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,874
And then the stock dives
on bad news.

365
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,165
Disastrous, not just bad.

366
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,165
And Axelrod is
right where he needs to be,

367
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,207
which isn't illegal unto itself.

368
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,457
Because why?

369
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,418
He's got research that puts him
on the right side.

370
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,249
The sales were strong.

371
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,749
They didn't like
the finance side.

372
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,666
Like Tesla.
They're moving units.

373
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,249
Doesn't mean the numbers add up.

374
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,125
Yeah.

375
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:13,499
This company's been around
50 years.

376
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,707
Not carrying so much debt.

377
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,875
Hmm.

378
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,291
Oh.

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,082
Right.

380
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
Report signed by Taylor Mason.

381
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,916
You were trying to warn the kid

382
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,499
about the place they're working.

383
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,417
Yeah.
I think they know.

384
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,417
How do you fire someone?

385
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,207
You can stand,

386
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,291
but I'm gonna sit for this one.

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,374
But just so I know exactly
what we're talking about,

388
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,917
why don't you tell me
who you're firing?

389
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,666
I'm not sure yet.

390
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,290
But when I look
at the efficiency

391
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,874
of the research department,
I see some bagginess,

392
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,290
so I'm sitting with everyone
and drilling down.

393
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,457
Honestly, I'm hoping that with
some direction

394
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,458
and some motivation,

395
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,040
they can just pick it up
without my having to...

396
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,457
Yeah, it would be nice
if a pep talk did the trick.

397
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,082
But analysts are too important.

398
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,165
Their responsibilities
are too built-in.

399
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,124
You can't afford
to be carrying someone

400
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,457
who isn't pulling
his or her weight.

401
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,249
So, do them the long-term favor
of ripping off the Band-Aid

402
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,207
and getting them one step closer
to where they're headed

403
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,749
and what they should be doing.

404
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,999
Thank you.

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,041
I had a feeling
that would be the course.

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,542
One thing, though.

407
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,499
Doing it will change you.

408
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm used to radical shifts.

409
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,499
This is different.

410
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,165
I get the feeling

411
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,124
there's a specific reason
you're struggling with this.

412
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:07,791
The question you've been
asking yourself.

413
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,834
Say it out loud.

414
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,542
I'm looking for affirmation.

415
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,374
My father was fired
when I was in seventh grade.

416
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,374
He was a mathematician
at an aerospace company.

417
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,374
His division
and his job went away,

418
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,208
and it never came back.

419
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,707
I imagine
that affected the homelife.

420
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,707
Yeah.

421
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,958
It did.

422
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,666
And the company?

423
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,375
The company thrived.

424
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,791
Graff...

425
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:09,959
let's go.

426
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:25,416
All the preparations
have been made.

427
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,290
I'm awaiting your command.

428
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,624
So, is it time?

429
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,667
No.
Not yet.

430
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,708
Almost.

431
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,208
We cracked 25.

432
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
The stock is running.

433
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,083
When will you do it?

434
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,917
Fucking soon.

435
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,000
Still alive for now.

436
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,999
This fun for ya?

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No.

438
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,374
Well, come on.

439
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,332
Skip out on the rest.

440
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,582
Let's go grab a coffee.

441
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,499
You and I?

442
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,374
Us. Yeah.

443
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,207
This is like the third time
you have directly spoken to me.

444
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:56,082
Yeah, well, that was before.

445
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,458
Before?

446
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,499
Okay, you don't want
to grab a coffee, fine.

447
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,667
We'll do the thing later.

448
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,542
Wow.

449
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,333
Why the flower bomb?

450
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,999
Because I still feel like
things aren't right between us,

451
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,416
and I don't like it.

452
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,332
And I want them to be.

453
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,582
Well, these are unnecessary...

454
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,834
but beautiful.

455
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,782
He's trying to dig himself out?

456
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,541
Man picked
an appropriate shovel.

457
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,082
Do you realize
that at this number,

458
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,666
I'm worth close to
a quarter of a billion dollars?

459
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,708
Up high, kid!

460
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,416
I'm gonna get an Ice Juice
from the fridge. You want one?

461
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:16,332
Don't get high
on your own supply.

462
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,416
No, I'll not be drinking
any of that nonsense.

463
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,750
Bring me something
with some alcohol in it.

464
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,290
Stock's about to pop to 30.

465
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,874
Double my position
at the market.

466
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,457
That'll tap the account.

467
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,457
If I had more,
I'd fucking buy more.

468
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,958
This thing is running
like Bill Rodgers in Boston,

469
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,959
fast and long.

470
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:43,958
This ICEJ issue is a real BBW,
big and bouncy.

471
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:47,791
Traderight's bidding for close
to 700,000 shares on the name.

472
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:48,792
Traderight?

473
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:50,499
Place is the fucking
Lollipop Guild.

474
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,417
Why is a tiny-ass
retail brokerage

475
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:54,040
looking to move
that kind of weight?

476
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,457
700,000 shares.

477
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,124
That's a big print
for a small place like that.

478
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,291
I'm gonna find out
what's up with it.

479
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,749
You think it's him,
Rhoades Sr., buying in heavy?

480
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,916
Could be.
Hedge funds and institutions

481
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,666
would want to show Patriot
they're supporting the deal,

482
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,999
so they do their transaction
with them.

483
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,624
Only a knowledgeable
and motivated individual

484
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,332
would use a small retail shop
for a buy like this.

485
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:17,875
This is a cash play.

486
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:20,124
So...

487
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,833
everything's in place.

488
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,707
Yeah.

489
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:29,625
It's golden frog time.

490
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:53,332
It seems pretty fast.

491
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,667
It is.
And nasty.

492
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,707
Well, it'll make for
a bumpy couple of days.

493
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,583
But no permanent damage, Doc?

494
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:11,457
If they're healthy
to begin with, no,

495
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,124
no permanent damage.

496
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm still not sure
I'd recommend it.

497
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,124
I've registered that.

498
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,082
Good.

499
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,290
You want your slide back
from my lab or...

500
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,375
No.
Get rid of it for me.

501
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,834
For your foundation.

502
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,749
Money's in the account.

503
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,749
And as you know,
it's a lot of money.

504
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,624
How much do I use?

505
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,416
Not much.
Just trace amounts.

506
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:53,958
That's all that's in there.

507
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,666
It's like Brylcreem, then.

508
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,583
Little dab'll do ya?

509
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:03,125
Just trace amounts on my signal.

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,750
Hey, Ron.

511
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,707
How ya feeling, Ron?

512
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,667
Hey, Ron.

513
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,667
What's up, Ronnie?

514
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,291
We got just the guy.

515
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:52,249
He owes.

516
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,040
Sometimes a man
comes into your life

517
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,958
at just the right time,
you know?

518
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,667
Absolutely.

519
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,165
My wife caught her
stealing jewelry.

520
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,416
I love the way she cleans,

521
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,833
but it's either this
or she gets deported.

522
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,834
Her choice.

523
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,165
Well, as long as it doesn't
come from you.

524
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,958
You get someone else to ask her.

525
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,374
Got ten guys who can do that.

526
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,916
Won't track back to me.

527
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,875
Good.

528
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,374
Thanks for paying it off.

529
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,541
I do what I say I'm gonna do.

530
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,165
Are you sure about this?

531
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,582
This is not gonna be pleasant
for whoever you hire.

532
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,624
It's got to be people you trust.

533
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:49,124
There can't be
any clear connection.

534
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:49,667
I got it.

535
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,750
I have some ideas.

536
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,791
I can't do it.

537
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,082
What do you mean, you can't?

538
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,207
You got to do it.

539
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,707
Look, you promised me,
and you owe me.

540
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,749
I still owe you,

541
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,457
but I can't do this
to myself, man...

542
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,375
not even for you.

543
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,124
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, I believe you.

544
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,416
I just need a number
to call you back on.

545
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,375
Hold on one second.

546
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:05,040
Hey, Burt,
I'm gonna have to table

547
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,624
the new
home-starts feature.

548
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,916
I've got something breaking.

549
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,750
People are getting sick
on Ice Juice.

550
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,958
How's it going?

551
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,291
Okay.

552
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,458
Oh, I'll cover that shit.

553
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,541
You'll lose.

554
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,542
No way.

555
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:28,082
What's the action on?

556
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,457
We're short a name.

557
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,458
As of now, it's going up.

558
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,791
People are taking bets
on the exact moment

559
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,040
it will turn and start falling.

560
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:34,875
See you in a bit.

561
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,082
Book it.

562
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,000
Maybe I'll get in on this.

563
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,792
Anybody betting it won't turn?

564
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,791
No, ma'am.
This is a red-light short.

565
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,666
Axe doesn't get positions
this size wrong.

566
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,458
What is it?
Ice Juice.

567
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,375
You know what?
No, thanks.

568
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:59,082
Sorry to barge in.

569
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,332
Oh.

570
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,874
Always welcome.

571
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,499
What's going on?

572
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,959
How's your stock play?

573
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:07,792
I heard something.

574
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:10,999
I think it's going well.

575
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,457
It seems to be up, way up.

576
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,624
Oh, Chuck.

577
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,500
It's not gonna stay there.

578
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:21,499
And the thing I heard...

579
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,458
Axe Cap is short the stock.

580
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,874
Uh, thank you for telling me.

581
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,166
I appreciate it.

582
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,040
Although I don't appreciate
you looking at me

583
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,791
like some kind of a pathetic dog
you see in a shelter.

584
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,999
Get out of the stock, Chuck,
any way you can.

585
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,541
They're gonna crush you.
Is that so?

586
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,542
Wow, I'm glad to see
you view me as so defenseless.

587
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,958
I think enough of you
to come here

588
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:56,332
and violate my agreement
with my company.

589
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,082
And I think of you as
a fucking titan in your arena,

590
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,457
but you don't understand
what's going on.

591
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,332
No, I think
that I understand plenty

592
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,457
about your lack of faith
right now.

593
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,833
Okay, we can bicker as long
as you want another time,

594
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,999
but are you gonna
get out of your position?

595
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,708
No.

596
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,916
Can't or won't?

597
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:19,667
What difference does it make?

598
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,500
Foolishness is right next door
to strength.

599
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,708
So they say.

600
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,707
Hello?

601
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,457
Mafee, it's Wendy Rhoades.

602
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,624
The Ice Juice short,
how do I get a piece of that?

603
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,791
There's an allocation.
I can make it happen.

604
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,207
As much as I can get.

605
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,834
You got it, baller.

606
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,958
Eat anything unusual today?

607
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,124
I've been drinking a lot
of this stuff.

608
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,374
Ah, we'll take a look.

609
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,124
It's supposed to be
good for you.

610
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,125
Ready?

611
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,249
I've got illness breaking out
at six other locations.

612
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,124
Some victims already have
lawyers and are prepping a suit.

613
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,416
Trace amounts of bacteria
in the warehouse.

614
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,457
I've got a doctor who treated
a couple of the sick patients,

615
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:29,332
uh, speaking out against
Ice Juice's flash-pas technique

616
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:29,917
as faux science and unsafe.

617
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:31,749
- Hey!
- Yeah?

618
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,249
Run down flash-pas!

619
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,207
Run down hazards
of a corrupted fruit

620
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,749
and/or vegetable supply.

621
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,624
Run down fraudulent
purification techniques.

622
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,124
We may also need a sidebar

623
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,165
on food-borne outbreaks
at chain restaurants,

624
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,332
the historical effects
on the populous,

625
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,707
- company, the whole thing.
- All over it.

626
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,416
This is spider eggs
in bubblegum.

627
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,707
This is another Chipotle.

628
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,833
It's worse.

629
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,249
Okay.

630
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,583
What do we got?

631
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,124
Excuse me. Hey.

632
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,332
Hey, Chuck, it's...
It's Armageddon.

633
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,707
Easy, Ira. Tell me
what the hell's going on.

634
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,374
Stories are hitting, news
outlets calling for comment,

635
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,541
social media, the press.
People are getting sick.

636
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,207
Something's breaking out.

637
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,374
They don't know if it's listeria

638
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,040
or Legionnaires'
or what the fuck it is.

639
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,040
- You have a TV, put it on.
- I'm not gonna

640
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,165
turn on my TV, Ira.
Tell me what I'd see.

641
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,040
People getting
loaded into ambulances,

642
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,999
reports of illness
going back several weeks,

643
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,749
which my fucking clients
failed to mention.

644
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,249
The stock was getting pummeled
so badly, they halted trading.

645
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,374
The smart money's
fled to safety,

646
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,707
and when that happens,
the bottom drops out.

647
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,499
When trading resumes,
the deal's gonna break.

648
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,541
That's when you go below
the original deal price,

649
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:35,291
and th-that's...

650
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,041
an unmitigated disaster.

651
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,749
Yeah. This is, uh...

652
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,457
This is fucking horrible.

653
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,082
Is there any way you can sell?

654
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,374
Chuck, my stock's
all restricted.

655
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,707
Officer class, Ira.

656
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,583
Keep it together.

657
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,916
Son of a bitch.

658
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,624
Rudy, I've brought you in last

659
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,916
because when I look at this
on a purely results-based model,

660
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,833
that's where you stand...
last.

661
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,290
Last?

662
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,834
Really?

663
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,791
I'm really last.

664
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,999
By the numbers, yes, dead last.

665
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,749
My... My name isn't Rudy.

666
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,417
It's Peter.

667
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:25,040
Oh.
Do you prefer Peter?

668
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,082
No.

669
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,124
And I love
that they call me Rudy.

670
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,457
You know why?

671
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,749
No.

672
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,541
It's because this place is like
Notre Dame was for him.

673
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,958
The real Rudy.

674
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,165
I was
a high-school fuck-up.

675
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:42,249
But I impressed a teacher,
got into Hofstra.

676
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,916
I saw Axe speak there,

677
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:47,082
and from that moment,
this is all I dreamed about.

678
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,124
Being here at Axe Capital?

679
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,165
Yes. The next time
Axe showed on campus,

680
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,541
I asked him a smart question,

681
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,290
one that I had thought about,
planned out ahead of time,

682
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,374
and he said to see him
when I got out,

683
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,375
he'd find a place
for me. He did.

684
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:02,457
But I figured
he'd be like my coach here,

685
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:06,040
and, well, he hasn't
been that... at all.

686
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,458
Just... Just been left
to figure it out for myself.

687
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,999
Well, there's no janitor
with a heart of gold

688
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,207
here to root you on,

689
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,582
and no one gets on this field
unless they are the fastest,

690
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:22,542
strongest, or most talented
person on the depth chart.

691
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,707
I know.

692
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,332
And I know
I don't really belong,

693
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:31,667
on paper or in any other way.

694
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,207
But if I somehow make it
out of this room alive,

695
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:39,541
you won't see another person
in this place work harder,

696
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:42,999
longer, faster than me.

697
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,458
I promise.

698
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,291
Yes!

699
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:09,249
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

700
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,707
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

701
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,874
Nice!

702
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:17,040
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

703
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:21,249
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

704
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,707
I just now realized
what they're saying, Rudy...

705
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,124
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
As in Rudy Ruettiger.

706
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,708
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

707
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,583
Donna!

708
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,207
Have the kid get in here

709
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,249
and get this fucking software
off my computer.

710
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,291
I have no more use for it.

711
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:19,290
Well, if old Rhoades Sr.
Was counting on any liquidity

712
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:23,374
from this particular venture,
he is sadly mistaken

713
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,958
'cause this is leaving him
cash-strapped and tits-up.

714
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,249
Speaking of cash,

715
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,499
this could have him
looking to sell Palm Beach.

716
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,666
Ooh, the pride and joy.

717
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:34,124
If you knew how many times
I'd seen that crusty bastard

718
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,958
strutting around
Mar-a-Iago,

719
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,082
bragging about
his better frontage.

720
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,041
You know what?

721
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,249
Have someone down there
ready to pounce

722
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,082
if the place hits the market.

723
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,290
Straw bidder.

724
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:48,124
Yeah, I'll scoop it up cheap
when the clearance sale starts.

725
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,999
Trading on ICEJ resumed just
in time for the closing bell.

726
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,959
Care to watch the docking
of the Hindenburg?

727
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,124
Ding, ding, ding!

728
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,165
Closing price,

729
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:04,124
three, eighty-nine.

730
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,874
Stillborn.

731
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,165
Reuters says,

732
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,416
"Fresh-Squeezed Chapter 11
in its future."

733
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,207
This is one
busted-ass IPO.

734
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,834
Let's crack open that bottle.

735
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:19,000
Just need your signature
on the trading report.

736
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,499
Mm.

737
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,499
We crushed it today.

738
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,874
Oh, oh, what is this?

739
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,332
What?

740
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,833
The big ICEJ allocation
to the New Beginnings fund.

741
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,749
What the fuck?
Wendy Rhoades wanted in.

742
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,749
She called in the request right
before the thing went south.

743
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,374
She took down a huge
chunk of change for herself.

744
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,165
I assumed it came from you, Axe.

745
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,290
It fucking didn't.

746
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,874
You notify me next time
she makes a request like that

747
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,499
before you fucking fulfill it...

748
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,374
unless you want to start
thinking about

749
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,749
another career
besides trading equities.

750
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,624
You got it.

751
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,582
Fuck. Sorry.

752
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:55,875
Fuck.

753
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,457
What do you think she knew?

754
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,874
Not sure.

755
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,290
Either way, it's a strong move

756
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:05,040
betting against the family
like that.

757
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,708
Paid off.

758
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,166
Who'd you can?
Oh.

759
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,874
I didn't do it
to be perceived as tough,

760
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,374
but to make it clear
that if you survive today,

761
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,040
you are now officially
on the team

762
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:02,082
and wouldn't have to keep
looking over your shoulder.

763
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,541
Yeah, yeah.
Someone still

764
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:06,290
got a stake through the heart,
and I want to know who.

765
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,040
I could have justified
firing Rudy.

766
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,457
He's still finding his footing.

767
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,457
But he's scrappy
and deserves the chance.

768
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,082
So I fired Pununzio instead.

769
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,791
He's kind of a weasel.

770
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,958
Good a reason as any.

771
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,875
And now
you're baptized by blood.

772
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,040
I need a drink.

773
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,707
Like a real drink?

774
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:26,749
Yeah.

775
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,125
Maybe like a whole bottle
of a real drink.

776
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:54,165
You're not gonna be
in that clown car for long.

777
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,246
I love it.
It's a great car.

778
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,958
Look, I didn't want
to do this on site.

779
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,165
That's why I offered
to take you to coffee.

780
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,500
Do what?

781
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,332
This is for you.

782
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:12,000
Open it up.

783
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:17,541
That's $250,000 dollars...

784
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:22,040
as a personal thank-you
from me to you, on Klaxon.

785
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,999
And I'm cheap as fuck.

786
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,791
I'm well-compensated,
more than well-compensated.

787
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,707
Yeah, officially
and on the books,

788
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:31,208
with records
of the transactions everywhere.

789
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:35,874
But I wanted to spiff you
above that.

790
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,916
Everyone in our line
needs cash squirreled away.

791
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:42,749
It can make all the difference.

792
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,750
Believe me.

793
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,249
I can see
you are telling the truth.

794
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,374
Then believe me when I say this.

795
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,916
There's more coming...

796
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:54,166
more of all of it.

797
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,207
It took me a while...

798
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:03,208
but now I understand
exactly what Axe sees in you.

799
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,083
Have a good night.

800
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:35,457
Did I actually hear Mom
crying from the other room?

801
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,249
Might have been me.

802
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,916
You want to play
the "on paper" game now?

803
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,999
I'm down millions today.

804
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,666
I can't believe
how much goddamn money I lost.

805
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:49,290
It was never yours
to begin with.

806
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,040
You got to get it in the boat

807
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,707
before you can hang it
on the goddamn wall.

808
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,874
Only thing to do
in a case like this

809
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:58,958
is write off the loss
against your cap gains.

810
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:00,791
This was supposed to be
my cap gain.

811
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:05,124
Anyway, I-I should be
apologizing to you.

812
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,457
Fucking right.

813
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:10,290
But you should really
apologize to your friend,

814
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:13,124
since he's the one who
took the actual pounding.

815
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,917
Dad.

816
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:19,332
Oh, God.

817
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:23,749
No, Chuck, you didn't...
You didn't go into your trust?

818
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,625
I authorized it.

819
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:28,958
I had
that much confidence in it.

820
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,375
And you, Ira.

821
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,332
I'd do it again.

822
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:36,290
It was a fluke thing.

823
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,207
The whole eight-
million-dollar equity piece?

824
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,457
Yes.

825
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,082
That's where we started.

826
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:45,624
What?

827
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,791
- Dad?
- It was rolling.

828
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,290
The thing
was a complete monster.

829
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,833
And what you do...

830
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:56,291
when you have an advantage
is press it.

831
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,624
How much?

832
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,792
All of it.

833
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:10,833
So, my entire trust is...

834
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,916
Gone.

835
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,333
I'm gonna throw up.

836
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:21,333
Well, you did have
that Ice Juice today.

837
00:45:44,834 --> 00:45:49,207
I've never used
the word swanky before,

838
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:51,749
but that's what
this building is swanky.

839
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,791
I wouldn't use
that word, either,

840
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,374
but I can't say you're wrong.

841
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,791
It must feel good.

842
00:45:56,792 --> 00:46:00,749
My own apartment's probably
a quarter the size of yours,

843
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,040
in a part of town that's
considerably worse than this.

844
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:05,959
During the winter,

845
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,124
the heat pipes bang
practically all night.

846
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,165
I grew up in a place like that.

847
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,374
Mm.

848
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:14,791
Sometimes I look
at my surroundings

849
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,874
and wonder why I stay...

850
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,750
doing what I do.

851
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,165
I mean, your boss offered

852
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,916
to put me in a place like this.

853
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:23,917
Really?
Oh, yeah.

854
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:25,749
Practically got
on his hands and knees

855
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,332
and begged me to work for him.

856
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,916
And the night I turned him down,

857
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:32,207
when I got home
and looked around my place,

858
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,457
for about ten minutes,
I felt like an idiot.

859
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,124
I can understand that.

860
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:40,916
Then I fell straight asleep
'cause I had a clean conscience.

861
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:43,207
I was where
I was supposed to be,

862
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,457
doing the right thing.

863
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,833
I am happy for you.

864
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:49,416
And now I'm going to go inside.

865
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,833
Yeah.
You can in a second.

866
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,499
But as you're putting your head
on your pillow tonight,

867
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,124
I want you to think about
what you're really trading on

868
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,874
in order to live here,
work there, be who you are.

869
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,624
I think about it all the time.

870
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,707
That means there's still hope...

871
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,249
because soon, you'll never
think about it again.

872
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,749
You will just glide along, rich,
with even bigger apartments

873
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,499
and nicer watches
and faster planes,

874
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,290
only none of it will matter
to you at all.

875
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,457
We never use the words
we really mean.

876
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,499
Like "swanky"?
No.

877
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,332
Like "soul."

878
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,999
Your soul.

879
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,290
Axelrod will demand things
of you incrementally

880
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:32,541
that will change the fundamental
nature of who you are,

881
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,833
and I am here because
I can give it back to you.

882
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:39,332
I don't believe in the soul...

883
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:41,624
not in the way
it's traditionally used,

884
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,124
nor in the more modern meaning,

885
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,958
which connotes connectedness
and being spiritually awake.

886
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:49,582
What I do believe in
are actions, purpose,

887
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,290
purity of vocation,

888
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:54,165
and the challenges that
come along with those things,

889
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,374
the things that
make me feel alive.

890
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,125
Axe Capital gives me
all of that and more.

891
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,207
So, you worry about my soul,

892
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:06,083
and I'll just keep doing my job.

893
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:26,833
I figured on a little more wow
factor for two-thousand bucks.

894
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,666
I had the rest dropped off
at the hospital.

895
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:32,083
Very thoughtful of you.

896
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:38,332
You know
who you look like right now?

897
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,125
Who?

898
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:45,541
Bobby fucking Axelrod.

899
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:48,249
It's been a while.

900
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,416
Well, I had a good day.

901
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,082
I'm glad you noticed.

902
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,499
Oh, I notice.

903
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,749
I'm not the one who takes
shit between us for granted.

904
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,874
You're right.

905
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,582
And that's why I was trying
to formalize my apology

906
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:04,291
with the flowers.

907
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:07,874
Then I formally accept.

908
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:13,291
So, we can start over from here?

909
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:18,375
Yeah.

910
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:26,791
So, this is like a first date?

911
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,708
Sure.

912
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:36,165
Tell me something
about yourself.

913
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,708
I'm in finance.
Mm.

914
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,749
Sounds boring.

915
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,374
No!
No, not today.

916
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,207
Today, I kicked ass at work,

917
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,874
yeah, big project I've spent
the last few weeks on.

918
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,499
Whose ass did you kick?

919
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,707
Rhoades.

920
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:53,958
Big time.

921
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,290
Pounded a company he's in.

922
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,833
Your friends at the bar helped.
Everyone stepped up.

923
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,708
Good.

924
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:08,457
Those don't look like Bruno's.

925
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:09,500
Mm.
Fuck Bruno.

926
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,959
Ryan did those up
in the wood-burning oven.

927
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,750
Remember our real first date?

928
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,999
Caviar.

929
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,834
I was trying to dazzle you.

930
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:34,750
Well, you did.

931
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,290
I didn't even like
that stuff back then.

932
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,041
Ah, you got used to it.

933
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,874
Mmm.

934
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,624
Still is better than anchovies.

935
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,499
That's for fucking sure.

936
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,708
Mmm.

937
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,082
Hey, what's going on?

938
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:46,124
Where are you?

939
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,874
I'm trying.

940
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,582
I don't know, Bobby.

941
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,834
I'm... I'm really trying.

942
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:13,624
The chunk of cash I need

943
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,332
is on a statement
with your name on it.

944
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,208
The blind trust.

945
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:21,499
Well, if this is what
it takes...

946
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,165
uh, to help you and Ira...

947
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,874
- Does that mean...
- Yeah.

948
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,333
Crack it open.

949
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,332
How would you like to be
done with this floor for good

950
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,958
and out of that halfway house,
and home,

951
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,874
with only your platinum
wristwatch for jewelry

952
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,707
instead of an ankle bracelet?

953
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:41,999
When? How?

954
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,707
Almost immediately.

955
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,165
Any deal I make with you
has to be in writing.

956
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:50,040
Terms of your release will be...

957
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:53,582
this meeting
and what I instruct you to do

958
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:56,791
will never even
be spoken of again.

959
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:58,749
Whatever it is, I'm ready.

960
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,707
Upon my word,

961
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,666
you will make a call
to Bobby Axelrod

962
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:06,082
and tell him
that you need to see him,

963
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,707
that it's urgent.

964
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,833
And then when he shows up,
you'll tell him the truth...

965
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:11,999
What's on your mind?

966
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,874
That my father,
Charles Rhoades Sr.,

967
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,541
has taken a massive position
in a new IPO...

968
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:18,916
Chuck Rhoades Sr.
Has taken a significant stake

969
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:19,917
in a company
that's going public.

970
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:21,541
Ice Juice.

971
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:22,833
Ice Juice.

972
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:25,458
No shit.

973
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:30,583
I believe I can do all that.

974
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:33,874
Bittersweet day
for me today, Dake.

975
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,874
Why's that, sir?

976
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,666
You must have impressed
some people

977
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,124
while you were in New York,

978
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,958
the Attorney General among them.

979
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:42,249
Sir?

980
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,165
You've been named
interim U.S. Attorney

981
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,582
for the Eastern District.

982
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:46,833
I've been named...

983
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,791
A.G. said, "Smarts and ambition
are coming off him"

984
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,499
like heat waves
from an Oklahoma blacktop."

985
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,582
You've got to get on the train.

986
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:58,083
I always knew I'd be
working for you someday.

987
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,624
Rhoades?

988
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:28,040
You didn't think this shit
happened by accident,

989
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,124
did you, Mr. Dake?

990
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,999
So, you leveraged the Attorney
General into my appointment.

991
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,917
It was no arm twist.

992
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,541
I just told her
that smarts and ambition

993
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,666
were coming off you

994
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,499
like heat waves
from an Oklahoma blacktop.

995
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,582
And she agreed.

996
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:42,958
Word of advice.

997
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:45,082
You get the big job,

998
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,833
you want
to hit the ground running.

999
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:50,666
You're gonna have a shitload
of FBI at your disposal,

1000
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:53,749
and this is
how I suggest you deploy them.

1001
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,875
Axelrod.

1002
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,124
Bobby Axelrod's moves

1003
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:02,374
will be almost impossible
to track.

1004
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:06,165
So, in addition
to monitoring all his trades,

1005
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,999
follow everyone he touches
and everyone they touch.

1006
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,040
The pattern
won't be easy to spot,

1007
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:13,417
but it will be there.

1008
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,082
There are 18 Ice Juice locations

1009
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,457
in New York City alone.

1010
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:27,082
You will need to monitor
all of them.

1011
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,666
Because he will be acting
out of malice,

1012
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:33,040
he will take risks
he'd normally avoid.

1013
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:37,000
He will use
compromised associates.

1014
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,083
You must be ready
across the board.

1015
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,499
The stock is running.

1016
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,916
When will you do it?

1017
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:53,834
Fucking soon.

1018
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,542
Oh!

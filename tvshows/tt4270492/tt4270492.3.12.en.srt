You want an unprecedented
raise in record time.

00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:12,542
So how are you going to help me
get the first ten stacks?

I just want to see you work
a little bit harder for it.

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,667
You breached my threshold
and threatened me.

What, exactly, did you do?

How do I get you to break
your letter of intent

off the raise team.

Obstruction of justice.

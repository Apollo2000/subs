00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:26,539
A Sicilian woman and
an Arab trader fell in love.

278
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:30,122
But the Arab had a wife
and children back in Tunisia.

279
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:33,706
So he told the Sicilian woman
that he loved her,

but he had to go back
to his family.

Is there anything I can say to
get you to see it differently?

1263
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,289
There is not.

1264
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:13,163
Wags.

1265
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:15,747
You ready to become a wartime
consiglieri once again?

1266
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,414
Pop had Genco.
You have me.

1267
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:20,414
You know why they called it
going to the mattresses

1268
00:52:20,498 --> 00:52:22,122
when mob families
went to war?

1269
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,913
It's mentioned in 1
but never explained.

1270
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:25,205
General idea.

1271
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,080
It's because you had to
move out of your home

1272
00:52:27,164 --> 00:52:30,581
and hole up some place where
no one could find you,

1273
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:32,038
with all your men.

1274
00:52:32,122 --> 00:52:33,622
But you had to do it quick,

1275
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,664
so that you'd get the jump
on the rival family

1276
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:37,122
before they got
the jump on you.

1277
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:39,038
So you had places
stashed around the city,

1278
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,997
with the mattresses
on the floor.

1279
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:43,455
And that is where
you would make your stand

1280
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,414
until you nailed the boss
of the rival family.

1281
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:48,247
And once you got him

1282
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,414
and all his soldiers
fell into line,

1283
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,455
that's when you'd go home
to your comfy bed

1284
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,205
and your wife and kids.

1285
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:55,581
And that's what
we're about to do?

1286
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:57,080
We sure are.

1287
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:58,247
Get me Bach.

1288
00:52:58,331 --> 00:52:59,581
Get me Hall.

1289
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:01,581
Get me anyone
who can help us find out

1290
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:05,497
what is near and dear to
Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince.

1291
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:08,080
Because when I find out
what matters to him,

1292
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:10,622
I am going to
fucking destroy it.

1293
00:53:10,706 --> 00:53:13,497
And him right along
with it.

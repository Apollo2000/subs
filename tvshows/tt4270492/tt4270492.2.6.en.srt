1
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:09,525
<i>Previously on Billions...</i>

2
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:11,327
You heard anything about a new casino

3
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:12,962
coming to upstate New York?

4
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,363
Yeah. I heard whispers.

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,665
Sandicot's downtown is
ripe for redevelopment.

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,735
The whole county's on
the edge of default.

7
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:21,737
You get to buy it cheap,
pennies on the dollar.

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,206
<i>Wendy was at Krakow
Capital earlier today.</i>

9
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,108
I need you back at Axe Capital.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,710
Well, that's not gonna happen.

11
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:29,311
I'm here to ask a favor.

12
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:30,679
Rhoades reached out to me.

13
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:31,913
I'll be careful.

14
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,782
<i>We only get one shot at this.</i>

15
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,684
Express concerns about the bid rigging.

16
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:37,753
Make it clear that you
know it's going on.

17
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:39,487
Arendt is putting us all in danger.

18
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,079
<i>He's gonna send us all to prison.</i>

19
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,043
Mike's putting the band
back together again,

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,926
just like I told him to.

21
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:48,296
Lawrence Boyd, you're under arrest.

22
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,498
I thought you understood
the goddamn game.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,333
Oh, I believe I do.

24
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:56,137
We find everybody that he fucked
and we buy up their clamps.

25
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,640
It'll be tantamount to
a class-action suit.

26
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,874
Oh!

27
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:00,908
You've been served.

28
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,876
With a lawsuit?

29
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,844
Hundred and twenty-seven of them.

30
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,254
They expedited you right through.

31
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,456
I'm not sure swift
justice is what I'm after,

32
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,126
but I'm glad to be outside.

33
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:55,880
If I didn't have the five
million for the bail,

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,930
I would've had to stay the night.

35
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,031
You'd have been fine.

36
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,999
No, I wouldn't have.

37
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,600
Get us the fuck out of here.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,940
Rhoades is gonna flip one of your guys.

39
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,609
When this is over,
you'll be able to stand tall

40
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,178
knowing that you did the
right thing by cooperating.

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,148
<i>He has. I got word.</i>

42
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,216
Where do I sign?

43
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,483
What do I do?

44
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,052
- Flip him back.
- How?

45
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:24,856
I introduced you to a man
who can get that done.

46
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,958
Hall stopped returning my calls.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,509
You wouldn't let him do what he wanted.

48
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:31,628
Well, I fucking will now.
Anything he says.

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,965
You goddamned better,

50
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,800
because I need you to gut
this motherfucker Rhoades

51
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:39,202
for both of us.

52
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:42,105
I will.

53
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:46,844
I'll get out here.

54
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,196
When you get back to your
country house tonight,

55
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:58,221
go out back and take a sauna.

56
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,190
Get focused.

57
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,125
That's an order.

58
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:13,068
You know, I usually get a
full-on<i> Woodrow Wilson</i> going

59
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,138
when I'm billing a client for
hundreds of lawyer hours a week.

60
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:19,685
But, uh, every hour I spend with you,

61
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:22,253
I'm aware little by little,
you're getting wiped out,

62
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:23,997
and that's even though
I'm underbilling you.

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,948
And then I sign the slips
for all the associates

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,416
putting in time on your cases,

65
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,952
and I wind up feeling a little sick.

66
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,754
Just keep doing what you're doing.

67
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,190
I'll figure it out.

68
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:38,193
How about the house?
It has to have occurred to you.

69
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,761
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,997
Oh, it would solve a lot of problems.

71
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,733
Financially.

72
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,101
Are you worried Wendy
wouldn't want to sell?

73
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,504
No.

74
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:52,874
I'm worried she wouldn't care.

75
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,543
You're raising your children here.

76
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:57,445
Trust me, it matters just as
much to her as it does to you.

77
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,234
That doesn't mean she wouldn't see
the wisdom of putting it on the market.

78
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,516
Right now,
things between us are so fragile,

79
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:06,254
I'm afraid to pull even a single thread.

80
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,522
Plus, if I floated selling the house,

81
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,925
I'd have to tell her why,

82
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:14,728
and I think it's best that she...

83
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,030
doesn't know the full extent of things.

84
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,132
How's couples therapy going?

85
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,335
As excruciating as I remember it?

86
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,308
Actually, I find that the best moments

87
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,312
often closely follow the worst ones.

88
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,913
You know?

89
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,316
Every now and then, for whatever reason,

90
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,852
the heaviness just lifts,

91
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,356
and, uh...

92
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,257
then we're just us again.

93
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,659
I don't remember those
moments lasting very long.

94
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,060
Like lightning.

95
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,602
Y-Y-You're fighting for a lot right now,

96
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:58,037
your job, your marriage.

97
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,741
Maybe consider the concept
that everything has a life span

98
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:05,544
and it's not the worst thing
to let certain things change...

99
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:08,180
or die off... when it's time.

100
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:19,958
Fuck.

101
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,528
I'm here solely at the
behest of our mutual friend.

102
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,836
I know.

103
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:28,133
He says that you've gained a
more comprehensive understanding

104
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:30,903
of your position.

105
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,359
I have.

106
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:35,373
What happens now?

107
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,142
Your accounts are frozen, of course,

108
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:40,278
so go to your contingency funds.

109
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,115
You'll need to access
2.5 million dollars

110
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:48,653
and funnel that amount
here by tomorrow morning.

111
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:49,954
It's the first installment

112
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,424
to your former associate
Michael Arendt...

113
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,525
so that he will cease cooperating.

114
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,561
You need to form a holding company...

115
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,763
I suggest on the Isle of Man...

116
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,131
in order to make payments to his wife

117
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,634
in the sum of $2.5 million
dollars every quarter...

118
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:05,335
I don't want to know the specifics.

119
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:07,404
You need to carry the weight of it now.

120
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:10,340
If any of these wire transfers
is even a minute late,

121
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:13,009
he will be free to say whatever he wants

122
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,945
to whomever he wants.

123
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:17,047
I understand.

124
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,417
Is money enough?

125
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,886
There's also this.

126
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,122
Arendt's children?

127
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,557
He will know that I will know

128
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,560
where they are every
day that he's in jail.

129
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:33,763
You wouldn't actually hurt them?

130
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:37,867
Imagine the kind of man
that could hurt a child,

131
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:40,770
the psychic baggage
that would come along

132
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:43,739
with something like that.

133
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:46,075
You'd never offload it.

134
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,510
Not really.

135
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,681
Make the payments.
I'll take care of the rest.

136
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,550
Enjoy your sauna.

137
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:03,058
<i>Get in touch with Boyd's people.</i>

138
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,326
Let's get him in here.

139
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:05,961
What do you think we can ask for?

140
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:08,363
The maximum, what is it, ten years?

141
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,132
Let's offer five.

142
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,767
Lowest I'll go is 18 months.

143
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,002
Jail time?

144
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,604
He's not even gonna negotiate
if that's on the table.

145
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:16,771
So be it.

146
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:19,174
You want to risk putting
this in front of a jury?

147
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,042
I want the world to know that I can be

148
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,044
a stubborn motherfucker if I need to be.

149
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,913
We're talking about
bid-rigging Treasury auctions.

150
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,283
What kind of a jury isn't
gonna slip into a coma

151
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,353
while we try to explain to them
what the fuck that even means?

152
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:34,622
It's your job to figure out
how to keep them entertained.

153
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:39,961
This is a case that
could make your career.

154
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,863
Or end it.

155
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:05,152
I can't wait to see Boyd's face.

156
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:11,440
That's right.

157
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,966
We don't rate an appearance by Mr. Boyd?

158
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:23,836
Mr. Boyd is confident his
presence isn't required.

159
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,239
I've been instructed by
my client to tell you

160
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,874
that Spartan-Ives is
willing to pay a small fine,

161
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,043
but that there will be
no admission of guilt

162
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:35,548
by Mr. Boyd personally and,
of course, no termination.

163
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,050
We have an authenticated audio recording

164
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,385
of your client incriminating himself,

165
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,554
and a corroborating witness.

166
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,492
You can tell your client
that his disrespect

167
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,096
of the Southern District has been noted.

168
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,597
There's a deal on the table.

169
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,432
We pass.

170
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,904
Hang tight.

171
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,945
Hey.

172
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,413
Hey.

173
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,681
What was that?

174
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,783
Uh, we've lost Arendt.

175
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,351
What do you mean, he's...

176
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,087
Oh, fuck!

177
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,956
Boyd obviously feels safe.

178
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,891
Somebody got to our witness.

179
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,127
So all we have is a shitty recording?

180
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,694
- That's our case?
- No.

181
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,363
We have a guilty defendant.

182
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,031
Don't forget about that part.

183
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,532
You wanted a jury trial.

184
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,368
You've definitely got it.

185
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,479
<i>I was renovating anyway,</i>

186
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,481
so I said, "Well,
why not dry-age my own?"

187
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,916
Ohh!

188
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,950
All that meat!

189
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,051
Don't you be shy.

190
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,452
You choose whatever you want,

191
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,755
and I'll have Valerie
throw it on the grill.

192
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,926
We have the Wagyus, Tomahawk ribeye,

193
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,203
Fullblood Tenderloin...
all grass-fed, of course.

194
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:01,063
Ooh. A5 Kobe Strip.

195
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,466
That is a nice one.

196
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,402
That's aging well.

197
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:11,441
So, listen, we have a timing issue.

198
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,776
How bad?

199
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,445
We cut deals with all the
property owners to vacate,

200
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,479
but...

201
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,947
Some are backing out?

202
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,316
A guy named Hank Flagg.

203
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,951
Spoke to my lawyers last night.

204
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,520
I don't think he's some crank.

205
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:27,190
He's made it clear he's
holding out for a better deal.

206
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,524
Does he know it's a casino?

207
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,459
I made all the offers through an LLC.

208
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,794
No one knows I'm involved.

209
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,029
Can we work around him?

210
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:36,365
Well, he's got 200 acres of shit,
but it's key.

211
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,435
It's where we need to build
the access road to the interstate.

212
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,869
Well, what was your offer?

213
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,037
One-point-five.

214
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,506
For 200 acres in the middle
of the fucking sticks?

215
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,074
Yeah, you wanted to get it done.

216
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,309
I did.

217
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,010
We'll bring in a government agency,

218
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:51,612
a community-reinvestment
development authority.

219
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,781
They will basically
force him from the land.

220
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:56,017
That'll turn into the
litigation from hell.

221
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,321
Special-interest groups'll pile on,
environmentalistas.

222
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:00,956
That flame'll burn quick,

223
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,391
and then I'll bleed the guy out.

224
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,193
He'll take my price.

225
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,228
They always do.

226
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,531
Two years at the outside.

227
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,100
Look, I'd be willing to pop up there,

228
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:14,168
see what I can...

229
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,838
Have at it. Maybe you'll turn him.

230
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,174
I'm gonna go check on the grill.

231
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,676
Take your time.

232
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,165
Two years?

233
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,981
What's that gonna cost us?

234
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,415
Our kidneys.

235
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,086
Flagg got his price. He backed out.

236
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,687
The guy knows something's up.

237
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,791
What are you gonna have?

238
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:40,093
I don't give a shit. You decide.

239
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,776
Hello?

240
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,246
Hello. In here.

241
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,449
Hey.

242
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:04,951
Uh, isn't this<i> my</i> night?

243
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,953
I'm just stopping by.

244
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,994
Our son told me...

245
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,297
what you said to him
about the separation.

246
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,467
Well, what did he tell you?

247
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:25,438
That you took responsibility for it

248
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,340
and... that you stood up for me.

249
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:35,013
That means a lot, um... to the kids.

250
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,982
You're showing them we're not polarized,

251
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:38,283
we're not at war.

252
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:40,385
I think it helps stabilize them.

253
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,656
And it means a lot to me, too.

254
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,892
Good.

255
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,599
How ya doing?

256
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,335
Uh, very well. Quite well.

257
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,437
You sure?

258
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,705
Mm-hmm.

259
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:04,541
Busy, but, uh, otherwise,
I'm crackerjack.

260
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:10,848
And I'm about to bust open a
bottle of rosé to prove it.

261
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,983
Care to join me?

262
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:13,084
The Wolffer?

263
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,353
Yeah. Last bottle.

264
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:16,920
Sure.

265
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,927
And what makes you think you're
gonna get the kids to eat kale?

266
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,129
That would be the kale
chips I plan to serve.

267
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,598
They're practically Pringles.

268
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,966
- Sneaky!
- Mm.

269
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,635
I love it. I wonder
if<i> I</i> should try to make that.

270
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,438
That is for the entrée...

271
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,075
salmon with ginger and sage.

272
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:40,343
Who are you?

273
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,350
Look, I'm sure
that I can stretch the salmon

274
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,919
to serve four if you'd like to join us.

275
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:53,188
Eva would be thrilled to
have a smaller portion.

276
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:58,427
Okay.

277
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,171
Shit.

278
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,906
Excuse me.

279
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:12,107
Everything okay?

280
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,277
Ira?

281
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,845
Yeah.

282
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:17,846
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

283
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,114
<i>Yes, who's there?</i>

284
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,149
Alligator.

285
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,483
Alligator who?

286
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,119
Alligator the shark.
He has a beard growing.

287
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,420
What?!

288
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:29,057
That made absolutely no sense.

289
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,059
That was amazing.

290
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,896
May I please be excused?

291
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,264
- Me too.
- Yes.

292
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,700
Clear your plates, and then, yeah.

293
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,980
I'll be up to say good
night before I go.

294
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,417
Well, that was interesting.

295
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,218
Yeah.

296
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,389
I thought Kevin's nonchalance
was very impressive.

297
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,290
Mm.

298
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,658
Not Eva's, though.

299
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,759
Unh-unh.

300
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,827
No.

301
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,930
Her eyes were like saucers.

302
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:13,400
Parsing every word, every gesture.

303
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,568
I mean, they<i> both</i> were.

304
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,035
Uh-huh.

305
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:20,207
Two analytic little minds
searching for meaning.

306
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,142
I wonder where they got that from.

307
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:30,383
We're lucky.

308
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:33,052
I think they each got
the best of both of us.

309
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:36,155
Nothing can ever take that away.

310
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:58,577
I can finish up here.

311
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,347
- You sure?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

312
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,682
You go have a wonderful night.

313
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,316
I'm glad I stayed.

314
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,652
Thank you for asking me.

315
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:07,719
Yeah.

316
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:11,990
It was, uh... nice.

317
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,031
I have to take this.

318
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,598
Good night, Wendy.

319
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,967
Good night.

320
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,469
Ira? Yeah.

321
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,070
No, I can talk.

322
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:33,711
Hey.

323
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:34,546
Hi.

324
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,447
Come in.

325
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,382
- I appreciate this.
- Oh.

326
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,350
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

327
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,452
Oh, Taiga, this is Wendy. Wendy, Taiga.

328
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:43,854
- Hello.
- Hey.

329
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:44,989
I like your bag.

330
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,290
Oh. Thank you.

331
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,892
I'm gonna be in here, okay, babe?

332
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:48,926
Sure.

333
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:56,667
You'd like her.

334
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:59,503
She's an interesting girl,
very accomplished.

335
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,538
I'm sure it's quite a skill set.

336
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:11,280
I know it's a little strange,
my coming here.

337
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,316
These are strange times.

338
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,385
How worried should I be about Chuck?

339
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,254
Well, you, of all people, should know,

340
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:19,622
I can't really answer that.

341
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,091
I do understand.

342
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,627
And I know you're his lawyer,
but you're also his friend.

343
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:25,929
If Chuck's in crisis,

344
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:29,365
then hiding it because of some code,

345
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:30,899
that doesn't help anybody.

346
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,236
It has nothing to do with a code.

347
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:36,105
It's true he<i> is</i> in crisis.

348
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:38,608
He's getting crushed, actually.

349
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,909
I wish he'd tell me.

350
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,612
He doesn't want to risk
freighting the relationship.

351
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,781
He's afraid it'll
collapse under the stress.

352
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:48,183
He's showing superhuman restraint,
if you ask me.

353
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:49,752
I wish I'd had one-tenth of that

354
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:52,454
when Elizabeth and I were splitting up.

355
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:53,789
The irony is,

356
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,759
he's probably never needed you
as much as he does right now.

357
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,994
Jesus.

358
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,428
Ira, how bad is it?

359
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,597
Is it something he'll get through?

360
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,734
Honestly... I don't know.

361
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,769
I've seen him in the
line of fire before,

362
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,705
but this... this... this is a siege.

363
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:11,939
And I will say this,

364
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,643
the Axelrod civil suits are
a big fucking part of it.

365
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:16,811
What do you mean?

366
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,580
He said they couldn't hurt
him while he was in office.

367
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:21,382
He was padding it.

368
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,184
All right, look, you can't know this,

369
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,087
but it didn't go away when
we moved for dismissal.

370
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,189
He's gonna be deposed next week.

371
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,457
He could be on the hook
for a lot of damage...

372
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,260
to his reputation,

373
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:33,927
not to mention his bank account...

374
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,796
<i>Your</i> bank account.

375
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,198
Between the investigation
and these lawsuits

376
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,335
and you...

377
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,837
I can't figure out how
he's still standing.

378
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,286
Unusual choice.

379
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,387
Eva has a lesson.

380
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,991
Plus, neutral territory.
You've got all the tricks.

381
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,158
Nope. No tricks.

382
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,061
This will be as direct a conversation
as I know how to have.

383
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:12,665
Oh. So you came to throw bombs?

384
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,766
Good.

385
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:20,540
I'm reconsidering your offer.

386
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:23,508
You're late. I hired someone.

387
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,445
If he were getting it done,
you wouldn't be here.

388
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,852
So, what changed your mind? Seeing Wags?

389
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,687
My mind's not all the way changed.

390
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,489
But seeing him did have a hand in it.

391
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:40,291
It's gonna take some doing to
get rid of that ass tattoo.

392
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:41,360
I have terms...

393
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,495
A dozen laser sessions, at least.

394
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:46,097
...and one of them is,
I don't talk about my clients.

395
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,066
What happens in my office is sacrosanct.

396
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,902
I don't talk about my
sessions with you or anyone.

397
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:53,004
Not even your husband?

398
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:57,441
And I keep my files on
an air-gapped computer

399
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,843
that no one touches.

400
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,245
Reasonable.

401
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,013
Anything else?

402
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:05,183
20% increase in salary and
2% stake in the company.

403
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,885
Kaboom! There it is.

404
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,686
Look at the balls on you.

405
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:14,124
Yes on the comp, no on the stake.

406
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,894
No one owns any of it but me.

407
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:21,064
But a profit share and
payout equal to one percent

408
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,900
in the case of a sale.

409
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,106
You were dug in the last time I saw you.

410
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,407
Still pretty angry.

411
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,608
Yes, I was.

412
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,310
So, what changed?

413
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:36,413
When you came to my office,

414
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:39,749
I asked you to back off, and you did.

415
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,386
I drew a boundary, and you respected it.

416
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,455
So you're ready to trust me again?

417
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,757
It's a start.

418
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,125
Okay.

419
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,161
So, are we done?

420
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,888
There's one more thing I need.

421
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:58,968
Let's hear it.

422
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:04,240
You have to drop the civil
suits against my husband.

423
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:08,244
Wow. That is quite an ask, Mrs. Rhoades.

424
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:09,412
I admire your audacity,

425
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:11,880
but that is not something
I think I can accede to.

426
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:13,849
Then our relationship stays nonexistent.

427
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:16,252
It's not negotiable.

428
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:18,821
Your husband hurt my company.

429
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:20,088
He hurt<i> me.</i>

430
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:27,729
Okay.

431
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,866
I'll drop the suits.

432
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:34,369
Thank you.

433
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,672
I'll have my lawyers give
you an official letter

434
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,240
guaranteeing it,

435
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:41,576
with dates certain and
penalties attached.

436
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,247
Good.

437
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:48,749
Okay. I'll see you
in the office tomorrow.

438
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:55,356
Motherfucker.

439
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,826
That's why you filed those
suits in the first place,

440
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:01,295
so I'd cave and come
to you with this deal.

441
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:07,834
Well, not to restart our
partnership with a lie...

442
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,303
it's not the only reason.

443
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:12,906
But yes, that was a scenario
that I had gamed out.

444
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,979
Our deal hold?

445
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:23,417
Yes.

446
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:24,551
But not for you.

447
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,452
You want a session, see someone else.

448
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,555
My office is off-limits.

449
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,191
Fine.

450
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:42,968
Hey.

451
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,138
Have Chef Ryan give the
kids dinner tonight.

452
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,006
I'm taking you out.

453
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:49,008
Yeah.

454
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,911
And I'll see you at the pad.
We're taking the chopper.

455
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:00,185
You said you have something interesting?

456
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,554
Could be.

457
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:08,994
Axelrod's people were making
a lot of trips upstate,

458
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:12,731
always to the same town,
a place called Sandicot.

459
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,732
And?

460
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,801
And it's a pattern.

461
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:18,236
But what's in the town?

462
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,505
Nothing. It's a dirt spot.

463
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:22,874
I mean, why are they going?

464
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,776
You asked me to track their movements,

465
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,178
not to synthesize the meaning

466
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,580
of each contact they
have or place they visit.

467
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,228
From Chef.

468
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,632
This is a 1975 ChÃ¢teau d'Yquem.

469
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:51,135
Tell Chef thank you.

470
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,669
Absolutely.

471
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,175
We need to get past this stalemate.

472
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,213
I agree.

473
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:08,719
You have to believe that
I need you as a partner.

474
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,656
I need your counsel, your perspective.

475
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:16,426
I trust no one more than you.

476
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,462
And right now,

477
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:22,064
I need your take on something.

478
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,935
Okay.

479
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:30,773
So, uh, you know we had
a bit of a rough quarter.

480
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:34,144
Everyone was a little rocked by it.

481
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:37,046
You can feel that they're having trouble

482
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:38,614
buoying themselves.

483
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:41,183
And... so...

484
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:45,454
I was thinking of bringing...

485
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:47,489
bringing Wendy Rhoades back.

486
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,493
Are you fucking kidding me?

487
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,997
I thought this was
about you apologizing.

488
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,099
- Now this?
- I know. I know.

489
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:59,668
But the guys have made it clear,

490
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,404
through their results and their words,

491
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,173
that they need her.

492
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:07,008
I thought you had a new man.

493
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,177
Wags convinced me to try him out,

494
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,379
but Wags was pretty
fucked up at the time.

495
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:15,083
You're not<i> thinking</i> about
bringing Wendy back.

496
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,417
It's a done deal, isn't it?

497
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:20,488
You're actually lying to<i> me</i> now.

498
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:23,524
I'd like your blessing.

499
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,460
_

500
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,365
Take it.

501
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:35,035
Bobby, take the fucking call.

502
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:38,839
I'll be right back.

503
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:39,907
I love you.

504
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,948
Would you like to hear
about the desserts?

505
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,083
We'll take the check.

506
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,584
Of course.

507
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,089
Tell me.

508
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:57,791
Flagg has 200 acres of scrub.

509
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,659
If he's holding out for another offer,

510
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,528
he doesn't have a lot of leverage.

511
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,531
On the other hand,
he owns a small trucking company,

512
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,700
so he's not hurting for cash.

513
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,735
So he's someone we can reason with,

514
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:10,604
not some crackpot who's gonna lie down

515
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:12,038
in front of the bulldozers.

516
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,872
Correct.

517
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:15,041
<i>I need to wrap this guy up
right fucking now.</i>

518
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:16,542
Word spreads there's a holdout,

519
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:20,512
we'll have nine other property
owners going rogue on us.

520
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:30,990
Fuck me.

521
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,412
I didn't sleep at all.

522
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:59,350
This fighting... isn't us.

523
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,390
I'm going into the office early,

524
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:08,393
then I'm gonna head
upstate for a few hours.

525
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,995
When I get home tonight,
I want to talk this through.

526
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:13,765
I want to work it out.

527
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,032
Okay?

528
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:24,208
Hal.

529
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,776
Hey.

530
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:30,181
♪<i> We are poor little lambs
who have lost our way</i> ♪

531
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,383
♪<i> Baa, baa, baa!</i> ♪

532
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,987
Hey, I missed you at the Whiffs reunion.

533
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,555
I wish I'd had the time.

534
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,457
Ah.

535
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,991
Can you spare a minute?

536
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,360
Yeah.

537
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,503
I have been hearing rumblings
about a little town upstate,

538
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,172
and I wondered what you
could confirm for me.

539
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,441
You know my ear's always to the rail.

540
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,045
What do you know about Sandicot?

541
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,346
The gaming license?

542
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,149
That's what I heard.

543
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,418
If you're looking to buy,
you have to do it quickly.

544
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,722
They're announcing soon,
and there's sure to be a bounce.

545
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,724
You'll keep this between us?

546
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,891
What a question.

547
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,293
Good man.

548
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:20,229
<i>Black Jack Foley.</i>

549
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:24,066
There are those
who still call me that, yes.

550
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,630
How are you, Charles?

551
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:26,669
<i>I'll be better</i>

552
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,937
<i>if you help me out with
a little something.</i>

553
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,505
Is it within my purview?

554
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:32,640
What in this state isn't?

555
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,542
Not much.

556
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,079
Certainly not the proposed
location of a casino.

557
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,782
You must be talking about Sandicot.

558
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,184
<i>I am.</i>

559
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:45,987
And I'm asking,
does it have to go there?

560
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:49,824
Nothing has to go anywhere.

561
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,527
<i>I need you
to write her a contract.</i>

562
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:56,197
That'll be the only one at the firm.

563
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:59,066
It's necessary... protection all around.

564
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,535
She gets a big salary bump,
I lock her in.

565
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,271
There's no way her husband
can make a move on you now.

566
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:05,972
Especially since they're estranged,

567
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,941
the conflict of interest is irrefutable.

568
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,877
And reach out to Oliver Dake.

569
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:15,115
Tell him we won't be testifying
that the $5 million was a bribe.

570
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:17,650
Might be handy to keep
that in our back pocket,

571
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:18,851
just in case.

572
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:21,521
I'm not interested in
putting Wendy in jail.

573
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:24,791
Also, we're gonna drop the
suits against her husband.

574
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,392
So it is détente.

575
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,232
What do you think of the new lobby?

576
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,601
I think it's paranoid.

577
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,737
Much higher level of security.

578
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,606
Hired new compliance people, too.

579
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:43,608
What's next, a microchip implant?

580
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,510
You can just wear this.

581
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:50,049
Did your lawyer look through his papers?

582
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:51,883
He said it's fine. Do you have a pen?

583
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,687
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

584
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:01,092
Will you excuse us?

585
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:02,494
That's not necessary.

586
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,929
No, it'll only take a minute.

587
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,899
Orrin.

588
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,800
Call off the dogs.

589
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:12,803
We're gonna drop the lawsuits
against Mr. Chuck Rhoades...

590
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:14,205
all of them.

591
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:18,609
In stages, as we discussed,
so we don't create a news story.

592
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:29,186
Is the show over?

593
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:30,988
I'm earning back your trust.

594
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,594
Grand gestures aren't necessary.

595
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,228
When it comes to you, Bobby,

596
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,397
it's the small kindnesses I prefer.

597
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:53,943
We're doing this<i> now.</i>

598
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,578
Um, I'm due in a deposition...

599
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Then name the time. But today.

600
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,348
No more bogus excuses,

601
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,417
because I am done with this game.

602
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:02,719
Well, I'm gonna have to...

603
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:03,887
2:00 p.m.

604
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:06,623
If you don't show,
you can expect a suspension,

605
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,658
if not outright firing.

606
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,530
<i>I'm on my way out.</i>

607
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:15,964
Jury selection.

608
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,133
So...

609
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,635
Well, I'll make this quick.

610
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,340
I was just thinking about something
that Harry Houdini once said.

611
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,277
"An old trick well done is far better

612
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,413
than a new trick with no effect."

613
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,981
Houdini have any other advice...

614
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:36,685
like, how to get out of a
straitjacket underwater?

615
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,588
I'm gonna look for a way out in there.

616
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,423
And when this is over,

617
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:44,026
we need to have a talk
about my future here.

618
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,058
You know why I hired you?

619
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,507
I used to.

620
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:01,209
For your fury.

621
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:07,715
A lot of people around here...
Sacker, me...

622
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,018
we were born with a place at the table.

623
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,687
But you came to this job

624
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:15,422
knowing what it means to be an outsider,

625
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:18,626
and with the desperate fury of one.

626
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:21,095
But you are still
letting that fury use<i> you</i>

627
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:23,297
instead of you using<i> it.</i>

628
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,367
Right now, it's directed at me,

629
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:29,269
which doesn't serve you at all.

630
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:35,109
But refocused, channeled,
it'll become a weapon...

631
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,777
instead of a liability.

632
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,101
Come on.

633
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,011
My number's up.

634
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:15,413
I'm supposed to see Dake at two o'clock.

635
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:16,649
Sorry.

636
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:19,852
No.

637
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:22,688
You have been loyal.

638
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,025
You have gone above and
beyond trying to protect me.

639
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:28,726
You should cooperate.

640
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:30,828
Do what's right.

641
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,198
You owe it to your family.

642
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,700
What are you gonna do?

643
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,071
Wait.

644
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,463
Impressive collection.

645
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:10,801
Bobby Axelrod.

646
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:12,769
Hank Flagg.

647
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:14,538
You ride with a club?

648
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,540
To my mind, if you want to be an outlaw,

649
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,743
you don't join a club
with a fucking logo.

650
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,913
So, you run a hedge fund?

651
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:24,347
That's right.

652
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:26,282
We do have a logo.

653
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:28,251
So, what's your interest in my property?

654
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,254
I have a stake in the project
they want to use it for.

655
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:33,989
And I thought you might be
tired of talking to lawyers.

656
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:41,197
Jesus. Is that an Indian Four?

657
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,434
Yeah.

658
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:46,202
I'm restoring the foot clutch on it.

659
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:48,070
Yeah, suicide clutch.

660
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:49,404
That mid-1930s?

661
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,540
That's a good guess. It's '30.

662
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,277
Ah, four cylinders.

663
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,511
God, back in the day,

664
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,148
this machine was the epitome of power.

665
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,016
You had to be rich enough to afford it

666
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,018
and strong enough to handle it.

667
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,154
Let's go in the house.
We can talk there.

668
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,026
You got to know one-point-five
is a great price for this property.

669
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,528
One-point-five is bullshit now.

670
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,896
Well, what do you imagine...

671
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,566
It's got to be a casino.
That's how I have it figured.

672
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:18,900
Oh, come on.

673
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:22,070
You drive all the way up
here to tell me I'm wrong?

674
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:25,140
No. You came up here to
try to get me to deal.

675
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:28,243
Look, I respect you
wanting to hold firm.

676
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:30,812
I admire the fortitude.

677
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:33,047
But your problem is,

678
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,150
my friend's not going any higher.

679
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:37,218
He's just gonna bleed you out.

680
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,952
Or I'll bleed<i> him</i> out.

681
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:40,621
I'm in no rush.

682
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:44,625
Well, then, he's just gonna
bring in a government agency.

683
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,694
They won't give a shit.

684
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:50,598
They'll tell you the casino's
for the good of the community,

685
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,601
and then they'll throw
you off your own land.

686
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:56,236
Maybe they'll throw in a
couple of hundred thousand

687
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,504
for your trouble.

688
00:35:57,506 --> 00:36:00,307
It'll be fucking Ruby Ridge
up here before that happens.

689
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:05,879
My guy's handing you a golden ticket.

690
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,347
You should take it and run.

691
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:12,485
Okay.

692
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,304
I'll sweeten it a little.

693
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:17,857
I'll make it an even two mil.

694
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,492
Mm.

695
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,133
Let me give you a little context.

696
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:28,868
My girlfriend's in real estate.

697
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:33,940
One day, she notices a spike
in interest in Sandicot,

698
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,043
which is, you know, curious,
to say the fucking least.

699
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,245
Then, the same week,
a friend of mine notices

700
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,181
a couple guys eating
burgers at Murdock's...

701
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:45,183
haircuts wearing expensive sneakers.

702
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:49,154
So I go down to Town
Hall to see what's what,

703
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:51,623
and I find out that you
bought the town's debt

704
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,992
for pennies on the dollar.

705
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,561
It's all public information.

706
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:59,365
I know what you stand to make.

707
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,100
And I also know what you stand to lose

708
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:05,003
if the town defaults on the bonds.

709
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,339
You can't afford to wait.

710
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:10,575
You need that casino open
and ready for business

711
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:12,610
as soon as goddamned possible.

712
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:14,812
I wish my guys had your
fucking initiative.

713
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:19,884
I'll double the offer.

714
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,154
Seven.

715
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,225
Yeah, I think I'd be happy at seven.

716
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:32,697
Nobody leaves a negotiation happy.

717
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,331
Five.

718
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,201
And for that, you throw in
the fucking Indian Four.

719
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:10,233
And would you be able
to decide on the facts,

720
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,268
regardless of your personal beliefs?

721
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,103
Yes. Of course.

722
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:15,905
Thank you.

723
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:18,354
Potential juror number two...

724
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:19,098
Actually, Your Honor,

725
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,177
I have a couple of
supplemental questions.

726
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,345
Okay.

727
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:23,612
But let's keep it moving.

728
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:25,113
Understood.

729
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:33,989
Do you have any idea how
much wealth in this country

730
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,925
is controlled by the top 20 percent?

731
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,426
A shit ton.

732
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,195
Your Honor.

733
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,396
Sorry.

734
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:42,965
Almost all of it.

735
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,132
Huh.

736
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:46,601
I'd like to challenge
the juror for cause.

737
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:53,708
Do your personal beliefs
about who has all the wealth

738
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,978
affect your ability to apply the law?

739
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,645
Not at all.

740
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:00,247
I understand my duty as an American.

741
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:03,484
All Americans,
regardless of wealth, can be fair.

742
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:05,185
Challenge for cause denied.

743
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,120
We'll use a peremptory challenge.

744
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:10,156
Thank you, juror. You're excused.

745
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:14,728
You just lost your paradigm juror.

746
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,829
That's got to hurt.

747
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:39,385
<i>You said you worked underground,</i>

748
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:41,487
building the Second Avenue Subway.

749
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,155
You're a sandhog.

750
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:44,557
And proud of it.

751
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,993
So was my grandfather.

752
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,061
Lincoln Tunnel, back in '34.

753
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:53,065
He said he never earned a bonus.

754
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,666
Has that changed over the years?

755
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,569
No. No. Never gotten a bonus.

756
00:39:57,571 --> 00:40:00,839
Do you think you'd be
able to decide this case

757
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:02,307
in a fair and impartial manner

758
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:06,245
if you knew that the average
Spartan-Ives bonus last year

759
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:09,014
was over 366,000 dollars?

760
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:10,214
Holy shit.

761
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:12,417
Again, this is a hypothetical, but...

762
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:14,452
He's torqueing up this jury

763
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,154
like a fluffer on a porn set.

764
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,657
They're inflamed for the moment.
They'll calm down.

765
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,993
What if you knew Mr.
Boyd's personal bonus

766
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:24,062
was more than 50 times that?

767
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,300
That wouldn't affect your ability
to be impartial, would it?

768
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:32,403
I would be impartial.

769
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:35,139
Always trust a sandhog.

770
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:39,110
<i>You have a confusing résumé.</i>

771
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:41,579
What's with the, uh, fox-trot

772
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:44,181
from Southern District
to Eastern and back?

773
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,717
Nothing. It happens.

774
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,719
It never occurred to you that Rhoades

775
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:51,889
was moving you around
to serve his purposes

776
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:54,758
whenever he found himself
holding a Yarborough?

777
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,795
I don't play bridge.

778
00:40:57,797 --> 00:41:00,029
<i>You're excused, juror 32.</i>

779
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:01,998
How many challenges do they have left?

780
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,700
That's tap city.

781
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:09,239
If that's your view of bankers,

782
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:12,576
then you could probably
recognize when a-a witness

783
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:15,311
has a personal hatred for the defendant

784
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:18,648
and accord him the
impartiality he deserves?

785
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,816
Sure I could.

786
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:23,152
I assume everyone hates
this man from first sight.

787
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,722
It's not gonna color my opinion.

788
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:30,727
These jurors are gonna
do me like Louis XVI.

789
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,261
Let me work.

790
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:44,906
What I want you to do...
is start fucking dealing.

791
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:54,549
Bryan, can we talk?

792
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,657
You really don't need to do this.

793
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,559
Their best witness is Tom McKinnon.

794
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:07,762
We'll paint him as a
cuckold with an agenda.

795
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:09,764
There's a very good chance we can win.

796
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:12,133
Define "win."

797
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:14,802
Define "very good."

798
00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:18,973
Summer I was 18,

799
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:21,475
I worked in menswear at
Gimbels department store.

800
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,944
It doesn't exist anymore.

801
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:26,981
I wore a suit to work.

802
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:31,485
And I wore three suits home
underneath it on my last day...

803
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:33,520
sold them on the side
to pay for college.

804
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:38,725
The risk was worth the
reward back then because...

805
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:40,860
I had nothing to lose.

806
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,097
I'm not that kid anymore.

807
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:48,735
I'm facing ten years in federal prison.

808
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,973
That's a risk I cannot tolerate.

809
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:04,184
Larry.

810
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,652
Hear you had a rough one.

811
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:10,056
I'm at the table, Chuck.
Don't be a son of a bitch.

812
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,931
We're ready to settle.

813
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,934
Admission of guilt,
five years' probation,

814
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,237
and a 60 million dollar fine.

815
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,504
A very nice offer.

816
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:34,479
It's funny.

817
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:38,751
Something about a settlement
doesn't sit right with me.

818
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:43,655
Bid-rigging the U.S. Treasury market,

819
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:48,092
that, to me, is a crime
that...<i> so</i> profoundly

820
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:52,096
violates public trust
in our financial system

821
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:55,567
that it really seems only
right to continue the trial

822
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:57,835
and let the people decide.

823
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:01,739
No deal.

824
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:04,108
Are you fucking kidding me?

825
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:06,744
Is he kidding?

826
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:08,712
What a motherfucker!

827
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:17,187
That's what you're claiming?

828
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:22,426
You know I can have you
disbarred for lying.

829
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,500
The attorney general is on the phone.

830
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,012
General.

831
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,413
Chuck.

832
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,748
I hear you have confounded
Boyd and his team.

833
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,850
Congratulations.

834
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,485
This call means the world to me.

835
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,787
Thank you, ma'am.

836
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:51,987
<i>Yes.</i>

837
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,356
You have made it clear

838
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,958
that there will be no special treatment,
haven't you?

839
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,796
Thought that made sense, considering.

840
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:03,399
Now they're seeking settlement.

841
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:05,435
But I look forward to a trial...

842
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:07,837
A hard-hitting trial.

843
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,840
I would never meddle.
I need you to know that.

844
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,908
I would never ask you to accept a plea

845
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,443
unless you, too, felt that plea

846
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,212
was in the best interest of justice.

847
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,048
I appreciate that.

848
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,352
We are, as always,
interested in the same thing.

849
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:26,187
And I want you to know

850
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:29,725
that I would never
refuse to accept a plea

851
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,128
if, suddenly, I saw
that to do so would be more fair.

852
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,998
<i>And that the idea of you</i>

853
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,701
never meddling...

854
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:46,407
extended to me and the entire scope
of my affairs in the Southern District.

855
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:52,413
You have your open field.

856
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,048
Make the deal.

857
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:14,768
And so, now,
as the great Bruce Buffer says,

858
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,105
"It's time."

859
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:21,041
Do you believe
U.S. Attorney Rhoades

860
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:23,043
remained involved in the Axelrod case

861
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:26,179
even after he'd recused himself?

862
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:30,082
Yes.

863
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:33,520
Yes. Of course.

864
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:36,790
How did you know?

865
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:38,525
Specifics.

866
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,762
He came to me with information

867
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,898
that made it clear he
was still involved.

868
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:50,436
He made it clear that I was to try

869
00:46:50,438 --> 00:46:53,306
to get the same information...

870
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,342
...but to do so in a way that...

871
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,884
Yes, General.

872
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:07,586
Um...

873
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:09,387
But...

874
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:12,290
Uh, I-I understand. Yes. Yes, ma'am.

875
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:14,760
But I'm... But I'm just now
coming into possession

876
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:16,829
of material information,

877
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:19,797
a-and if I could
have just a few more...

878
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:20,898
No. No.

879
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,600
Um, of course.

880
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:24,902
As you wish.

881
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:33,578
You can go.

882
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:37,381
What?

883
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,186
We're done here.

884
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:10,614
Yeah?

885
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,348
It's over.

886
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,817
Boyd puked himself.

887
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,859
<i>He's taking a guilty plea.</i>

888
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:23,994
Fuck.

889
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:27,963
Surrendered like a
French fucking soldier.

890
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:29,598
Rhoades knew his man.

891
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:41,777
As, uh, as I'm sure you know,

892
00:48:41,779 --> 00:48:45,648
the attorney general has
suspended my investigation

893
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,816
and ordered me back to Washington.

894
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:50,419
Well, I hope you've enjoyed your stay.

895
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:53,355
Well...

896
00:48:55,026 --> 00:48:59,227
Do you know what I... what I like most

897
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:02,597
about my job, Mr. Rhoades?

898
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,132
The sartorial flair?

899
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:09,403
I took an oath.

900
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:13,407
The same oath sworn by you, in fact,

901
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,777
to the people of the United States.

902
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:19,646
And when I see that someone

903
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:22,821
is putting his own
interests above that oath,

904
00:49:22,856 --> 00:49:27,187
there is nothing I like
better than making sure

905
00:49:27,189 --> 00:49:30,857
they never get another job
in the legal profession

906
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:32,793
f-for the rest of their lives.

907
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,897
Know this.

908
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:42,368
I had you... in the cross hairs.

909
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,808
But today, you're the man who
brought down Lawrence Boyd.

910
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,644
You're... Elvis.

911
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:57,449
So... today...

912
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:00,119
you are safe.

913
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:04,189
But...

914
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:07,493
don't get fucking comfortable.

915
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:21,740
What happened upstate?

916
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:24,809
I bought Flagg's property for five,

917
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,344
which I've leased to Thayer

918
00:50:26,346 --> 00:50:29,447
for $750K a year on a ten-year lease.

919
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:31,850
Wyatt, we are rolling.

920
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:34,119
You pulled this
out of the fucking fire, boss.

921
00:50:34,121 --> 00:50:36,621
An actual, unmitigated win.

922
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:38,023
The yield on this bad boy

923
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:41,592
is gonna keep Mama in
new shoes for<i> years.</i>

924
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:43,794
Bring on the bulldozers.

925
00:50:53,973 --> 00:50:54,938
Yeah?

926
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:57,642
Congratulations.

927
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:01,278
Victory torn from the jaws.

928
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,948
Ah, sometimes, you play the goban.

929
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,884
Sometimes, you look across the board

930
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:09,486
and you see a total lack of<i> kiai.</i>

931
00:51:09,488 --> 00:51:11,889
I know none of those words.

932
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:15,792
But I feel like you're calling
Lawrence Boyd a butter boy.

933
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:18,595
A guilty man took a guilty plea.

934
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:21,964
<i>Closer than ever
to your goal, Bryan.</i>

935
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:23,300
Which one?

936
00:51:23,302 --> 00:51:27,003
That's what you should spend
the next few weeks figuring out.

937
00:51:33,078 --> 00:51:34,276
See you next week.

938
00:51:34,278 --> 00:51:35,344
Namaste.

939
00:51:36,848 --> 00:51:37,747
Hey.

940
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:39,281
Hey.

941
00:51:39,283 --> 00:51:40,382
I heard about Boyd.

942
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:42,518
I know, brutal.

943
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,887
But forget that. This is more important.

944
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:46,155
I-I'm sorry.

945
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,957
I should have told you about Wendy

946
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:51,093
before I even spoke to her.

947
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:53,696
You think this is about<i> her?</i>

948
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:58,033
Bobby, you act
like we're in this together.

949
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,802
You make command decisions,
sometimes life-changing,

950
00:52:00,804 --> 00:52:04,206
and you don't even run them by me first.

951
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,875
Do you remember the boat?
The Galápagos?

952
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:09,277
You make plans, you put them in motion,

953
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:12,047
and then you inform me after the fact.

954
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,315
That is not the marriage
that I signed up for,

955
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:18,353
and that is not one that I
will accept going forward.

956
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,056
I've risked alienating
my brothers and sisters.

957
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:24,792
I have walked away from things
that I care deeply about.

958
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:26,261
I know.

959
00:52:26,263 --> 00:52:28,329
And I do it because I understand

960
00:52:28,331 --> 00:52:30,431
that when something becomes a liability,

961
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:34,101
you cut it loose for the greater good.

962
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:37,004
And if you ask me,
Wendy Rhoades is a liability,

963
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:40,274
and I will<i> never</i> be okay
with the two of you talking.

964
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:42,609
Okay.

965
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:44,544
You're right.

966
00:52:44,546 --> 00:52:47,181
A-About everything.

967
00:52:51,854 --> 00:52:53,720
Look, what if I agree

968
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:58,692
that I, personally, won't see her?

969
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:01,461
I'll draw a line.

970
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,563
She and I will never have any sessions.

971
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:06,600
That way,
she'll never have anything on me.

972
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:10,704
Can you live with that?

973
00:53:16,511 --> 00:53:18,111
I can try.

974
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:58,783
There you go, gentlemen.

975
00:53:58,785 --> 00:53:59,885
- Congrats.
- All right.

976
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:00,918
- Well done.
- Hear, hear.

977
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,423
Top-drawer.

978
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:07,459
On my account, pal. Enjoy it.

979
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:09,427
Couldn't be happier for you.

980
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,798
To the vir triumphalis.

981
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,166
Hear, hear!

982
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,869
Son, there were times when
I thought you were finished.

983
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:20,504
You scared the hell out of me,
more than once.

984
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,473
But you prevailed.

985
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:29,280
And the only question now is...

986
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:32,083
which mansion will it be,
Gracie or the Governor's?

987
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,784
Relax, Dad.

988
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:35,252
I fought to keep my job.

989
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:38,088
I'm just gonna try to enjoy
it for the time being.

990
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,825
Don't waste this moment.

991
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:44,762
There's no telling how
fleeting it might be.

992
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:46,430
Uh, I have a piece of news.

993
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:49,433
Words you never want to hear
come out of your lawyer's mouth.

994
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:51,801
You're gonna want to hear this.
It is very good.

995
00:54:51,803 --> 00:54:54,570
On my way over here,
I got a call from Axelrod's lawyer.

996
00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:56,773
They are not gonna be
deposing you next week.

997
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:58,775
They're not gonna be
deposing you at all.

998
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:00,676
But their case can't proceed unless...

999
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:05,581
Their case isn't proceeding.

1000
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,917
They are dropping the lawsuits...

1001
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:10,085
quietly, over the next couple of months.

1002
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:13,155
What did I tell you? You have muscle.

1003
00:55:13,157 --> 00:55:15,491
You even scared Axelrod.

1004
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:19,128
When did this happen?

1005
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,930
I got the call on the way over.

1006
00:55:20,932 --> 00:55:23,399
Your father's right.
You must've scared him.

1007
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:24,699
What's the problem?

1008
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:27,602
Now you're truly unencumbered.

1009
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:31,040
Axelrod isn't scared
by displays of strength.

1010
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,207
You all right?

1011
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,642
I'm not sure.

1012
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:38,113
Uh...

1013
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,948
Thank you for this tribute.

1014
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,282
It means a great deal,

1015
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,652
celebrating this victory with you both.

1016
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:45,253
I have to go.

1017
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:47,322
Enjoy the scotch.

1018
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:02,503
Hall!

1019
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:05,306
Sandicot's not getting
the gaming license.

1020
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,645
<i>The commission went another way,</i>

1021
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:13,848
<i>gave it to a town in the Catskills.</i>

1022
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:17,184
I'm looking into what happened,
but it's over.

1023
00:56:22,692 --> 00:56:24,257
Are you there?

1024
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,002
I'm so happy for you.

1025
00:57:13,674 --> 00:57:14,907
Is something wrong?

1026
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:18,344
What did you do to get Axelrod
to drop the civil suits?

1027
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,580
This is a conversation,

1028
00:57:21,582 --> 00:57:23,749
and I don't think we
should have it tonight.

1029
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,752
Let's not do anything to spoil
the tremendous day you've had.

1030
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:28,186
Yeah, it's too late for that.

1031
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:33,058
I went back to work at Axe Capital.

1032
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,927
And, um, are you gonna try to insist

1033
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:37,128
that you did it for me?

1034
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,930
No.

1035
00:57:38,932 --> 00:57:40,198
I wanted to go back.

1036
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,367
Chuck.

1037
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:45,836
It's my work.

1038
00:57:47,307 --> 00:57:51,142
And when I didn't have it anymore, it...

1039
00:57:51,144 --> 00:57:53,844
it left a hole I tried
very hard to fill, but couldn't.

1040
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,279
So yes, I went back for me,

1041
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:57,982
but in doing it,
I found a way to help you, too.

1042
00:57:57,984 --> 00:58:01,586
Well, I'm happy that it works for you.

1043
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:05,255
But for us,
I am afraid it's a deal breaker.

1044
00:59:18,437 --> 00:59:20,549

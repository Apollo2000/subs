"Billions"...

2
00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:09,744
The only enemy
more dangerous

3
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,577
than a man with
unlimited resources...

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,389
is one
with nothing to lose.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,715
And that is what
you are looking at

6
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,492
right here.

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,335
This is for you...

8
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:25,075
Look at them.
With that morning-after glow.

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,634
This is what your wife
is out doing.

10
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,049
You see things differently.

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,390
That's an edge.
Congratulations.

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,218
All the analysts
now answer to you.

13
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:36,165
We've long suspected criminal
activity at Axe Capital.

14
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:38,764
- Do you know how to do this?
- Some parts of the job

15
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:40,260
are pretty intuitive.

16
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,140
Is there any law enforcement
here?

17
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:43,301
No.

18
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:46,176
You let me know
if any show up.

19
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,957
- You should name a C.I.O.
- I'll do it.

20
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:51,689
But I'm not running with you.
And neither are the kids.

21
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,335
So, you do what you got to do,
but we're staying.

22
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,113
Black Jack Foley.

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,933
- How are you, Charles?
- I'll be better

24
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,697
if you help me out
with a little something.

25
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,888
Jack.

26
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,911
Will you make me governor?

27
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,042
The Ice Juice IPO never tracks
back to my family,

28
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,860
to my father's investment.

29
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,043
Get out of the stock, Chuck.
They're gonna crush you.

30
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,628
Wow, I'm glad to see
you view me as so defenseless.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,409
The Ice Juice short,
how do I get a piece of that?

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,604
Ice Juice
never made anyone sick.

33
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:21,721
You baited him?

34
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,452
You used my company,
my career, my future...

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,947
Where do you get
the fucking nerve?!

36
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,674
I am done with you.

37
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,605
You've been named
interim U.S. Attorney

38
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,176
for the Eastern District.

39
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,165
You didn't think this shit
happened by accident,

40
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:36,943
- did you, Mr. Dake?
- I've arranged that

41
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,823
you'll lead
the prosecution at Eastern.

42
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,501
Tell Sacker I'm gonna make
her Chief of Crim.

43
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,582
I'm gonna find it.

44
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:46,270
Whatever thread
you left behind.

45
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,709
And I am gonna pull on it

46
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:50,364
until your whole fucking world
unravels.

47
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:52,369
I might go down behind
all of this,

48
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:55,930
but you are gonna be
right there next to me.

49
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,646
Worth it.

♪♪

53
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:59,896
I'm from horse country,
Chuck, West Texas.

54
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:03,209
My family bred 'em,
American quarterhorses.

55
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,429
Those babies
fetch quite the price,

56
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,452
so we were real gentle
with the product.

57
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,073
We used teasers.

58
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:11,166
Those are stallions
you put into the stall

59
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:13,935
with the sole purpose of
making sure the mare's in heat,

60
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,257
primed for breeding.

61
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,455
Now, a teaser, he doesn't get
to do any fucking.

62
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,645
He's just there
to get the mare ready.

63
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:21,260
Take her kicks.

64
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:23,793
Try to mount,
take some more kicks.

65
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,637
By God, that teaser,

66
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,781
he's got a rager going on
the whole dang time.

67
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,719
But that doesn't matter.

68
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,116
As soon as that dam
is ready,

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,463
we yank that teaser out of there,
lead the real stud in,

70
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,503
and he gets to do
all the fucking.

71
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:41,795
Teaser has to make do with some
mangy hay and a bucket of oats.

72
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:45,884
- Brutal.
- Yeah, nature often is.

73
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,897
Right now, you're
that teaser, aren't you,

74
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,107
with Dake
prosecuting Axelrod?

75
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,371
He's getting all the credit

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,745
for... putting the cuffs on him
and freezing his assets.

77
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,155
Dake is fucking Axelrod
right now in front of everybody,

78
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,087
and you,
you're back in the barn,

79
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:05,224
nursing your rager
with a bucket of oats.

80
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,527
Well, as long
as justice is served,

81
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,776
credit doesn't matter
at all, General.

82
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,438
Good.

83
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:16,245
Why don't you tell me
how it really makes you feel

84
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,212
to see Dake with the lariat
in his grip?

85
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,469
You'd like to tear that case
from him with your bare hands

86
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,077
and leave him crying
in the gutter.

87
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:28,851
Hmm?

88
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,443
You got some wolf in you,

89
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,873
which is why
you're not getting fired.

90
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,589
Not quite yet, anyway.

91
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,997
No, sir, you are among
the blessed few.

92
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,000
It's end times
for most of your brethren,

93
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,199
but you have not been
raptured yet.

94
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,818
I've only kept on
seven U.S. attorneys

95
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,825
since the president
was good enough to appoint me

96
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,912
Attorney General
of these United States.

97
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,014
I just wanted to make sure
our agendas are aligned

98
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,484
when it comes to
that justice you spoke of

99
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:56,803
moments ago.

100
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:59,989
These high-profile cases you
and your people have working?

101
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:03,094
Heap of Wall Street-related
matters.

102
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:04,968
Well, the markets
are within my purview.

103
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,194
Well, that may be,

104
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,735
but I come
from baseball country.

105
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:10,114
We learn at an early age

106
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,911
that a tie
goes to the runner.

107
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:14,883
And that is how I want you to
think of our business community

108
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:16,783
and its leaders
from now on.

109
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:18,539
Now, look,
if there's a clear crime,

110
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,015
then, by all means,
you go after it.

111
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:23,982
But if it's a bang-bang play,
don't call a man out on a win.

112
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,476
Just let that rally continue.

113
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:30,646
I thought you come
from horse country.

114
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,953
West Texas
contains multitudes, Chuck.

115
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:37,314
Ahh.

116
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:39,949
Prioritize the cases
that make sense.

117
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,554
You know what to do
with the rest.

118
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,512
They're marked
so there's no confusion.

119
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,486
Come on, let's schottische on
into this ballroom.

120
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:51,923
Come on.

121
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,465
First order of business.

122
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,092
There's going to be an idea
dinner night after tomorrow.

123
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,231
- Platinum invite list...
- Fuck. Fuck that.

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,057
Fuck having this meeting
without Axe here.

125
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,126
Fuck all of this.

126
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,577
- Easy, "Dollar" Bill.
- Nothing about this is easy.

127
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,486
I've been humping my ass
into the city,

128
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,591
hour and a half in traffic, into
this swanky Manhattan office,

129
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,909
and you haven't called
a single meeting

130
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,943
because the government's
frozen all the assets.

131
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,332
So when you called
this meeting,

132
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,125
I assumed that meant
it was go-time

133
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,372
and they've finally been
unfrozen.

134
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,857
Not yet. Still frozen like
Otzi in the goddamn Alps.

135
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:44,971
That's the Frozen Man, right?

136
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,313
I need those funds to flow

137
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,440
like the Kancamangus Rapids.

138
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,830
I'm ready to rock and roll
on full auto

139
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,597
right the fuck now.

140
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,361
Where the hell is Axe?

141
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,407
I'm over here!

142
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:29,946
Cool bachelor pad... bro.

143
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:33,837
I wasn't gonna stay
in Westport.

144
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:35,996
Guys like you
head to the city

145
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,476
when their marriages
fall apart

146
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:40,111
for the same reason
birds fly south

147
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,856
instead of freezing
their asses off.

148
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:44,043
It's in the genetic code.

149
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,552
You're the first person
to see the place.

150
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,493
Other than the kids.

151
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,160
What do they think?

152
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,878
It's stocked with video games
and snacks.

153
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,410
They seem fine.

154
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,882
How about you?

155
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,363
Did you just change
out of the pajamas

156
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,693
three minutes ago?

157
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,193
Are you planning to come
to the office anytime soon?

158
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,044
Yeah, once my assets
are unfrozen.

159
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,268
Should everyone else
go home, too?

160
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,552
Not if they want to stay
on the payroll.

161
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:15,368
That's inspiring stuff.

162
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,532
Must be what Kennedy said
to his staff

163
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,286
during the Cuban
missile crisis.

164
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,749
Kennedy wasn't under
as much pressure as I am.

165
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,793
I tell you, Bobby,
it's times like these I...

166
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,678
I wish you hadn't fired
Dr. Gus.

167
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,069
Why?

168
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,198
Because this...

169
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,463
is a fuckin' disaster.

170
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,221
I get it!
I get it.

171
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:43,591
You're worried that every day
you're on the sidelines

172
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,001
makes it harder for you to make
your numbers for the year.

173
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,103
Not harder.
Impossible.

174
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,378
- Right?
- Well, know this.

175
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,010
You won't fall
below the hard deck.

176
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,026
No one is crashing and burning.

177
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,522
If you come through for me now,
you will all make a bonus

178
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,056
of at least what you made
last year.

179
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:08,599
But first, you need to deliver
on today's mission.

180
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,213
The idea dinner.

181
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:13,926
Top-ten hedge-fund managers
in the city will be there.

182
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,087
These rat fucks

183
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,555
are how these billionaires
measure themselves.

184
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,359
Even being in the room
confers upon you

185
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,004
almost mythical status,

186
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,694
like you're a knight
of the Round Table.

187
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:25,040
- They ride in on horses?
- Maybachs.

188
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,755
I've heard Axe say he'd never go
to one of these hog shows.

189
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,220
Yeah, that he couldn't
understand why anybody

190
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,670
would want to sit with his
rivals and give away good plays.

191
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,540
The whys
and goddamned wherefores

192
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,795
are not for you to concern
your pretty little heads with.

193
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:38,019
I think it's great
that we're invited, considering.

194
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,710
We're kind of the most toxic
shop on the street right now.

195
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,712
They begged him to come,
sent emissaries, gifts,

196
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:46,414
all to ensure he'd be there
to share his insights.

197
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,169
I'm so radioactive right now,

198
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,291
I had to beg an invite
to this idea dinner.

199
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,499
I need to understand
why you'd do that.

200
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,175
Why do you think it matters?

201
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,657
Look at where I am.

202
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,759
Indicted,
thanks to your husband.

203
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:01,282
Thanks to you giving in
to the worst of your instincts.

204
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,387
Well, yeah, maybe that, too.

205
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,355
But... the point is
I'm about to stand trial.

206
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,105
If I win,
I want a company to return to.

207
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,314
The government,
by freezing my funds,

208
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,904
is trying to tell the story
that we're crooked.

209
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:15,152
They know we're not.

210
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:18,918
They know they spent years
trying and failing to prove it,

211
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,604
but the story
is being written

212
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:21,946
every day now.

213
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,916
So events
like this idea dinner,

214
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,283
they also tell a story.

215
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,332
So if I'm there,
I'm telling the story

216
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,016
that I'm not cowering,
I'm not hiding,

217
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,164
I'm not defeated.

218
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,900
But I can't just show up.
I have to dominate it.

219
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:34,770
The only thing is,

220
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,183
for the first time
in my life,

221
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,472
I don't think I can.

222
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:44,463
Fear?

223
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,487
Rage.

224
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,204
We need to arm him with an idea
that will shock and awe

225
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,023
so the dinner ends
with Axe's idea

226
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,945
e-mailed and texted
from firm to firm,

227
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,361
leaving no doubt
we are still the sharpest.

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,034
So go generate some speedballs
he can dazzle with

229
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,240
or go the fuck home
for good.

230
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,893
You're not authorized
to guarantee bonuses.

231
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:15,039
Your ego just wrote a check
your body can't cash.

232
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,180
I appreciate you waiting
until after the meeting

233
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,505
to hit me with that one.

234
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:20,319
I know holding back
doesn't come naturally.

235
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,088
Well, I was so shocked
you could quote "Top Gun,"

236
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,462
it took me a second
to respond.

237
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:25,933
I figure speaking their language
is part of the job now.

238
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,659
But... none of this
is going to matter

239
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:30,095
unless Axe gets us
back in the game.

240
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,835
I have our best man
working on it right now.

241
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:34,912
I want to run
a Dickens process.

242
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,444
Tony Robbins took me through it
a few years back, so...

243
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,565
Sit down.

244
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,339
I take you to specific
moments in your life,

245
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:47,713
use them to jump
into the future.

246
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,897
You get to experience
different possible versions

247
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,191
of your life, like in...

248
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,667
Like "A Christmas Carol,"
hence, Dickens.

249
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,933
Let's find a moment
early on

250
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:59,343
when your rage served you.

251
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,312
Close your eyes.

252
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,922
Let it come to you.

253
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,254
Fifth grade.

254
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,511
I needed money.

255
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,824
There were these rich
eighth-grade pricks

256
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:20,451
from Harrison.
God, I hated their stupid faces.

257
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,552
I had an Islander jersey
and a Koho hockey stick.

258
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,176
I signed 'em Mike Bossy
and Bryan Trottier,

259
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,809
and the dickbags bought 'em.

260
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:28,916
What'd you get?

261
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,979
$300 cash,
new sneakers, Atari.

262
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,527
When they found out,
they went to town on me

263
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,387
like
Dave "The Hammer" Schultz.

264
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:39,853
God, I got so angry
at them,

265
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,866
my parents
for not having enough money,

266
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,343
myself for getting caught.

267
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:48,036
That rage...

268
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,140
grew in me.

269
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:53,886
It worked like jet fuel
for years.

270
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,192
It was useful.

271
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,506
Yeah. Fuck, yeah, it was.
Got me here.

272
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,622
Your brain, instincts,
market feel, all that,

273
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,266
had more to do with it.
But for the moment, let's agree

274
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:05,015
that the rage worked
for a time.

275
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,807
But let's look for a moment
when it was the wrong tool

276
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,393
and it cost you
more than it made you.

277
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,194
We're gonna talk
about your husband now?

278
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:14,013
No, about you

279
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,294
and how when you allow
your anger

280
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,176
to make you blind
to consequences,

281
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:22,505
it shuts off those other
more crucial skills.

282
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:26,991
Let's take a moment

283
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,933
from your personal life

284
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:31,127
with Lara.

285
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:35,496
She'd say I allowed my anger
to throw everything away,

286
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,738
to crack the foundation
of trust.

287
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,033
So what if you could go
back into your past?

288
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:43,845
How would you handle
that memorabilia sale?

289
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:45,780
My past?

290
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,095
Nah, I wouldn't change it.

291
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,196
Good. We can't.

292
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,263
But holding on
to the feeling

293
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:55,763
of that rage,
look to the future.

294
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,353
Where do you see yourself
in five years

295
00:14:58,456 --> 00:14:59,939
if you carry on this way,

296
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:04,019
if you continue to carry
the weight of this anger?

297
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,560
Where are you in 10?

298
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,896
20?

299
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,303
Are you happy?

300
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:13,624
Are you fulfilled?

301
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,603
Or are you lonely, bitter?

302
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,765
Lashing out.

303
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,769
Fuck Dickens!

304
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:27,186
All I see is jail

305
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,668
and the company I spent
my lifetime building up

306
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:30,792
reduced to rubble.

307
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,436
Look, I want to do this
with you.

308
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,039
I want to believe
that it can help.

309
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,760
But I just don't think
I can.

310
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,275
Okay.

311
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:45,501
But now you know exactly
where your focus needs to be,

312
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:47,416
where you need to be.

313
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,139
At the office.

314
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,704
And when you get back home
from this conclave,

315
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:53,649
make sure you get
with your people.

316
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:56,543
Make sure we are all
on the same bill of lading.

317
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,475
There's a new sheriff in town.

318
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,050
You are all my deputies.

319
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,703
Gonna be one hell
of a turkey shoot!

320
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,382
Thank you!

321
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,387
God bless you.

322
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,428
Are we still employed?

323
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,549
We seem to be.

324
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,806
Mm. And the shift in agenda
he was talking about,

325
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,152
- that hits us?
- Mm-hmm,

326
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,785
but we press on,
as always.

327
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,495
I'll handle the optics,
and we'll manage up the chain.

328
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,315
Just so you know,
I'm as nimble as I need to be.

329
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,007
I count on that.

330
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,999
This is the fissile material.

331
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,788
You'll know what to do.

332
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,293
Well, well, well.

333
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:35,713
Bryan Connerty
and his new lord.

334
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,820
May your reign be long
and fruitful.

335
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,028
I serve at the pleasure...

336
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,443
Don't we all?

337
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,065
Freezing the assets?

338
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:47,165
Now, that's an Ivan Koloff bear
hug you're putting on the man.

339
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,982
You're squeezing the breath
out of him.

340
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,412
- I was more Iron Sheik era.
- All right, fine.

341
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,616
It's a camel clutch,
and a hell of a good one.

342
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,856
You seem pretty comfy
at his elbow.

343
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:57,697
That's the job.

344
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,302
Until it ain't.

345
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,252
Man, ain't that the truth?

346
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:04,101
But you can't let this monster
have a chance to recover.

347
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,025
Yes. I'll use my leverage
and strength

348
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,740
and get something valuable
in return.

349
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,331
I know my job, Chuck.

350
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:13,192
And I also know the real reason
you need this to go quickly.

351
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:15,558
Oh. I want somebody
to imagine or notice it.

352
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,379
You are like a man who committed
a crime of passion.

353
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,660
In the moment,
it felt so right.

354
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,100
But in the morning,

355
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,101
all he sees is the blood
splashed on the walls

356
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,711
of his dead lover's bedroom,

357
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,035
and he just wants it
all to go away,

358
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:31,676
but it can't.

359
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:35,062
I'm going to prosecute the case
to the full extent of the law

360
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,094
without breaking the terms
of our agreement.

361
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:39,361
So if you don't clean up
all the blood

362
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,439
before the cops get there,
I cannot guarantee your DNA

363
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,282
- stays out of the courtroom.
- This is a conversation

364
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,590
we need to finish somewhere else...

365
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,822
private.

366
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,019
Hey.

367
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,088
Hey.

368
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,332
You ready?

369
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:11,499
Yeah.

370
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:12,788
Let's do this.

371
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,807
<i>And newly appointed
U.S. Treasury Secretary</i>

372
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,751
<i>Todd Krakow was sworn in today.</i>

373
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,968
Look at that preening fuck.

374
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:25,290
You know, his name on money may
actually make me like him less.

375
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,253
Hello, Bobby.

376
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,439
Birch!

377
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,134
- Axe.
- Wendy.

378
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,668
Lara.

379
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,171
I'm here
to go over my assets.

380
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,147
You were supposed to bring
a business manager

381
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:41,833
or accountant,
not a competitor.

382
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:44,151
I only compete with currently
active hedge funds.

383
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,009
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I want a clean fight.

384
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,665
Protect yourselves at all times.
There'll be no standing eight count.

385
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,564
Give Lara full access
to the books.

386
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,186
She has a right to see
the state of things.

387
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:55,937
As you wish, my liege.

388
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:04,645
Run her through
where the bodies are buried.

389
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:09,845
This column,

390
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,238
this one,
this one, and this one

391
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,840
are the main holdings.

392
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,921
There you have it.

393
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:18,421
I see the balance
on the accounts.

394
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,245
And what a soaring,
fat balance it is.

395
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,691
We need to see
the trade history

396
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,965
leading up to the redemptions
and cash positions.

397
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,500
Sure. Let me bring up
a different screen.

398
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,929
Like Squanto should have said
to the pilgrims,

399
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,399
- "Get the fuck out of here."
- Wags, come on.

400
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,821
It's proprietary.
You're not seeing it.

401
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,385
- This is bullshit, Wags.
- Lara, we're not having a fight.

402
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:35,952
I'm telling you, you're not
gonna see that shit.

403
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,524
As is often the case,

404
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,345
the longer you can hold off,
the more likely

405
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,377
you'll be screaming in pleasure
at the end.

406
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,401
We're not making a porno,
Orrin,

407
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,703
though I appreciate the effort
to make me laugh.

408
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:48,837
My father always said laughter
was the best medicine,

409
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,029
which is why I was so confused

410
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:54,287
when I finally tried cocaine
in the '80s.

411
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,465
Okay.
You lightened my mood.

412
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,194
Now make me really happy
and tell me how we expose

413
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,534
all the shit
that Rhoades pulled

414
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:02,867
to suck me in.

415
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,930
Easier said, Bobby,
because we can't introduce that

416
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,638
without confirming
your actions as a response.

417
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,839
We'd be virtually admitting
your role.

418
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,831
What he did,
it's a fucking crime.

419
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,771
Maybe.
But it's not a defense.

420
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,162
All right, get to the rest.

421
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,475
Let's get our new head
of compliance up here.

422
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,529
The answer man is here.

423
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,213
The charges carry
a long potential sentence.

424
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,863
15 to 20 years

425
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:56,505
and tens of millions
in fines, of course.

426
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:59,076
They're using the locked-up
money to distract us

427
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,677
as they meticulously build
their case.

428
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:04,243
They are using the locked money
to do three things.

429
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:06,046
One, to make me take a plea.

430
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,510
Two, to make it hard
for my people so they'll quit.

431
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:11,403
And, three, to spread the word
through implication

432
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:13,745
that this is about more than
my actions against Ice Juice,

433
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,564
that we are
an illegal enterprise.

434
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,013
Turn on the telestrator,

435
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:19,861
because you just diagramed
the shit out of this.

436
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,006
How long can they really
keep it frozen?

437
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,621
Wrong question.

438
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,822
This is where
the holding out comes in.

439
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,182
Don't let anyone know
you care.

440
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:32,130
Mm, we'll find a way
to get you liquid again

441
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,789
in four to six months.

442
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,547
Months? Fuck that.

443
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,320
There is one idea that might
get it done right away,

444
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:41,301
but... it's one
you're going to hate.

445
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,104
Give up your so-called
license to trade.

446
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,546
Walk away from the table.
Cash in your chips.

447
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,133
They'd be forced to release
the bulk of your money.

448
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:52,985
That is the only angle
that I see.

449
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,401
And if it's the only angle
that I see,

450
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,212
it's the only angle there is.

451
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,153
You agree to stop trading,
you personally,

452
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:02,845
and they give you back
your money.

453
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:05,376
We would set something up
where Axe Cap trades it

454
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:06,599
without your direction.

455
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,129
It would function
like a blind trust,

456
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:10,771
but the language
would be such

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,167
and they'd be releasing
so much money back to you

458
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:14,487
that if you violated it...

459
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,037
Oh, that is a bozo no-no.

460
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:20,660
Do that and you would earn
yourself a lifetime ban...

461
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,300
and more.

462
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,929
No.

463
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:27,694
No fuckin' way.

464
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,862
I'll never do that.

465
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,180
If I give up my ability
to trade, I'm agreeing

466
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,062
that they're right and I built
all this by cheating.

467
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,600
I might as well give up
my license to breathe.

468
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:39,776
You guys have to

469
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:42,159
- work it out yourselves.
- Do not put me in the middle of it.

470
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,772
What the fuck is...

471
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,635
What's the problem?

472
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:49,717
Your lap dog
is not cooperating.

473
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,736
Wags, although Lara
should have faith,

474
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:54,409
because I've shown I'm pretty
good at making a dollar,

475
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,526
she has a right to choose
and make her own decisions,

476
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:57,612
like I told you.

477
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:58,660
I thought you were telling me
with a wink.

478
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,221
That's why I played back
with the "liege" stuff.

479
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:02,674
- Did I wink at you, ever?
- Not an actual wink, but...

480
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:05,095
Are you planning on giving him
your money to manage?

481
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:07,161
If it ever gets unfrozen,
I might.

482
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,906
- Why?
- For general health, financial,

483
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:11,396
and for things between us.

484
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,121
Now that I'm able
to take outside money,

485
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,042
I thought I'd start
with friends and family.

486
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,487
We're neither.

487
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:19,705
Listen, Lara,
I won't micromanage you.

488
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,271
But if you really plan

489
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,883
on giving billions of dollars
to this stock jockey,

490
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:25,081
ask him this,

491
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,373
how he's codified the behavioral
heuristics at his firm

492
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,980
from stock selection
to position sizing

493
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:33,581
to market timing
to risk management.

494
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,763
He hasn't,

495
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,123
because his
decision-flow process

496
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:39,781
is Google, Exxon,
Proctor & Gamble,

497
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,515
same as any old lady
in Kansas City,

498
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,969
except she won't charge you
two and twenty for it.

499
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:45,854
We are all in
the same game, Axe,

500
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,311
protecting assets
and trying to find that edge.

501
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,225
You have about as much edge
as Mister Rogers.

502
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:51,796
Okay, guys!

503
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,523
Okay, you go on ahead,
sweetheart.

504
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,426
You look into everything
you want with Birch,

505
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,766
and I will support
whatever you decide.

506
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:03,986
Thank you, Bobby.

507
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:06,130
You really want me

508
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,835
to let 'em into the books
and see the trades?

509
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:09,665
Lots of guys watch
Bruce Lee movies.

510
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,814
Doesn't mean
you can do karate.

511
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,363
Boot up the screen.

512
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,973
I still can't believe
he made that move.

513
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,800
It was the smart thing
to do.

514
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:27,248
If I'd known what you were
doing, I would have never...

515
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:28,392
Yes. No.

516
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,586
I mean, if you'd known,
if you'd told me,

517
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:31,729
if I'd known...

518
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,135
It was a moment of peak.
I'm gonna stop and tell you?

519
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:35,303
Wish you had.

520
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,940
You were very convincing.

521
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:39,928
But, in a way, it all had to
play itself out, didn't it?

522
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:41,838
If I had known
what you were gonna do...

523
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:43,763
- You'd have tried to stop me.
- Yes, I would have,

524
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:45,510
and I... might have succeeded.

525
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:47,583
Well, that would have been
better in one way...

526
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,900
but worse
in all the others...

527
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:54,836
because now we are home,
and we are a "we" again.

528
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,570
And if I hadn't have done
a thing,

529
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,994
who knows
how I'd have felt,

530
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,551
what resentments
might have festered?

531
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,108
But you did and I did,

532
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:03,020
and there is nothing
festering.

533
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:07,059
Except for the thing
I'm off to deal with now.

534
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,719
Yeah.

535
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,648
Except that.

536
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:15,420
Thank you.

537
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,503
Your wife,
she still down in D.C.?

538
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:22,178
Yes, outside.

539
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,466
You must miss her.

540
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:26,000
We talk every day,
and the train ride is only...

541
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,539
Sure it is.
But the problem is

542
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,693
that the free flow
of information,

543
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,125
the casual details of the day,
can get lost.

544
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,320
You know,
for a time, even though

545
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:39,360
we did reside in the same house,
my wife and I lived that way.

546
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,911
You're telling me that you
and your wife have no secrets?

547
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,875
Oh, ho, ho, ho! I'm certain
some are still lurking.

548
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:47,630
We all mask certain emotions,

549
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:50,004
often our most intense ones,

550
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,738
like Bjorn Borg did.

551
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:52,994
But like Borg,

552
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:55,450
eventually, it'll end up
costing you everything,

553
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,912
so we're digging in, right?

554
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:00,297
- Digging in.
- Ah.

555
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,671
She told you
about her short on Ice Juice.

556
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:04,338
That's the kind of bond
we have.

557
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:05,683
So you are here to tell me

558
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,430
she will turn
state's evidence

559
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,933
to avoid being the subject
of prosecution?

560
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,151
She is a co-conspirator

561
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,905
- in Axe's scheme.
- No, sir.

562
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:17,435
She's safe due to the terms
of the deal you and I struck.

563
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,093
That was about your father.

564
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:22,525
I said me and my family.

565
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:24,588
And you assented.

566
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:28,463
And now you will say
this is unduly burdensome,

567
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,254
which will force me to say
that it is less so

568
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,699
than remaining a glorified
Internal Affairs grunt

569
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:35,358
working out a dank office

570
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,875
on the fringes
of our capital city.

571
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:39,656
And, as you saw,

572
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,294
Jock Jeffcoat is taking
my counsel these days

573
00:26:42,363 --> 00:26:44,921
on who should be in
and who should be out.

574
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:46,884
There's only
so much compromise

575
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:48,974
of my own system of morality

576
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:50,809
that I can swallow.

577
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,750
I happen to know
you're a Calvinist.

578
00:26:55,466 --> 00:27:00,041
You believe we're all fallen
beyond any hope for redemption.

579
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,891
So answer me this.

580
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:05,867
What's one more demerit
for a friend allied with you

581
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:07,962
against a common foe?

582
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,086
Ecumenically,
that's not exactly right,

583
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:11,887
and it's borderline
offensive.

584
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,976
But, also, it's...

585
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,019
pretty much true.

586
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:20,421
Okay. I'll do all I can

587
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,304
to keep your wife
out of it,

588
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,268
but now you owe me.

589
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:26,888
Name it.

590
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,866
I'll hold it in reserve.

591
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,473
A favor to be named later.

592
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:34,976
Look at you, huh?

593
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,335
Muckin' in.

594
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,180
Done.

595
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,324
This is all on background,
no attribution.

596
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,542
<i>Yep, until
you want to go on record.</i>

597
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,077
Good. You know,

598
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,162
if they were gonna charge the firm,
they would have.

599
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,838
Well, isn't their argument
that this one instance

600
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:52,551
could be the tip of the iceberg,
that they need to go

601
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,942
through all the old trades
to see if there's a pattern?

602
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:57,877
But that could take months.
It's harassment, Randy.

603
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:59,796
They've already spent years

604
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,068
going through
all those old trades,

605
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,092
trying to make a case,
and they've failed.

606
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:05,924
Now they've come up with this
story about me and sabotage,

607
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,488
which you will see is false.

608
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,648
Look, I shorted that company

609
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:12,467
'cause I saw a faulty process
and bad financials,

610
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,385
and I'm being penalized because
the markets agreed with me.

611
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:16,752
I was set up.

612
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,426
Now, soon you'll have
all these details,

613
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,967
but... what they are doing
right now

614
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,574
is they're trying to ruin
not only my reputation

615
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,004
but that of everyone
who works at Axe Capital,

616
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,033
and that is the story
you should be digging into.

617
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:31,916
Hi.

618
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,422
Want dinner?

619
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:35,478
Do we need to do that?

620
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,421
Hey.

621
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:46,093
On Axelrod, I could use to see
the transaction records

622
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,129
of all the people
who bought or sold stock

623
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:50,351
in the Ice Juice IPO,
the victims in this thing.

624
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,567
You mean besides the people
who were poisoned?

625
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:54,948
Yeah, they were about
the only ones who got paid.

626
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,493
S.E.C. said you were holding
the records for some reason.

627
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,272
I've got forensic
financial analysts

628
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,525
combing through
all that now.

629
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:04,187
I didn't want you to, uh,
bog down in those details.

630
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,192
I like knowing
the minutiae in my cases.

631
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:09,331
Good,
as I would expect you to.

632
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,898
I'll get the results to you
ASAP.

633
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,927
- Great.
- Okay.

634
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,994
You know,
I was just wondering,

635
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:17,785
who'd you get the initial tip
from that started all this?

636
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,506
I should interview
him or her.

637
00:29:19,712 --> 00:29:22,135
I understand
why you're asking,

638
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,758
but my tipster
is not exactly

639
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,331
Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel.

640
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,611
Just a foot soldier.

641
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,630
It was enough info
to get the FBI going

642
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:31,853
but not a firsthand witness.

643
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:35,292
If there were material value,
I would share the name.

644
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:37,390
Of course.
I know you would.

645
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:42,586
I am glad that I asked Chuck
to send you to me.

646
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:44,511
I need your expertise.

647
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:46,357
Glad to be here, boss.

648
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,967
Ugh. Don't call me "boss."
We're peers.

649
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,294
In a hierarchy, yes,
but colleagues.

650
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,279
Call me "Oliver."

651
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,212
You got it.

652
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,114
Never trust an officer
who doesn't ask you to salute.

653
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:03,142
It means that
what he does demand of you

654
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,332
is gonna be a lot worse.

655
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:05,401
Dake.

656
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,635
All of it.

657
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,753
You know,
you're in law school now.

658
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,537
How does this fact pattern
smell to you?

659
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:14,122
I get transferred
to prosecute Axelrod,

660
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:15,519
but then he puts
a blindfold on me.

661
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:18,649
I can't access certain documents
or know who the tipster is?

662
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:22,385
Well, there's nothing to be
done about it now, so...

663
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,473
drinks?

664
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,701
Again?

665
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,124
Hmm.

666
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,975
Have you tried blinking rapidly
100 times?

667
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:44,008
Yeah, I've tried it all.

668
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,353
We shouldn't have stopped
seeing her.

669
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,976
When you leave things
unresolved,

670
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,459
this is what happens.

671
00:30:57,786 --> 00:31:00,756
Mm. Maybe you're right.

672
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:04,569
Let's make an appointment.

673
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:18,216
I'm taking a walk.

674
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,717
Chocolate egg cream, please.

675
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:25,959
Coming right up.

676
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,242
I thought I'd find you here.

677
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:34,965
What do you want?

678
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:38,788
I became single-minded
to the point of myopia.

679
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:42,611
I know that I have
transgressed materially

680
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,319
but, more importantly,
in terms of loyalty.

681
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:48,625
I will devote myself
to the long and arduous process

682
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:50,259
of making up for the latter.

683
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:53,724
As to the former,
I have an offer for you.

684
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:57,212
I have lined up a seat for you

685
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,500
on the Theakston-Manley
asbestos trust,

686
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,063
rubber-stamping claims.

687
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,718
One meeting per quarter.

688
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:05,157
Your fee, 350K a year.

689
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,686
Now, that'll lead
to more similar seats

690
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,796
once you impress people.

691
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,760
You put together
three of these babies,

692
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,260
that's a nice little
sinecure.

693
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,089
Well, I was on my way
to being a zillionaire,

694
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,049
and you're giving me
a sinecure.

695
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,359
I understand
the rancor, Ira.

696
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:22,715
I don't begrudge you it.

697
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,757
And I hesitate to bring up

698
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,504
what I know you already know,

699
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:27,871
but I want to hear it from you

700
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:29,491
now that the smoke
has cleared

701
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,662
that you will not say a word
about my role in the IPO.

702
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,651
You know that it's in your
best interest as well as mine,

703
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,014
because that's how you'll get
paid off in your civil case.

704
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,396
Well, I've been punting
my interview with Eastern

705
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,413
as long as I can.
It'll go on the books soon.

706
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,394
But, no, Chuck,
I won't say a word.

707
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:02,567
Funny thing,
the egg cream, hmm?

708
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,269
No egg in it,
no cream, either.

709
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:08,080
Just... chocolate syrup,

710
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:10,807
a splash of milk, seltzer.

711
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,761
I guess the French had a drink
called chocolat et crème.

712
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,725
The American corruption for that
became "egg cream."

713
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:19,753
Wonderful arcana.

714
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:22,677
That's...
That's so Chuck of you.

715
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:24,672
God, I used to love
that shit.

716
00:33:25,312 --> 00:33:27,387
Go home and write it
in my journal.

717
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,270
Now that the smoke
has cleared,

718
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:32,034
you need to hear something.

719
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:35,236
I've realized...

720
00:33:35,577 --> 00:33:38,040
that you need all this,

721
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,959
to put people
in impossible positions,

722
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,231
to dominate with your will,

723
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:45,885
to torture.

724
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,348
I never think
in those terms.

725
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,492
Well, you've forced me to.

726
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:51,301
Let's talk it out.

727
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:52,945
No, this is it.

728
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,173
I'll never talk to you again
once this conversation's over,

729
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:00,755
which it is.

730
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,466
You coming in, nagusi?

731
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,593
Nope. Case. All day.

732
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,721
Something hot for Axe.

733
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,285
- An iron condor with four...
- Please. Go back to B school.

734
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:46,731
Anything good yet?

735
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,482
How about a strangle where
we arb the vega on...

736
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,051
You go back to fucking yourself.

737
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,552
I just need two minutes
with Taylor.

738
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,954
Everyone does.
You have to wait.

739
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,779
- Hey, Wags, listen...
- Don't want to fucking hear it.

740
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,338
Nope. As soon as.

741
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:59,590
Yeah, well, be all over Taylor
till they figure it out.

742
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:02,182
- If I flame this dinner...
- No chance, sahabi.

743
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:03,814
Never let it happen.

744
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:06,762
Orrin, time for you
to go see your protégé.

745
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,480
You want me
to propose the deal?

746
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:10,805
I want you to remind him
what happens to guys like him

747
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:13,111
when they take
this big a swing and miss.

748
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,310
I want you to remind him

749
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,208
that the political winds
have shifted.

750
00:35:16,307 --> 00:35:18,863
It's better if I show up
with something to offer.

751
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:22,255
Then bring him a glass of
fuckin' milk, but go do it.

752
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:31,802
Field trip. Come on.

753
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:33,087
Where?

754
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,371
Somewhere we can talk
without everyone coming at us.

755
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,775
I know a place.

756
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:48,802
Ever seen Eastern Promises?

757
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,286
No. Have you ever been
to one of these idea dinners?

758
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:54,534
No seconds in attendance.

759
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,416
Ugh.

760
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:06,505
Where are we on an idea?

761
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:09,352
Haven't fully cracked
the big one yet.

762
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,121
Trying.

763
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:12,266
Are you?

764
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:13,982
Trying?

765
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,271
Ask the real question.

766
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:21,142
Are you shopping offers
on the street?

767
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,267
Just to get it
out of the way,

768
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:28,497
let me apologize for anything
that might have offended

769
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:30,488
at the poker tournament.
Now that I'm at Treasury,

770
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,489
I need to find someone
to steward my firm.

771
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,435
I'm already stewarding
a firm, a bigger one.

772
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,321
Not that size matters.

773
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:41,013
Right.

774
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:45,814
Whatever Axe's flaws,
one thing he knows is people,

775
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:48,115
and if he believes
you can do it well,

776
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,482
I believe you can.

777
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,499
And I'd actually be
hands off.

778
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,622
Let you operate
as you saw fit.

779
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,414
That's my situation now.

780
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,371
Is it?

781
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:04,087
I said no.

782
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,588
With finality

783
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,485
or as a negotiating ploy?

784
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:10,617
Look, I know it's Axe's faith
that confers value on me

785
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,347
until I have
a track record of my own,

786
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,907
until others actually see
what I can do.

787
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:16,551
So I am loyal to him.

788
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:20,252
Until and unless it becomes
necessary, I will not leave.

789
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:21,708
All right.

790
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:24,137
You can take the heat.
I believe you.

791
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,671
Such disrespect.

792
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:35,603
Look at you,
sitting here with your tits out.

793
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,950
You got a problem
with my tits?

794
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,739
Or maybe
they're turning you on

795
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,370
and that's the problem.

796
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:53,661
You know, I could have done
that for myself.

797
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,132
I know.
I wanted the release.

798
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,873
It was even better
than a hand job.

799
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:03,087
You chose to meet here
in the anteroom

800
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:04,696
instead of the dining room.

801
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:07,225
I seem to have lost
my appetite lately.

802
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,266
- Hmm.
- And, no, it's not my health.

803
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:11,611
Full workup.

804
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,214
Radiology fine,
bloodwork perfect.

805
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:15,402
Heart, too.

806
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:17,320
Still, nothing
wants to stay down.

807
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,951
So, what's got your duodenum
inside out?

808
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,039
Want a hint?

809
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:23,224
His name
is the same as mine.

810
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:26,944
Oh, that boy is a feisty one,
there's no denying that.

811
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,191
What he is
is unfit for office,

812
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,724
unfit to run, even.

813
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:34,076
I came here
to tell you that I am sorry

814
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:36,081
I asked you
to put him forward.

815
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,567
It was a mistake.

816
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:41,182
And I will throw my full weight
behind whomever it is

817
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,713
that you say I should.

818
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,813
- Well, that's disheartening.
- It is.

819
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,110
I hate delivering the message,
but I owe it to you.

820
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:49,667
The candidate's
too volatile.

821
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:50,994
He's unpredictable,

822
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,035
a liability to all of us.

823
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,471
Oh, Charles.

824
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,406
For a father to speak
that way of his own son.

825
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,355
I myself will pass up
supper tonight.

826
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,519
That's how disappointing
I find this.

827
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:04,195
So you understand?

828
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,748
Not in the way
you hope I might.

829
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,972
I have had this
in my possession,

830
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:14,444
hoping not to be forced
to use it.

831
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:17,138
But I cannot stand by

832
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,522
and watch you run
that young man down.

833
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:22,247
You used his money,
Charles,

834
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,654
without his consent,
I might add,

835
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:26,770
to invest in something
so risky

836
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,071
as to almost be the ruin
of both of you.

837
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,354
Now, I believe Chuck
will not only survive it

838
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,523
but that the ruthlessness
he has shown

839
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:35,644
these past few months

840
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:38,835
will serve him well
on our shared mission,

841
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:42,275
making him governor
of this great state.

842
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,488
I'd like you
to embrace it.

843
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:47,192
But you at least
have to accept it.

844
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,725
Hmm.

845
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:53,583
I accept nothing
when it comes to that boy.

846
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,421
We'll see.

847
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,111
Hello, Dad.

848
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:11,433
Ah, let's all get
our appetites back, hmm?

849
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:14,643
Together.
What do you say, Charles?

850
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,660
This is a bridge too far,
Black Jack.

851
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:20,112
This is a bridge

852
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:23,301
too fucking far.

853
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:30,644
Ah, he'll come 'round.

854
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:34,738
I've seen this play
a thousand times.

855
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:38,329
By the time
the curtain comes down,

856
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:41,195
he'll take your hand,
and you'll share the bow.

857
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:44,573
I don't know.

858
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,096
Well, what's meant to happen
always does.

859
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,435
Let's eat.
I'm fuckin' famished.

860
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:20,023
That's some serious
fucking topspin.

861
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,922
You putting sneakers on
for a match,

862
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:24,288
or you come up here
with a specific proposal?

863
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:27,484
Axe'll wait you out,

864
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:30,563
no matter how long you manage
to keep the money frozen.

865
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:32,077
He won't make a deal.

866
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:34,503
We'll find out, huh?

867
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,519
What's it going to be, Bryan?

868
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,449
Pistols at dawn?

869
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:39,658
Fists?

870
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:42,357
You insist on picking
through every transaction,

871
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:43,964
he'll embarrass you.

872
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,648
Embarrassment is free.

873
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:47,441
We'll cost your client
a fortune

874
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,156
keeping his money
out of play for half a year,

875
00:41:49,224 --> 00:41:50,821
maybe his whole fortune.

876
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,760
You can't even count
that high.

877
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:54,238
It doesn't matter.

878
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:56,256
The case has no support
in D.C.

879
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:58,319
It used to,
but all that's changed.

880
00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:01,134
This is exactly
the type of matter

881
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:04,152
the A.G. is walking
away from these days.

882
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:06,156
No. No.

883
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:07,894
He's walking away
from insider trading,

884
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:09,375
funny accounting,
all sorts of shit,

885
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,447
but the reason he can

886
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:13,035
is because a case like this
gives him cover.

887
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:15,387
People care about it
on a visceral level

888
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:16,738
because it's about sabotage,

889
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:20,269
breaking the public trust,
hurting the average guy twice,

890
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,462
once
with the tainted juice,

891
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:23,597
and a second time
with the stock pricing.

892
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:26,443
How's that
for serious fucking topspin?

893
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,363
You want us to ease off,

894
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,961
you have to give something
in return.

895
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,862
I understand your position,

896
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,070
and at this time,

897
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,533
I don't have
anything to offer.

898
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:42,371
Then maybe wait until you do

899
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:45,089
before wasting
my fucking time.

900
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,915
Bach almost offered up
Axe's ability to trade.

901
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:54,147
I felt it.

902
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:58,238
Either he wasn't authorized,
or he sensed weakness.

903
00:42:58,593 --> 00:42:59,984
Did you show weakness?

904
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,218
I did not.

905
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,408
You have some scouting report
on me saying that I did?

906
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:04,981
It was just a question.

907
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,834
A better question is

908
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,112
which is Axelrod
going to bet on,

909
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,218
his present or his future?

910
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:13,472
A man who believes
he'll win at trial

911
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,404
sits calmly on the sideline
for six months

912
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:16,988
until his money is unfrozen,

913
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:19,535
and then he prevails in court,
goes on with his life.

914
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:23,077
But... a man who thinks he's going
to lose that trial?

915
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,209
Well, he's desperate
to get his money

916
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:27,154
back in the game
as soon as possible

917
00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:29,435
because he sees it
all going away.

918
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:31,675
Him giving up trading

919
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:34,093
would necessitate
a reinvention of who he is.

920
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:36,245
I've seen him
walk away from the table

921
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,597
on an impulse

922
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:39,892
when we were certain
that only a deal

923
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:41,206
would keep him
out of prison.

924
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,889
No one gets where he got
by acting only on impulse.

925
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:47,160
When it comes to billionaires
and Bobby Axelrod in particular,

926
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,486
the thing
you got to understand is...

927
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,365
they're meat-eaters.

928
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,253
The only win they can live with
is total, present and future.

929
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:58,343
If... he gave up trading
and got his money back,

930
00:43:58,565 --> 00:43:59,686
it'd be because he believed

931
00:43:59,755 --> 00:44:02,439
he was gonna kick
our asses at trial.

932
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,142
He expects to get all of it,
everything.

933
00:44:06,587 --> 00:44:07,790
That's who he is.

934
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:10,945
But still,
we keep the pressure on.

935
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,940
See if he makes a mistake
now that it's all on the line.

936
00:44:14,242 --> 00:44:16,728
And then,
no matter what he does,

937
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,717
we have to
position ourselves

938
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,559
to claim victory.

939
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,921
Here, boy.

940
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:36,321
Okay, break it down for me.

941
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:39,560
We are the Czechoslovakian
gymnastics team in the '70s.

942
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:41,411
A lot of pride
for what this country was,

943
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:44,953
but if something doesn't change
soon, defections are coming.

944
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:47,426
How'd Taylor do?

945
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,047
Fine.

946
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:52,971
- I'm not asking you to rat.
- I mean, you are.

947
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,043
Well, I won't tell anyone

948
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:56,452
- it came from you, but...
- It was a shit show.

949
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,536
Yeah. Get me Taylor,
Wags, and Wendy.

950
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:07,165
Why the fuck did you lead
the first morning meeting back

951
00:45:07,234 --> 00:45:09,017
without Wendy there
to handle the troops?

952
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,231
- Taylor handled it, as well...
- I'm talking to both of you,

953
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:13,568
and from what "Dollar Bill"
tells me, it was a shit show.

954
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:15,931
- Hey, you ratted.
- I pay for the information.

955
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,166
It's mine to use.
That's how it goes.

956
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,781
Wendy wasn't here.
She was with you, I gather.

957
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,747
We needed ideas.
We needed to come together...

958
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:27,888
So you made a bad thing worse
by jumping in

959
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,831
- before you had a plan, and...
- No, Axe.

960
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,222
It wouldn't have mattered
who was in the room

961
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,341
with the PMs
and the traders.

962
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:33,472
It was always gonna be
a shit show

963
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,991
if the message wasn't
"We're liquid again."

964
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,115
- Hallelujah.
- Don't be an ass.

965
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:38,300
You're right.

966
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:40,355
I meant Axe,
but you, too, Bill.

967
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:42,169
Will you leave us alone
for a minute?

968
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,236
Whoever you're trying
to destroy, stop.

969
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:52,027
You need to focus
on fighting for your freedom.

970
00:45:52,223 --> 00:45:54,337
You know what
you're suggesting I do.

971
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:56,975
The one thing
you can do right now.

972
00:45:57,169 --> 00:46:00,425
You taught me an average trader
makes a trade and feels good.

973
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:02,818
A great trader makes a trade
and feels nothing,

974
00:46:02,905 --> 00:46:04,713
as in be cold and act.

975
00:46:04,782 --> 00:46:06,500
Don't get hung up on emotion.

976
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,818
Give up trading
till the case is over.

977
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:11,880
You get it back if you win.

978
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,064
If you lose,
you've got bigger problems.

979
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:16,788
Let them trade for you,
then feed the press a line

980
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,255
about how it proves
the government has no case.

981
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:23,351
Unless you're worried about
something harder to admit,

982
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:27,007
that Taylor will be the public
face of Axe Cap and not you.

983
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:28,614
It's Theseus's Ship.

984
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:30,566
Once you change out the sails
and all the planks

985
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:32,568
that make up the hull,
whose ship is it?

986
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,339
Yeah. You got it.

987
00:46:36,136 --> 00:46:37,941
As long as it's your money,

988
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:40,366
it is still Axe Capital,

989
00:46:40,435 --> 00:46:42,801
no matter who's making
the day-to-day decisions.

990
00:46:43,281 --> 00:46:44,985
Are you sure?

991
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:48,665
It's not me
that has to be sure.

992
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:03,528
- Yes?
- I'm holding in my hand

993
00:47:03,597 --> 00:47:05,984
Robert Axelrod's signature
relinquishing his ability

994
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:07,341
to trade securities.

995
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,044
He gave it up.

996
00:47:10,886 --> 00:47:12,793
Well...

997
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,923
ol' Samson
got a real buzz cut.

998
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,654
Uh, we need to get
our version out right away.

999
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:20,086
I've already taken steps.

1000
00:47:20,155 --> 00:47:22,068
A.G. on the phone.

1001
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,520
Got to go, Ollie.

1002
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:28,710
Rhoades.

1003
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,083
Is this really the attorney
of the United States

1004
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,607
for the southern district?

1005
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:33,930
Am I that lucky?

1006
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,897
There must be streams
in the desert.

1007
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,779
General, a pleasure.

1008
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,306
Your predecessor called
once a term.

1009
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:42,447
I'm in the habit
of counting the herd

1010
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:44,278
at the end of the day,
Chuck.

1011
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,544
Sure.

1012
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,235
Eastern had a good day today.

1013
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,880
Axelrod's put his office keys
on Dake's desk.

1014
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:51,023
Good for them.

1015
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:53,212
But you're calling
because you want to make sure

1016
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:54,980
that I have adjusted
the priorities.

1017
00:47:55,187 --> 00:47:56,744
Pass the message along.

1018
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:57,919
I'm a thorough man.

1019
00:47:58,072 --> 00:48:00,693
As am I. It's done.

1020
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:02,664
Attaboy.

1021
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:05,530
I'll eagerly await
our next chat.

1022
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:13,722
Hey, you boys ready to go?

1023
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,365
Daddy's got to head out.

1024
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:16,612
- See ya, fellas.
- Later.

1025
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:19,021
Go wait in the car.
I'll be right down.

1026
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,638
Your office said
the money's unfrozen.

1027
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:26,458
Yeah, I told 'em
to call you.

1028
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:28,651
Should I have it wired
to Birch?

1029
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:30,208
No, Bobby.

1030
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:32,585
I pictured you two
running around together.

1031
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:34,887
That fuckin' starter plane
of his.

1032
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,453
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that sardine can.

1033
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:45,637
The money, Bobby.

1034
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:49,760
Just don't fuckin'
lose it.

1035
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:53,780
Now, there's one bitter
thing that we have to swallow

1036
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,752
along with
this delicious lo mein.

1037
00:48:57,078 --> 00:48:59,628
We have to slow down
on a couple of cases.

1038
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,846
You like giving up
those cases?

1039
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:09,407
- I hate it.
- Me, too.

1040
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,047
No A.G. picks our cases.
I'm chafing against it.

1041
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:15,017
I'm chafed.

1042
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:16,971
So, are we gonna do
something about it?

1043
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:19,088
When I know, you'll know.

1044
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:23,551
IoT, you know?

1045
00:49:23,762 --> 00:49:25,639
Sure, Internet of Things.

1046
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,352
When companies
that make appliances

1047
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:29,735
and digital thermostats
contract with the firms.

1048
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:32,451
- That manufacture the microchips
- to make their products smart,

1049
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,973
the connected things inside,

1050
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,505
they force the chip companies
to sign nondisclosures.

1051
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:37,891
They don't want
their competitors

1052
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,116
to be able to mimic them.
Right, so it's hard to know

1053
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:43,968
which chip companies are poised
to dominate the market. My theory.

1054
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,699
If we could find
a common component

1055
00:49:45,768 --> 00:49:47,127
among a bunch
of varied devices...

1056
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,448
You could
reverse-engineer it.

1057
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,545
You have fun
smashing shit apart?

1058
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:51,748
A blast.
And I found a component

1059
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:54,890
that matched the specs
for a Quartes chip.

1060
00:49:55,032 --> 00:49:57,354
So I called Quartes
and claimed to be building

1061
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:59,029
an Internet-connected
washing machine

1062
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:01,571
that sends a message to the
owner when the laundry is done.

1063
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:03,520
Got the full specs
on their latest chips.

1064
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:05,471
- And they matched.
- That they did.

1065
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,093
Everyone tries to hide it,
but Quartes is the main supplier

1066
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:10,325
for 85% of loT products
on the market.

1067
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:11,733
So, that's the shot?

1068
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:12,956
That's the shot.

1069
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:15,978
It plays.
Good work.

1070
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:17,461
You'd have found something
like it

1071
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,599
- if you weren't...
- That's why I have you, Taylor.

1072
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,149
It's a good thing
that you can deliver

1073
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:23,040
when I can't,
not a bad thing.

1074
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:24,128
Thank you.

1075
00:50:24,197 --> 00:50:26,543
Once you leave here, we can't
really talk individual names

1076
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:28,348
of companies again
for a long time.

1077
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,951
Management issues, sure,
but not stocks.

1078
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,355
It'll all be up to you.

1079
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,007
I can't be seen
to be guiding the firm.

1080
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,428
It'll look as though I'm
violating the terms of my deal.

1081
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:40,126
I know. You saved the firm
by doing what you did.

1082
00:50:40,195 --> 00:50:42,688
We bought back into the market
late in the position.

1083
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:44,840
Tonight's a big one for me.

1084
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:54,007
The most important managers
in the business will be there.

1085
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:56,916
Between them, they cover
all the meaningful strategies

1086
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,742
currently in play.

1087
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,161
Quite the cotillion.

1088
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:06,911
It's the social event
of the season.

1089
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:09,250
Tonight plants our flag
for the future.

1090
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,632
This room will set the agenda
for what the industry's

1091
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,662
talking about for
the next week, month, year.

1092
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:18,101
And what they will be talking
about is Axe Capital.

1093
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:35,588
All right, guys.

1094
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:37,559
Mom and Dad are going
to their therapist.

1095
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,639
Hour of screen time
only, okay?

1096
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:41,912
Probably grab a bite afterwards,
but we won't be late.

1097
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:43,478
Okay? Bye.

1098
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,549
- Bye.
- Bye.

1099
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:21,902
Look at all the trouble
you've caused.

1100
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:24,062
What a disgrace.

1101
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,413
Agreed.

1102
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,672
He's almost beyond reclamation.

1103
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:31,545
I can't stand the sight
of this dog.

1104
00:52:32,905 --> 00:52:34,438
I want to leave him here,

1105
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,703
and I'm tempted
to take you with me.

1106
00:52:36,925 --> 00:52:38,601
It's up to you, mistress.

1107
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:43,120
Leave with me or administer
the required corrections.

1108
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:48,231
He's in need of punishment.

1109
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:50,680
I'll stay.

1110
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:05,773
Have you missed this?

1111
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:09,459
Then why aren't you showing
the proper appreciation?

1112
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:11,914
I should put you
in this fucking cage.

1113
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:15,775
Perhaps you're in need
of something deeper?

1114
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:17,982
Yeah.

1115
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:20,297
Have you missed this?

1116
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,441
It's not about me.

1117
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,811
Or maybe you found, uh,
other outlets.

1118
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:28,001
How dare you question me?

1119
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,348
I can take care
of my own needs.

1120
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,769
Oh.

1121
00:53:32,924 --> 00:53:34,718
Explored
other fantasies, then?

1122
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:36,893
What fantasies exactly?

1123
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:40,632
You being with other men.

1124
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:46,761
Of course.

1125
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:50,503
That's your fantasy.

1126
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,736
You're that pathetic,
aren't you?

1127
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:57,170
I am. I am.

1128
00:53:57,843 --> 00:54:00,188
I want to hear
about you and...

1129
00:54:00,257 --> 00:54:01,305
Young men?

1130
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:03,498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1131
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:08,876
Uhmmm...

1132
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,666
will he be handsome, rich?

1133
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:12,761
- Of course.
- Yeah?

1134
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,119
He's brilliant.

1135
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,629
Barely 30 years old.

1136
00:54:17,426 --> 00:54:19,746
- With the washboard abs?
- Oh, yeah, he's ripped.

1137
00:54:19,815 --> 00:54:21,349
Tell me!

1138
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,171
That's how you want
to be punished?

1139
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,560
Yes! Yes!

1140
00:54:27,346 --> 00:54:29,859
It's... It's the most
excruciating thing

1141
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:31,264
that I can think of.

1142
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:33,116
I want to know
what he does to you,

1143
00:54:33,185 --> 00:54:35,125
what you do to him.

1144
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:39,332
We're somewhere private.

1145
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,267
- A hotel?
- A hotel.

1146
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:44,674
White sheets thrown around us.

1147
00:54:44,745 --> 00:54:45,965
Our clothes are off.

1148
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:51,962
Hands and mouths on bare skin.

1149
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:54,145
I take him in my hands.

1150
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,206
- Is he...
- Yeah, hard.

1151
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,938
Thick.

1152
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:04,236
I give myself to him

1153
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:08,463
and let him do
whatever he wants.

1154
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,394
Is it good?

1155
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:15,799
Good? No.
It's fucking amazing.

1156
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:21,908
He understands me.

1157
00:55:22,597 --> 00:55:27,005
He knows exactly what I need.

1158
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:52,157
Oh, Axe is so fucked!
From the Journal.

1159
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:55,177
"Government defangs Axelrod,
barred from trading."

1160
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:57,456
I'd love to agree, but I think
he bested those fuckers,

1161
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:58,538
and so does B.I.

1162
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,425
"Axe Capital poised to plunge
heavy back into the markets."

1163
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:03,390
He has his money.
What else does he need?

1164
00:56:03,525 --> 00:56:06,391
To do with as he pleases.
But what's the fucking point?

1165
00:56:06,688 --> 00:56:08,043
He's gonna be here soon.

1166
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:10,411
We're gonna know by the look
on his face what happened.

1167
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,978
Either he crushed them,
or he's become

1168
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,990
the government's favorite bitch.

1169
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:25,124
Who's this?

1170
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:27,142
I'm Taylor Mason,

1171
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:29,176
Chief Investment Officer,
Axe Capital,

1172
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,179
and I have a silver-backed
fucking gorilla of an idea.

1173
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:35,618
It's an angle of attack
on an Internet sector

1174
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,924
that's worth 12X
what you think it is.

1175
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:39,831
But the sector
is only the beginning.

1176
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:42,383
I'll walk you through
both the technical side

1177
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:44,383
and the types of derivatives
that are available

1178
00:56:44,452 --> 00:56:46,521
to both bet on it
and to effectively hedge it

1179
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,086
so that the play
is risk-neutral.

1180
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:54,751
That's how Axe Cap is doing it.

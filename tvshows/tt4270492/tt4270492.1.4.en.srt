00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,209
<i>Previously on "Billions"...</i>

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,109
So, the key
to bagging Axe is...?

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,109
<i>Pete Decker.</i>

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,029
Mr. Decker, we have an awful lot
to talk about.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,019
<i>You think you're gonna
fucking blackmail me?</i>

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,169
You're gonna watch,
listen, and report.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,079
We got a subpoena on your folks'
investment portfolio,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,209
and it seems that they were
in on the Pepsum trade.

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,999
Yeah, I'll come in on Monday.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,090
Yeah, I'll come in on Monday.

11
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,159
I just lost my mojo
somewhere along the line.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,229
It's fucking gone.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,999
Everyone else is up
double digits.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,069
I'm down.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,029
You're just listening
to the wrong voice.

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,009
It's what I like to call
the prisoner's dilemma.

17
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,069
No, you don't like
to call it that.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,070
That's what it's called.

19
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,079
Does no one ever

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,199
check you on this bullshit?

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,129
You have to ask yourself,

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,209
"What is he gonna attack next?"

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,119
Find a way to bury
the son of a bitch.

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,159
I haven't been able
to get Garth Sykes on the phone.

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,029
He bails, it hurts us.

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,000
When can I see Axe
and talk to him about it?

27
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,199
When can I see Axe
and talk to him about it?

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,119
It's a crush-the-other-guy
business.

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,029
It's like <i>Highlander.</i>

30
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,130
There can be only one.

31
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,219
I want to give you a short
that you're not gonna bail on.

32
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,210
Do you know Cross-Co.?

33
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,189
I don't see the short play.

34
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,220

what the fuck transpired

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,119
inside that head of yours.

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,009
I was blowing steam, I guess.

60
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,039
You're not tanking anymore.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
I've seen your runs.
You pulled past even.

00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,169
I've seen your runs.
You pulled past even.

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,039
Open road ahead of you.

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,040
It was an $8 million day
to the good.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,229
I had a drink.
Three.

66
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,019
Watched the Yanks lose.

67
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,139
And then there was
just... nothing.

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,049
You don't feel anything.

69
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,109
Maybe a twinge
when I get crushed.

70
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,209
Nothing when I'm up.

71
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,049
It happens.

72
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,189
You ever do this thing
where you pull up your positions

73
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,999
and just stare at them
on the screen?

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,140
And just stare at them
on the screen?

75
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:33,129
Try to really hold on
to all that money inside?

76
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,049
No.

77
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,229
Does it make you feel happy
when you do?

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,209
Like it's enough?

79
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,229
No.

80
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,089
Right.

81
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,170
Because what drives you
doesn't understand "enough."

82
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,019
Well, last night,
I was doing it...

83
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,169
Staring at the numbers.

84
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,119
I look away from the screen,
out the window,

85
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,019
and I see them out there,

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,219
eating everything we planted

87
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,999
like it's a fucking salad bar
for them.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,230
Like it's a fucking salad bar
for them.

89
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:05,049
And then just... rage

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,039
over how fucking stupid
they are.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,109
Eat, move, shit.
Eat, move, shit. Repeat.

92
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,099
I mean, how can things
that dumb have the gall

93
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,169
to occupy the same space
that I do?

94
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,120
Does that one make
any sense to you?

95
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,190
Yeah, more than you know.

96
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,009
Is that Pete Decker?

97
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,220
What?

98
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:29,159
He used to work at Axe.

99
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you have business with him?

100
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,149
Do you have business with him?

101
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,189
Which guy?

102
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
Decker. There.

103
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,179
I don't know.
I guess I missed him.

104
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,029
I love you.

105
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,200
Talk to you, okay?

106
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,149
Look, there won't be any record
of what happened here.

107
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,210
It's been worked out.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,189
But I'll remember.

109
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,029
I can't have this.

110
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,039
Can't give the world
another reason to hate us.

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,999
Can't give a wedge
to law enforcement, a way in.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,109
Can't give a wedge
to law enforcement, a way in.

113
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
You understand?

114
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,159
Go get yourself coffee.
Shower in the gym.

115
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,080
Don't fucking talk
about any of this to anyone.

116
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,150
Keep it together.
All right?

117
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,119
<i>What you need to know
before we even start</i>

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,089
is how tight these guys are
with each other.

119
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,099
They are grateful,
and they're scared.

120
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,209
Let's get started.

121
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,210
This is a proffer session,

122
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,571
otherwise known as
Queen for a Day.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,999
As the documents
you signed state,

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,078
As the documents
you signed state,

125
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,119
you lay out everything illegal

126
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,999
you've done
in the securities industry,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,029
particularly in regards
to Axe Capital,

128
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,079
in return for a felony 5K
letter-reducing sentence.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,029
If you are untruthful
or withholding,

130
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,270
you can and will be prosecuted.

131
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,090
"Sing for your supper and you'll
get breakfast in the morn'."

132
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,019
But what they don't spell out
in that, uh, fine show stopper

133
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,999
is what happens when you decide
that you forgot the tune.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,140
Is what happens when you decide
that you forgot the tune.

135
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,150
Well, then you go to jail, Pete,
and so do mom and dad.

136
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,070
So, is it prison
or start talking?

137
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,129
Just another schnook
running his own money.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,090
Fucking egg noodles
with ketchup.

139
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,019
Okay.
Let's do this.

140
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,009
How does the day start
at Axe Capital?

141
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,079
What does Axe do?

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,999
The real answer is
anything he wants.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,210
The real answer is
anything he wants.

144
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,089
When you're at his level,

145
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,209
you're more like a nation-state
than a person.

146
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,049
There is no schedule
he's following.

147
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,019
<i>I mean, when he shows up,
the meeting starts.</i>

148
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,219
<i>I got it. He's rich.</i>
Let's go.

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,210
<i>Rich?</i>

150
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,059
<i>Rich is a Marquis Jet card,</i>

151
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,009
<i>uh, flying out East
on a chopper.</i>

152
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,099
<i>This is more like,
"Hey, I want a cheesesteak.</i>

153
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,159
<i>Send some guy to Philly</i>

154
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,029
<i>and bring them back
for everyone."</i>

155
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,069
Jim's or Shank's?

156
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,139
<i>Both.
And Tony Luke's.</i>

157
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,159
<i>The fact is, he does not need
to call meetings.</i>

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,199
<i>Everywhere he goes,
they form around him.</i>

159
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
<i>I mean, he's like a...
Like an aircraft carrier</i>

160
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,089
<i>I mean, he's like a...
Like an aircraft carrier</i>

161
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,229
<i>in the center of a strike group.</i>

162
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,009
<i>When he turns left,</i>

163
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,169
battleships, destroyers, subs,

164
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,109
they all turn left with him.

165
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,119
- I could use a coffee.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,119
Anyone else?
In a minute.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180
Keep going.

168
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,109
You just don't know where
his focus is gonna stand.

169
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,009
Sometimes,
you hope it lands on you.

170
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,169
Sometimes,
you wish you were invisible.

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,189
Because when it does land
on you, he sees everything.

172
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,129
No, no.

173
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,029
I did get the offer,
but I did turn it down.

174
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,169
That's what I was coming
to tell you.

175
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,219
Good.

176
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,000
Because it seemed like maybe
you were trying to tell me

177
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,109
Because it seemed like maybe
you were trying to tell me

178
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,109
if I didn't match it,
you were gonna leave.

179
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,119
No, I was...
trying to be loyal.

180
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,009
You don't try to be loyal.
You just are.

181
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,019
Or you're not.

182
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,189
I am.

183
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,230
Well, that's heartening, Mafee.

184
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,029
Information flow.

185
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,229
When you are Bobby Axelrod,

186
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,189
you don't chase information.

187
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,109
Information flows to you.

188
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,229
- What kind?
- All kinds.

189
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,019
It could be an owner
of a sports team

190
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,159
inviting him to sit in a box

191
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
at a... at an all-star game

192
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,039
at a... at an all-star game

193
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,039
or some leader
of an African republic

194
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,039
looking for a-a handout.

195
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,139
While the rest of us
are plugging away, ants,

196
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,219
he sees the whole board.

197
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,999
Hey.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,179
<i>You always said
to call this number,</i>

199
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,120
and only this number,
in a circumstance like this.

200
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,029
<i>I understand.</i>

201
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,199
This has to be
an in-person conversation.

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,119
<i>I'll tell you a time and place.</i>

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,049
<i>Hey, and thanks for the call,
Constantine.</i>

204
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,999
You're a good friend.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,040
You're a good friend.

206
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,079
<i>You never really know
what he's doing or why.</i>

207
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,209
<i>I mean, he says he's going
to Morocco</i>

208
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,089
<i>to check out
a seven-star hotel,</i>

209
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,049
<i>but then you find out
he's really in Hangzhou</i>

210
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,129
<i>making a web-portal play.</i>

211
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,199
Oh, hey.
Pouch needs a minute with you.

212
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,039
Later.

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,209
Metallica's playing one
North American gig this year.

214
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,029
Tonight. Quebec.

215
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,049
We going?

216
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,089
You're half right.
You got the conn, brother.

217
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,099
And like I always say...

218
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,209
Don't fuck it up.
I know.

219
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,190
♪ <i>Funky music plays</i> ♪

220

Axe!

226

Fuck, fellas.
It is good to see you.

227
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,049
- How are you, bro?
- Metallica? Holy shit.

228
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,009
I couldn't be more psyched
if you told me

229
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,089
Jillian Barberie was gonna ride
my face like American Pharoah.

230
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,229
That's beautiful.
I want that on my tombstone.

231
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,200
All yours.

232
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,049
Hey, where's Freddy?
Not coming?

233
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,079
Yeah, he's late, as usual.

234
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,999
Yeah, you know what?
We should leave his ass.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,129
Rule is if a guy
is flying you somewhere,

236
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,129
he gets to show up last,
step on the plane,

237
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,029
close the door, take off, right?

238
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,999
If you own the plane,
you don't wait.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,018
If you own the plane,
you don't wait.

240
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,139
That's the rules,
but not for you guys.

241
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,160
Never for you guys.
Come on.

242
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,220
Ah, that's not Freddy.
Shit.

243
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,029
Dude.

244
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,009
How far do I have to go
not to be bothered?

245
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,019
I wanted to catch you...

246
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,149
- Sorry I'm late, man.
- Freddy!

247
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,079
Freddy!
Hey, what's up, brother?

248
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,179
Hey.
Hey, jump on. Jump on.

249
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,139
I'll be there in a sec.
Okay.

250
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,069
Have to talk
about the Cross-Co. short.

251
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,109
I didn't understand the play

252
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,169
when you had me make it.

253
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,150
Now I do.

254
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,069
We should get out
of the position.

255
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,000
I'd never do that.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,180
I'd never do that.

257
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,179
It's the only way to eliminate
potential conflict of interest.

258
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,999
- There's no conflict.
- Come on.

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,079
It won't look good.

260
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,069
You set the position then jump
onto the board of YumTime.

261
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,229
If I made moves...

262
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,189
based on what looked good,

263
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,089
I'm damn sure I wouldn't have
this puppy right here.

264
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,190
And I'm on lots of boards.

265
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,099
Those don't have contracts
they're dumping

266
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,000
with Cross-Co. Trucking.

267
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,069
A guy I talked to

268
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,149
who traffics in the name

269
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,079
says he's hearing whispers

270
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,169
the contract's
going to be cancelled.

271
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,229
This opens us up
to contract steering,

272
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,000
manipulation.

273
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,069
Manipulation.

274
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,169
It opens me up.

275
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,149
I didn't have the board seat
when we took the short position.

276
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,079
And I don't have anything to do
with the day-to-day at YumTime

277
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,149
or their contracts with vendors.

278
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,229
There's no paper that says I do.

279
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,229
So, the only thing you're
open to is making some money,

280
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,190
which would make a nice change.

281
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,049
Like your wife says,
hold the fucking position

282
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,019
until I tell you I'm done.

283
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,999
Come on. Come on.

284
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,009
I guess
that meeting's over, huh?

285
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,099
Shotgun!

286
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
All right.

287
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,999
Inside information,
specifically.

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,009
Inside information,
specifically.

289
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,130
Where is it coming from?

290
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,079
Where does rain come from?

291
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,099
The sky.
God himself.

292
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,079
Information comes
from everywhere and all at once,

293
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,009
from guys who owe him,

294
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,199
guys he's worked, charmed,
hired, paid off for years.

295
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,159
Sell-side traders looking to get
a gold star next to their name.

296
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,189
Disgruntled employees,

297
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,149
execs at the company
in question,

298
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,029
an analyst covering a stock
who feels underpaid.

299
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,029
Like rain, it comes.

300
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,999
Sounds like
it's great to be Axe.

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,120
Sounds like
it's great to be Axe.

302
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:33,089
It is.
But it's a zero-sum game.

303
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,109
Kill and eat or be eaten.

304
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,169
I mean, don't kid yourselves.

305
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,219
These guys are like kings.

306
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,140
Someone is always coming
to assassinate them.

307
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,089
You ready, Quince?

308
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,169
Yeah.

309
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,159
But you're gonna love
what I just heard

310
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,149
from this British fruit,
Farraday,

311
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,089
my guy on the stock loan desk.

312
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,129
Guess which hedge-funder's
got himself

313
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,069
in a precarious short,

314
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,169
ripe for a squeeze?

315
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,999
If you're talking Bobby Axelrod,

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,180
If you're talking Bobby Axelrod,

317
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:03,229
this just became
my favorite round of the year.

318
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,089
You have details?

319
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,129
I do.

320
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,009
Hit first.
And talk.

321
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,159
I want to know what stock
I'm running up his ass.

322
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,020
It's a trucking company...
Cross-Co.

323
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,159
Right here on the course?

324
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,039
I'm President Emeritus.

325
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,100
I do what I want.

326
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,220
All right.
To me.

327
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,090
Come on.

328
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,050
Eat those.

329
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,129
Wow.
Fuckers.

330
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,229
There's nothing I can do.

331
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,009
It was the only diamond
in my hand.

332
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,139
You know I can still read you,

333
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,209
same as in ninth grade, right?

334
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,099
I know when you're lying.

335
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,139
I know when you're telling
the truth.

336
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,199
- Which is fucking rare.
- Blow me.

337
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,179
- Truthful request.
- Exactly.

338
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,189
- Eat another.
- Guys, come on.

339
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,149
You even think
about letting me win?

340
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,129
- My plane?
- Oh, yeah?

341
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,119
When we boxed in my basement,
you think about letting me win?

342
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,009
I'd try.

343
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,229
You'd stick your fucking jaw out
every time you threw a cross.

344
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,999
It would just, like,
sit there, begging to be hit.

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,040
It would just, like,
sit there, begging to be hit.

346
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,089
Freddy the cheat.

347
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,069
Yeah, but I seem to recall
beating all of your asses.

348
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,159
- Indeed.
- You had the ape strength.

349
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,080
Ape smell, anyway.

350
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,219
You know, the best thing was
is that you always thought

351
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,039
that you were gonna win, Axe,

352
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
right up until the moment
that you fell.

353
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,109
You know,
some of us have changed.

354
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,109
Like when we used to play this,

355
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,029
I always used to try
to shoot the moon.

356
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,039
Back then, I was reckless

357
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,159
and, you know,
I had nothing to lose,

358
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,109
so I'd risk it all
at the same time.

359
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,999
But, you know, not now.

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,109
But, you know, not now.

361
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,999
You're still reckless.
You just mask it better.

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,029
You still need to crush,
not just win.

363
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,079
Still need to knock me
the fuck out in my own basement.

364
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,009
Whoa, Freddy.
Take it easy.

365
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,149
What the fuck?

366
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,089
I mean, we used to go
at each other hard

367
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,999
all the time out of respect.

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,109
That's the kind
of friendship it was.

369
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,199
What kind of prick would he be
if he took it easy now?

370
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,199
Hey, I'm just pointing out
that while he's telling us

371
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,009
he doesn't shoot the moon
anymore,

372
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,070
he just shot
the fucking moon on us.

373
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,000
Unless you can take this,
which you can't.

374
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:02,109
Unless you can take this,
which you can't.

375
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,199
No. Sh...

376
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,229
Freddy, you're the one
who fucked that one up.

377
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,119
I mean,
you saw what he was up to.

378
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,039
I mean, I caught on
a little bit later,

379
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,049
but I didn't have the cards
to do anything about it.

380
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,040
But you did.

381
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,189
I mean,
you haven't changed at all.

382
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,999
I mean,
y-you were just waiting

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,049
for somebody to stop him,
like Ike...

384
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,079
Right.
And you were just trying

385
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,109
to preserve your own position.

386
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,009
So, now I'm a dick
'cause I'm trying to win?

387
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,010
- Yes.
- Yeah.

388
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,139
- You're the dick.
- Yeah. You're the dick.

389
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,179
The king.
Who protects his flank?

390
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,209
My client is getting hungry.

391
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,019
You are.

392
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,999
We'll take an hour...
in a minute.

393
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,210
We'll take an hour...
in a minute.

394
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:32,069
Flank.

395
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,199
Prime brokers,
trading arms of the big banks.

396
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,209
On paper, they're supposed
to serve two functions...

397
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,999
Provide credit
and execute trades.

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,009
They're like loan sharks

399
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,209
for guys too rich
to use loan sharks.

400
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,050
Example.

401
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,019
They let you trade on margin,

402
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,119
lever up your book
two, close to three times,

403
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,229
even these days.

404
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,169
And when you stumble,
they're there to catch you,

405
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,099
even if it means
they take a short-term loss.

406
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,219
Why would they do that?

407
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,169
Their business model
is like a casino's.

408
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,079
Take care of the whales.

409
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,999
So, it's in their interest
to serve him

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,140
So, it's in their interest
to serve him

411
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,119
in whatever way he needs.

412
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,150
Right up until the whale
gets beached.

413
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,199
Wags, Roytan upgraded CXC,
Cross-Co. Trucking,

414
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,059
to a "strong buy."

415
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,050
Shit.

416
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,099
That's bad for our short.
Target?

417
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,139
They think it could hit $90.

418
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,129
Fuck!

419
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,049
Double scoop of shit.

420
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,089
Look at that e-mail.

421
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,069
They're recalling our shares.

422
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,139
Pulling the fucking rug.

423
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm calling Axe.

424
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,069
Hey, Chief.
Sorry to bother you.

425
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,069
<i>Roytan analysts pumped it
up on Cross-Co., target of $90,</i>

426
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,089
right when the prime e-mailed
to take the stock back.

427
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,029
That can't be a coincidence.

428
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,099
<i>No.</i>

429
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,149
Son of a bitch.

430
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,009
It's a short squeeze.

431
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,049
Someone found out
about our position.

432
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,009
Guys on the prime broker desks
have looser lips

433
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,149
than my first wife
after the second kid.

434
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,149
<i>What do you want to do?
Bleed some off?</i>

435
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,199
No.
We got to hold.

436
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,109
It's gonna pay off big time.

437
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,140
Get the fucking prime broker
on the phone right now.

438
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,019
<i>Farraday.
Wags and Axe.</i>

439
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,220
Gentlemen.

440
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,029
Don't "gentlemen" me.

441
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,069
We need another day
on Cross-Co., plain and simple.

442
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,189
Axe, you know how important
your business is to me,

443
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,099
and ordinarily, I would,
but we need the shares back now.

444
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,229
<i>Or you can buy in on the market.</i>

445
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,149
Why don't you buy
the stock for us

446
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,999
and hold it as a courtesy?

447
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,119
Ordinarily, I'd take the loss
for you with a smile, Axe,

448
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,099
but no accommodations.

449
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,029
This one's coming from on high.

450
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,089
- Quincy's office?
- No comment.

451
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,999
You are making a $100 million
fuck-up here.

452
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You spent years
becoming my main prime.

453
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,019
You spent years
becoming my main prime.

454
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,069
You're losing me now.

455
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,149
I'm pulling my business.

456
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,199
<i>My hands are tied.</i>

457
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,079
If you don't make the borrow
on the stock

458
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
by opening bell tomorrow,

459
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,189
I've been instructed
to buy you in

460
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,200
on your entire position.

461
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,129
This isn't coming from me, Axe.

462
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,110
Axe?

463
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,139
I hung up on the little tool.

464
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,209
Good.

465
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,009
What now?

466
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,119
Scour the 13-F
for Cross-Co.

467
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,159
Find me the top 10 shareholders.

468
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,159
Hedge funds, not institutions.

469
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,189
I need someone I can call
for these shares.

470
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,999
You got it.

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You got it.

472
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,189
Hey.
Hey.

473
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,109
Were you in the proffer
on Axelrod this morning?

474
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,159
No. Why?

475
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,130
Who was it with?

476
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:14,099
Are they signing up
a cooperator?

477
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,050
I could get a jump
on the release.

478
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,119
You'll find out
when it's time to find out.

479
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,050
Of course.

480
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,209
So, what happened
on the plane, man?

481
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,219
Oh, nothing
I'm bothering you with.

482
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, come on.

483
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,189
Oh, come on.

484
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,049
When I thought
that Cynthia was cheating on me,

485
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,079
who'd I turn to?

486
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,089
Yeah, but...

487
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,219
Now, look, dude,

488
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,039
I can see it in your face

489
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,139
that this isn't
some typical speed bump.

490
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,229
Someone's trying to fuck me.

491
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,130
Oh, so it is just like Cynthia.

492
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,039
Yeah, but it's more expensive.

493
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,119
I'm being short squeezed.

494
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,159
Okay.

495
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,139
Uh, someone's trying
to make a stock go up,

496
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,069
and I need it to go down.

497
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,129
If you short a stock,

498
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,999
you borrow someone's shares
who has them,

499
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,018
you borrow someone's shares
who has them,

500
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:01,179
betting that the stocks
are gonna go down.

501
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,219
But sometimes, the stocks go up,

502
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,059
then you have to buy in
at the market price.

503
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,039
And sometimes,
the stocks just keep going up.

504
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,010
Right.

505
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:10,219
Being squeezed on a stock, Axe?

506
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,139
Yeah, they're trying.

507
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,070
Eh, they're always trying.

508
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,199
Oh, yeah.

509
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,170
This is Purple Urkle.

510
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,129
THC level... 24.3%.

511
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,129
Ooh!
It's connoisseur cut.

512
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,019
You guys said something
about golf.

513
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,189
This will be beautiful
out on the links.

514
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, yeah.

515
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,230
Oh, yeah.

516
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:33,019
One step closer?
Whoo-hoo!

517
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,099
Yeah, his life goal is to play
on at least one course

518
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,199
in every country on the planet.

519
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,089
And then...
Augusta, baby!

520
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,149
- Gentlemen, have fun.
- Will do.

521
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,079
Guys, you go on ahead of me.
I got to make a call.

522
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,209
I know who's squeezing me.

523
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,159
Chuck Rhoades' goddamn father.

<i>I just flashed

526
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,069
Farraday's boss, Quincy,
and Rhoades Sr.

527
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,199
In the clubhouse together,
drinking fucking Azaleas.

528
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,149
Crusty old bastard's
coming after you.

529
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,039
Feels like it.

530
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,999
So, big shareholders of CXC.

531
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,170
So, big shareholders of CXC.

532
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,179
<i>Yeah, you found one?</i>

533
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,159
Yeah,
but you're not gonna like it.

534
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,199
Ken Malverne at Vista Verde.

535
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,010

538
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,109
You're gonna make a deal
with that devil?

539
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,999
Gonna try.

540
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,999
Garth Sykes called about
our exposure on Cross-Co.

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,019
He's looking for you.

542
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,069
This kind of shit worries him.

543
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,089
You usually handle the worries.

544
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,090
But today, you are.

545
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,169
My sources says that Rhoades
is proffering a witness

546
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,140
against Axe Capital.

547

Who?

548
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,169
I don't know yet.
I will.

549

<i>Find out.</i>

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,229
Also,

551
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,179
I have reason to believe
that Rhoades, Sr.

552
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,029
Is making a play against me.

553
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,140
Use it.
Go after him.

Cross-Co. is on a run.

Are you concerned?

562

642
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,089
I can die after tonight.

643
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,029
I wore that album out, too.

644
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,039
Yeah, okay.

645
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,029
Best song.

646
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,079

Wrong.

647
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,169

648
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,079
But yours is respectable.
Classic.

649
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,029
Well, you can't beat a classic.

650
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,150
Friends, cars, music.

651
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,130
New things can be fun, too.

652
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,209
Unless you're afraid of change.

653
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,089
Oh, I'm not afraid of much,

654
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,999
and I can change in an instant,

655
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,080
and I can change in an instant,

656
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,080
but, uh,
not just for the fuck of it.

657
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,059
Sometimes, you just got
to make the change blindly

658
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,149
and pray that it all goes well.

659
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,139
And most of the time, it does.

660
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,029
Or it blows up in your face.

661
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,999
Yeah. It can.

662
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,050
It takes guts to make change.

663
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,140
That's also called progress.

664
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,099
I think I'll stick
with the classics.

665

Elise, we're ready for you.

666
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,169
Yeah, well,
here's the problem...

667

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,000
you take it ASAP.

804
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,130
Who's the confused dog now?

805
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,209
Tell me about short squeezes.

806
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,040
Why?
Because I want to know.

807
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,110
Specific to Axelrod.

808
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,149
Well, no one has successfully
squeezed him.

809
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,209
Mm-hmm.

810
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,180
I mean, sure,
he's lost on shorts,

811
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:17,159
but if he takes a big position,

812
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,209
it's because he knows something.

813
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,169
So, if the squeezers
are winning,

814
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,069
uh, riding it up...?

815
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,219
They better sell quick,
because with Axe,

816
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,000
it's gonna go down
at some point soon.

817

Hey, Garth.
What's up, brother?

843
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,189
Hey, I'm not
in the office today,

844
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,059
but believe me,
I'm all over this thing.

845
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,049
Sounds like you at the end
of the goddamn world.

846
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,999
Listen.

847
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,009
I got people asking

848
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,029
why the hell you've drifted
non-compliant.

849
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,049
Well, we notified you
as a courtesy.

850
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,000
<i>No, I was notified</i>

851
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,049
<i>No, I was notified</i>

852
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,139
because of the 1.5 large
that I have with you,

853
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,079
which may not be a lot to you,
but it's a mountain to my folks.

854
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,169
<i>Last time I listened to you,</i>

855
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,059
I slapped my name
on a building for the ages.

856
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,139
If that isn't enough,
maybe the fund isn't for you.

857
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,099
<i>You know, you can go
to many other funds</i>

858
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,069
<i>and get 4%
nice and fucking quiet.</i>

859
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,169
<i>Go buy some T-bills.</i>

860
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,149
But if you want
the high-altitude returns,

861
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,199
you got to be prepared
to go where eagles dare.

862
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,039
Your granddaddy
made a fortune in bourbon.

863
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,999
Did he fold up shop when
they passed the Volstead Act?

864
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,028
Did he fold up shop when
they passed the Volstead Act?

865
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,069
How the fuck do you think
you got to where you are today?

866
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,069
<i>You think you got
a suite in Churchill Downs</i>

867
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,059
<i>because of your winning
goddamn personality?</i>

868
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,039
If you want to stay, stay.

869
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,219
You want to pull,
then tell me in the morning,

870
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,180
but either way, get off my dick.

871
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,059
<i>My source got burnt,
so I don't have any details.</i>

872
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,219
This may be the last thing
we get for a long time.

873
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,149
It was Decker who flipped.

874
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,040
<i>They have Pepsum.</i>

875
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,020
Okay.

876
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,090
- Thanks.
- No problem.

877
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,129
Hey.

878
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,029
You walked out on me.

879
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,999
That kind of thing could
give a girl a complex.

880
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm sorry.
My loss.

881
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,039
I'm sorry.
My loss.

882
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,219
It was a work thing.
How was your show?

883
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,169
It was your loss.

884
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,149
Peace offering.
What are you drinking?

885
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,199
Your best tequila on the rocks,
three limes. On him.

886
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,039
Coming right up.

887
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,219
If it's any consolation,
I almost missed Metallica,

888
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,149
and I flew in especially
for them and my oldest friends.

889
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,219
That's tragic.
Why?

890
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,109
Uh, you don't want
to hear about it.

891
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,199
Okay.

892
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,999
You know, the road manager
told me who you are.

893
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,019
You know, the road manager
told me who you are.

894
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,149
Not sure
what you're worrying about.

895
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,130
I wouldn't be.

896
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:07,089
Well, you'd be surprised.

897
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,139
At what?
How difficult your day job is?

898
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,000
Ludicrous, I know.

899
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,229
Look, I get it.

900
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,069
But I barely have a dime.

901
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,229
And when I want to do something,
I do it.

902
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,029
When I want to go somewhere,
I go.

903
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,129
I guess I'm just lucky
I do what I love.

904
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,999
Yeah, me, too.

905
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Most of the time.

906
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,039
Most of the time.

907
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,089
And when I don't,
all the choices are mine,

908
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,010
which is the fucked thing.

909
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,049
I think I just figured that out.

910
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,039
Well, this is
getting tragic again.

911
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,169
Don't go all
Charles Foster Kane on me.

912
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,009
You know, I've never seen it.

913
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,999
Seen <i>Rocky</i> seven times.

914
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,159
But never <i>Kane.</i>

915
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,179
If you, of all people,
have never seen <i>Citizen Kane,</i>

916
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,089
you have to, immediately,

917
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,209
projected on a big screen,
on film.

918
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,000
That's doctor's orders.

919
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,129
That's doctor's orders.

920
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,089
Promise me.

921
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,070
I promise.

922
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,149
I'm not into missed
opportunities, just so you know.

923
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,119
Good.
Me neither.

924
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,069
And I'm not down with regret,

925
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,079
so wherever you see
this night going,

926
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,100
I'm okay with it.

927
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,019
You know what?

928
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,109
If there were two of me,
I'd go for this right now.

929
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,069
But there's not.
There's just one.

930
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,049
You're married?

931
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,079
Yeah.

932
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,179
And it's a real thing.

933
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,090
Road manager
didn't tell me that.

934
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,229
I get it.
That's cool.

935
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,039
She must be, uh...

936
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
a real classic.

937
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,159
A real classic.

938
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,029
She is.

939
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,119
Fuck.

940
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,079
I don't usually misread
situations like this.

941
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,139
Don't. Don't.
You didn't.

942
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,089
No, I know.
You totally led me on.

943
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,069
And now I'm gonna let it go

944
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,069
because you made
the tough choice,

945
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,110
and that's rare.

946
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,109
Your wife is lucky.

947
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,139
Although you know what?
You're probably the lucky one.

948
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,189
True.

949
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,190
Don't forget it.

950
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,039
Describe the setup
once you left Axe Capital

951
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,119
and hung up your own shingle.

952
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,129
Well
after your years of service,

953
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,149
if you leave
with the right combination

954
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,009
of loyalty
and ass-kissery,

955
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,189
he wishes you well.

956
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,200
And?

957
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,209
He gives you a chunk of capital,
seed money,

958
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,039
and in return,

959
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,000
you give him transparency
on all your ideas.

960
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,069
You give him transparency
on all your ideas.

961
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,119
You open the kimono,
so to speak.

962
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,139
More like a colonoscopy.

963
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,179
He makes bigger, faster moves
on all your ideas,

964
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,029
often rendering them useless,

965
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,219
but then the tips
start to come in,

966
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,999
and it's all worth it.

967
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,120
Uh-huh.

968
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,999
So, he directs you to make
trades on his behalf?

969
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,229
Not exactly.

970
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,130
Just say information
starts to show up.

971
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,189
And what does he get in return?

972
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,000
A taste.

973
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,009
A taste.

974
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,159
A sweet taste.

975
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,179
So, he was an investor with you?

976
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,219
We couldn't find any
documentation or linkage.

977
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,139
Not exactly.

978
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,169
There are accounts
with names of holding companies,

979
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,169
LLCs, re-insurers on them

980
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,059
that clear to other accounts
with other names.

981
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,179
At what point...
At what exact moment

982
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,070
did Axelrod instruct you
to buy Pepsum Pharmaceuticals?

983
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,119
Never.

984
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,999
What the fuck?
What... What the fuck?

985
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,220
What the fuck?
What... What the fuck?

986
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:02,109
You will be prosecuted

987
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,009
for lying in this room,
Mr. Decker.

988
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,139
He never instructed me.

989
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,079
But you believe
it was insider trading?

990
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,139
I know it was.

991
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,049
How? Who told you?

992
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,060
It was a voice on the phone.

993
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,019
If it wasn't Axelrod,
who was it?

994
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,079
Well, I can't be 100% sure,

995
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,999
but if I had to guess,
it was probably "Dollar" Bill.

996
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,019
Bill Stearn.

997
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,119
Which is odd,
because his portfolio

998
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,999
is in industrials
and agriculture.

999
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,179
Is in industrials
and agriculture.

1000
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,079
But that is the last thing
you need to know

1001
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,189
about how this all works.

1002
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,139
<i>Because you can't know,
not really.</i>

1003
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,019
<i>That's why even though
I opened up my own place,</i>

1004
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,109
<i>I could never have
really done it, been him.</i>

1005
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,189
<i>There's so much you have
to keep in your head...</i>

1006
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,029
<i>Balancing, weighing, deciding.</i>

1007
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,129
<i>You can't let anyone know
all of it, maybe any of it.</i>

1008
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,159
I mean, to be Bobby Axelrod

1009
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,209
is to keep so much in your head,

1010
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,029
just to keep it
from blowing up your brain

1011
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,000
takes Benedictine-monk-like
discipline.

1012
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,999
Takes Benedictine-monk-like
discipline.

1013
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,150
Not sure the Benedictines
would dig the comparison.

1014
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,080
We're done.

1015
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,199
Well, we didn't get what
we wanted, but we got something.

1016
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,059
Bill Stearn.
Get the FBI on him now.

1017
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,079
I want this motherfucker's
genome mapped.

1018
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,039
That is how deep
I want this to go.

1019
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,039
Find out how he got
what he got on Pepsum

1020
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,079
and whatever else dirty
he may do in this life.

1021
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,000
I want to put him on the rack

1022
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,019
I want to put him on the rack

1023
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,159
and stretch him
until he gives us Axe.

1024
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,049
Constantine, my old friend.

1025
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,229
- You showed.
- Of course.

1026
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,119
You said it was important,

1027
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,130
but I knew that meant
total disaster.

1028
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,169
I have been at Mundia Tel
my entire career.

1029
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,009
What people thought was bedrock
was really bullshit.

1030
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,010
But now everyone is going
to finally see the truth.

1031
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,999
I sensed that you,
of all people,

1032
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,079
would understand...

1033
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,000
and would know what to do
with what I'm going to tell you.

1034
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:03,059
And would know what to do
with what I'm going to tell you.

1035
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,179
So tell me.

1036
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,220
♪ <i>Mid-tempo music plays</i> ♪

1037
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,159
Hey.
Hey.

1038
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,189
Where are the guys?

1039
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,070
Uh... after party
with the band.

1040
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,199
Oh, I picked that up for you.

1041
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,089
Thought you'd like it.

1042
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,130
Yeah, nice.
Thanks.

1043
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,180
Thanks, man.

1044
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,089
What the fuck's wrong?

1045
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,209
I'm in some shit.

1046
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,169
I fucked up.

1047
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,130
Yeah?
Fucked up how?

1048
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,179
Um...

1049
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,219
I heard your Cross-Co. play
on the runway,

1050
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,139
and I-I-I jumped on it.

1051
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,049
You rode along on my intel?

1052
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,059
I piggybacked because I figured
you always know.

1053
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,129
You stole my fucking idea.

1054
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,000
You're like Paulie Pennino.

1055
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You're like Paulie Pennino.

1056
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,200
Who?

1057
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:03,139
Paulie, Adrian's brother,

1058
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,200
putting the Shamrock Meats logo
on Rocky's robe.

1059
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,169
You should've asked, man,
like any friend would.

1060
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,069
If you had, we could have
worked it out

1061
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,099
to get you in on this
without attracting attention.

1062
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,019
Instead, you... you promoted me
like someone at work.

1063
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,099
They don't get to be here.
You do.

1064
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,159
I know. I-I know.
I fucked up.

1065
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,169
I fucked up.

1066
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,000
I-I put pretty much everything
into that short.

1067
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,189
I-I put pretty much everything
into that short.

1068
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,149
And then,
when the stock took off,

1069
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,169
it was too late
to ask you for help,

1070
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,079
and now I-I'm getting
a margin call.

1071
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,029
Broker's saying
I got to make good by morning,

1072
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,069
but I can't cover.

1073
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,059
I'm ready to... I'm ready
to puke all over myself.

1074
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,040
How much?

1075
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,029
How much do I owe?

1076
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,049
Yeah.

1077
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,070
I want to know how much
our friendship's worth.

1078
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm in the hole
just a little over $210,000.

1079
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,109
I'm in the hole
just a little over $210,000.

1080
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm gonna be pretty much
wiped out.

1081
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,019
This your brokerage?

1082
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,220
Yeah.

1083
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,999
I'm sending instructions
to my people

1084
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,130
I'm sending instructions
to my people

1085
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:33,040
to guarantee your margin.

1086
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,079
Axe, I...

1087
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,099
It'll turn around
in the morning.

1088
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,079
Stay short.

1089
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,039
Don't cover until then.

1090
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,199
The thing you got to remember is
if a short's going against you,

1091
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,029
you got to be able
to withstand the pressure

1092
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,030
or it'll crush you.

1093
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:53,019
You see it all so clearly.

1094
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,209
I don't lie to myself,

1095
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,089
and I don't hold on to a loser.

1096
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,999
The moment it doesn't
feel right,

1097
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,110
The moment it doesn't
feel right,

1098
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:02,060
I let it go, get away from it.

1099
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,230
Let's call it a night.
Plane leaves at 9:30.

1100
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,230
Thanks, man.

1101
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,060
Hey.

1102
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,040
Hey.

1103
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,199
You know, I know you know.

1104
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,099
But, uh,
that was Pete Decker today,

1105
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,049
and I'm proffering him.

1106
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,059
In that second, I felt, uh,

1107
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,029
guilty and defensive,

1108
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,059
so I dissembled.

1109
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,199
Oh, I put you in a position.

1110
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,190
I didn't mean to.

1111
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:56,059
But there were a hundred

1112
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,999
legitimate things
you could have said,

1113
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,060
legitimate things
you could have said,

1114
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:02,089
including,
"I can't talk about it."

1115
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,079
You're right.

1116
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,229
Not to pile on,
but your dad called me.

1117
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,119
Said he's been trying
to find you for the last hour.

1118
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,140
Yeah.
He texted me six times.

1119
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,179
You know, he has
a rare ability...

1120
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,169
It's a gift almost...
To push my buttons.

1121
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,069
You know the plans
he had for himself

1122
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,149
when he was your age,

1123
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,199
before the fire hit
that building.

1124
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,999
When every paper in New York
calls you a slum lord,

1125
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,159
it doesn't help out
a brand-new political career.

1126
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,999
Now you're it.

1127
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,190
Now you're it.

1128
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:33,009
You're the chance
to grow his own legend.

1129
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,219
If only you'd get into line
and do what he needs you to.

1130
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,099
And if you get chewed up
in the process,

1131
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,089
well, hell, it was a good try.

1132
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,129
I just have to keep reminding
myself again and again and again

1133
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:47,149
that he can't help himself,
you know, when it comes to me.

1134
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,230
That's right.

1135
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,039
You know...

1136
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,039
you have to remember when
it comes to yourself, too...

1137
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,999
When you're raised
by someone like that,

1138
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000
your instincts, no matter
how hard you fight them,

1139
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:03,189
your instincts, no matter
how hard you fight them,

1140
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,139
sometimes fall
towards self-preservation.

1141
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,010
You end up hurting
those you love, too.

1142

You pumped

This wasn't about me
making a few shekels.

1219
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,079
This was about me
striking at our common enemy,

a small piece.

1231

I shouldn't have gone
off-piste like this.

But by the time I get out,

1237
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,340
I'll be lucky to break even.
- No.

$55.
This is where I bought in.

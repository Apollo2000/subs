1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,762
Previously on <i>Billions...</i>

2
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:09,011
On power of the President,
you are fired!

3
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:10,887
Mr. Connerty,
as your first detail

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,637
as United States Attorney

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,970
for the Southern District,

6
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:15,929
please show this gentleman out.

7
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,679
The palace coup is complete.

8
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:20,470
I did what I had to do
to survive. And to win.

9
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,887
You have to know

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,345
that anything I do
to stop you is warranted.

11
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:26,845
Rudy, you're fired.

12
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,053
For fraternizing.

13
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,136
With our sworn fucking enemies.

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,970
You will move assets
how and when I tell you.

15
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:35,178
Your 2 and 20 is now 1 and 10.

16
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,470
The rest will be paid to me.

17
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,303
You are now officially
but unofficially

18
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,303
the proud owner of half
of my half of Panay's fund.

19
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:45,303
It's time to put away
childish enthusiasms.

20
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:47,345
They left me no choice.

21
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,470
Said they were going to
destroy my business, my life.

22
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,428
Most of your major cases are
being put under review

23
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,679
by Connerty.
Your name will be ruined.

24
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,303
And Epstein's vacated
New York Attorney General's seat

25
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,011
is there for me.

26
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,553
He owed me a favor.

27
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:01,345
Yeah.
As I do now.

28
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,428
You got that carry permit
you were looking for.

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,303
We need to be certain
no money is going

30
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:08,220
to ex-employees
of Axe Capital...

31
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:11,762
Please stop fucking
with Taylor Mason.

32
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,804
Forget all about them.

33
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,970
But be sure you don't
forget about me.

34
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:18,762
He's a Russian Oligarch.

35
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,887
But you, mon frère,
are a motherfucking

36
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,679
American Oligarch.

37
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,512
You will not relent.

38
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,303
Taylor must pay.

39
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,512
We have to do it without
Grigor getting a whiff of us.

40
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:30,095
We don't put out this fire
by pouring water on it.

41
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,095
But by sucking oxygen
out of the room.

42
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:34,762
Completely.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,929
This is the competition's...

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,845
Not exactly RoboCop.

45
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:16,804
But until now,
considered state of the art.

46
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,387
Ooh, money just walked in.

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,345
Rebecca Cantu.

48
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,136
Oh. So that's what a rich person
looks like.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,679
I'd always wondered.

50
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,929
But check out this badass
our company built.

51
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,595
Brains like Will Hunting,

52
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,929
strength like Artis Gilmore
in the ABA days.

53
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,178
Ooh.

54
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,095
Which is why Patriot Trust Bank

55
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,011
is proud to be doing this raise
for you.

56
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,887
I'll let the scientists
who made him

57
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,553
tell you how and why later on,

58
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,637
but I want you to know
that we are committed

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,136
to helping put one of these
in every company loading bay,

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,011
and eventually,
every home in America.

61
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,637
What size investments
are available?

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,303
My kind of question.

63
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,929
We're looking for
no more than five firms

64
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,637
to fulfill $100 mil
in this C round,

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,512
which comes with
anti-dilution rights.

66
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,053
Anything else?

67
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,929
The, um...
The noise signature,

68
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,553
that hum, uh, makes me believe

69
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:06,553
there's a combustion engine
inside there.

70
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,595
Rebecca, this product wasn't
hand-delivered to you early,

71
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,637
so I'll forgive you for not
having your research in order.

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,387
We have a proprietary
power source.

73
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,637
It's one of
the reasons we're set apart.

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,261
Anyone else have a question?

75
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,929
Oh. It's proprietary.
That... It...

76
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,720
Thanks. Withdrawn.
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,845
Over the line, Smokey.
Forfeit your turn.

78
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:27,053
- Mark it zero.
- Not how it's gonna go.

79
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:31,512
Of course, proprietary doesn't
tell us shit, does it.

80
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,679
I grew up with
a mechanic for a father.

81
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,303
So, uh, forgive me.

82
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,303
That's definitely
a combustion engine.

83
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,470
And that won't work
for the military.

84
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,470
So you'll have to
improve the battery technology,

85
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,720
but the, uh, the margins
on this thing

86
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,887
are already thin as Kate Moss
on a juice fast.

87
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,762
The money taken in today
will go a long way

88
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,220
in offsetting any costs
we might incur...

89
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:50,303
Mm. It doesn't know
how to walk.

90
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,053
I don't know
what you were looking at.

91
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:53,720
There's no remote.
No human control at all.

92
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:56,136
But it's not actually stable,
right? It's metastable.

93
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,679
I've seen this demo
a dozen times.

94
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,720
Hasn't fallen...
Hasn't even stumbled... once.

95
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,804
Well, you could hold
a curling match on this floor.

96
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,553
But, um, what about...

97
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:08,929
now...

98
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,178
Can we run it again?

99
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,470
Any other questions?

100
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,053
Whoa. They shoulda had you
inside the tent.

101
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,387
Could've trouble shot it,
helped launch it.

102
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,970
I don't launch shit products.

103
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,428
Lucky she was here,

104
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:35,011
or we might've actually
gone in on that loser.

105
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:36,720
So, straight back
to the office...

106
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,845
Oh no...

107
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:42,011
Axe, look, I know this may still
seem a little bleeding edge...

108
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,178
It's the Mechanical Turk.

109
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,095
But at least that
beat people at chess

110
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,637
before the con was revealed.

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,762
This company has real
consumer potential...

112
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:52,970
Yet this bank is invested in
this because the chairman's son

113
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,178
was in the Spee
with the Chief Tech Officer.

114
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,929
Or some bullshit like that.

115
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,595
He told you to deliver.

116
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,136
That's why you've been doing
all the talking today,

117
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,512
because it matters to you.

118
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:02,804
But now
you're gonna have trouble

119
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,887
salvaging anyone else
in this room.

120
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,553
If it makes your life easier,
I'll take a piece.

121
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:09,637
You will?
That's great...

122
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,804
But...

123
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,387
there's something that matters
to me that I need in return.

124
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,970
Won't cost you a penny.
Will even save you some...

125
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,887
This is gonna be a time of
great prosperity for us both.

126
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,387
So I'm glad to continue...
To renew...

127
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,011
To start...
our friendship.

128
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,845
I know your bank would have
liked the other business...

129
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,136
But I'm touched
that you prefer mine.

130
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,053
Based on a number of factors...

131
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,428
Including the brevity
of your track record...

132
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,637
- Alto Bank...
- Bank Allemane...

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,470
Patriot Trust Bank can't extend
you leverage at this juncture.

134
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,970
Thank you for your time.

135
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,220
Here.
Have a koozie.

136
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,845
I can set you more meetings.

137
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,804
No. I've seen more eyes
go cold on me

138
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:03,261
than Agent Bill Tench did
in a whole season.

139
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,845
Axe got to all of the bankers.

140
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,845
- I'm done.
- I should have gone.

141
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,011
You don't have time
to waste on that shit.

142
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:11,845
It's not time that's
the problem. It's capital.

143
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,303
Winston and the quant team have
a huge stat arb opportunity

144
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,220
that I'm gonna have to
leave on the table

145
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:18,220
if we don't lock in leverage
by end of week.

146
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,011
I can't let Axe cause that.

147
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:23,053
- You have an idea?
- Not even a notion. Yet.

148
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:25,387
But I will.

149
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,095
We will.

150
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:35,095
He actually invested
in the piece of shit...

151
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,845
Believe me, I was excited
that we were getting into

152
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,929
Private Equitatus,
but badly built robots...

153
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,929
Private equity, Spyros.

154
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,345
Maybe just show me
your mood ring

155
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,470
if you want me to know
how you feel.

156
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,220
Or don't.
Because I don't give a shit.

157
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,887
But if we go in
on crappy companies

158
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,470
just to get the return favor
of fucking over Taylor Mason,

159
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,303
it's gonna be a hard sell
to our investors

160
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,970
on the wisdom of the idea.

161
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:56,011
At a certain point, the Street's
gonna start wondering

162
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,679
if you care more about revenge
than making money.

163
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:58,845
And so do I.

164
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,970
Leave.

165
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,553
I serve at your pleasure.

166
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,929
And so do I.

167
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:12,011
Meaning: I feel the same way he does.

168
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:15,136
If you burn cash and have down
quarters just to hurt Taylor,

169
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,220
you're Neil McCauley
throwing it all away

170
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,553
to kill Waingro in that motel.

171
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,136
I can't stand by
and let that happen.

172
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,512
For a minute there, you're glad

173
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,345
that Neil allows himself
to feel.

174
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:27,345
But then, yeah, his one moment
of humanity kills him.

175
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,053
But this isn't that.

176
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,762
We're mixing into
private equity. For real.

177
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,762
And I got everybody downstairs
generating ideas.

178
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,720
But you haven't said yes
to any of them yet.

179
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,804
They have a dozen internal ideas
you've turned down.

180
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,095
- 'Cause they all suck.
- They can't all suck.

181
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,553
What we need is
a meaningful partnership.

182
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,345
And I know how to find it...

183
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:48,845
Helena, could you have the team
put together a list

184
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,804
of all the private companies
Rebecca Cantu is invested in.

185
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,220
Ah, shit, Wags.

186
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,095
You really know your man.

187
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:03,929
I never asked to be
your Attorney General.

188
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,845
I'm just a small-town lawyer
who was called to serve.

189
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,220
And that's what I did.
Under our last AG,

190
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:12,553
Alvin Epstein, who felt the call
to duty in DC.

191
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:15,720
But now that fate... and
the New York State Legislature...

192
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:18,178
have made me
the Interim Attorney General...

193
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:22,345
I'm asking you to let me
see this mission through...

194
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,136
You think he's got
what it takes?

195
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,470
- ...and keep serving.
- To win?

196
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:26,929
Well, he's starting
with the job.

197
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,804
As natural advantages go,
that's a good start.

198
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,637
And if he gets it?

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,220
His rep is: he stays in his own
side of the sandbox.

200
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,178
Well, if he's not gonna scrap
with us over jurisdiction

201
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,470
and for cases,
he's my kind of candidate...

202
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,053
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

203
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,428
...and to the people
of New York.

204
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:40,470
Thanks to the tireless...

205
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,220
Look at him.
Champing at the bit

206
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,428
to keep the reins of power
now that he has them.

207
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,470
- Don't do that.
- What?

208
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,512
If you're talking to people,
it's chomp.

209
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,637
But it's not that.
It's from the poem:

210
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,929
"Twelve beauteous steeds,

211
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,762
of golden color
and with golden manes,

212
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:55,387
Champ at the bit."

213
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,053
Champ. Champ.

214
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,595
We can go home now.

215
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,220
Voters don't want
William Safire.

216
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:01,637
They want an Attorney General
who talks like

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,637
he's actually from New York.

218
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,345
...this effort
and the progress we've made.

219
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:06,804
There's still...

220
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,679
The concealed carry
for your client...

221
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:10,220
Personally taken care of.

222
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:12,512
- Hand-stamped for approval.
- Thank you.

223
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,553
Let me know
if he needs a lesson.

224
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,387
I'll take him to Tiro myself...

225
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,345
Why do I feel
an ask is coming...?

226
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,553
'Cause you're a bright boy.

227
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:20,637
And contract
makes the world go 'round.

228
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,095
Okay.
What's up in this rotation?

229
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:25,178
The police pension fund.

230
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,095
I need an independent look at
the administrator, Raul Gomez.

231
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,470
Funds unaccounted for?

232
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,220
I don't have access
to the books,

233
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,929
but after 20 as a cop
and years of restrained living,

234
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:35,637
he's suddenly got
a NetJets account.

235
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,637
He flew private
down to the Derby.

236
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,011
Uh huh. You do, as they say,
have people for that.

237
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:42,845
Whilst I am merely
a humble barrister

238
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,345
with no particular portfolio.

239
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,303
When cops get going
investigating cops,

240
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,303
they're worse than
scamps in a sewing circle.

241
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,804
As you well know, Chick.

242
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,178
Which is why I'm coming to you.

243
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,679
And to insulate yourself.

244
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,679
Raul Gomez is a man
with a lot of friends,

245
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,095
many inside
your very department.

246
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,929
Some might even be
more loyal to him than to you...

247
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:03,637
And wouldn't hesitate to
lash out at little ol' me.

248
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,345
- Thank you, and bless you.

249
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,136
Now, who's gonna look after
Rhoades if that comes to pass?

250
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,261
You know how to
take care of yourself.

251
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:18,220
And even if you aren't one,
you operate like an insider.

252
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:19,720
Who's better at tracking down

253
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:22,053
and punishing
financial wrongdoing than you?

254
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,261
Well, I didn't have you
as a flatterer.

255
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm whatever I need to be.

256
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,095
- Nice to see you.

257
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,136
Now I gotta be a rabbi.
Excuse me.

258
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,053
Oh. Guiding your boy
to the top seat?

259
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,804
No. He's not my boy.
Yet.

260
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,929
He's new to certain parts
of this life,

261
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,178
so I need to see him in action
before I decide.

262
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,178
Do what I ask
and you'll graduate from

263
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,553
cadging pop gun permits
for big players

264
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:50,220
to becoming one yourself again.

265
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,970
You looking for the endorsement
of the Police Commissioner

266
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,762
to catapult you into the race?

267
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,303
I want his men.
I want their votes.

268
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:04,220
And I want the visual of them
bathing me in all that blue.

269
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,303
Cleaning...

270
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:14,095
Cleaning what?

271
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:18,220
Uh... w-wages...

272
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,762
I remember him speaking English
when we hired him.

273
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,136
Maybe it'll come back after
we punt him into the Hudson.

274
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,970
Eureka Building Solutions.

275
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,261
New big national
janitorial services company.

276
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:29,762
Thousands of employees.

277
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,303
They're chewing up
the competition,

278
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,845
undercutting all bids.
Best margins in the industry.

279
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,136
Is that what motormouth
was going on about?

280
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,929
Tuk has relatives
without green cards,

281
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,845
only temporary work visas,
who work for Eureka.

282
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,345
They get paid 16 bucks an hour,
plus benefits.

283
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:45,720
What's the thing?

284
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,762
Company forces them
to kick back salary,

285
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,220
off the books.
Benefits aren't real.

286
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,428
They're really getting
paid less than minimum wage.

287
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,136
If they complain, the company
jams them up with ICE.

288
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,053
And the chief investor
in their main competitor,

289
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:01,011
Manifest Cleaning Services,
seems to be Rebecca Cantu.

290
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,178
We were told to look for
overlapping businesses.

291
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:06,845
But Eureka's a private company,
so we can't short it...

292
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,887
But we can
burn it to the ground,

293
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,595
leaving Rebecca's company
to own the market.

294
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,011
Tuk, you're about to
go get a job...

295
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,845
Will you set a dinner
with Rebecca Cantu?

296
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,470
Oh. Yay.

297
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:24,470
Can we go somewhere meaty?

298
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,845
Actually, you know what?

299
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:28,011
I'll call and set it myself.

300
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,637
For two.

301
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,595
Helena,
will you get Rebecca Cantu?

302
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,845
Roni Supreme for ya.

303
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:38,970
Do you mind if I eat before you?

304
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,553
I don't like to take
a long lunch hour.

305
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:41,720
This is actually the first time

306
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,011
I've left the office
during lunch.

307
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,845
You're a partner,
you can't live a little?

308
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,053
Yeah. No. You're right.

309
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,512
I've got a very small equity
piece so technically...

310
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,470
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

311
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,428
- Was it really out of the blue?
- Kinda.

312
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,970
I mean, when you're almost fired
so many times and then not...

313
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,303
you start to believe
you're Willis in Unbreakable.

314
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,136
Right until they shatter your
heart into a million pieces.

315
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,053
Ah, shit man.

316
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,178
No one there will talk to me.

317
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,220
I think because they assumed
I'd walk across the river

318
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:13,178
and take a job with you guys.

319
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,804
So...

320
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,303
How's it going
at Taylor Mason Capital?

321
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,553
Fine. Good.

322
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,261
New firm. Strikes and gutters,
ya know, but...

323
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,095
I need a job, man.

324
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,136
My attorney said
my non-compete isn't binding.

325
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,136
And Axe Cap isn't gonna
fight it anyway.

326
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,512
So I'm coming to you
because you know what I can do.

327
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,762
You know you can count on me.

328
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:38,345
And my wife...
is super pregnant.

329
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,095
Done. Taken care of.

330
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:44,970
Really?

331
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,261
I gotta talk to the team,
but, like you said,

332
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:47,637
I have ownership interest.

333
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,428
I'm employee number one...
Or two.

334
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,762
Is Taylor an employee?

335
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,595
Doesn't matter.
The point is... I got you.

336
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,762
Mr. Panay.

337
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,178
Smart of you to
accept my invitation

338
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,762
to discuss
the police pension fund.

339
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:13,178
Surely me stalking
through your office

340
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:15,261
would raise questions
you wouldn't want to answer.

341
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:18,387
Or perhaps just whispers
that might escape your walls.

342
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,428
I agreed to meet you here so
I could leave when I wanted to.

343
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,178
We may already have
arrived at that moment.

344
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,887
Well, if you've nothing to hide,
what's your rush?

345
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,387
I'm managing
more money than God...

346
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,387
And bringing in better returns
than He did last year.

347
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,720
So that doesn't leave me
a lot of time to deal with

348
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,929
a man strutting around
on phantom limbs.

349
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,387
I know damn well
you got cut off at the knees.

350
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,887
Time's a fickle beast.

351
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,261
Why, a year ago,
I had legions at my command

352
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:50,136
while your fund was deflating
like a Tijuana breast implant.

353
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,970
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised

354
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,428
if you were Googling
how to tie a noose.

355
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:57,762
And yet through some act
of prestidigitation,

356
00:14:57,845 --> 00:15:01,720
you wound up with a lifeline
instead.

357
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:17,428
Now, it's possible that the
God... whose ass you are kicking

358
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,053
on the board... took pity on you.

359
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,053
But I think it's more likely
that Raul Gomez

360
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:24,595
saw a desperate man
that he could manipulate.

361
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,845
So tell me...
how's it work?

362
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,261
Is he invading the principal?

363
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,762
Or are you just
kicking back to him?

364
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:40,595
Raul is as clean as they come.

365
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,512
He pulled the pension fund
from Axe Cap

366
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:45,303
the second Axelrod's
legal troubles set in.

367
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:48,178
And then he picked me

368
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,095
because I am a paragon
of business ethics.

369
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,762
You do know that Axe
was in that legal trouble

370
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,345
because I put him there.

371
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,011
But he survived.

372
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,011
He always does.

373
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,845
How come you don't
know that by now?

374
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,929
And for the record,

375
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,804
I didn't even mean
to mention his name.

376
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,136
There is no record.

377
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,011
Why does mentioning his name
concern you, friend?

378
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,095
You have no business with him,
do you?

379
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,136
Just don't want it to seem like

380
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,303
I'm gloating that I took
from him, is all.

381
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,095
Hmm.

382
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:21,553
Is that the thing?

383
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:23,345
You took from him?

384
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,095
Or is there more to it?

385
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,470
This game can be cutthroat.

386
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,929
That's it.

387
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:33,303
Uh-huh.

388
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,595
Hmm.

389
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,261
Okay.

390
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:42,220
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Panay.

391
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,720
I came across a tantalizing
tidbit during my daily rounds.

392
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,303
It's Bonnie's birthday...

393
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,345
That's the tidbit?

394
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:01,762
No.

395
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:03,887
She was contacted by

396
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,720
a certain former
Axe Cap employee

397
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:09,178
whom I'll just call
"Mafee."

398
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:13,345
And "Mafee" invited her
to celebratory drinks.

399
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,679
She declined, but she didn't
officially report it.

400
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:18,637
Still not sharing.

401
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,845
And let me guess how you
came across this morsel:

402
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,011
In addition to reading
all the e-mails flagged

403
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:25,804
for possible
compliance violations,

404
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:29,345
you're also perusing any sent to
eligible females in our employ.

405
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,637
Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty.

406
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,387
As the head of HR,

407
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,553
I really need to ask you to
cut that the fuck out.

408
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,553
Axe Cap emails are not your
personal Penthouse Forum.

409
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,595
Is Bonnie still here?

410
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,637
She's doing a B-day shindizzle
with some of the people here...

411
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,762
- Are you going?
- It's for the psilikatzides.

412
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:47,970
Small timers.

413
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,387
You weren't invited.

414
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,095
Neither were you.

415
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:53,970
- Wait, are you going?
- Come on.

416
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:57,053
Shut up.

417
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,387
Hi!

418
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,595
Oh, come on.

419
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,178
This one's classic, right?

420
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,762
You got a problem
with the 'Commodes?'

421
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,428
Was expecting you to bring
more Steely Dan.

422
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,845
Oh. I hold back the top shelf
for my birthday.

423
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,970
<i>Uhh,</i>

424
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,011
<i>oww.</i>

425
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:27,011
The adults are here...
to party!

426
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,595
Happy birthday!

427
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,178
This one's mine!

428
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,970
Got any other celebrations
planned?

429
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,804
Didn't plan this one.

430
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,011
People like to fete me.

431
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,136
And you let them?

432
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,929
I don't know.
If I feel like a drank.

433
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:04,470
Anyone you don't feel like
drinking with?

434
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,053
Okay, I know why you're here.

435
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:10,595
'Cause that laxtard Mafee
tried to sniff my panties.

436
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,261
I shut that shit down.

437
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:14,053
I don't need to report
everything I do to mommy...

438
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,095
but why is mommy
spying on my shit?

439
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,011
I'm the head of HR,
email correspondence hits me

440
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:20,220
even when I'm not
looking for it.

441
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:21,970
Uh huh.
So, my emails just happened...

442
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,220
This isn't all about you.

443
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:25,804
We are all as sick
as our secrets.

444
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,595
So stop keeping 'em.

445
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,428
I will if you stop snooping.

446
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:39,178
<i>Deal.</i>

447
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:45,804
Topper.

448
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,845
What's the matter with you?

449
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,679
<i>I've got work early tomorrow.</i>

450
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,845
Yeah. We all do...

451
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:54,970
Oh, right.

452
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:57,887
The other work.
Sorry, bud.

453
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,387
<i>Topper.</i>

454
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:08,679
What's that mean?

455
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:10,428
<i>COAT?! The fuck is that?</i>

456
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:14,428
It means "Chance of Action
Tonight." Coat.

457
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,053
Who were you writing that to?

458
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:17,095
My wife.

459
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,470
Oh. Puke.

460
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:21,261
In assessing nocturnal options,

461
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,303
whether to keep drinking,
head home,

462
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:26,220
or squeeze in
a tight little karaoke set,

463
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:28,303
it is good to know
the likelihood of success

464
00:20:28,387 --> 00:20:30,553
with your special lady.

465
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,136
Sexually.

466
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,470
Well, assuming you pay her cash,

467
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:34,720
chance should be north of 100.

468
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,929
I can assure you,
I do not pay for it.

469
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,720
No. You just beg for it.

470
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,553
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes it works!

471
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:42,261
Maybe for you and you only.

472
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:43,553
But not for your wife.

473
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:45,345
What you guys
don't seem to realize

474
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:47,512
with all of your begging
and whining is:

475
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,387
Act like a man,

476
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,428
sometimes a girl
just needs to get railed.

477
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,345
Don't you agree?

478
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,679
Nobody wants to fuck
a sexual panhandler.

479
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,679
So how does it work
in your bedroom?

480
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,637
Action whenever either of us
fucking wants it.

481
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,178
- Okay.
- Oh!

482
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:11,887
- Yes.
- Yeah!

483
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,220
- That's it.
- Cheers!

484
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,762
- Come on!
- Yeah!

485
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,428
May I?

486
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,637
Tai chi.

487
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,136
The dance of the yin and yang.

488
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,553
You ever practice?

489
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:15,345
In my day, I have tried it all.

490
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:17,804
But I always come back
to brute force.

491
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:22,220
Much like Mr. Axelrod.

492
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:24,345
You've heard about
my banking problems.

493
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,470
Yes.
And like your Mighty Mouse,

494
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:32,470
By providing me leverage.

495
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,220
Yes. And no.

496
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:36,845
There are friends I have.

497
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,220
Uh, they do similar work,
they come from a similar place.

498
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:42,553
Brothers. The Kozlovs.

499
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:47,053
And they're looking to get more
of their money into the West.

500
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,804
So you've done me the favor
of finding the leverage...

501
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,428
And you will do me the favor

502
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:54,345
of being most hospitable
to my friends.

503
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:55,845
I'll look into it.

504
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,220
Yes.
Look before you leap.

505
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:02,053
So long as in the end, you leap.

506
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,178
<i>You're in a select club.</i>

507
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,303
Female billionaires
not named Oprah?

508
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:16,595
Sure.
But I meant

509
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,595
people who have stopped me
from making an investment.

510
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,261
I'm not usually
so easy to dissuade.

511
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,428
You seem pretty easy.

512
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:27,720
If you keep pouring like that
I will be.

513
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,428
No, but really, thank you.

514
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:31,720
I might've been fooled
by that robotics demo.

515
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:34,136
I happen to be expert in that.

516
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,053
That's the thing about
doing what I do.

517
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:37,970
You're in these investments
for so long,

518
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,970
you really can't
take any chances.

519
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,762
I have to dive deep
into all these companies,

520
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:43,261
really understand what
the businesses are doing.

521
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:45,261
I'm counting on that.

522
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:48,387
Well I'm not gonna
carry your fucking water.

523
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,512
I don't expect you to.

524
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,053
What if I want to
partner with you?

525
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:53,970
I'm not raising.

526
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,553
You're really not
taking on any money?

527
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:57,804
Opening a new fund
in a couple months.

528
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,095
We could talk then.

529
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:01,512
Maybe we don't
go through the fund.

530
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:03,845
You got a personal piece
of everything, right?

531
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:08,178
So break me off
a piece of your piece.

532
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,970
What are you high on
from the last batch?

533
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,553
A bottled cocktail company.

534
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,553
A better mousetrap
for backend webforms.

535
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,303
Uh, an industrial
custodial company,

536
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,178
but that one's fully subscribed.

537
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,512
Then that's the one I want.

538
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:22,762
Why, 'cause it's so sexy?

539
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:24,637
Hmm?

540
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,887
I wasn't doing the conman thing.

541
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,011
I wasn't telling you that
there's no opportunity

542
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,929
so that the scarcity would get
you to implore me for a way in.

543
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,053
It really is full.

544
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:38,178
Well, even if it's not a game,
I believe in your confidence.

545
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:41,220
How much of the company
do you have?

546
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:42,762
Say half.

547
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,261
I'll take it.

548
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:45,428
Not on your charmed life.

549
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,553
Half of your half.

550
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:50,053
At 1.5x
the market price.

551
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,053
What's behind
the mighty hankering

552
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:54,679
for that specific deal?

553
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,929
If you're that deep in it,
I know it's the one.

554
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:59,804
Men in business.

555
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,929
It was a steady stream of no's
and rejections,

556
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,970
first from my bosses, then
when I went looking for capital.

557
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:06,637
And now that I don't need you,

558
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,387
you all want to chip off a piece.

559
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,428
I can promise you: I'm a value add.

560
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,470
Yeah, I don't doubt that
for some reason.

561
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,720
Is that what made you
leave the shopping network

562
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:20,303
and go out on your own,
shitty male bosses?

563
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:23,095
They hired me
to pick the products.

564
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:24,804
The ones I rolled out
were stone winners.

565
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,887
Yet I still had to fight them.

566
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,637
Eventually
I couldn't handle them

567
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,261
not listening to my ideas.

568
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,679
How basic they thought.
How slow they moved.

569
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:36,595
The way I heard it, you started
hoarding all the best products

570
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:38,679
instead of putting them
in the system.

571
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:41,053
That way you had 'em
when you launched on your own.

572
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:43,053
Well, if that were true,

573
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:45,136
how could I have kicked their
ass in the lawsuit they brought?

574
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,387
I saw value. I took.

575
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:53,178
You think that makes me bad?

576
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,470
Yeah. I do.

577
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:59,470
In the best way.

578
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,011
Mm.

579
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,345
Can I get the box?

580
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:01,845
This is working for me.

581
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:18,220
Please?

582
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,095
How the hell did you find me...

583
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:57,804
It wasn't easy.

584
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,720
It wasn't meant to be.

585
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,220
You know I'm not
my father-in-law.

586
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:06,178
Yet you're here.
You tracked me down.

587
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:08,136
What do you want?

588
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:13,970
You once told me
you knew people who...

589
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:15,345
switched it up.

590
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:16,762
Reversed who was dominant.

591
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,345
Changed styles altogether.
Yes.

592
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:21,345
They were role players.

593
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:22,679
Experimenting.

594
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,804
So, yes, they switched,
from time to time,

595
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:26,845
moved off of bondage altogether.

596
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:28,887
Tried exhibitionism, voyeurism.

597
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,887
Other forms of play...

598
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:35,470
But that's not Chuck,
not his arousal template.

599
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:38,178
For him it's not a game.
It's rooted deep.

600
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,345
Thank you.

601
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:44,428
Don't thank me.

602
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:47,261
Just don't come back.

603
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:56,637
Hey, I wanted to ask you...

604
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,387
I need to deal with something.
Is it urgent?

605
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,095
No, it's a personnel thing.

606
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:01,804
Someone I want to bring in.

607
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:03,428
Anyone you think meets
our hiring criteria

608
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:05,512
and fits our culture goes to
the top of the list.

609
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:08,553
Well, I don't know
if he's top-of-the-list.

610
00:29:08,637 --> 00:29:09,845
It's Rudy.

611
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,428
You think we need a mascot?

612
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:13,387
I think he'd be a net positive.

613
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,053
He never really got a shot
to show what he could do.

614
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,637
If you think I didn't
coach him up well enough,

615
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,053
- have at it.
- I-I didn't mean...

616
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,470
You are a vital and valued
member of this firm.

617
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,970
And if you want to
bring Rudy on, under you,

618
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,679
and take responsibility
for him blooming,

619
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,220
you have my full blessing.

620
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:28,178
Excuse me.

621
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,261
Report.

622
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:36,637
Here's the brief.

623
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,345
Tl;dr, please.

624
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:44,178
The Kozlovs...

625
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,720
They're a rougher, messier
version of Grigor Andolov.

626
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:47,929
Not as smart, not as rich.

627
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,637
Maybe twice as vicious.
Real animals.

628
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,887
And we get back more.
Much more.

629
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,679
They don't just order murders,

630
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,512
they carry them out.

631
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,261
- Thank you.
- You're paying me.

632
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,095
You don't have to thank me.

633
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:08,970
I think I'm gonna like him.

634
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:10,178
You're going to like
the way he does his job.

635
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,011
Already do.

636
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,637
He didn't offer an opinion
on how we should proceed.

637
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,637
He wasn't in here
"pitching."

638
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,887
But had you asked.

639
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,053
Sure.
I imagine he'd have an approach.

640
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,261
I'm asking you though.

641
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,136
It's still money.

642
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,887
Yes. And we need it.
But...

643
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,929
If the Kozlovs come on board,

644
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:26,887
that means Grigor
has more capital here

645
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,470
than the rest of the investors
combined.

646
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:30,011
Gives him too much power.

647
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,553
He may have already
gotten us into a position

648
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:34,428
from which there is no escape,
only defeat.

649
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:35,637
Zugzwang, you know?

650
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,303
It's what I almost named
the firm.

651
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:38,804
In hopes that it would
inspire us

652
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,136
to get the other fella
in that position.

653
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Anyway, you're right.

654
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,553
If I take the Kozlov money,
Grigor is in control.

655
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:46,720
If I refuse the money,
I'm refusing Grigor's wishes.

656
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,136
And he might pull his money,

657
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
instead of backing me
against Axe's threats.

658
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:52,387
But unlike chess, this isn't
just a two-person game,

659
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,887
so there must be another option.

660
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,804
We say yes.

661
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:59,136
- Make the Kozlovs say no.
- How?

662
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,804
Well, in order to
give me the money,

663
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:02,387
they have to have the money.

664
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,178
It's a good thing you didn't
name the firm Zugzwang.

665
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:07,720
Would have outed
how good a player you are.

666
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:09,136
It's better they don't know.

667
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,887
Better they never know.

668
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,178
I'm glad I know.

669
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,261
Why's Michael Panay
afraid of Bobby Axelrod?

670
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm afraid of
the Brazilian Wandering Spider.

671
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,011
Well, now, see,
that makes sense.

672
00:31:32,095 --> 00:31:34,011
Most venomous arachnid
in the world.

673
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:36,637
But Mr. Panay's phobia
doesn't track.

674
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,095
If the pension fund
is really his,

675
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:40,804
what on God's green
does he have to fear?

676
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,387
So my theory is, it's not.

677
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,220
Axe is still handling the fund
and Panay's a patsy.

678
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:48,845
Well, that is a theory.

679
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,679
Flat Earth is too.
Making a comeback.

680
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,345
Only two ways
it could've happened.

681
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:55,845
Axe pulled one over on you...
or Axe is paying you.

682
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:57,720
Latter seems a lot more likely.

683
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,136
Seems like old times
with you two.

684
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,220
I never took kickbacks.

685
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,220
I originally used Axe Capital
because he was the best.

686
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,762
He made money for cops.

687
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:08,220
And when your antics ruined it,
I moved on.

688
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,095
Because at the end of the day,
that's what it's all about.

689
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,637
Not about flying private
to the Kentucky Derby, huh?

690
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,804
I know you get off
on seeing fear.

691
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,595
So your balls must be turning
sapphire as you wonder...

692
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,553
why isn't he afraid?

693
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:23,637
Maybe because I've never been to
the Kentucky Derby in my life...

694
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,637
and you're standing here
without color of authority.

695
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,845
You're a private citizen now.

696
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,804
Get used to it.
Or don't.

697
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,804
Either way, you can't touch me.

698
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:45,220
Hey, hey, people, you all know
what time it is...

699
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,220
The fuck you staring at, Gumby?

700
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,470
Uhh...

701
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:01,637
You're new.
You'll learn.

702
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,929
This is how it works
the day after payday.

703
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,095
Giving back money.
Doesn't seem fair.

704
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:08,387
If you want to stay,
that's the way, Gandhi.

705
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,595
Gumby or...

706
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,637
Am I gonna have a fucking
problem with you?

707
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:16,220
Good.

708
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:19,011
I'll see you next Thursday.

709
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,011
More mommy and me time?

710
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,178
No, I think we have
an understanding.

711
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:40,595
I was impressed with
how you handled the guys.

712
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,679
We're in the fucking veld.

713
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:45,679
It's predator or prey.
Choice is clear.

714
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:49,011
I used to tend bar in college.

715
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,595
Got hit on by assholes
all night long.

716
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,679
It's not that different.

717
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:55,845
And pays a lot better.

718
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:59,929
Do you ever worry that at some
point the armor won't come off?

719
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,512
Is that why you need
a guy who doesn't beg,

720
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:02,762
takes charge.

721
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,929
Tell me when you find one.

722
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:08,512
No, but seriously,
is that what you want?

723
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:12,470
You mean do I want to sublimate
my authority at home?

724
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,136
With someone who's masculine
in all the right ways

725
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,387
but not a douchebag.

726
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,303
Let them take care of me,
but make the decisions.

727
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:20,720
Or do I want to be
the shot caller.

728
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,178
Maybe pay all the bills.

729
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:27,387
And end up with someone
who'll swallow that?

730
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,512
Yeah.

731
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:32,637
When I get home from work,

732
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,887
if I didn't go drinking,

733
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,345
and sometimes even if I did,

734
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:41,220
I lace up the Nikes and I run
the West Side Highway

735
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:43,095
until I forget that I want
anything at all.

736
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,011
Then I come back here.

737
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:52,303
What about you?

738
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:56,970
- This isn't...
- About you.

739
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:01,929
Sure it's not.

740
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,679
I guess I get out the running
shoes from time to time.

741
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,220
Is that always
the way you do business?

742
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:16,387
Yeah. You?

743
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,845
Of course.

744
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,261
Seriously, never had an evening

745
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,178
that started at a tiki bar
end so well.

746
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:23,095
Well, next time
we'll try a luau.

747
00:35:23,178 --> 00:35:24,804
Love to see you
in a grass skirt.

748
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:26,261
Gotta have the legs for it.

749
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:28,679
I'll have the papers
memorializing

750
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:31,261
your piece of the business
sent over this afternoon.

751
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:33,595
Unless you didn't really
want to take a stake.

752
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,303
I want it.

753
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:37,679
Scrounging for equity's
not a pick-up move.

754
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,387
Then we'll be in touch.

755
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,887
You get it?

756
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,595
I almost pooped myself.

757
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,387
But I think so.
Most of it.

758
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,804
Well, scoop up
any other intel you can.

759
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:03,804
And hold your mud.

760
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,261
Hey.

761
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,470
Bob?

762
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:42,345
I once remarked
you wouldn't even sweat...

763
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,720
and here you are dry as a bone
after a workout.

764
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,720
No workout.

765
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,970
Kelly just stretches me.

766
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,470
She's the best in the city.

767
00:36:51,553 --> 00:36:53,345
Mm-hmm.

768
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,512
I can have her stay after,
take care of you.

769
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:57,261
Another day maybe.

770
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,053
After we speak about
a friend of yours.

771
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,345
Sorry to cut this short.

772
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:06,261
Of course. See you.

773
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:19,011
I don't want to have you
in the cross hairs anymore.

774
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:22,762
Cross hairs only matter if
they're sitting atop a weapon.

775
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:25,345
You're out of office;
you no longer have one.

776
00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:29,178
I've been tasked,
I have been given a task,

777
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:31,261
by folks who do.

778
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,595
Ah.

779
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,011
So answer this:

780
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:41,428
what happens to you
if I take down Raul Gomez?

781
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,178
I'd prefer that didn't happen.

782
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,845
And I appreciate the gesture
of you coming here to ask.

783
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:50,345
But we can't just
leave it there.

784
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:52,887
- Because, as I said...
- You've been tasked.

785
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,220
I have.

786
00:37:57,095 --> 00:38:00,053
Is there some other way to
satisfy your taskmaster on this?

787
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:03,011
He seems to feel that Raul
is using the pension fund

788
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:06,220
the way Chris Stapleton uses
Tennessee Whiskey,

789
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:07,929
to slake his thirst.

790
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,428
He's not.

791
00:38:09,512 --> 00:38:11,178
Not in the way
your man thinks he is.

792
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:12,970
Tell me how it really is.

793
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:15,053
Then we solve it together.

794
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:17,679
If a solution presents, yes.

795
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,970
The man who sent you after this,
is he law enforcement?

796
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:22,095
He is.

797
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:23,762
How high ranking?

798
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:25,762
They all salute him.

799
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,887
That man came up
around when Raul did.

800
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,428
He can't like the fact
that he's running

801
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:33,595
the most storied police force
in the nation

802
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,053
for not even a quarter of
what Raul makes on the books.

803
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,929
So it's jealousy.

804
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,428
And from where I sit,

805
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:43,011
I usually see jealousy
turn into the other thing.

806
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,178
Greed.

807
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,261
Ah.

808
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:51,887
There may be a way for you
to satisfy everyone involved,

809
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,178
without hurting anyone.

810
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,804
Everyone wins and no one loses?

811
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:58,428
I thought you and I
live in the real world.

812
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:01,053
Maybe Michael Panay loses.

813
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:03,220
Which, in the scheme
of things...

814
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:05,470
Yeah.
Not really such a loss.

815
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,220
No.

816
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,136
And if there's a big loser,

817
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
there has to be a big winner.

818
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:14,637
Now, who's that gonna be?

819
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:18,679
Take a guess.

820
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:34,136
You know that scene
in Pretty Woman

821
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,679
where the salesgirl
treats her like garbage,

822
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:37,595
so she marches down the street
to another shop,

823
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,845
buys absolutely everything,
then circles back

824
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,053
to the first store
just to throw it in their face?

825
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:44,512
Well, I'm Julia Roberts,
and you're fucked.

826
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:47,679
You made a big mistake.
Big. Huge.

827
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,345
- I got all the money I need.
- From where?!

828
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:52,929
None of your fucking business.

829
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,553
So you can bet the next time

830
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:55,887
I need so much as
a checking account,

831
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,387
I'm going elsewhere.

832
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,261
Thanks for the koozie, asshole.

833
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,845
If it was a loan
from a Russian bank,

834
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,053
I'd see it on my system.

835
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:08,679
An individual.

836
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:10,720
Not Grigor, he's an investor...

837
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:12,470
The Kozlovs?

838
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:13,929
They use you as their prime...

839
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,470
Yes.
We've lent them capital,

840
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:17,929
but for infrastructure projects
mainly.

841
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,679
Force a capital call on
a few of those projects then.

842
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,512
Pull back the loans.

843
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:25,136
I want them cash poor
on this side of the Atlantic.

844
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,470
Cripple their ability
to dole out to Taylor.

845
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,053
That's a big request...

846
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,720
I can practically feel your hand
in my pocket.

847
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,595
I already went in on that
dipshit robotics play.

848
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,679
This costs me more,
so it costs you more.

849
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:39,178
Drop Spartan-Ives,
make me your main prime.

850
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:41,512
Well, if you fight for me
as hard

851
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,929
as you're fighting
for your bank...

852
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,303
that's on the table.

853
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:47,845
Good enough for me...

854
00:40:52,845 --> 00:40:56,387
Hey, guys, Theo
from Patriot Trust...

855
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,512
I know we thought
we could extend

856
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:00,178
that billion-two for a year,

857
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,345
but it turns out
we need to pull it back.

858
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,512
Fuck you.

859
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:07,595
When?

860
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,178
Immediately.

861
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,387
You guys should come in
so we can hammer it out.

862
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,387
So, how dirty is my man?

863
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,553
Training Day
or Prince of the City?

864
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:30,804
Raul is taking money.
You were right.

865
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,720
I smelled it.

866
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,929
You have the evidence I can use
to seize his pension?

867
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,595
Not exactly.

868
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,387
God damn it, Chuck.
Did I send in the wrong man?

869
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,553
In a way.

870
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:43,804
Because I don't have
what you asked for.

871
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:47,387
But in another way, I know how
to get what you really want.

872
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,220
Spit it out.

873
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:52,387
Keep Raul, have him fire Panay.

874
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,512
Now, why the fuck
would I do that?

875
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:59,845
Raul was in his job
before you were in yours.

876
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,261
He's not your man.

877
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:06,387
You do not have an...
understanding with him.

878
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,553
So you think you won't
have an understanding

879
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:12,011
with whatever manager he hires.

880
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,470
And I imagine,
as you've gotten older,

881
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:17,845
contemplated your retirement,

882
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:21,178
an understanding seems more
and more important to you.

883
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,845
And you think I can get that

884
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:33,970
with whoever Raul hires
to replace Panay?

885
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:38,637
I think the new manager and you
would be fucking soulmates.

886
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,887
Because I believe that man
would be Bobby Axelrod.

887
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:49,845
Oh, you really got down
in those NYC sewers.

888
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,428
That's what you get with me.

889
00:42:51,512 --> 00:42:54,887
No fear, of power or alligators.

890
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,595
It's why you and your union
are gonna back me for AG.

891
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,887
Thought that might be coming.

892
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,303
It's better for you.

893
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:03,720
You were saddled with Darcha

894
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:06,136
by baroque rules of
New York State succession.

895
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,011
He's not your choice.

896
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:11,970
He doesn't know
how this town really works.

897
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:25,553
Just the one photo?

898
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,720
I tossed the ones
of me with Chuck.

899
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:31,929
And I haven't yet
had the chance to

900
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,887
shake and smile
with all the machers.

901
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,136
So no pics with him.
But his words in your mouth.

902
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,345
Okay. It suits you.

903
00:43:38,428 --> 00:43:41,136
Uh, you still have Darcha on
your wish list for state AG?

904
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,011
Yes. I back-channeled
with his Chief Of Staff,

905
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:44,345
and he said
they have no interest

906
00:43:44,428 --> 00:43:45,637
in fighting it out with us.

907
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,261
I think they'll basically
do our bidding

908
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:49,512
and back the fuck off
when we want 'em to.

909
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:52,345
Darcha really would have been
our ideal man then.

910
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:54,303
Why "would have been"?

911
00:43:54,387 --> 00:43:56,512
He cancelled his appearance
at San Gennaro tomorrow.

912
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:03,178
What about Sansome?

913
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:05,053
Still appearing.

914
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:07,136
Hmm.

915
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,720
Motherfuck.

916
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:13,804
They pay me...
then they take the money back.

917
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,178
I can't leave.
They call Immigration...

918
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,387
It's a story being told
over and over

919
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,553
inside the ranks of
Eureka Building Solutions.

920
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:22,178
What had once looked like
a leader

921
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:23,470
in the industrial cleaning space

922
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:25,136
awaiting a huge valuation,

923
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,762
is now rumored to be
facing probes

924
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:27,887
by several regulatory agencies...

925
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:32,136
That is one powerful
piece of journalism.

926
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
It is.
And accurate.

927
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:36,261
It's gone up on the journal's
site by now,

928
00:44:36,345 --> 00:44:37,553
but I wanted to show it to you
personally, since, you know...

929
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:39,220
Sure.

930
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:42,178
It's wrong what that company did
to those workers.

931
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:45,720
They deserve their bread
and their roses too.

932
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,553
Tuk did good work here.

933
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:51,345
Went above and beyond.

934
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:54,470
He's complaining he still
smells like pine cleaner.

935
00:44:54,553 --> 00:44:56,011
Go give him an attaboy, Ben.

936
00:44:56,095 --> 00:44:58,720
Took me three years with you
to earn an attaboy.

937
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,387
Then fuck the attaboy.

938
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,345
Did his job. Got paid.
Move on.

939
00:45:02,428 --> 00:45:04,053
Your guy. Your call.

940
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:06,512
...I think I'll give him
an attaboy...

941
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:17,553
Move.

942
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:21,428
Ooh, a She-E-O.
Nice...

943
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:23,970
Uh, Axe...

944
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:25,887
I was trying to figure out
why you invested

945
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,220
in that dogshit
robotics company.

946
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:31,428
And if I fucked an idiot or
just someone really duplicitous.

947
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:32,762
Who told you?

948
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:34,679
Patriot Trust Bank.

949
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:36,428
Trying to drum up more business.

950
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:37,845
Definitely not switching primes.

951
00:45:42,345 --> 00:45:44,178
I heard you were denying
Taylor Mason leverage.

952
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:46,053
- I wanted the Street to know.

953
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:49,220
Now I see what's behind
EVERYTHING: Your wrath.

954
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:51,261
Which I am now going to blunt.

955
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:54,011
I'm gonna get Taylor
their leverage.

956
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,887
That is not what I would call
a proportionate response.

957
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,470
Because proportionate responses

958
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:01,595
don't work on
nation states like you.

959
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,011
I-I don't care if you lie
or obfuscate.

960
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,011
I care when you take profits
that should be mine.

961
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:09,053
Your cleaning company is worth

962
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,637
significantly more
than it was yesterday.

963
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,887
You know what kind of horrible
shit your competition was up to?

964
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,679
Of course I did.
And I would've beaten them,

965
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:17,428
in time, through proper
business practices.

966
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:18,887
And now you have.

967
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,845
And my piece would have been
worth even more

968
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,261
if I didn't cut you in.

969
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:23,679
Somehow I don't think
it would have

970
00:46:23,762 --> 00:46:25,095
gone up so quick if you hadn't.

971
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:27,011
- Really?
- Like I told you:

972
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:28,261
I'm a value add.

973
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:30,679
Give me back the shares, fucko.

974
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:33,512
I paid you handsomely.

975
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:35,553
You can buy me out
at current value.

976
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,512
Take the rest of the ride
yourself.

977
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:39,095
If you want to be rid of me
that badly.

978
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:41,887
Fine.
Half my shares back.

979
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,095
Well, as you said,
they're worth more now.

980
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:47,220
- So what price, uh...
- I get the profit on those.

981
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:48,929
You get only your initial
investment back on 'em.

982
00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:50,887
And I let you have a clear shot
at Taylor Mason.

983
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,637
Expensive...

984
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,345
But worth it.

985
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:55,970
Good. Done.

986
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:57,845
And we'll take the rest
of this ride together.

987
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:02,720
By the way, you got bigger.

988
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:05,929
You now have 4,200 new
and hard-working employees

989
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:07,470
ready to step aboard
your cleaning company.

990
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:09,553
Our company.

991
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:11,136
Now what?

992
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,303
You hungry?

993
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:13,970
I could eat.

994
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:20,011
Come in.

995
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:25,470
Donna didn't announce
the United States Attorney

996
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:27,512
for the Southern District.

997
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,970
She must've stepped out.

998
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:30,929
And that's when you stepped in.

999
00:47:31,011 --> 00:47:32,178
Ah.

1000
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:33,762
Always angle-shooting.

1001
00:47:33,845 --> 00:47:36,011
Shooting angles.
Important difference.

1002
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:37,595
You taught me that.

1003
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,553
- Should I go?
- Nah. I'm just getting warm.

1004
00:47:40,637 --> 00:47:42,804
- Ahh.
- I know what you're doing.

1005
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:44,387
And I'm here to tell you, don't.

1006
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,929
Don't do it.
Don't run.

1007
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:47,512
You didn't come to plead.

1008
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:49,178
You came to threaten.

1009
00:47:49,261 --> 00:47:51,345
So hit me with the back half.

1010
00:47:51,428 --> 00:47:54,136
I've been keeping out of
your way as much as possible.

1011
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,053
What do you call
reviewing all my old cases?

1012
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,512
My duty.
But like I said,

1013
00:47:58,595 --> 00:48:00,637
I've been holding back
the full power of my office.

1014
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,887
And I think you know
what that power is.

1015
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,178
What it can do.
So if you run,

1016
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:08,011
if you try to again put yourself
in a position of public trust

1017
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,595
and public authority,

1018
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,387
I will be forced to
let slip the dogs of war.

1019
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,887
Oh, that one
I definitely taught you.

1020
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,804
Yeah. That's the one
I used on Axelrod

1021
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:19,345
to get him to make
his first mistake.

1022
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,845
Sometimes you learn
from the worst.

1023
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:23,679
You didn't need to bring out
the needle to nudge me.

1024
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:26,845
I was running.
I am running.

1025
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:28,679
And when I win,

1026
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:32,136
I'm gonna roll over you
like it's Tiananmen Square.

1027
00:48:45,887 --> 00:48:48,136
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

1028
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,929
So,

1029
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,512
how's it work
at a quant overlay?

1030
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,178
Am I still gonna be an analyst
or...

1031
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:57,679
I'm sorry, man.
I can't do it.

1032
00:48:58,845 --> 00:49:00,220
Taylor blocked it.

1033
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:03,512
They're like the HAL 9000
or Rain Man.

1034
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:05,428
They're always playing
the percentages.

1035
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:07,053
Yeah, they're not.

1036
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:08,637
They see... everything.

1037
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,095
It's why they did
what they did with Axe,

1038
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:12,053
despite the risk.

1039
00:49:12,136 --> 00:49:15,804
Why they brought me here
and put a lot of faith in me...

1040
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:18,470
and why I gotta say no.

1041
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:19,804
You're blocking me?

1042
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:21,595
I think you're a great dude.

1043
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,053
If I was 13 again,

1044
00:49:23,136 --> 00:49:24,845
I would play Magic:
The Gathering with you,

1045
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,887
like, every day at lunch.

1046
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,053
But when you're a man, you gotta
put childish things away...

1047
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:32,053
at work.

1048
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,679
I got responsibilities now.

1049
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,553
Like you said, I'm a partner.

1050
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:42,929
You're a fucking asshole.

1051
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:44,470
You think you're better than me.

1052
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:46,553
I don't think
I'm better than you.

1053
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:47,970
I'm just better at my job.

1054
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:50,136
And I will definitely figure out

1055
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,220
what an appropriate baby gift is
and send one.

1056
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,095
You ready?

1057
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,470
You want me to go with you?
Or send Cook.

1058
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:22,011
No.
I have to face Grigor alone.

1059
00:50:22,095 --> 00:50:24,053
I hope he doesn't recognize
that I did it.

1060
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:25,929
What are the chances of that?

1061
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:27,595
If he does know,

1062
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:30,261
he's either going to
take them out or take me out.

1063
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:01,887
Garlic pepper and dill for you.

1064
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:06,845
Horseradish for me.

1065
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:19,136
I bring what to most
would be bad news.

1066
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,595
The Kozlovs, the men who
wanted to give you money,

1067
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,929
have had some reversals and
no longer have money to give.

1068
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:29,428
I suppose that is bad news.
For me.

1069
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:32,929
But for you...
these friends are overextended.

1070
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:35,220
Perhaps you could rescue them
or...

1071
00:51:35,303 --> 00:51:38,220
and I'm just thinking out loud
here... take them out.

1072
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:43,512
They are vulnerable.
Prone.

1073
00:51:43,595 --> 00:51:46,303
You could buy all their assets
for pennies on the dollar.

1074
00:51:46,387 --> 00:51:50,970
Your idea of fun is to dangle
my friends in front of Axe

1075
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:52,804
and watch him feed on them?

1076
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:54,845
I'm feeding them to you.

1077
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:57,762
Axe just cut 'em down
into digestible bites.

1078
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:00,970
This is a course of action

1079
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:05,470
only the nastiest of the Bratva
would take.

1080
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:09,720
It is also what I thought
you might say, and do.

1081
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,970
All this raises the question:
The Kozlovs,

1082
00:52:22,595 --> 00:52:25,387
how good friends
are they really?

1083
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:34,428
It turns out...

1084
00:52:34,512 --> 00:52:35,970
not so good.

1085
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:41,095
I accept this
most gracious gift.

1086
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:44,428
And in return, you hope what,

1087
00:52:44,512 --> 00:52:49,136
that the leverage you so crave
will now come directly from me?

1088
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,470
I think you like that Axe
has shut the banks to me.

1089
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:53,553
Because it makes me
more reliant on you.

1090
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,887
That ends now.

1091
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:59,261
Like the once great American
Bob Ritchie said:

1092
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:01,011
"You can knock me down
and watch me bleed./

1093
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,053
But you can't
keep no chains on me."

1094
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,887
The Kid Rock.

1095
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,720
I admire him greatly.

1096
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:09,512
I need independent leverage.

1097
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:13,637
You'll use your influence to
open the banks back up to me.

1098
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,053
This I do.

1099
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:25,679
"Only God Knows Why."

1100
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:03,720
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:12,428
Here. Can you just give me
one second?

1102
00:54:12,512 --> 00:54:13,679
Yeah.

1103
00:54:17,595 --> 00:54:19,553
So glad the fund's coming back
to Axe Capital,

1104
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:21,136
where it belongs.

1105
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,178
Somehow you always seem
to get what you want.

1106
00:54:27,512 --> 00:54:29,762
Pure luck.

1107
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,136
...from the scourge
of spreading disbelief.

1108
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,095
Free us from all evils

1109
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:41,720
and dangers that
threaten us from every side.

1110
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:44,929
May the faith for which
you sacrifice...

1111
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:48,428
You sure you're ready for
the glare of public life again?

1112
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:50,303
You're good at
working in the shadows.

1113
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,845
Don't worry about me, buddy boy.

1114
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:54,553
...the Lord our God
can rightfully expect

1115
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:57,428
from His servants.
Amen.

1116
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,428
Thank you, Father.

1117
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:03,762
Thank you, Father!

1118
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:07,762
I think there's one thing we can
all agree upon as New Yorkers.

1119
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:10,178
Someone always wants something
from ya.

1120
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,178
Someone's always hocking ya.

1121
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:15,637
'Help me. Support me.
Endorse me.'

1122
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,637
Well, maybe you've noticed.

1123
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,512
I don't do a lot of endorsing.

1124
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:23,053
Until someone like the next guy
comes along.

1125
00:55:23,136 --> 00:55:26,011
Then I'm practically
hocking him.

1126
00:55:26,095 --> 00:55:29,553
I've seen the good he's done to
clean up the streets of Gotham.

1127
00:55:29,637 --> 00:55:32,595
And I can't wait to see
what he's gonna do

1128
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:34,303
for the rest of New York State.

1129
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:37,845
I give you your next
Attorney General...

1130
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:40,720
Chuck Rhoades!

1131
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:49,220
- Wonderful. Thank you.
- You bet.

1132
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:51,136
- Thank you.
- All right.

1133
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,679
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1134
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:55,387
I am so proud to be here
with you tonight.

1135
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,595
In fact,
"I am chomping at the bit

1136
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:00,637
to be your next
Attorney General"!

1137
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,679
- Yes!

1138
00:56:02,762 --> 00:56:05,387
Okay.

1139
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,428
Yeah!

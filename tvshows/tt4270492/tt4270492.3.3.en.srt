00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,359
Yeah, well,
not at the moment.

164
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,445
But I can advise close friends
on what they ought to do

165
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,363
with money
they've been entrusted with.

166
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,907
Let me guess
what those funds are.

167
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,993
Things like Ionosphere
or Victor Mateo's?

168
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,369
Those are excellent choices.

169
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,747
I can't do it, Axe.
I can't even think of doing it.

170
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,541
If I know that you're that close
to them, others do, too.

171
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,627
My board of directors
wouldn't allow that.

172
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,129
You got to know
if I got my eye on the money,

173
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,090
that's the best chance it has
to grow for your members.

174
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,717
You can't leave it behind.

175
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,261
I was that way, too,
when I first left the job.

176
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,722
- But then...
- Then what?

177
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,058
You found other interests,
deeper pursuits?

178
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,518
Learned the difference
between Warhol and Peter Max

179
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,354
by spending weekends
at the museum?

180
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,356
I grew up in Westbeth,
for fuck's sake.

181
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,149
I have always known one was
shit, the other a genius.

182
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,109
But, yes, all that.

183
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,154
Life changed.

184
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,282
Did it solve anything
for you?

185
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,077
Did it make
the transition easier?

186
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,870
Come on, man.

187
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,415
I saw the look in your eyes when
you had that gun in your hand.

188
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,708
You'll always miss it.

189
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,920
With every breath I draw.
But I had to move on.

190
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,005
As do you.

191
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,548
You knew it was coming.
I didn't.

192
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,677
You did your 20.
You planned for it.

193
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,846
And you had something to do
with your talents.

194
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,681
You went to B-school
at night,

195
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,183
became a trustee
of the pension fund.

196
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,894
You became a rich man
for the first time in your life,

197
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,270
but these things don't last.

198
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,731
You know, you have a few down
years, and you could

199
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,316
- get yourself voted out.
- Axe...

200
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,860
Look, what if I
could put you into a fund

201
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,196
where there was no hint
of a connection to me

202
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,280
but was one
I could guarantee?

203
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,034
If I could give you the 2.2 bil
to manage, I would.

204
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,244
I can't.

205
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,038
The way that people look
at police these days,

206
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,119
we can't afford even the whiff
of impropriety.

207
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,551
[Aimee Mann's "Goose Snow Cone"
plays]

208

<i>♪ Lookin' into the face
of the goose snow cone ♪</i>

209
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,516
You might want to come home
late tomorrow night.

210
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,767
Huh?

211
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,602
Your father.

212
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,564
I told you he wants
to see the kids.

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,316
You did, and I told you
I wasn't interested.

214
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,986
Which is why you should stay
late in the office.

215
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,031
Return any and all phone calls
you've been ducking.

216
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,490
I'll text when he's leaving.

217
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,993
I don't duck.
I return all my calls every day.

218
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,244
Do people really do that,
not return calls?

219
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,288
Avoidance usually.

220
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,539
Most people don't want
to give bad news

221
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,458
or admit they don't know
the answer.

222
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,626
- What answer?
- To whatever the caller wants.

223
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,669
Most people aren't the final
authority, but they don't want

224
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,963
to let on someone else
is making the decisions.

225
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,132
Not me.

226
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,342
No. Not you.

227
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,304
Except about whether my own
father can cross my door frame.

228
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,599
He's a grandfather, too.

229
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,186
And the kids shouldn't be
deprived of him.

230
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,396
- "Can I get back to you?"
- What?

231
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,315
Why don't they just return
or take the call and say that?

232
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,524
"Can I get back to you?"

233
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,694
They can.
They don't want to.

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,822
Well, I do, and I want to come
home when I want to come home.

235
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,449
I'm trying
to keep this light.

236
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,825
I do not want an argument.

237
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,078
But there's reasons
I don't want him here,

238
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,449
and I don't want him
seeing you.

239
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,168
Reasons it won't do either
one of us any good to go into,

240
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,086
I promise.

241
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,791
Okay.

242
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,635
I'll bring the kids to him.

243
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,220
Drop them off so they can see
him, and you're clear.

244
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,889
I'll pick them up after.

245
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,801
Okay.

246
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,191
The robots have come.

247
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,535
I got in this racket
a generation too late,

248
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,994
just like Tony Soprano.

249
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,454
Yep, this is how it ends.

250
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,372
Civilization?

251
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,374
Uh-huh. Just like
in <i>Tommyknockers.</i>

252
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,293
First it makes things better
for you. Then it destroys you.

253
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,420
This is how computers
take over the world.

254
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,422
<i>Tommyknockers</i> was aliens,
not computers.

255
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,341
Yeah, but I have heard
about other funds

256
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,593
that bring in quants,
and it doesn't sound good.

257
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,595
Once they get the algo
really going...

258
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,596
They get 'em measuring
everything we do,

259
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,765
get us competing
against it.

260
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,350
Who can beat
a fucking computer?

261
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,645
Eventually, the only human left
is the guy feeding the machines.

262
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,814
No computer can get
the kind of info I can

263
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,274
or know what to do with it
the way I do,

264
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,317
so buck the fuck up.

265
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,027
No fear!

266
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,280
Bucking. Absolutely.

267
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,739
Fuck fear.

268
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,866
Really?

269
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,785
Nope.
Scared shitless.

270
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,662
- Me, too.
- Yeah. I'm totally scared.

271
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,414
Pussies.

272
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,208
I take it you've looked
at the object on the table.

273
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,835
Cardboard?

274
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,794
Yes.

275
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,963
You can see the folds
and the tabs.

276
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,381
Fit the pieces into a box,

277
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,128
signal when you're done,
and we'll begin the interview.

278
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,814
I got her ingredients

279
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,442
and followed her recipe
and process to the letter.

280
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,319
- You think you nailed it?
- You tell me.

281
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,653
Because it's
fucking important

282
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,821
that when Raul
bites into this thing,

283
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,699
he is carried away
on sweet reminiscences

284
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,492
of our visit
to Ann's Snack Bar

285
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,864
and the Killer Mike
<i>R. A. P. Music</i> release party.

286
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,668
Hmm.

287
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,717
Piss-poor effort, Ryan.

288
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,969
Miss Ann's spinning
in her grave right now,

289
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,095
may she rest in peace.

290
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,222
It's not good?

291
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,390
Her sister told me
exactly what to do...

292
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,975
Oh, no, it's good.

293
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,602
But this thing needs
to transport the man.

294
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,021
If you can't fucking do it,

295
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,689
we'll fly her sister up here

296
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,650
with a vat
of their original cooking oil,

297
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,568
even if we have to go down there
and kidnap her ourselves.

298
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,445
Easy, fella.
Ryan, keep at it.

299
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,401
This is very close.

300
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,118
What the fuck, Wags?

301
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,412
I've been thinking
about your situation.

302
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,873
And I realize it could be
my situation, too.

303
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,874
If this thing cascades

304
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,126
and the government takes
all of your shit,

305
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,253
I'm next.

306
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,546
And then I'll be
in the same boat as you are.

307
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,548
Let's be honest,
if that comes to pass,

308
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,384
you'll be in a much
fucking smaller boat.

309
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,879
Don't I know it.

310
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,145
It's actually really good.

311
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,147
I might have overreacted
there.

312
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,441
Yeah, so, again,
what the fuck?

313
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,193
The quants.

314
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,237
Ahh.

315
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,989
Since 1602,

316
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,157
when the
Dutch East India Company

317
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,493
first offered shares
to the public,

318
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,412
smart, highly trained
mathematicians

319
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,122
have tried, without success,
to solve that market.

320
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,959
And today, Taylor begins the
interviews to hire their own.

321
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,918
<i>Our</i> own.

322
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,586
You know
how I feel about that.

323
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,671
I do.

324
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,257
Billy Beane never won
a World Series.

325
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,258
This isn't baseball.

326
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,261
Then why didn't you put
quants in place before?

327
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,178
Maybe I just
didn't get to it.

328
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,223
Maybe I didn't feel
like I needed to.

329
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,516
But Taylor might.

330
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,309
And if they want to do it,
it's your job to help them.

331
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,223
Fine.

332
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,610
Damn.

333
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,025
Apologize to Chef Ryan
on your way out.

334
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,916
Sorry to keep calling,

335
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,794
but you know I need to speak
to all the major shareholders,

336
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,672
understand how and when the
company got on Axelrod's radar.

337
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,466
Oh, I love talking
about this.

338
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,967
What else is on your pad?

339
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,387
Shall we, uh, relive my divorce
and the day the music died?

340
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,180
I want to put Axelrod away.

341
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,474
I imagine
you want the same thing.

342
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,851
I want this done
and out of my life.

343
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,519
His conviction
sets up my civil suit,

344
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,688
so let's just cut to the...

345
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,898
what happens after this?

346
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,734
You go over what I said
with your boss,

347
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,777
decide if you want
to interview me again.

348
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,071
I don't want to drag
this out,

349
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,072
and I don't want to get
all invested.

350
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,200
I've seen Axelrod wriggle free
plenty of times.

351
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,076
- I'm gonna stop that.
- We'll see.

352
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,536
Let's just do this
with your boss.

353
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,662
Okay?
You, me, and Dake.

354
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,832
I'll come down to your place
tomorrow or the next day.

355
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
One time, with feeling.

356
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,055
You know, back before Texas
was civilized,

357
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,264
if you were a Ranger

358
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,351
and one of your compatriots fell
at the hands of a rustler,

359
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,105
you'd bring that rustler in dead
if you brought him in at all.

360
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,398
Might just make use
of some rope and a tree.

361
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,775
Sure.

362
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,486
And people used to shit
outdoors

363
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,320
in the middle of the night

364
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,489
so as not to stink up
the house.

365
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,366
And then we found
a better way.

366
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,784
I'm not so sure they did.

367
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,495
That walk to the outhouse
in the freezing cold

368
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,455
made a man nut up... literally.

369
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,623
But we ain't talking about

370
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,332
squatting in
the dark here, Chuck.

371
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,209
Nossir.

372
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,836
It's probably
that rustler stuff

373
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,505
that made you ask me to cancel
my morning and come here.

374
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,673
That it is.

375
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,217
José Lugo.
Convicted felon.

376
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,220
Killed a federal prison guard
when his back was turned.

377
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,014
Makes it a federal matter.
<i>Our</i> matter.

378
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,183
Sounds like it might.

379
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,269
Might is a New Yorker's word.

380
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:12,936
I don't want to hear it.

381
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,689
It's a lawyer's word, sir.

382
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,983
I'll need to examine
the facts.

383
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,776
Don't condescend to me,
Chuck.

384
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,070
We went to the same kind
of college,

385
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,072
same damn law school,
clerked in the same offices,

386
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,907
read the same books
on ethical justice

387
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,703
by guys like Rawls
and Dworkin.

388
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,039
"The suppression of liberty is
likely to always be irrational."

389
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,626
I even bought in
to that crap for a while.

390
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,711
But a man has to grow
into who he is,

391
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,921
and who the fuck I am

392
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,549
is a man that's not gonna allow
a prisoner to shank a guard.

393
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,260
And neither are you.

394
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,971
I'll make sure
my office looks into it.

395
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,014
Believe it has.

396
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,391
Believe it's dragged its feet
in prosecuting.

397
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,559
Believe that ends now.

398
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,853
Are you picking my cases
for me, General?

399
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,439
Oh, I would never do that.

400
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,066
I'm merely giving you
continued guidance

401
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,276
on the types of matters
we are interested

402
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,863
in seeing brought to justice
under the current regime.

403
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,074
I never liked the idea
of a regime in power

404
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,284
in this country.

405
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,704
But you did drop all the cases
that didn't fit the agenda.

406
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,789
I did.

407
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,793
So now you're free
to go after the ones that do.

408
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,921
Thanks for stopping by
this morning.

409
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,005
Can I look forward

410
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,467
to seeing you again soon,
General?

411
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,552
I love all my children
the same, Chuck.

412
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,638
But the Sovereign District
of New York

413
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,556
is the first among equals.

414
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,099
[chuckles]

415
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,851
Something I learned clerking

416
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,938
for the kind of New York judge
you revere so much is,

417
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,227
you don't let your firstborn
fuck up his Haftarah portion.

418
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,463
I looked in
on your candidate.

419
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,050
I know what he's supposed to be
doing with that box.

420
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,093
He's not doing it.

421
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,928
Maybe we move
to the verbal portion.

422
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,846
Maybe we just cancel
at this point.

423
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,140
- Why would I do that?
- Because you've studied

424
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,434
the Flash Crash of 2010,
and you know that "quant"

425
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,395
is just another word for
"wild fucking guess... with math."

426
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,190
"Quant" is another word for
"systemized, ordered thinking

427
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,733
represented in an algorithmic
approach to trading."

428
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,110
Just remember:

429
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,614
Billy Beane never won
a World Series.

430
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,949
If I had a few more minutes...

431
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,154
Forget it.
Tell me why you're here.

432
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,539
I combine the human edge
with the quant edge.

433
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,125
My system mimics
human peak performance.

434
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,334
Go on.

435
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,254
It's a decision pattern algo
me and my team are developing.

436
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,047
It'll be able
to examine data sets

437
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,383
and mirror your own trade logic
in its executions.

438
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,052
At Axe Capital, we support
people from all cultures,

439
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
but when you talk to me,
it better be in fucking English.

440
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,767
I can model
Taylor's trading patterns.

441
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,061
Reproduce them.

442
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,187
At ten times the speed.

443
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,064
My trading patterns
are imperfect.

444
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,275
They're pretty fucking good.

445
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,402
Yes, but I don't want
a pretty fucking good algo.

446
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,363
- That's what I've been saying.
- No, but I start from there.

447
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,824
The way that you would imitate
Taylor's brain

448
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,368
- is by studying it, right?
- Yes, modeling, as I said.

449
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,537
He wants to steal
your fucking brainwaves,

450
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,414
like a witch doctor.

451
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,369
You see that, right?

452
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,796
Yes, actually, I do.

453
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,089
I don't need something
that thinks like me.

454
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,800
I need something
that thinks better.

455
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,380
Thanks for coming.

456
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,815
Our master came calling again
with a new assignment.

457
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,652
José Lugo.

458
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,111
That sound familiar?

459
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,073
It does. It's an inmate
who killed a guard.

460
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,116
Mm-hmm.

461
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,412
Uh, it was Connerty's case,
but he did not pursue charges.

462
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,290
We may not have
that luxurious option.

463
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,084
Find out why.

464
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,834
On it.

465
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,416
[horns honking]

466
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,261
Go for the Recession Special,

467
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,179
even though
the recession's over.

468
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,765
You know what?
I'm not even sure

469
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,017
which recession
they're referring to.

470
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,477
They all end, though.

471
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,187
Yours can, too.

472
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,272
And two dogs and a drink
at that price

473
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,399
is a hell of a deal.

474
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,316
You done?

475
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,652
'Cause I'm just
getting ready to go.

476
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,195
Civil suit.
Reimbursement and damages.

477
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,365
I help EDNY hang
a guilty verdict on you,

478
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,867
and my case is
the Dream Team versus Cuba.

479
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,285
Even if you slither
out of the criminal courts,

480
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,080
I hammer you
like the Goldmans did O. J.

481
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,666
Ira, if that felon found
a way not to pay a penny,

482
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,501
what do you think
I'm gonna do?

483
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,379
Besides, can you really afford
to wait that long?

484
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,547
Better question,

485
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,675
will that beautiful
and sweet fiancée of yours?

486
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,302
Oh, you're following me,
you sick motherfucker?

487
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,929
[Counter Guy]
What do you want?

488
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,349
Uh, two Recessions,
and what juice are you having?

489
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,892
Oh, too soon?

490
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,222
Couple Cokes.

491
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,189
Bobby, I'm not some sucker

492
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,192
who's just gonna play along with
whatever game you got running.

493
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,069
I'm taking you to court,
guns up.

494
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,988
I'm gonna win
a fat judgment,

495
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,741
and then, because I got
nothing else, thanks to you,

496
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,159
I'm gonna make it
my sole purpose in life

497
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,995
to stick to you
like Lester Hayes

498
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,290
until you've paid it willingly
just to get me to go away.

499
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,916
So you take your hot dogs
and shove 'em up your ass,

500
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,086
lengthwise.

501
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,124
That's not very open-minded
of you, Ira.

502
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,424
You should be more open-minded!

503
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,100
[Mafee] <i>I'm not in a full panic.</i>

504
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,687
When I get a full panic
going, I, well...

505
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,397
You can say it,
whatever it is, in here.

506
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,734
I... There's things
I'd say to other people

507
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,068
without a second's thought,

508
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,612
but you listen so closely.

509
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,071
That's my job.

510
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,908
But it's like you see inside
the best parts of me,

511
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,534
and it makes me
want to be better.

512
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,412
Mafee: what happens
when you panic?

513
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,408
Butt sweat.

514
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,417
And now?

515
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,669
Yeah, a little. The whole idea
that we could all be replaced?

516
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,548
If that didn't make your butt
sweat, you wouldn't be human.

517
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,301
Not <i>your</i> butt. I would never
even think about your butt.

518
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,386
It's not like I stare at it
when you walk by.

519
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,888
I barely know you have one.

520
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,097
Jesus.

521
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,558
This quant thing
has me all fucked up.

522
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,309
You think I'm gross now.

523
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,770
No, I don't.
I think you're...

524
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,772
[Ben Kim] I don't think
I can take this.

525
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,024
My mother begged me
to code at Stanford,

526
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,609
but I went
for Applied Mathematics,

527
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,445
which seemed, you know,
smarter then, but now not only

528
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,531
is she going to be proven right,
but I'm going to be replaced

529
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,158
by people who listened
to their mothers

530
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,243
- and learned to code.
- Okay.

531
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,412
You, we,
are not being replaced.

532
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,582
Will there be augmentation
of some kind? Yes.

533
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,294
Will it ask you, us,
to raise our game? Yes.

534
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,208
But we have to want that
for this place, don't we?

535
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,092
- No.
- No.

536
00:22:59,128 --> 00:22:59,884
[stammers]

537
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,302
Go.

538
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,972
Express your fears to Taylor.

539
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:04,592
Let them tell you, Mafee.

540
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,777
[Chuck] <i>Although it's lovely
to see you, Bryan,</i>

541
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,239
there was no need to come in
from your Rumspringa.

542
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,825
Much as I dig
getting my Amish on with Dake,

543
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,327
I did have to come.
José Lugo.

544
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,329
You can't prosecute
this one, Chuck.

545
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,998
I went full Gil Grissom
on this case,

546
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,666
and there was no way
to charge the kid with murder.

547
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:35,503
Body of a prison guard
would indicate otherwise.

548
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,213
Lugo was being held awaiting
charges on a drug offense.

549
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,632
Not the end of the world.

550
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,009
He couldn't make bail,

551
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,927
so they stuck him at MCC
for two months.

552
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,764
Day one, this guard started
in on Lugo, and he went beast.

553
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,725
The kid ended up in the
infirmary a dozen times.

554
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,603
Orbital ridge fracture,
teeth, internal bleeding,

555
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,938
splintered wood
in the rectum, name it.

556
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,274
You just did.

557
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,110
I've archived 25 prisoner
statements backing it all up.

558
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,487
And what about
the other guards?

559
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,615
They refused to go
on record.

560
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,576
But that in itself
tells the whole story,

561
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,202
which is this:

562
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,245
José Lugo

563
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,207
is the kind of person
we are here to protect.

564
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,335
[sighs]

565
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,045
I'm asking you:
please don't.

566
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,212
Don't do this.

567
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,626
Don't prosecute the case.

568
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,727
Didn't take much legwork

569
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,064
to put Mr. Slayton as one
of your sports-betting clients

570
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,149
who did his part
at your behest.

571
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,943
Who were you working for?

572
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,320
We don't take orders.
We give 'em.

573
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,363
[scoffs]

574
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,698
I see. So, the full weight
of these felonies

575
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,408
should be earmarked for you two?

576
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,410
- And who are you now, sugar pop?
- I'm the one

577
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,079
that's about to
pistol-whip you.

578
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,748
Guys, you know how it works.
Name the power behind you.

579
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,417
He's the guy that deserves
to be sitting here, not you.

580
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,503
We have no idea
who you're referring to.

581
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,089
Who's paying for him?

582
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,633
- I'm guessing it's the same guy.
- You can't ask that.

583
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,052
You don't think
we can afford a good lawyer?

584
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:06,761
We own a nightclub.

585
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,721
Nightclub?
Your pisshole?

586
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,890
We just got one
of those digital jukeboxes.

587
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,476
Give me Axelrod,
the rest goes away.

588
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,479
Anything else, I drop
this whole thing on you.

589
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,524
You become the masterminds
at the head of a conspiracy

590
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,276
seeking to sabotage
and manipulate companies

591
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,778
and financial markets.

592
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,696
We're masterminds.

593
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,489
Masterminds is good.
I like masterminds.

594
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,866
Put us down
for masterminds.

595
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,618
Gentlemen, I suggest we have
a private conversation.

596
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,328
You know,
that's a good idea, boys.

597
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,664
Go talk amongst yourselves.

598
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,500
You Inwood types never could
learn to shut your mouths.

599
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,835
Sorry?

600
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,962
Oh, we used to drove over
from Fordham and roll your kind

601
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,296
just 'cause
it was easy pickings.

602
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,215
That's funny. We used to ride
over to the Bronx

603
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,634
and beat the shit out of Fordham
fruits for morning exercise.

604
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,802
Can't believe we missed you.

605
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,470
Must have been hiding
in the corner.

606
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,514
I'm gonna ask
that this conversation stop.

607
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,725
Why don't you stop?
Let the men finish talking.

608
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,061
Are you two sawed-off pricks
including yourselves

609
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,980
in that category?

610
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,441
You don't have shit on us
but some dink's word.

611
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,318
You had more than that, this
wouldn't be a conversation.

612
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,571
So if you got the sack,
make your move.

613
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,902
Otherwise,
we got kegs to change.

614
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:15,038
Next time I see you boys, I'll
watch 'em slap the cuffs on.

615
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,326
Then I guess
we won't be seeing each other.

616
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,212
[doors slam]

617

[exhales sharply]

618
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,692
I used to love visiting museums
when I was a young man,

619
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,820
back before I could afford
the paintings.

620
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,575
Now I'd rather look at 'em
on my walls.

621
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,744
I'm selling all my shit.

622
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,871
You were right
at the car auction.

623
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,247
I am barely hanging on.

624
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,708
Redemptions are starting
to hit in a big way.

625
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,461
[laughs]
It doesn't matter anyway.

626
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,838
I never knew what was any good
about my collection.

627
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,256
I just bought what
the art advisor told me to.

628
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,176
That's one way to go.

629
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,136
I can't imagine
what I sound like.

630
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,808
You sound like a guy who's had
a rough couple of years.

631
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,768
Happens to everyone.

632
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,229
I'll have to shutter soon.

633
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,898
What are you walking with?

634
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,693
40.

635
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,403
I guess I can live on that.

636
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:34,200
Can you?

637
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,785
Got the city apartment,

638
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,412
the Hamptons place,
Beaver Creek.

639
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,583
The debt service and running
the properties is ten a year.

640
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,878
You'll have to start
your new family office.

641
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,630
There's a lease,
an analyst or two,

642
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,131
an assistant, an accountant.

643
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,925
You got private school,

644
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,927
your daughter's horse,
you got charity.

645
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,054
You can't dip below
two a year on that,

646
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,556
or you lose your board seats

647
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,432
and your wife loses
all her friends.

648
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,476
You can forget flying
wheels up from now on.

649
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,603
You're sucking it up
in commercial.

650
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,190
You'll hold on to your driver
until it kills you, but...

651
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,316
soon, he'll be gone, too.

652
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,521
Fuck! I'm broke.

653
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,116
What would you give
to get it back?

654
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:19,871
Your status, all your money,
the whole thing.

655
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,247
Anything.

656
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,251
My leg. My spleen.
An inch off my dick.

657
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,920
Well, then this is the best day
of your new life,

658
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,464
'cause I got a line
on an orphaned two billion

659
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,507
looking for a home,

660
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,176
and I can get you in the room
to pitch for it.

661
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,215
All you have to do
is say yes.

662
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,435
[typing]

663
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:42,930
[knocks]
Got a minute?

664
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,858
Roughly two minutes.

665
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,569
The quants, why?

666
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,905
Why now?
What if we didn't?

667
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,615
What if we kept things
the same?

668
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,617
Think of the Pulaski Academy
Bruins, Mafee.

669
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,701
You read me?

670
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,120
The high school football team
that never punts?

671
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,581
Right.
They were pretty solid before,

672
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,082
so why'd they do that?

673
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,959
Because the coach deduced
that, statistically,

674
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,503
they'd be better off
using all four downs on offense

675
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,005
and not giving the ball back.

676
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,717
Yes. And because the coach
wanted championships.

677
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,802
- So it's about edge.
- Always.

678
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,679
ETFs. They sucked the dumb money
out of the market.

679
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,641
Trillions have poured
into them.

680
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,392
That was our edge,
and our edge is gone.

681
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,393
When I look around now,

682
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,938
it's only other killers
like us staring back.

683
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,856
But there are a bunch of quants
already out there on the market,

684
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,191
already working that edge.

685
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,693
That's why ours
has to be better.

686
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,946
Okay. Okay.

687
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,781
Look, people down on the floor
thought this was about

688
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,741
wholesale firing
and replacement.

689
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,160
So I see the wisdom
in adding.

690
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,324
But otherwise, are we good?

691
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,960
I don't know. Are we?
Are you?

692
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,628
Are you running
all four downs,

693
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,463
playing every play
like it's your last?

694
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,507
Is your mouth guard always in,
chin strap always buckled?

695
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,628
- If that's you, we're good.
- [door opens]

696
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:05,929
[door opens]

697
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,235
Please describe the nature
of your approach to the market

698
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,403
and how your algorithms
serve that end.

699
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,738
Boring.

700
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,157
What the fuck kind of way is
that to kick off an interview?

701
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,493
I'm rejecting the premise
or flipping the script.

702
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,828
<i>I</i> should interview <i>you.</i>

703
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,788
For what,
the school newspaper?

704
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,249
[chuckles] Yassss, Queen.
Good one, but no.

705
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,584
I've got offers from half
the funds on the Street

706
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,294
and several tech firms out West,

707
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,504
and they pay guarantees,
not bonuses.

708
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,799
Now, don't get me wrong.
I've heard about Taylor Mason.

709
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,926
Love to see if you live up to
the hype, but I've got options.

710
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,131
So, let me put this
in your language:

711
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,766
What's in it for <i>moi?</i>

712
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,894
You Patrick Bateman/Bud Fox
hybrid wannabe.

713
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,812
He was doing Spader
in <i>Wall Street.</i>

714
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,732
But I don't care
about his insulting tone.

715
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,233
I only care about his ability

716
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,652
to think clearly and rationally
under pressure.

717
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,319
You're not thinking
of hiring him?

718
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,488
She's no fool.

719
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,073
No.

720
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,951
But, sadly, though you may have
a genius-level I. Q.,

721
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,328
you have no control
over your emotional state.

722
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,247
That's why
you're lashing out in here,

723
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,458
defensive,
allowing your rage at yourself

724
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,960
to manifest in boorish,
childish behavior.

725
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,671
He couldn't figure out the box,
so he did that to it.

726
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,424
Then he let the rest of his
bullshit cloud his thinking.

727
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,843
He has no idea why he had
to resort to brute force,

728
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,511
so he doesn't get
to work here.

729
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,847
Take your feet off the table

730
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,052
and get the fuck
out of our office.

731
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,189
So, are we done
with this now?

732
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,232
No.

733
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,777
Let me remind you.
August 2007.

734
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,321
The Dow crashed 400 points
because of a coding error.

735
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,198
That was more
than ten years ago, which,

736
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,076
even with the breakdown in
Moore's Law, is more like 100.

737
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,410
Feels like yesterday to me.

738
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,033
We need to be thinking about
tomorrow. So we keep going.

739
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,171
Warden, I need you to say
that if the guard were alive,

740
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,672
you'd fire him for abuse

741
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,591
and that the kid is innocent.

742
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,927
My hands are clean,
my conscience clean enough.

743
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,762
I'm not gonna take you
off the hook

744
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,514
and hang myself there
instead.

745
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,557
Well, I didn't devote
my life to the law

746
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,017
to prosecute innocent men.

747
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,061
Nor I to oversee
their incarceration,

748
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,854
but once they send them
to me...

749
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,232
Yep, you do your level best.

750
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,985
Currently, there are 400 cases
filed against you by inmates,

751
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,613
which could suggest
your level best

752
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,906
[laughs] isn't very good.

753
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,990
Almost all of them
pro forma.

754
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,535
Their beds are too hard.
Their food sucks.

755
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,954
I get it.

756
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,997
The cases
are filed against you

757
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,375
in your official capacity
as warden

758
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,503
and, therefore,
defended by me

759
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,548
in my official capacity
as U. S. Attorney.

760
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,091
And you're gonna throw them
if I don't play ball?

761
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,052
I wouldn't even know
how to throw a case,

762
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,846
how to lose on purpose.

763
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,056
Normally, I would knock
these nuisances away

764
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,144
like a windshield wiper
during a light rain.

765
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,688
But what if I just...
slowed down...

766
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,440
let 'em build up...

767
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,609
cloud your field of vision,

768
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,779
the drops becoming a deluge.

769
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,574
But if I say
the kid was tortured

770
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,909
and it was
the guard's fault...

771
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,327
Then I fight those cases off

772
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,413
as if they were against me
personally.

773
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,748
- You can't think I'd testify.
- No.

774
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,791
No.

775
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,502
There's a young journalist
I know.

776
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,296
He'll take your testimony.

777
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,298
Stalwart, ambitious fellow

00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,174
branching out from finance

779
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,218
into what we might call
national news.

780
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,511
He can protect your name

781
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,513
if you give him
enough corroboration

782
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,223
to make his story
undeniable.

783
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,100
Thank you, Warden.

784
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,103
Happy to do the right thing.

against Willie Mosconi.

790
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,121
You were gonna sandbag me.

791
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,997
Let me win a few games,

792
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,667
then double the bet,
then run me down.

793
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,211
I didn't even bring
my own cue.

794
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,463
If you had,
maybe I'd have gone for it,

795
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,256
counting on
that special vanity

796
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,133
that a man
with a custom cue has.

797
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,551
Once you started chalking up,
no chance.

798
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,137
[laughs]

799
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,390
Oh.

800
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,636
Thanks, Chef Ryan.

801
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,894
Mm.

802
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,313
Last time I had a burger
this good...

803
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,650
Remember that time down in
Atlanta, with Killer Mike?

804
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,653
[laughs]

805
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,280
That was right before
I gave Axe Capital

806
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,027
that extra half-billion
from my fund.

807
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,162
[chuckles]
Good anchoring technique.

808
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,705
No.

809
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,499
But no matter how tasty,
I'm not sure

810
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,834
I can give the same treatment
to Michael Panay.

811
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,837
There is no linkage to me, so
that solves the first problem.

812
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,298
But he will listen to me

813
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,717
and invest
exactly as I instruct,

814
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,344
so that solves problem two.

815
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,222
Yeah, but he's on a bad run,
Axe. He's bleeding out.

816
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,056
But you got a surgeon
stepping in.

817
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,517
I know that,
but my board can't.

818
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,227
I got to hard-sell
this guy to them.

819
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,019
Well, get Panay
to convince them.

820
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,188
Get him
in front of that board.

821
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,983
You sure? It's hard
to defend numbers like his.

822
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,026
He's presentable.

823
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,320
Let's get him in here
and see. Panay!

824
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:13,075
Looks like I'm not
the only sandbagger in here.

825
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:13,568
Mike,

826
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,786
this is Raul.

827
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,205
- He's gonna take you in.
- Not unless you can tell me

828
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,124
why you ran your fund
into the ground.

829
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,667
They'll expect some answers.

830
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,043
He'll have answers.

831
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,671
Just show strength and pitch
them your best three ideas,

832
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:26,880
which I'll give you.

833
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,674
And if anybody steps
in your face...

834
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,509
Kick 'em in the cock.

835
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,885
[chuckles] Okay.

836
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,971
I'll wear sharp shoes.

837
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,056
[Axe] All right.

838
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,219
I'll let you know
when we've booked a meeting.

839
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,736
So?

840
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,070
I might be able to sell him.

841
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,734
But why would I?

842
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,241
[cellphone vibrates]

843
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:16,675
I must be out
of my fucking mind.

844
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,184
Oh, I disagree.

845
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,936
I think you're showing some
real nuance in your thinking,

846
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,272
which is what is required
since you have suffered

847
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,441
at the hands
of some very devious opponents

848
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,734
in Rhoades and his father.

849
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,152
Yeah, well, I'm here
for some goddamned reason,

850
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,942
so, uh, what is it
you want to propose?

851
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,994
That I acquire your virtually
worthless shares in Ice Juice

852
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,789
for considerably over market.

853
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,333
30 million dollars.

854
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,211
A firm called Ionosphere
would paper the transaction.

855
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,255
In return,
you forgo your civil suit

856
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,633
and refuse
to testify against me.

857
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,176
You'll give my people
a statement

858
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,806
laying out how Rhoades did
what he did.

859
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,976
Your best friend sold you
down the river for nothing.

860
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,230
He's not worth saving.

861
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,816
I'm willing to pay you
30 million to tell the truth.

862
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,820
It's just a transaction to you,
this whole thing?

863
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,405
Numbers move
from here to there,

864
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,074
and emotions
are smoothed out,

865
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,410
like ice under a Zamboni.

866
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,704
No, I understand what's fair.

867
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,331
And I know
how to make a deal.

868
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,579
So, take your life back.

869
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,716
Gary?

870
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,443
While you're at it,
go ahead and pick one.

871
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,862
On my tab.

872
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,983
Why should she
have to suffer?

873
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,450
[door opens, closes]

874
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,004
How does it work?
What am I missing?

875
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,214
We'll get back to that.

876
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,176
Résumé says you were at NASA,
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

877
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,387
20 years. The most rewarding job
a data scientist could ask for.

878
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,347
And now finance. Why?

879
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,058
The stock market
is representation

880
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,934
of the psychology
of the entire world

881
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,270
at any given moment.

882
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,273
Data is an exact thumbprint
of that moment.

883
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,859
I get to know what the world
is thinking and feeling

884
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,152
and what it will do next.

885
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,447
What a refreshing,
excellent answer.

886
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,406
Yes.

887
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,074
Would you be willing
to let me test it

888
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,743
so I can observe it
under market conditions?

889
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,953
Of course. I'll give you
access for the day,

890
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,866
and you'll be able
to see how it works.

891
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,917
It doesn't fit together,
right?

892
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,126
You're testing the ability
to realize that,

893
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,545
the confidence to admit it?

894
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,083
Outstanding.

895
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,055
Connerty called.

896
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:03,847
He saw the article.

897
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,933
A lot of people
have seen it.

898
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,268
They found a good photo
of the kid.

899
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,187
Looks innocent, no?

900
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,189
Handsome, for sure.

901
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,774
Even better.

902
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,442
Can't make us proceed now.

903
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,196
If you had been forced
to prosecute,

904
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,067
could you have?

905
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,786
Honestly, I don't know
that I have it in me.

906
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,075
Glad we won't have to
find out.

907
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,292
[Connerty] <i>Well, now that
we're all here...</i>

908
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,588
As you both know, I had a large
ownership stake in Ice Juice.

909
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,091
It was to be worth a great deal
at one point.

910
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,425
Turned out to be worth
substantially less.

911
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,506
Thanks to Axelrod's
involvement.

912
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,309
Uh, I can't and won't speak
to the actions of Bobby Axelrod.

913
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,478
- [scoffs] What?
- Hold on.

914
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,772
'Cause I don't actually know
what he did.

915
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,901
But I sure as hell will testify
about what Chuck Rhoades did.

916
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,528
Which is?

917
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,615
Purposefully induce sabotage
against my company,

918
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,452
use his status and position
to lure Bobby Axelrod to do it.

919
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,830
And I will confirm,
on the record,

920
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,248
that Charles Rhoades Sr.

921
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,417
was steering his own money

922
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,752
and that Chuck's money
was directly involved...

923
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,795
Stop.

924
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,673
Mr. Schirmer,
you need to speak with counsel

925
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:20,924
before going any further.

926
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,844
We all need to hold
and contemplate the risks

927
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,470
these allegations pose
to our case.

928
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,848
Dake!...Oliver.
We need to hear him out.

929
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,802
This meeting is over.

930
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,022
Yeah, I sort of figured.

931
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,984
<i>[♪ suspenseful music ♪]</i>

932
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,193
Why'd you let him go?

933
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,820
We need to know
what he had to say.

934
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,780
He said Chuck induced
the sabotage.

935
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,325
We need to know what that means!
Why the fuck...

936
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,244
'Cause I know how to do my job,
and the job is Axelrod.

937
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,537
If Chuck is part of it,

938
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,040
it's prosecutorial misconduct,
at a minimum.

939
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,333
Is it?

940
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,792
At this moment,
we don't know,

941
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,462
And we don't want to know.
Because if you keep asking,

942
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,422
you run the risk
of a Brady disclosure.

943
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,342
The more he says about whatever
story he's put together,

944
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,343
the more likely
we'll be obligated

945
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,304
to inform the defense
of our findings.

946
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,390
And what do you think
they will do with that,

947
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,268
other than blow up

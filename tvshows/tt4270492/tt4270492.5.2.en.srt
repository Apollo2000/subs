<i>Previously,
on</i> "Billions"...

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,637
You've come far
and learned much.

3
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:08,925
Until we see each other

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,583
and move your knowledge
into the world, be well.

5
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:13,555
An invitation for you
to do a Vanity Fair

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,266
cover photo shoot
for the "New Decas" issue.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,600
Somebody else will probably
get the cover.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,394
Probably Mike Prince.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,222
I was hoping you'd make
it to 'The Mike' this year.

10
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:22,963
You and I could do
a fireside chat.

11
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:24,441
It'd be the highlight
of the conference.

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,234
Ah.
Maybe this year we will.

13
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,115
Try to take me out
in some magazine?

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,083
I'll come see you
on your home fucking turf.

15
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,005
The separation
has convinced me.

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,934
We need
to be done.

17
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,478
I am not here because
you forced me to be.

18
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:36,845
Or because Chuck did.
I am here as Chuck's operative

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,079
because
he wants to get you.

20
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,009
That crypto mine that
you busted upstate,

21
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,624
I'd appreciate it
if you'd drop the case.

22
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,378
Best I can do is make it a civil
and not a criminal action.

23
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,589
An act of friendship
that goes beyond the norm.

00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,140
I work a little
differently than normal.

41
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:53,345
I'm not gonna challenge or
even explore that statement.

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,641
You know why?

43
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:57,659
Because this works a little
differently than normal therapy.

44
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:00,535
The mission here
is to dim

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,610
the emotional response
to past trauma.

46
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,831
Mm‐hmm.

47
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,708
Let's choose some people
to use as resources.

48
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,835
So, you're gonna need
a comforter,

49
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,255
a protector,
and a wise person.

50
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,924
They can be alive or dead,
real or fictional.

51
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,600
Old days, Wendy
filled all these roles.

52
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,852
These aren't those.

53
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,181
No, yeah, hundred percent,
true, okay.

54
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,539
Uh...

55
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,477
For my comforter,
I'm going with Ira Schirmer.

56
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,896
My best friend.

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,566
For my protector,
Alan Alda.

58
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,735
Oh, that's a good one.

59
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,112
I use Tony Siragusa.

60
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,573
Oh. Big and kind.
I get it, yeah.

61
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,492
Um, for wisdom...

62
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,328
I am a voracious reader
of crime fiction.

63
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,205
And recently
Darkly Dreaming Dexter

64
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,040
has found its way
to my night table.

65
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,294
So for a wise person,
a serial killer?

66
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,878
We may need to schedule
more sessions.

67
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,631
Not him, his father,
of sorts, Harry...

68
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,384
he had all the answers.

69
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,429
Okay. A father figure.
Good.

70
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,348
And finally, uh,
a safe space.

71
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,225
A place where you...

72
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,145
Yale Law Library.

73
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,650
Describe a recent moment
where you felt betrayed.

74
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,528
Drop a plumb line
down through your memory.

75
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,779
Where does it catch?

76
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,353
What, uh, image or idea

77
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:21,072
do you associate
this betrayal with?

78
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,785
9/11.

79
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,079
Traumatic day for sure.

80
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:30,084
Yes, but, uh, not the day,
uh, the monument.

81
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,046
He... Axelrod...
was being arrested,

82
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,590
and she was there.

83
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,592
She...
your wife?

84
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,344
Wendy. Yes.

85
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,722
Uh...

86
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,683
I knew she would
be there.

87
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,144
But, uh...

88
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,606
The way they clung
to each other...

89
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,277
What's the emotion associated
with that image?

90
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,279
Rage.

91
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,032
And, uh...

92
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,327
sadness.

93
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,581
Jealousy.

94
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,667
Where do you feel that...
in your body?

95
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,629
Everywhere.

96
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,344
What negative self‐belief
does that bring up?

97
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,490
That Axe is
a criminal.

98
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:25,148
And once again,
that's a negative belief

99
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,944
about the man you call Axe,
not you.

100
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,585
Well, once I
vanquish him, uh,

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,813
then I'll be able to
focus on Rhoades.

102
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,481
If you do the 'you' part,
you may find

103
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,442
the 'him' part
doesn't matter so much.

104
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,029
I know that
should be right.

105
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:44,839
But it just doesn't
feel right.

106
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,663
Here, take the dampers.

107
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,332
Follow this light
with your eyes.

108
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,252
When you experience
traumatic feelings,

109
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,714
focus on the resources
in your safe space.

110
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,006
Mm‐hmm.

111
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,842
Conjure them.
Trust them.

112
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,301
We practiced this
all week.

113
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,595
Follow the light with your eyes
and be with them.

114
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,724
Especially if you think about
the monument site...

115
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,268
or either of the people
you saw there.

116
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,864
There's not a person
who meets you,

117
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,907
doesn't think
you're special.

118
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,451
Even the bad guys.

119
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,489
Maybe especially
the bad guys.

120
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,038
You have that thing,
gets people to come to you.

121
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,128
To open up even if they know
they shouldn't.

122
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:35,524
Now, your portfolio
is impressive.

123
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,628
But I think it could be
more impressive.

124
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,715
Extend far past
the isle of Manhattan.

125
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,800
I see that for you.

126
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,510
I want to make it happen.

127
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,722
Plantains,

128
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,184
boiled and mashed.

129
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,283
They call it mangú.

130
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,558
Fills you up for
a day in the fields.

131
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,198
I should feed it
to my guys.

132
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:00,735
The story goes that
American soldiers down in the DR

133
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,653
were offered it
and they refused it.

134
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,281
Until one brave...
and probably very hungry...

135
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
infantryman went in.

136
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,744
And he liked it
so damn much he said:

137
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,914
"Man, that's good."

138
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,541
Got shortened to mangú.

139
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,918
Nifty story.

140
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,670
Mm. Problem is,
it's bullshit.

141
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,214
Doesn't hold up
under scrutiny.

142
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,758
And neither does your offer.
Why do I get more?

143
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,718
Because someone else
gets less.

144
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,095
Mm. That I believe.

145
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,097
Okay.

146
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,056
Offer me nice things,
I'll take 'em...

147
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,060
because I like
nice things.

148
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,646
But they buy you
no latitude.

149
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,981
You step wrong and
you'll have me after you...

150
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,443
and you'll find I'm a lot harder
to olé than the other guy,

151
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,947
because I care about the crime
and not the criminal.

152
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,114
Hey, good.

153
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,159
Keep your eye on
the sparrow, ya know?

154
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,420
All right.
I got my part done.

155
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,756
She's gonna burrow up his ass
like a toilet snake.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,633
And I have our info.
It's confirmed:

157
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,344
Simon Shenk is leaving
Errix Biotech for the FDA.

158
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,012
And he's set
for the conference.

159
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:12,329
So is Jules Hakli,
Ameri‐Hospitals.

160
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,432
The whole pharma team.
Good.

161
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,978
Mike Prince may think he's got
home field advantage.

162
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,438
But these road dogs
are gonna play spoiler.

163
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,606
Got your flannels?

164
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,108
In the car.

165
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,635
Uh, hey, it's me.

166
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,929
File the order...

167
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,982
Yes. I know
it's a warring gesture.

168
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,183
I'm a man at war.
File it.

169
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,400
These windows,
no shades.

170
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,361
Let the whole city watch you
do your wild thing.

171
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,406
Remind me not to have you
and Bill over after I move in.

172
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,366
Oh, that would be safe
these days...

173
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,827
His book's flatlined.
So...

174
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,329
He can't...

175
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,539
perform unless
his portfolio does?

176
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,293
No. I can't get it up
to fuck a non‐earner.

177
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,962
Oh...

178
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,589
Go deeper.
That's what I said.

179
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,717
Bill's been swinging from
"Fuck it, I'll do it live"

180
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,304
to choking back tears like he's
listening to "Goodnight Saigon."

181
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,714
I'm worried about him.

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,089
And I don't even like to think
about anybody but myself.

183
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:39,184
It might help if you let him
know his entire worth

184
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,103
isn't wrapped up in
his P&L's performance.

185
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,230
So... lie to him?

186
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,815
You want me to
lie to him?

187
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,017
I can do that.

188
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,194
I'm sorry
we've hit a snag.

189
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,237
Your bank just withdrew
your pre‐approval.

190
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,939
It seems your husband
got an automatic

191
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:54,001
temporary restraining order
on your assets.

192
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:55,910
He froze
your fucking loot?

193
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:00,680
I guess it's war.

194
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,336
I'm sorry.
I'll, uh, get right into it.

195
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,885
You know the shot?

196
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,888
No.
Just told to be here.

197
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:17,988
That's usually not
a very good sign.

198
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,089
Mm.

199
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,311
Ah, Chuck.

200
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
The Manhattan D. A.

201
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,481
Ah.

202
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,878
I always forget,
are you Law or Order?

203
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,946
You also have some cases
to brief the governor on?

204
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,031
No.

205
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,450
Those crypto‐miners
damn near decimated that town.

206
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,911
City council had to
go to the market

207
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,080
and buy electricity
ten times the normal rates.

208
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,957
Fucking libraries are closed
because of it.

209
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,710
We should be having mug shots,
perp walks, prison sentences.

210
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,378
And instead, you handed out
a speeding ticket.

211
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,630
We did the best
we could.

212
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,925
You know what?
I believe that.

213
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,389
Which is why Gramm gets it
from here on out.

214
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,555
You think you're yanking crypto
from my purview?

215
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,181
Was I being obtuse?

216
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,267
Where does a man
measure from?

217
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,476
The base.

218
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,263
That's where
we're yanking from.

219
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,171
All criminal referrals
from this office

220
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,272
will now
flow to her.

221
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,150
Lock, stock,
kit, and caboodle.

222
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,318
You see, because,
unlike you, Chuck,

223
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,738
she is not terrycloth soft
on big business.

224
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,489
The people of New York State
elected me

225
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,200
because they believed
in my judgment...

226
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,953
They elected you so they could
feel good about their sex lives

227
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,539
and think of themselves
as liberal and fair.

228
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,167
The people of Manhattan,
however,

229
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,169
elected me
to punish predators.

230
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,337
Not slug shots of Dubonnet
with them.

231
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,007
You sip Dubonnet...

232
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,176
I have
no fucking idea.

233
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,595
That you do is
the nub of the problem.

234
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,846
Interface with her office,

235
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,014
see if there's any other
cases she wants.

236
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,272
Axelrod's behind
this move.

237
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,857
Know how I know?

238
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,809
Tattaglia's a pimp?
Could never orchestrate

239
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,694
something like this?
Exactly.

240
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,396
And a move like this really
awakens my Dark Passenger...

241
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,919
You've been reading
Dexter again.

242
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,241
Indeed I have.

243
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,494
Thinking about dismemberment
instead of prosecution?

244
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,871
Well, in a way.

245
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,635
Dexter Morgan's Dark Passenger
could only

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,376
be sated by the brutal
act of taking life.

247
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,984
But, in order to make something
decent of this innate drive,

248
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,452
he developed a code.

249
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,384
A way that he could kill,
but for the 'right' reasons.

250
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,552
I will do the same.

251
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,555
I will loose my urges
for dominion and victory

252
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,392
only in the name of justice
and in accordance with it.

253
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,478
You really are serious
about making a change.

254
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,563
That raises the degree
of difficulty.

255
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,567
May‐haps. But I am committed
to this course.

256
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
To purge the world
of villainy.

257
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,239
And myself of...

258
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,492
I guess villainy, too.

259
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,411
So if you want to help yourself
and help this office,

260
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,665
you will find a way to get
on board with this code.

261
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,084
And to keep me
held to it,

262
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,129
as Dexter's father
did him.

263
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,762
I haven't been having much fun
lately, you know?

264
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,265
But I will enjoy using this guy
to get what I want,

265
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,933
and at his own
fucking party.

266
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,560
Because
he can fly?

267
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,728
Because he thinks
he can fly above me.

268
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,985
He'll learn it's best to
keep his feet on the ground

269
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,403
while trying to
trade body blows

270
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,113
with the Theogenes
of Wall Street.

271
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,115
Whoa. Easy, Wags.
Sorry.

272
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,576
Must be all the high‐mindedness
in this mountain air.

273
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,077
The battle
you're talking about

274
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,037
is you and Prince
at the Fireside Chat?

275
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,542
Yes. But that'll be
one for the crowd.

276
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,501
Prince has gone deep
on psycho‐ceuticals.

277
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,113
And we're about
to go deeper.

278
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:35,462
Your trip up north.

279
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,007
Mm, yeah.
Wasn't just for kicks.

280
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,634
We got a shaman who opened us up
to the power of ayahuasca

281
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,178
at just the right moment.

282
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,931
Along with universal truths,
we saw a market.

283
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
We were late
to psilocybin.

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,468
Won't happen
with pharma‐huasca.

285
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,179
And there's the man
that can secure it.

286
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:52,855
Simon Shenk from Errix.

287
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,441
Soon to be
of the FDA.

288
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,819
He'll need to divest.

289
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,821
And you'll be there
to assume his shares.

290
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,616
Like Ed Kemper inhabited
his victims' souls.

291
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,867
Gruesome.

292
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,410
For a drug like
medical ayahuasca

293
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,078
you'll need to establish
hospital‐based trials,

294
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,413
to help mainstream it.
Mm.

295
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,420
Come on!

296
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,632
So, we all have
our missions.

297
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,344
Sure you can handle the
emotional component of yours?

298
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,181
I am the one of us who can
handle emotions, yes.

299
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,643
- ‐ There he is.
- ‐

300
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,729
Welcome to 'The Mike.'

301
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,732
How lucky are we, to be here,
to do this, together?

302
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,901
I love knowing that
in 24 hours,

303
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,196
I'm gonna be smarter and better
than I am right now.

304
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,156
Because of you all.

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,992
Welcome, Axe.
Thanks for being here.

306
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,786
Hey, thanks for
finally having me.

307
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,287
You don't need to
make me look good.

308
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,040
This is the first time
you accepted.

309
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,375
Let's kick some butt
together.

310
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,043
Yeah!

311
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,170
All right.

312
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,846
You got yourself
a secret golden tunnel.

313
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,015
I want on the trip.

314
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,600
Who are you again?

315
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,602
You're running
your own money.

316
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,437
As hedge fund violations go,

317
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,902
that's like
shouting the N word...

318
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,725
not illegal, but enough
to get you fired.

319
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,943
I would never do that.
And I am not running my own...

320
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,833
You left the separate account
up on your screen

321
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,571
when you went to the bathroom
to jerk off.

322
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,741
I go to the bathroom
to go to the bathroom.

323
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,763
Mm.
Bottle of Jergens

324
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,121
peeking out of your pocket
says different.

325
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,748
But, hey,
that's your business.

326
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,711
My business is getting in on
your extracurricular.

327
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,255
I know you've got a 3 Sharpe
ratio strategy.

328
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,757
It's 3.64 actually,

329
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,883
but only to six figures.

330
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,428
Any bigger than that
and it won't work...

331
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,763
we get stuck in the tube
like Augustus Gloop.

332
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,349
What the fuck?

333
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,582
Figure out how to get it
big enough to cut me in,

334
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,062
or I'll cut you.

335
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,981
Like with a knife?

336
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,149
Are you threatening to...

337
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,693
No.

338
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,695
But I'll flip ya.

339
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,746
I'll flip ya for real.

340
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,915
Chuck can't actually
have veto power over what I buy.

341
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,705
If a judge were
going by the book,

342
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,525
you'd be allowed to buy
ten apartments.

343
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,806
You can easily afford that

344
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:26,091
out of your share of
the marital assets.

345
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,926
But the thing is...

346
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,678
Chuck knows
a lot of judges.

347
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:31,427
Outcome is
unpredictable.

348
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,848
So I could
lose the apartment?

349
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,683
Given the timeline
to get to court...

350
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,477
you've already lost
the apartment.

351
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,270
He did this because
I put out that statement...

352
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,189
which I did because
he was too busy

353
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,133
hanging from the ceiling
to do it himself.

354
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:44,443
And he did because you did
because his parents

355
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,862
and your parents because America
because England

356
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,115
because ancient Rome
because primordial ooze.

357
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,202
I appreciate your bedside,
Orrin.

358
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,496
Yes, Chuck would behave better
if he felt better.

359
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,471
But that's not
my responsibility anymore.

360
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,173
Probably never was.

361
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,369
I need to make myself
feel better.

362
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,396
So, we go to court.

363
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,468
We have a situation...

364
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,100
Ali Kashkhokh.

365
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,768
Allocator for
Ontario Educators.

366
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,937
I wish we'd known
you were coming.

367
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,313
Bobby isn't here
right now.

368
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,565
And neither are Wagner
or Taylor Mason, right?

369
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,026
Ah, you knew that.

370
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,363
Peach,
make her comfortable.

371
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,323
Yeah,
good luck with that.

372
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,120
Ali Kashkhokh
is hardcore...

373
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,412
What she is
is a total fuckin...

374
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,039
Wags.

375
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,108
We have a billion plus
of her union's dollars.

376
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,626
And she's a bellwether
for the industry.

377
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,376
If she approves or
disapproves, people listen.

378
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
What I was gonna say.
We can be back in an hour.

379
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,898
Nah, it's just
a spot‐check.

380
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,148
She's hoping to avoid us,
so she can poke around

381
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,010
for the second set of
Untouchables books.

382
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,054
And you rushing back will
make you look like Al Capone.

383
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,357
But we don't actually have
anything to hide, right?

384
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:57,568
- Of course not.
- Don't be ridiculous.

385
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,670
Thought not.

386
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,061
Losing Ontario Educators
would be bad though...

387
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,855
Pants‐shit bad.
I get it. Lemme go.

388
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,897
She's already hammering away
at the weak spots...

389
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,401
The market's like
a fragile bridge.

390
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,654
We don't know exactly when, but
eventually it will collapse...

391
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,031
And all the cars on it
will tumble into the ocean.

392
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,242
Many drivers
will drown.

393
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,327
The cars in this metaphor
are the investments,

394
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,371
the drivers are the investors,
like you, and...

395
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,914
Sorry.

396
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,083
I can't have you pulling people
off their desks

397
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,575
during trading hours.

398
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,295
It's not good for the fine
educators of Ontario...

399
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,796
or any of our
other investors.

400
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,549
Yeah, sure.
But me hearing their answers is.

401
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,108
Why don't I
get you to IR,

402
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:35,387
have them curate a tour,
answer any further questions.

403
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,938
Well, I was nominated
for their Second Circuit.

404
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,191
That's why I sent you that box
of embargoed smokes.

405
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,942
May be premature.

406
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,445
There's a certain senator
in possession of information

407
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:53,545
that could sink
my battleship.

408
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,865
What information?

409
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,020
Which senator?

410
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,154
Well, you know her well.

411
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,412
She put your name forward
for the U. S. Attorney's job.

412
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:00,996
Marcia Vandeveer.
Sure.

413
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,518
Old pal of my father's.

414
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,268
A fact which suggests
we may be able to just

415
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:08,045
roll her away like a stone
from your tomb.

416
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,713
You didn't answer
the other part.

417
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,510
The senator has become aware
that when I was at DOJ

418
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,263
I co‐authored a memorandum
endorsing a then‐novel reading

419
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,349
of a subclause of
the Geneva Convention.

420
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,142
The torture memo?

421
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,811
You wrote the fucking
torture memo?

422
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,230
I wrote a memo.

423
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,774
On a fine point of legal...
it wasn't the "T" word.

424
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,442
It was
"enhanced interrogation."

425
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,319
A vital tool in
intelligence gathering.

426
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,072
You're welcome by the way for
the very blanket of freedom...

427
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,078
Thank you.
And how the hell

428
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,832
am I supposed to explain that
to the senator?

429
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,483
I would simply like to
defend myself publicly.

430
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,622
Face the shame head on.

431
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,831
Turn it into pride.

432
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,375
As I did.

433
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,256
Well, I was hoping
with your help

434
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:50,522
we might shift
the Overton Window once more.

435
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,214
Okay. But my thing
was a harmless...

436
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,092
The waterboarding wasn't really
as bad as the media made it out.

437
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,931
Aah!

438
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,559
It's torture!

439
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,646
I may have been wrong
on this one...

440
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,856
You're damn fucking right...
it's torture!

441
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,942
And if even I
don't like it...

442
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,362
Believe me, that was
the sport version.

443
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,781
You should see how I roll on
covert hostile actors...

444
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,201
Rolled.
Not anymore.

445
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,619
In fact.
Not ever.

446
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,250
Don't even know
why I said that.

447
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,248
You're not a military man.
That's the way we go.

448
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,210
Uh, you trusted the generals.
Who would have done otherwise?

449
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,879
Me. No, I would not have
endorsed that shit.

450
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,882
No doubt. But I'm building
my case for Senator Vandeveer.

451
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,551
To get her to forget
his scribblings

452
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,720
and see him for
the man he is.

453
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,014
Chuck, you want to think
the best of me.

454
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,725
Well, everyone does.

455
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,393
I'll get rid of this.

456
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,021
Don't know where I dug it up
in the first place.

457
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,804
No, double no, fuck no...
It's your job.

458
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,195
We sent you on the road
to learn investor relations.

459
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,961
Only to find
I sucked at it.

460
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:58,405
Why?

461
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,115
Too fucking abrasive.

462
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,908
While Bonnie may have
proven herself

463
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,911
something of
a hothouse flower,

464
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,290
I have the rugged areole
of a desert succulent.

465
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,917
And an almost
pornographic knowledge

466
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,378
of all things
Axe Capitale.

467
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,895
I need you to
gentle down an investor.

468
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,687
She's a beast.
You are the best choice

469
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,230
for the job.
It's what you do.

470
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,608
Well, it's what she does for
Mase Cap, not Axe Cap.

471
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,444
Last I checked, this all
falls under Axe Cap.

472
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,154
Last I checked, we still had
some sovereignty.

473
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,947
You can't just
conscript our officers.

474
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,326
If you want to
borrow Lauren,

475
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,578
you should talk
to Taylor first.

476
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,914
Have you?
Didn't have time.

477
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,998
Did you have time
to talk to Axe?

478
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,724
There is
a chain of command.

479
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,837
You're in violation.

480
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
This is where you want
to make a stand?

481
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
Here, now, over this?

482
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,636
Every encroachment needs to be
called out and dealt with.

483
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,974
Look, I am willing to meet
with this allocator

484
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,686
if that's going to
be helpful...

485
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,771
Where should I tell her
you're taking her tonight?

486
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,332
Given the moves
she's already pulled,

487
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,801
she doesn't want
the wine‐and‐dine

488
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:17,776
or the shot‐and‐grind.

489
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,320
Tomorrow, first thing
in the office.

490
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,906
After I have Union Square Cafe
ferry over

491
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,492
some very special room service
to her hotel.

492
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,635
Each year's Mike finds us here
in front of the fire,

493
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,512
tackling a big topic.

494
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,224
This year's: Is it time for
a new capitalism?

495
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,517
We can keep it short:
No!

496
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,408
And who better to chop it up
with than Bobby Axelrod?

497
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,237
Seriously, Bobby, isn't it
incumbent upon us...

498
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,322
those who've 'won'
by any metric...

499
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,039
to acknowledge that we didn't
do it alone, and to...

500
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:09,369
Yeah, no, I‐I‐I know
what you say about

501
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,329
learning and giving back
and all the rest.

502
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,874
And I believe it's
what you tell yourself.

503
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,543
But if we look at it,

504
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,212
we see that it's not
the whole truth. Is it?

505
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,046
I guess not, Axe.
Tell us what is.

506
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,091
You want me to reduce it
to one thing?

507
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,676
I can.

508
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,678
It's about being picked.

509
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,014
Being
singled out.

510
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,849
Every one of us has already
been singled out.

511
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,996
And this confers it,
officially.

512
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,285
Like Davos.
Or the Allen conference.

513
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,231
You're either in Sun Valley
or you don't exist.

514
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,066
But what goes on there,
or here,

515
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,319
doesn't matter beyond that,
at all.

516
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,154
It's not about
the conversation.

517
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,947
It's about
the invitation.

518
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,533
This gives me remarkable insight
into how you think about trades.

519
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,076
It's all bottom line.

520
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,963
But what if some of us
aren't like that?

521
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:55,707
Been known to throw an elbow
or two when you need to, Mike.

522
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,417
Sure. When I compete
I'm there to win.

523
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,213
But I choose my playing field
carefully now.

524
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,340
And always against opponents
the same size as me.

525
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,760
And no one's making money
while they're here.

526
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,317
See, that's
another canard.

527
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:11,075
Every single person in this room
earns money while they sleep.

528
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,083
While they dream.
While they fuck.

529
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,479
I can honestly say
I haven't accepted payment

530
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,397
for that particular act
in years.

531
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,610
Look, you want to leave here
feeling better about yourself

532
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,904
than when you came.
That's it.

533
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,473
Isn't that the benefit
of helping others,

534
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,867
the selfish part
of giving back?

535
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,620
Why is that something
to be ashamed of?

536
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,915
It's not. But still:
not the whole thing.

537
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,583
Your man's
getting boxed in.

538
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,877
No such box.
Just you watch, Scoot.

539
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,626
What do you think
I get out of this?

540
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:45,841
It can't be status conferred,
since I do the inviting.

541
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,134
For you?

542
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,928
Respite from guilt.

543
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,471
That's your whole platform,
isn't it.

544
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,267
From he who has too much
to she who has too little.

545
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,144
It's your basketball story,
your history.

546
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,230
You talk about how it wasn't
your own achievement.

547
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,274
Not only my own.

548
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,109
My town, in Indiana,

549
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,277
had the third largest
high school arena...

550
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,321
yes, arena...
in the country.

551
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,575
I was fortunate to be
a standout... a star.

552
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,119
When we had a big game
coming up,

553
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,664
families would paint their
picket fences green and white,

554
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,665
my school colors.

555
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,250
And if I'd jog past,

556
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,504
everyone would come out of their
houses and cheer for me.

557
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,854
I can still hear the roar of it
in my head:

558
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,008
haaaaaaa...

559
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,509
And what you
take from that

560
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,219
is that you stood
on their shoulders.

561
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,180
That they lifted you up
to your success.

562
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,557
You were nothing special.

563
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,018
That's right.
I was supported.

564
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,061
It's important for all of us
to remember that.

565
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,023
It's what separates us from
demagogues and other monsters.

566
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,774
Ah. No sale.

567
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,610
I don't like
everyone in this room.

568
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,403
But I do respect everyone
in this room.

569
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,196
Because I know each
and every one of you has

570
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,074
a portfolio of accomplishments
that sets you apart,

571
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,368
proves your
exceptional qualities.

572
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,828
And I assume that goes
for you, too.

573
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,705
Well, unlike you, I'm not
embarrassed to say it.

574
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,645
As I'd expect.
Because I know your story

575
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,715
as much as you know mine.
How you came from nothing.

576
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,008
Yeah, it's true.

577
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,004
Your dad was
an insurance salesman.

578
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,839
You ate dinner with him
every night.

579
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,132
My dad was gonzo.

580
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,717
I ate dinner
wherever I could.

581
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,761
And yet you were still
in the wealthiest state

582
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,888
in the wealthiest country
in the world.

583
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,681
With access to
the best healthcare,

584
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,600
schools,
infrastructure.

585
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,895
And you were born
white and male

586
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,605
at a time that was
a huge advantage

587
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,568
in the greatest capital market
in the history of mankind.

588
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,404
The roads were paved
for you, Bobby.

589
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,407
Which is why you were able to
move so quickly across them.

590
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,284
Wow.

591
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,911
I knew you were
wracked with guilt,

592
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,956
but this takes it to
a whole different level.

593
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,124
Sure.
The roads were paved.

594
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,794
But I didn't even have
a goddamned car.

595
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,880
Now, you see, this is
where we are different.

596
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,466
I don't pretend I'm
an ordinary guy got lucky.

597
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,927
I am a monster.

598
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,930
A carnivorous
fucking monster.

599
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,227
It was success or oblivion
for me just as it was for you,

600
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,520
whether you want to
admit it here or not.

601
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,982
See, that's what all this
is for you.

602
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,734
A way to forget
you are that monster.

603
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,945
You have to be one.

604
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,572
Or you could never have gotten
here in the first place.

605
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,865
See?

606
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,825
Don't bring that weak shit
our way.

607
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,786
Not over yet.

608
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,872
Maybe you're right...

609
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,338
But I must be one of the cuddly
kind from Monsters, Inc.

610
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,882
Because tomorrow I'll be out
loading pallets

611
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,843
for the "Shake the Quake"
relief mission

612
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,637
for earthquake victims
in Honduras.

613
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,471
First we organize
the supplies,

614
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,307
then we air drop 'em
next weekend.

615
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,019
We're not just
writing checks here.

616
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,274
Care to join me
and see if giving back

617
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,568
with your own two hands
changes your mind?

618
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,793
Whoops!

619
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,571
Trap door.

620
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,283
Uh, I was planning on leaving,
but, um...

621
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,911
Sure. Why not, Mike?

622
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,330
Count me in.

623
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,128
Thank you.

624
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:14,591
That genius really thinks he
trapped you into joining him.

625
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,634
No idea
it's what you wanted.

626
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,837
You think they'll be putting
their backs into it tomorrow?

627
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,643
The bankers?

628
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,146
Stevens and Callahan
and them?

629
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,526
Would you put your back into
anything if you were them?

630
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,029
Their banks have 80 billion on
their balance sheet between 'em.

631
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,322
So I seriously doubt it.

632
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,615
That's right.

633
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,742
Callahan's got
a contract for life.

634
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,536
Driscoll's got it even better...
his name's on his bank.

635
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Father's name.

636
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,998
Well, like I said...

637
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,958
Their racket's as old
as J. P. Morgan's

638
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,128
and Charles Merrill's
themselves.

639
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,300
We both got
evening plans ahead.

640
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,886
The world's changed over
the past year, cap'n.

641
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,055
To be safe, we institute
a four‐part protocol.

642
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,015
To prevent
misunderstandings.

643
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,226
You send a text after:
"Hey, what a great night!"

644
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,727
She'll respond in kind.

645
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,437
You send a gift the next
morning, leave her smiling.

646
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,814
You make secondary plans
even if

647
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,065
you have no intention
of keeping them.

648
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,360
And when you don't
keep them...

649
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,071
Who do you think
you're talking to?

650
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,694
I'm a gentleman.

651
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,281
Fucking right you are.

652
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,415
If I send you a text after,
it's a real text.

653
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,461
Text, don't text.
Fine.

654
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,765
It's not that I've been
ducking your calls,

655
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,100
it's just that
I've been...

656
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,935
Ducking my calls.

657
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,396
I have. Yes.

658
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,022
I feel like you're going to
pull your money.

659
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,023
Are you going to
pull your money?

660
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,943
I don't want to talk shop
while I'm up here...

661
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,070
It's a financial
conference.

662
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,615
So that's why you're here,
to keep my money on board?

663
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,409
Yes.

664
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,661
It's been four months since
I moved under Axe's roof.

665
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,730
And we haven't had a single call
during that time

666
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:10,081
about business
or anything else.

667
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,499
I wanted to
see you.

668
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,460
And here you are.
Like King Kong in chains.

669
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,630
Not easy to get used to.

670
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,341
You know, it took me a long time
to get my balance back

671
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,467
after you ended our thing.

672
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,346
I'm glad
you were able to.

673
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,225
So, the money...

674
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,146
So, indeed...

675
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,651
Checkmate.
Good game.

676
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,863
Particularly quick,
Hikaru.

677
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,342
Where are we at?

678
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,510
Will the senator see me?

679
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,679
She will.
Problem is:

680
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,641
I'm not sure I should
walk you into it.

681
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,850
Why not?

682
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,685
Well, you did the thing.

683
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,896
A youthful indiscretion.

684
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,106
Born out of loyalty,
and commitment,

685
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,358
and the ability to
craft sound arguments

686
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,110
on any side of an issue.

687
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,030
It's also not
the kind I'd make again.

688
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,366
So people can change?

689
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,868
That's what you're saying.
You've changed?

690
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,537
You're no longer law school
DeGiulio, or Deputy AG DeGiulio.

691
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,707
You're truly
Judge DeGiulio.

692
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,127
Ah, this isn't
about me.

693
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,172
You aren't really interested
in if I can change.

694
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,446
Or man can change.

695
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:44,242
You want to figure out
if you can.

696
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,068
It's being put
to the test.

697
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,695
I am changing.

698
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:50,390
It's happening in
front of your eyes.

699
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,141
Well, that's gonna be
useful to you,

700
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,810
stating it
with authority.

701
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,228
Self‐hypnosis.

702
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,066
Look, you've done
the impossible before.

703
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,025
Why not now?

704
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,028
Well, after a certain age
it gets harder.

705
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,531
Or maybe undoable.

706
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:11,780
Or so incremental as
to have no impact.

707
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:15,198
Well, I prefer to think
of it as evolving.

708
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,993
You want to know if
I would have written the memo

709
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,210
when I was younger
or older?

710
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,828
I'm more concerned with taking
the lessons of it forward.

711
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,256
That's why I want to be
on the Supreme Court.

712
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,969
So that the accumulation of
all that I know can benefit...

713
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,637
Bullshit.

714
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,141
Fine.

715
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,852
I do believe I have
more capacity.

716
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,271
For good, for ill,
for anything.

717
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,107
The truth is...

718
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,942
I just really want it.

719
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,068
Ah.

720
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,698
I want to feel the power
of the seat make me more.

721
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,162
What's your driver?

722
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,789
I, uh, let certain
of my... quests

723
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,624
drag me into
the wastelands.

724
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,669
And it cost me every...
it cost me too much.

725
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,298
I may still need to do
these kinds of things,

726
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,843
but I also need to serve

727
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,471
the best of me
at the same time.

728
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,310
You and Axelrod.

729
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,894
It started as justice,

730
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,482
then became something
that wasn't, but...

731
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,034
Mm‐hmm.
...it still can be again.

732
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,948
And I can help you,
Chuck.

733
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,510
I want to.

734
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,365
If I'm in
a position to.

735
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,998
You can indeed
craft an argument.

736
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,503
We'll keep our appointment
with the senator.

737
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,005
And put all this
to the test.

738
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,990
Maybe now's a good time
for our one‐on‐one.

739
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,952
Mandatory inspection.
Like I'm back in the service.

740
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,037
Don't like to think
of it that way.

741
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,664
Why not?
When I was in the Navy,

742
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,334
at least I knew
what my purpose was.

743
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,753
Now I don't have a clue.

744
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,339
What the fuck do
I do here, Wendy?

745
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,716
My whole career

746
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,885
I've run operations...

747
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,347
logistics, combat,
organization.

748
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,308
I tried to live my life
by Jim Baker's words:

749
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,727
"You can either focus on
the 'Chief'

750
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,062
or the 'of Staff.'"

751
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,981
"Those who have focused
on the 'of Staff'

752
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,232
have done pretty well."

753
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,776
But if Mase Cap is no longer
an operation,

754
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,986
what do I do here?

755
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,487
Are you asking me
to define that

756
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,239
as Human Resources
or as a performance coach?

757
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,700
You have two fucking jobs.
I have zero.

758
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:58,815
Definitely need
the performance coach.

759
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,705
And I can help you.

760
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,291
I can help you get into
Olympian form...

761
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:06,586
but towards what aim, what
discipline, is a fair question.

762
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,963
And you need to
be asking Taylor.

763
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,799
So why aren't you?

764
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,969
♪ Bury me with my guns on ♪

765
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,931
I confronted my ego
and let go of it.

766
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,933
Seems intact again.

767
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,935
Sure.
You come back to yourself.

768
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,647
It's one experience,
not therapeutic dosing.

769
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,026
But Bram Longriver really opened
our eyes to the potential.

770
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,612
You spent time with Bram?

771
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,990
He was our personal guide
and shaman.

772
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,035
Longriver carries kind of
a mystical weight in the Valley.

773
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,454
We have that mystique
behind us.

774
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,956
Along with the full force
of his evangelical power.

775
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,958
Gives us instant credibility
with the therapists

776
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,919
who are using
the synthetic ayahuasca

777
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,171
as part of
their treatment...

778
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,174
that is,
as soon as you make it

779
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,051
legally available
in the U. S. market.

780
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,719
So you know
I'm headed to the FDA.

781
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,805
We have real intel.

782
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,990
And I have worked to make sure
no one finds out

783
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:04,826
until it's done... preserving
the value of your position.

784
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,649
Let's talk about us buying
your shares in Errix...

785
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,531
Hi.

786
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,450
Now turn your attention
to the main stage

787
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,869

00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,714

792
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,359
Did you close Shenk?

793
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,069
It was a late night.

794
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,280
Conversations were had.

795
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,282
You didn't close him?
The fuck?

796
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,913
Unexpected
circumstances.

797
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:03,494
What, you get distracted
by a stripper?

798
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,621
Not in the way
you mean...

799
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,749
Well, what happened, then?
Get robbed again, roofied?

800
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,337
I failed
the Chris Rock test.

801
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,091
Her stage name was Brandi,

802
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,511
but... but it was
really Mandy.

803
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,179
My Mandy.

804
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,516
My sweet little Mandy.

805
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,560
Your...

806
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,229
I didn't keep my daughter
off the pole.

807
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:31,406
Brutal.

808
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,003
Want me to
shut the place down?

809
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:34,848
No, it's okay.
I got... I got her out of there.

810
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,910
I s‐shipped her off
to a facility.

811
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,571
I think I'll have it
shut down anyway.

812
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,531
Thank you.

813
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,121
And Shenk?

814
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,374
I'll close today.

815
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,095
Oscar wants out?

816
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,972
He wouldn't even engage.

817
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,689
Ivy, would you draft
some of your colleagues

818
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,680
to help put my people
back together, please?

819
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,485
I'll do it myself.

820
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,790
Fuckin' bankers.

821
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,303
Didn't intend to spend
an extra day in New York.

822
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,390
Hope you enjoyed your
accommodations and the dinner.

823
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,724
Food doesn't
travel well.

824
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,352
Let's get to it.

825
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,770
Okayyy.

826
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,518
Let's start with
the current portfolio...

827
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:58,025
You have a cache of
emerging market bonds

828
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,819
that I'm particularly
proud of.

829
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,487
Where are the marks?

830
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,780
How are you valuing that?

831
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,156
You saw the 13F...

832
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,535
That's 45 days stale.
What do I own now?

833
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,613
How do I know there's not
a Mississippi‐sized delta?

834
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:12,049
We could show you that
if you want plain vanilla,

835
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:13,666
60‐40 for retirement.

836
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,907
But if you wanted that,
you wouldn't be here.

837
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:18,504
We had your aggression index
at a 6.7.

838
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,464
Do you really break things down
that way?

839
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,216
Not on
the external documents...

840
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,510
But based on your goals,
the investments you made...

841
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,471
and the investments you left
behind to come to us...

842
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,274
we figured that
was your sweet spot.

843
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,117
What if we could take
a little more danger?

844
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:34,853
People talk about quant
fundamentals, human overlay.

845
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,981
I overlay like
you wouldn't believe.

846
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,859
See, there are certain risks
that are not risky to you,

847
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,360
they're not risky
to Axe Cap.

848
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,697
Personally risky to me?
I don't think that way.

849
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,825
I just think if you're not
making 15 percent every year,

850
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,535
then my father
was right about me.

851
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,836
What did he say?

852
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,376
He blamed himself for not
punching my mother hard enough

853
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,534
to kill me the night
she told him she was...

854
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:55,875
That's plenty
right there.

855
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,754
Guys like that...

856
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,924
revvin' up your engine,
metal under tension...

857
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,886
my job is to keep you off
the highway to the danger zone.

858
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,473
And how do you
do that?

859
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,311
I know my SEC like
Bear Bryant knew his.

860
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,065
That was a kick
in the heinie.

861
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,318
You wanted
the unvarnished look.

862
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,992
And we do have the numbers
to back up...

863
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:27,089
Truth is, I don't care
what these people all said...

864
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:28,969
just that they didn't
wilt or crack.

865
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:32,351
In many founder‐named shops,
the whole place collapses

866
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,872
if the founder isn't
in their face 24/7.

867
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,082
That clearly is not
the case here.

868
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,168
The numbers do
speak for themselves.

869
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,254
And thank you
for that dinner...

870
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,966
the gnocchi was firm and tasty
and the halibut sublime.

871
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,843
Thought it didn't travel?

872
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,927
We all have
our roles to play.

873
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,931
Mine here was hard‐ass.

874
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,142
But you played yours
to perfection.

875
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,982
Senator, I understand
you have concerns.

876
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,443
Now let's address them
where they can be spoken to

877
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,571
most fully and frankly...
right here and now.

878
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,584
Behind doors
which are closed.

879
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:12,117
I have just one question...
and I can ask it anywhere.

880
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,622
Judge, did you write
that memo?

881
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,666
This memo?

882
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,125
I did, Senator.

883
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,378
Then that, as they say,
is the ballgame.

884
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:27,007
The other side protects its own
no matter the sin.

885
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,218
If I do the same,
I would be the same.

886
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,303
I must hold Judge DeGiulio

887
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,849
to the same standards
I keep for myself.

888
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,101
And they are as high
as a midnight showing

889
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,938
of Cheech and Chong's
Up in Smoke.

890
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,987
Had I suffered such
a regrettable lapse,

891
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,989
I would withdraw my name...

892
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:54,243
and I would kiss my career
and my sweet ass goodbye.

893
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,461
I think that time
I got waterboarded.

894
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,714
"Never let your head
hang down.

895
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,383
Never give up
and sit down and grieve.

896
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,827
Find another way."

897
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,303
Your dad?

898
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,929
Close. Nixon.

899
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,347
Inspiring.

900
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,350
The fuck is the other way,
the next move?

901
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,479
I don't know yet.
But I will reach out when I do.

902
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,002
I would have done
exactly the same as you.

903
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,880
Well, I'm glad you didn't
try to change my mind.

904
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,716
So you'll keep the memo
buried?

905
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,886
I will as long as he doesn't
go for a lifetime post.

906
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,764
Good.

907
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,724
He's still destined for
great things, though.

908
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,434
What do you
have in mind?

909
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,359
‐Hey, Eddie.
‐Keep it up.

910
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,069
Hey. Thanks a lot.

911
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,073
Gonna take care of
all these yourself?

912
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,533
Getting a workout too,
huh?

913
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,333
All right, bring it in.

914
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,963
Gotta lift
with your legs.

915
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,256
That's what they say.

916
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,591
Thanks for the help.

917
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,926
Well, you can
return the favor:

918
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,763
Host Stage Three pharma‐huasca
trials at your medical center.

919
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,262
We're not
a university hospital.

920
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,308
Well, that's why
we need you.

921
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,352
Bram Longriver says:

922
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,105
"We're in a race between
catastrophe and consciousness."

923
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,648
You have Longriver?

924
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,860
If we're gonna win,
we need much wider testing.

925
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:56,281
Is the Axelrod Foundation
willing to back that race?

926
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,409
I can make a call.

927
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,037
Then make that call.

928
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,080
‐
‐Great.

929
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,790
Thanks for everything.
I'll circle back.

930
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,386
You Michael Johnson‐ed
right over to Jules Hakli.

931
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,637
The hospital CEO.

932
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,127
Always wanted
to shake his hand.

933
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:22,474
Uh huh.
And now you're back hard at it.

934
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,979
You know, you and I should share
a beer at the closing dinner.

935
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,981
We always have
an amazing presentation.

936
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,232
Sure.
I'll try to make it.

937
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,156
Not gonna let me
sort in peace, huh?

938
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,491
Oscar,
I was bleeding out.

939
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,035
I couldn't just
shut my firm.

940
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,536
If I did, I could never re‐open,
or raise again.

941
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,497
It was a way to preserve
the name. To continue.

942
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,832
It's the answer to the one
question you didn't ask

943
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,586
but should have: Would I do
absolutely anything to survive?

944
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,872
The answer is yes.

945
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:53,663
That's why you should
leave your money with me.

946
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:56,248
Last year, Axe Cap
showed returns of 17 percent

947
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,509
while growing by 22 percent.

948
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,261
I was shrinking, dying.

949
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,138
So you gained all the benefits
of bankruptcy...

950
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,433
indemnification, restructuring,
wound‐licking...

951
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,893
without actually declaring.

952
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,563
And you're going to tell me that
you're going to be better.

953
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,607
Already are better...
Yes.

954
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,359
Since I've been there we're up
7.2 percent... you're up.

955
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,862
The difference between blitz
and regular chess?

956
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:21,241
In the traditional game, when
it's the other person's turn,

957
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,582
you consider what
you might do next.

958
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:27,998
You let your mind wander,
meditate, be open.

959
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,960
With fast chess,
you've anticipated their move

960
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,422
and your response before
they've made it.

961
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,383
Which game
have we been playing?

962
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,428
I don't want to have my money
with Bobby Axelrod,

963
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,306
I don't want to be
associated with him.

964
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,726
And if you are, I don't want to
be associated with you.

965
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,688
And you knew that before
I opened my mouth...

966
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,820
I‐I‐I hope when we meet again
it's not as competitors.

967
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,114
If you go back out on your own,
give me a call.

968
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,205
Oscar: You shouldn't have made
that rook sacrifice at move 37.

969
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,666
That's why you lost.

970
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:22,427
Well, you slipped away
last night.

971
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,264
Apologies.
Personal business.

972
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,742
I'll bet.

973
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,268
I've seen a guy take a girl
straight to the Champagne Room...

974
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,769
but never straight
out of the club.

975
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,521
At least not
outside Thailand.

976
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,107
What type of bar fine
she run you?

977
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,567
Wasn't like that.

978
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,610
Just had to have
a little chat.

979
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,196
I guess there's no such thing
as too young

980
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,616
when they're firm as a
genetically modified plumcot.

981
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,720
Mr. Axelrod and I know
Errix is a family business.

982
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:50,752
So we'll pay market
for your shares,

983
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:52,838
but we have to work together
to keep the stock price high

984
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:54,125
for your relatives.

985
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,627
Sell to us
and do your share

986
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,421
with approvals
once you're at the FDA,

987
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,498
and we're all sitting pretty
in Schaefer city.

988
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,388
Ah, yes,
that sounds fun.

989
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,849
But it's Longriver
I'm interested in.

990
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,852
His reach makes markets...
and makes this deal.

991
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,898
Then you're talking to the right
guy, 'cause we got him.

992
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,653
Bobby, I'm gonna need to stay in
the apartment a little longer.

993
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,404
Is that...
Yeah, more than okay.

994
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,157
You know
I never use it.

995
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,875
Thank you.
I'm sure I'll...

996
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,663
Thought you found
a place you loved?

997
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:30,726
Uh...

998
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:32,757
the deal got "Chucked."

999
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,917
Ah, you could've called me in.
Why didn't you call me in?

1000
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:35,751
I thought I could
sort it quickly.

1001
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,836
But it's going to
take a minute.

1002
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,255
The man's a delight.
You know?

1003
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,198
Look, I can
buy the place for you.

1004
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:43,526
Pay me back as soon as...

1005
00:46:43,611 --> 00:46:47,011
It's gone.
Thank you, but... it's gone.

1006
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,723
All right. Well, stay as long
as you need then.

1007
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,016
Hey, one more thing.

1008
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,851
Yeah?

1009
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,770
Gut him.

1010
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,690
That's the plan.

1011
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,526
A ten percent loss?

1012
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,821
You took my scrilla down
ten fucking percent?

1013
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,698
I tried to warn you.
The algo...

1014
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,326
your added investment forced it
to make suboptimal trades.

1015
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,578
Why is your brilliant machine
fucking retarded?!

1016
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,248
Bill, what you want
won't work.

1017
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,540
Like fuck it won't...

1018
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,042
This shit is
a nerdy new world.

1019
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,955
I had to have it put into
terms I understand.

1020
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,547
So let me translate for you:
A man can manage two wives.

1021
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,216
But you try to keep
four wives going,

1022
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,968
you can't keep everyone
satisfied.

1023
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,970
Too many variables,
not enough Bill.

1024
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,972
The whole thing
crumbles.

1025
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,808
I needed this.

1026
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,560
You are a useless
fucking bunch.

1027
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,023
Give him back his money.

1028
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,483
Investor beware.

1029
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,646
Maybe. But you didn't
actually invest his shit

1030
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:45,320
and risk fucking up
your side stash.

1031
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,781
I'm keeping it
as an asshole tax.

1032
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,241
Return it
as an asshole tribute.

1033
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:57,291
You know, I was almost back
at my desk when it hit me.

1034
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,585
So I may not be able
to crawl ass‐to‐mouth

1035
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,213
through your
algorithmic centipede,

1036
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,799
but the one thing that has kept
me in my chair all these years,

1037
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,637
WINNING, is that I know a liar
when I smell one.

1038
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,350
Your trading thing might not
work with the added capital,

1039
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,268
but when I look
in your eyes,

1040
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,437
I do not see someone
who has lost money.

1041
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,474
I see someone who's trying
to steal from me.

1042
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,053
So by the time I actually
get back to my desk,

1043
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:27,696
my money better be there,
or this time I will cut you.

1044
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,630
This is the thank you.

1045
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,050
The way you conducted yourself...

1046
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,135
and everyone else...
it was the full Dudamel.

1047
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,877
I want you to take over IR
for all of Axe Cap.

1048
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:56,558
- Formally.
- I have a job.

1049
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,478
You still have it.

1050
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,563
This job is better.

1051
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,399
More responsibility,
access.

1052
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,859
More money,
in case that matters.

1053
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,319
When doesn't it matter?

1054
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,571
When you're being untruthful
with yourself.

1055
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,448
Not a risk.

1056
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,076
It is quite the offer.

1057
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,954
And yet, I can't help but feel
I'm being used.

1058
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,900
So that you can isolate
Taylor even more.

1059
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:21,124
I thought we were past
Mase Cap paranoia.

1060
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,271
Is it paranoia?

1061
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:25,059
I'm using your talent.

1062
00:49:25,864 --> 00:49:28,043
If Taylor feels
similar appreciation,

1063
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:29,676
they'll bless this.

1064
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,173
Let me sleep on it.

1065
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,520
Thanks.

1066
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:42,479
Where'd we end up?

1067
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,897
Well, not where you were,

1068
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,148
not where you expected to be,

1069
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,817
but a very good place,
I believe.

1070
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,151
Solicitor General.

1071
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,486
Acting SG.

1072
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,696
Acting.
Of course.

1073
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,281
The price for
killing the memo.

1074
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,575
Indeed.
Everything stays nice and quiet.

1075
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,035
Well, useful to you too,
isn't it?

1076
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,079
With you as NYAG and me
on the federal bench,

1077
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,539
weren't gonna see me
that often.

1078
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,706
It'll be better this way.

1079
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,875
It's a prestigious post...

1080
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,377
and still an avenue
to the show.

1081
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,838
Two current Justices
were SGs before.

1082
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,048
Everyone gets everything
he wants, huh?

1083
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,592
I'm just glad I could
be a friend to you.

1084
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,011
Early dinner at Luger's?

1085
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,181
On me.

1086
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,738
Game's changed.

1087
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,949
No, game's the same...

1088
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:39,876
Fucking computer boys
scrape data and code algos.

1089
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:41,554
Slurp up all the alpha.

1090
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,796
Need to find a new way
to beat it.

1091
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:45,930
Market's closed, player,

1092
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:48,462
nothing left for you
on that screen until morning.

1093
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,754
But I'm here.

1094
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,256
What did you have in mind?

1095
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:56,470
Why don't you show me those new
cup holders in the mini‐v...?

1096
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,017
How 'bout a raincheck.

1097
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,271
I think I need
some alone time...

1098
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,582
Is Taylor here?

1099
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,751
They just
got back.

1100
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,128
Tea?

1101
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,212
I'm gonna roll dry.

1102
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,226
Imagine you know about Lauren
lending herself out to Axe Cap?

1103
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,193
And I imagine
you know that

1104
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:47,771
she's been asked to make it
a permanent detail.

1105
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,397
I did not.

1106
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,815
Are you going to
agree to that?

1107
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,817
She wants to do it.
It's a good opportunity.

1108
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,569
She'll rep both shops.

1109
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,363
And that's all right?
It's how it is.

1110
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,365
And if I don't like it?
I don't know what to tell you.

1111
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,825
There's a lot I don't like.
Doesn't mean I can change it.

1112
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:17,481
- Pop‐quiz, hot shot.
- Mm.

1113
00:52:18,372 --> 00:52:20,761
Not really a pop‐quiz.
I'm fully prepared.

1114
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,139
Where did I put
Adam DeGiulio?

1115
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,559
Solicitor General?

1116
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,602
What was wrong with
the Second Circuit?

1117
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,230
Served him, not you.

1118
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,648
The New York
Attorney General

1119
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,115
doesn't get before them
very often.

1120
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,401
Why Solicitor General then?

1121
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,321
You lost your New York
criminal jurisdiction

1122
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,238
to the Manhattan D. A.
Mm‐hmm.

1123
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,031
So maybe we go
big game hunting

1124
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:44,119
in another neck of the woods...
like the Supreme Court?

1125
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,538
And wouldn't you know
who decides

1126
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,582
who gets to argue
before the Court:

1127
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,041
Solicitor fucking General.

1128
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,003
I get up in front of the Nine,
I'm taking you with.

1129
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:56,298
Oh, damn straight.

1130
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,722
Did you, uh...

1131
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:07,559
you leak that memo to the
senator in the first place?

1132
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,478
I, uh, put it in motion

1133
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,023
before I made my deal
with the Dark Passenger.

1134
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,442
And it was too late
to pull it back.

1135
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,862
And you'd never do a friend
like that anymore, right?

1136
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,741
Right?

1137
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,661
Good thing we don't
have to know that today.

1138
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,709
We've got something special
for you tonight.

1139
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,252
I hope you've all
kept your appetite

1140
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:37,047
'cause we brought
a little bit of Brooklyn up here

1141
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:39,282
to Mohonk
Mountain House.

1142
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:42,052
From Lilia,
Chef Missy Robbins

1143
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,655
and her partner,
Sean Feeney.

1144
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,625
We're so excited for you to try
one of my favorite pasta dishes,

1145
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,694
which is the dish that
reminds me every day

1146
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:49,687
how much I love to cook.

1147
00:53:49,772 --> 00:53:51,102
And we hope you enjoy.

1148
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,449
Give it to me.
Struck terms with Shenk.

1149
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,992
He loves
the Longriver piece.

1150
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,202
Was a dealmaker.

1151
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,788
I got my arms around Hakli
the same way.

1152
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,164
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

1153
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,169
It's been my privilege,
all Mike long,

1154
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,171
to fete so many of you.

1155
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,382
And it's good to end on
someone I respect so much.

1156
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:24,719
Someone I'm proud to
call a friend and a guide.

1157
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,304
And though he's late
in arriving,

1158
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,516
I think he's going to be
a big part of all of our lives.

1159
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,811
Please, a warm hand
for my key partner

1160
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,813
in a breakthrough
healthcare initiative...

1161
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,315
Shaman Bram Longriver.

1162
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,198
I feel a deep spiritual debt
to the man...

1163
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,289
but I nevertheless
feel compelled

1164
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,327
to separate his dick
from his balls.

1165
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:52,115
Mr. Longriver's going to share
some wisdom with us

1166
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,708
after dinner, but,
please, come say hi.

1167
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,257
You stole my shaman.

1168
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,135
He belongs to
the whole world.

1169
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,054
You didn't come
in the spirit of The Mike.

1170
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,432
You came to scuttle around
and take for yourself.

1171
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,142
But the game was
already over, man.

1172
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,144
I thought there was
enough for everybody.

1173
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,646
Success breeds success
and all that happy horse shit.

1174
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,261
You don't come to
a man's house...

1175
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:19,917
This isn't your house...
Close enough.

1176
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:22,986
Like I told ya: When I compete,
hell, I'm there to win.

1177
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,698
Well, hear me:
Game's not over, buddy boy.

1178
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,700
Not by a country
fucking mile.

1179
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,703
I'm aware.

1180
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,344
Look at those fat
fucking furballs...

1181
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:54,893
Wags, you ever get tired of
working for a living?

1182
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,436
Every damn day.

1183
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,606
But I've got a nasty addiction
called money.

1184
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:00,148
So I do what I do.

1185
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,149
You?

1186
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,026
No. Never.

1187
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,819
Until today.

1188
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,863
You know, they call us traders
'gamblers.'

1189
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,573
The world economy's
just one big casino,

1190
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:13,745
fueled by a giant debt bubble
and computer driven derivatives.

1191
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,306
And there's only
one thing better

1192
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:17,142
than being a gambler
at a casino.

1193
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:19,228
That's being the house.
That is right.

1194
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:21,408
There's a systemized machine
out there

1195
00:56:21,493 --> 00:56:23,254
sucking capital
from localities

1196
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,006
and injecting it into
the global markets...

1197
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,218
where it can be used to
speculate and manipulate.

1198
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,428
And if something goes wrong,
there are bailouts

1199
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,305
and bail‐ins,
federal aid and easing.

1200
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,308
Where the government
doesn't hunt you down,

1201
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,894
but instead gives you
a nice soft net to land in.

1202
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,088
That's your answer
to the fireside chat:

1203
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:41,478
You want to become a bank.

1204
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:42,607
I want to become a bank.

1205
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,775
In order to rob it?

1206
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,402
In order that
I don't have to.

1207
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,989
And to sleep
like they do.

1208
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,577
And to die
in my own fucking bed.

1209
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:14,138
Told ya:
done giving you info.

1210
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,849
Goes the other way.
I'm giving you information:

1211
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,894
I know what you did.

1212
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,064
Maybe selling me out
to Axe was a move.

1213
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:26,070
But maybe you're actually,
appallingly, under his sway.

1214
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:29,343
Doesn't matter.
There will come a time

1215
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,688
when you will be forced
to line up against Axe

1216
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:33,658
for your very survival.

1217
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:36,202
'Cause he's not capable
of a true alliance,

1218
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,830
only destruction.

1219
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,790
And if
such a time comes...

1220
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,835
When it does,
you will need me.

1221
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,254
Though I have
come to realize

1222
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,299
the ways in which
Axe and I are alike.

1223
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:55,346
We both are possessed of
and by a sort of monster.

1224
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,018
But unlike Axe,
I am in control of mine.

1225
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,478
I have a code.

1226
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,439
And I need that code?

1227
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,858
No.

1228
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:09,444
You need that monster.

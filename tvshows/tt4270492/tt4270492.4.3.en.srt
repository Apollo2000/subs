1
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,344
<i>Previously,
on</i> "Billions"...

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,968
I get we're in a game
that requires us to win.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:11,220
I got tired of beating up
on the defenseless.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,351
There are things they were
comfortable with at Axe Cap

5
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:14,976
that we will never
do here.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,765
You think that I let
the Attorney General

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,078
stick his hand up my ass
and run me like a sock puppet.

8
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm just glad
I got out of there

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,171
before I had to get
caught up in any of that.

10
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:24,101
Oh, I'm really glad
to see you here tonight,

11
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:25,773
in that Brioni suit,
which is the mark

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,695
of the lawyer who is
successful at everything

13
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,720
that doesn't really matter.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,414
There's no shame
in not being able to hack it

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,484
at the highest levels
of the real game,

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,570
but the revisionist history,
that's for your wife at home...

17
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,300
not for the man
who fucking knows better.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,804
We put out this fire by
sucking oxygen out of the room.

19
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,054
I'm glad to continue...
To renew...

20
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,796
Axe got to
all of the bankers.

21
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,562
Winston and the quant team have
a huge stat arb opportunity

22
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,050
that I'm gonna have to
leave on the table

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,093
if we don't lock in leverage
by end of week.

24
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,773
Mm.

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,594
Can I get the box?

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,350
This is working for me.

27
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:00,320
Please?

28
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,304
You once told me
you knew people who...

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,414
switched it up.

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,424
But that's not Chuck,
not his arousal template.

31
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,914
For him it's not a game.
It's rooted deep.

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,101
They are trying to hang you
from the yardarm.

33
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,609
Make them defend
instead of attack.

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,800
All I want is vengeance,
and it will be had.

35
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,226
And we all know
what I need to do it.

36
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,492
A perch.

37
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:24,134
If you try to again put yourself
in a position of public trust,

38
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,898
I will be forced to
let slip the dogs of war.

39
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:30,930
"I am chomping at the bit to be
your next Attorney General"!

40
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,220
Yes!

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,725
Couldn't establish
internal surveillance.

60
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:34,882
Fuck.

61
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,413
We knew Taylor wasn't
gonna leave a key

62
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,452
under the welcome mat.
Who set up their security,

63
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,850
fuckin' George Smiley?

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,546
No. Someone else.
I know him by reputation.

65
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:45,390
He's a good man.
Thorough.

66
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,140
I didn't come
entirely empty handed.

67
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,546
Mason Capital's
remote logins

68
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:53,858
haven't been given
adequate scrutiny yet.

69
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:57,424
They will soon, no doubt,
but for now...

70
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,061
It's not what you wanted,

71
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:03,050
but MaseCap's positions
and trading pattern.

72
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,260
Can we do anything
with that?

73
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,260
We can use size
to soak up the alpha.

74
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,220
It's not a body blow,
maybe not even worth the effort.

75
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:13,305
No, we can do something
with that.

76
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,220
Unsettle 'em.
Throw 'em off their game.

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,680
Buy up
the price on names

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,019
they want to increase
their size in.

79
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,222
Costing them upside

80
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,975
and picking tiny little
percentages off their profits.

81
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:25,058
It'll be like the old
water torture...

82
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:27,136
Drip, drip, drip.

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,180
Like the Japanese
in W.W.II.

84
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,995
Even though the Chinese
invented it...

85
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,433
No they didn't...

86
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,737
Then why is it called
'Chinese Water Torture?'

87
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,680
Taylor will
try to ignore it.

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,925
Tell themselves that it's just
a few bips here or there.

89
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,277
- But it won't work.
- Their need for

90
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:41,542
mathematical perfection

91
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:42,930
will erode
their well-being.

92
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,026
Then a real mistake
can be induced.

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,550
If you ever get tired
of working for him, call me.

94
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,010
Oh, she's not
going anywhere.

95
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,026
She's right, you know.
The Chinese didn't invent it.

96
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,596
Hippolytus de Marsiliis did,

97
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,260
an Italian.

98
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,720
- Morning, Peach.
- Morning.

99
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,720
Take a look.

100
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:20,300
Lock in all these positions,
Big Gulp size.

101
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,050
Excuse me, Axe.

102
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,600
There are other plays
that would yield more upside.

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,440
Yeah. We're limiting the upside
for someone else.

104
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:34,214
Oh.
Exciting.

105
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:36,448

I got chicken business
with you.

113
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,878
What do you know
about the Chicken Man?

114
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,917
What's the thing?

115
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:20,100
Arkansas Chicken Index.
You know?

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,765
Given that Arkansas
is a major chicken producer,

117
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,300
and you getting so geeked
you broke out the Boss for us,

118
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,220
I'm assuming it's an important
fucking index.

119
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,104
It's a market mover.
The numbers dictate the price.

120
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,604
And Chicken Man's the guy
who puts out.

121
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,073
the Arkansas
Chicken Index.

122
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,682
'Zactly.
Latest numbers land today.

123
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:34,760
We need to be long.

124
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,385
Because there won't
be any chickens?

125
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,760
It's better than that.
There's plenty of chickens.

126
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,100
And the early chicken action
is counting on that.

127
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:45,612
But Chicken Man will say
that there's very few chickens.

128
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,417
And the price
will skyrocket.

129
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,760
Why will he say that?

130
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,346
'Cause he's supposed
to drag his ass out

131
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,862
to multiple farms
and production houses

132
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:52,870
to get an accurate count.

133
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,659
But the guy's
Otis of Mayberry.

134
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,050
So he'll
go to one or two,

135
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,393
to make an
appearance, but that's it,

136
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,214
he's not counting shit.

137
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,081
What the guy
does is, he sits there.

138
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,594
on his couch and calls.

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,526
a few of
the major poultry producers.

140
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,157
and just asks
them for their numbers.

141
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,350
Yeah, I need to get
a report on the birds.

142
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,799
And they say
their numbers are low

143
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,510
'cause it keeps the prices high.
Right.

144
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,424
It's like a teacher letting
a kid grade his own tests.

145
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,508
If the Chicken Man
is wrong,

146
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:21,407
why does he get
to stay the Chicken Man?

147
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,953
Because he's wrong in the way
the producers want him to be.

148
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,682
They installed him.
And they keep him in place.

149
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,680
He's a chicken patsy.

150
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:30,971
I assume you've got
a solid source.

151
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,307
How do you know
the Mobilized Meals gal?

152
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,760
How do you know where
to find mustache wax?

153
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,651
If it's crucial,
you get it done.

154
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:51,917
What does he eat?

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,534
She says he's partial
to chicken.

156
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,042
Bill...

157
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:02,890
what's your level
of certainty?

158
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,698
I am not uncertain.

159
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,237
Size up the position.

160
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,930
Could mean
a 300 million dollar win.

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,307
It's time for Pericles
to stroll the Parthenon.

162
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,229
You smile,
shake some hands.

163
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,764
Like a pol on the hustings.
Which you are.

164
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,100
Make the important people
feel important.

165
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,628
If they were
really important,

166
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,424
they wouldn't need me
to make 'em feel that way.

167
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,344
As Michel Foucault said...

168
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,682
Save that falderal for someone
with nothing better to do

169
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,140
than to parse
your Ivory Tower crap.

170
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,776
Maybe I'll just
stay home.

171
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,550
Son, are you hungover?

172
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,667
Because it's one thing
for a governor

173
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,100
to start his day at 11 a.m.,

174
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,698
but a New York State
Attorney General

175
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,565
needs to be a credible sentinel
on the watchtower.

176
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,050
Not in the bag,

177
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,503
it's a migraine
wearing out its welcome.

178
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,010
Well, walk it off.

179
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:54,424
The leaders of Local 1199,

180
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,350
the Service Employees
International East,

181
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,100
will be here at my casino
for the opening...

182
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:00,331
Yours?

183
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,600
My land, so close enough.

184
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,300
Now, these guys represent
400,000 votes.

185
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,640
You've got
some glad-handing to do.

186
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:08,979
Oh, my God.

187
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,720
I heard that.

188
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,901
Do you think JFK complained
when Ol' Papa Joe

189
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:15,698
sat him down
with the steel workers?

190
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:19,140
You're delivering Schenectady,
Dad, not Ohio.

191
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,930
Schenectady is the Ohio
of New York State.

192
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,327
Be here.

193
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,100
Donna, did you get
more Excedrin?

194
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,140
All I got is Tums.

195
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,784
Does that help?

196
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,600
No. It really doesn't.

197
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:41,483
Can't say I'm sad
about that.

198
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:43,970
Oh. You're a real
empath, Lonnie.

199
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,350
My empathy
for you died the night

200
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,680
of your hateful soliloquy
at that restaurant.

201
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,850
Sympathy went too considering
you gave it in front of my wife.

202
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,390
Regrettable.

203
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,335
But like all men
of consequence,

204
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:57,218
we put it aside to move forward
toward our common goal.

205
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,844
Yeah.
We tried to do that.

206
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,140
But the fundraiser is off.

207
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,038
Getting behind me
is good for your firm.

208
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,538
You made them see that.

209
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,220
I rope in donations
from the partners,

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,304
you get to flaunt
your political clout.

211
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:09,991
You don't know there's
a missile coming at you.

212
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,804
I'm the hermit
kingdom right now.

213
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,108
Plenty of armament pointed
at me at all times.

214
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:16,850
No.
Not pointed.

215
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,559
Launched.

216
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:22,098
I got called for comment
on an article about you,

217
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,640
about an old case
that you failed to prosecute.

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,010
So did my firm's PR rep.
Because of the event.

219
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,880
Which case?

220
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:32,010
SugarVape.

221
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,489
Flavors designed
to hook kids.

222
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,426
Marketing
to target them.

223
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:39,223
And a whistleblower
you hung out to dry.

224
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,510
The guy didn't have the goods.
That case couldn't be won.

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,005
We would've looked
like schmucks on wheels

226
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,220
if I brought that
to court.

227
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,200
This editor
running the piece

228
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,434
seems to think that
his readers will find

229
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,264
the SugarVape CEO's relationship
with various members

230
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,426
of your father's social group
very titillating.

231
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,559
Fuck.

232
00:09:58,905 --> 00:09:59,844
Which editor?

233
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,450
Lucien Porter.

234
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,458
Don't cancel
the fundraiser.

235
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,778
Oh, I will spike that article.
You know I will.

236
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,067
Why should I?

237
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,275
You finally have
the advantage on me.

238
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:17,991
You keep this alive,
I actually owe you.

239
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,184
Tell you
what I'll do.

240
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,680
- I'll hold off for now.
- Uh-huh.

241
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,300
But at a certain point,

242
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,390
this is gonna be
out of my hands.

243
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,565
So why don't you

244
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,470
get that Excedrin

245
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,989
and do what
you have to do.

246
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:51,800
Something
isn't right.

247
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,036
Explain the discrepancy

248
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:54,800
between realized gains
and expectations.

249
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,522
And don't you
dare blame latency.

250
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:57,934
Okay...

251
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,304
Transaction costs were
a little higher than we modeled.

252
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,983
There seems to be more
adverse selection

253
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,030
than we anticipated...
Can we just say it?

254
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,350
We're getting
front run somehow.

255
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,694
Obviously.
This is about the how...

256
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,600
Man, I fucking knew it.

257
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,311
There was something unnatural
about the way

258
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:12,430
we were getting
sawed off.

259
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,532
I even started an email
to let you know.

260
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:15,964
I'm Cassandra,

261
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,663
always seeing
the future.

262
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,139
You never
sent the email.

263
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,180
The difference between
you and Cassandra is:

264
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,890
She didn't wait until after
the fact to say it aloud.

265
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,475
Pwned like
in the aughts!

266
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,212
It's pronounced "owned."
Which, yes.

267
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,350
I only thought it
but didn't say it.

268
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,155
Doesn't count.
Damnit...

269
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:36,179
Finish this
at your desks.

270
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,470
You have it?

271
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,225
- Axelrod.
- Yes.

272
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:46,680
Couldn't have been
a huge money maker for him.

273
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,991
So his objective
wasn't profit.

274
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,260
It was disruption.

275
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,413
Strategy was to get in my head,
make me obsess over it.

276
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,921
And I did,
for a minute.

277
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,491
- Should we involve Grigor?
- No.

278
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:00,311
Can't seem dependent
on him in that way.

279
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:02,686
But we do need to seal the
cracks in our infrastructure.

280
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:04,389
I'll make sure Cook
is on top of it.

281
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,725
Thank you.

282
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,507
Yes?

283
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,577
Send him up.

284
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,702
Nice to see you.

285
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,039
And you.

286
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,569
So.

287
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,561
This is your shop?

288
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,452
This is my shop.

289
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,616
Not much to it,
is there?

290
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,249
Don't places like these
usually spend

291
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,725
buckets of money on nice digs
to impress their clients?

292
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,138
You don't want
to seem gilded.

293
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,961
Highlight
the brain power instead.

294
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,461
Clean. Simple.
Direct.

295
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,187
That's how we make
an impression now.

296
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,976
Simple or not,
it's nice.

297
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:56,704
It's...

298
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:57,968
cool.

299
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,430
I guess could be a word.

300
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,970
How about I have my executing
trader give you a tour.

301
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:04,226
Neat.

302
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:10,464
Mafee, I'd like you
to meet Douglas Mason.

303
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,220
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Mason.

304
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,300
Yes. This is...

305
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,010
He's my father.

306
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay.

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,781
There comes a time, Lucien,
when ideology meets reality.

308
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,046
Even in
the newspaper business.

309
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:33,680
And that's when we Oddfellows
swallow petty grievances

310
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,312
and divine
a productive way forward.

311
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,281
Your theatrical way
of asking me to kill

312
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,570
the SugarVape story?

313
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,100
On a nice afternoon in
your next incarnation,

314
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,760
maybe.

315
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:49,226
I'm working on a tighter
schedule than that.

316
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:52,062
"You used to think
that it was so easy,

317
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,437
you used to say
that it was so easy.

318
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,514
But you're trying,
you're trying now."

319
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,172
Doobies?
Doobie Brothers?

320
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,484
Gerry Rafferty.

321
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,289
My first job was writing
record reviews...

322
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,262
You remember stuff.

323
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,750
I'll tell you what else
I remember:

324
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:08,218
You didn't take me down to
Baker Street when you could've.

325
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,760
If you had, we could come
to an agreeable compromise

326
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,437
now over milkshakes
and handjobs.

327
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,350
But you didn't.

328
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,148
I get that your ass
is chapped, Lucien...

329
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,359
When you were
US Attorney,

330
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:20,172
you dealt your goods
all over the place.

331
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:21,510
But not to me.

332
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,961
You wanna go to Baker Street,
baby, we'll go now.

333
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,538
Tell me how
I can serve you.

334
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,742
The reason I came here is:
I want your comment

335
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,344
on the story
I am running.

336
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,720
Why did you bow to pressure
and fail to prosecute?

337
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:37,187
Who'd you make
the sweetheart deal with?

338
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:42,445
What do you think happens
when a man resorts to threats

339
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,804
in an effort to solicit
my attention?

340
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,265
What do you think happens
to that man

341
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:52,050
when I'm seated in
the State AG's office?

342
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,898
That's assuming you win.

343
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,336
And if I were the sort of fella
who liked to throw the dice,

344
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,970
that's not the direction
I'd toss 'em.

345
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,695
You should know,
that's not how dice work.

346
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,760
You're not the only man in
this town with a dick to swing.

347
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,320
- You've got enemies.
- Oh.

348
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,640
I've got a good idea
about who they are.

349
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:10,773
Who put you up on this nonsense.
I won't say the names.

350
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:14,720
But I will say: I've found
their help comes cheap.

351
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:16,914
Hell,
sometimes free.

352
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,656
Oh. You're too old not to know
that what's free is flimsy.

353
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,010
You want this story
to be true so badly

354
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,249
that it's got
you believing in unicorns.

355
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:28,180
No.
Nothing so exotic as that.

356
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,265
Just corruption.

357
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:33,515
Yours.
Porter.

358
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,609
"This city desert
makes you feel so cold.

359
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:41,148
It's got so many people,
but it's got no soul."

360
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,531
Remember that.

361
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,304
I'm offering you a glimpse
of the future:

362
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:49,383
You publish that piece,

363
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,674
it'll backfire.

364
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,078
First round of pink slime is
on me after this baby comes in.

365
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,320
- That stuff is horrifying.
- I don't mind it.

366
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,195
We can fry it,
with some hot chiles,

367
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,297
or use it as a base
for soup and...

368
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:21,976
Here it is.

369
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,679
What?

370
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,219
Problems
in Chickenland?

371
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:32,140
The motherfucking
report's delayed.

372
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,390
Why?

373
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:35,914
Motherfuck if I know.

374
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,720
I need to get
with Mobilized Meals.

375
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,898
Find out why Chicken Man's
in the vapor.

376
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:05,258
- Where you going?
- Arkansas.

377
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,031
To fix this.

378
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:10,100
I looked at the gap
in our cyber defense.

379
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,260
I identified the vulnerability
and stitched it up crudely,

380
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,788
but it's gonna take a day or two
to reliably address the issue.

381
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,577
Make it a day,
not two.

382
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,179
You got it.

383
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:22,550
Thank you, Cook.

384
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,970
Keep Sara in the loop
on this.

385
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,226
Ran it by her first.

386
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,010
...Just the most considerate kid
you'd ever seen.

387
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,296
No, not considerate like
she did nice things for people.

388
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,720
Considered like
she was always

389
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,577
measuring information
around her.

390
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:48,850
That sounds about right.

391
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,680
Only now they're considerate
in both ways.

392
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,093
No, no,
she was sweet, too.

393
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:56,413
When she was real little,
she always told me

394
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,499
that when she grew up
she wanted to marry me.

395
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,101
Now I wonder what I should
have read into that.

396
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,663
Affection.

397
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,359
And that when I was six,
I didn't know that many people.

398
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,335
Well, it was cute, anyway.

399
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,312
I got some work
to do.

400
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,054
Douglas, it was a pleasure
talking with you.

401
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,335
Thank you for
showing me around.

402
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,366
Excluding you,
every person you see

403
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,100
in this office
is under my employ.

404
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,220
They have chosen to work here
because they respect me

405
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,632
and they respect my vision.
They're smart to.

406
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,046
In the future, if you find
yourself in conversation

407
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,429
with one of them,
pay close attention

408
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:31,577
to the pronouns they use
in reference to me.

409
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,220
This talk again, huh?

410
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,470
You came to see me.
I thought you were ready.

411
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,174
To use your
"preferred pronouns..."

412
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,550
They're the ones used
by those who respect me.

413
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,040
Without the quotes.

414
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:45,056
I'm sorry, kid.
I'm trying to get there.

415
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,220
I missed ya.
That's why I'm here.

416
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,384
- Yes?
- Can I...?

417
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,680
Speak freely.

418
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,556
I just got
off the phone

419
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,640
with Grigor Andolov's
number two.

420
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:00,446
He wants to know
"when you're going to start

421
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,134
fucking earning?"

422
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,259
Now.

423
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,550
I just decided to work
on a derivative.

424
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:11,010
What kind of derivative?

425
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,640
- An homage to Vadim Linetsky.
- Oh.

426
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,555
You're in a 'path integral
methods' sort of mood, are you?

427
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:18,063
Would you like
to help me?

428
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:19,640
You bet.

429
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,510
You fucked me.

430
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,970
Closed the damn gate,
left me north of the wall.

431
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:33,680
I got fired.

432
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:35,845
- And went bankrupt.
- Yes.

433
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,688
Those things
did happen.

434
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:40,759
And I feel for you,
for what you've been through.

435
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:41,899
But them's the breaks?

436
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,510
Well... yes.

437
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,649
You didn't have
the evidence.

438
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,100
All those kids on
the street exhaling

439
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,907
these big ass clouds
of piña colada poison?

440
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,050
They're my evidence.

441
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,829
But you were a whistleblower
without a whistle.

442
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,134
I did the right thing.
You said you'd help.

443
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,850
You brought me on.

444
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,024
And then you yanked the rug
and I ended up on my ass.

445
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,600
And now you're running
for I-don't-know-what-the-fuck,

446
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,087
and I'm living
with my mom.

447
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,300
This is your
mom's house, huh?

448
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,595
And there's like six kids
on this block alone

449
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,688
that I gotta watch sucking
on these SugarVape products

450
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:19,970
like they're pacifiers.

451
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,876
Would you have preferred
that your mother

452
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:24,720
lose this place
after she mortgaged it

453
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,602
to help you pay
for the massive civil suit.

454
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:30,040
SugarVape would have
brought against you?

455
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,602
You didn't think of that,
did you?

456
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,376
I wouldn't let her do that.

457
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,243
They have professionals
on staff

458
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:40,850
whose only job is:
sell their bullshit.

459
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,600
That's what
corporations do.

460
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,102
If they're willing
to poison kids for profit,

461
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,800
nothing's off
the table.

462
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,470
- Fuck. You're right.
- Yeah.

463
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,470
I shielded you...
And your mother...

464
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,260
From the retribution SugarVape
was prepared to unleash.

465
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,720
But if you let that article run,
they'll sue.

466
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,282
And they'll go after your mom,
because she's got the money...

467
00:20:58,368 --> 00:20:59,350
They'll take her house.

468
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,180
Her furniture.
Her paintings...

469
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,196
And I'm not
in the position

470
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,930
to protect you anymore.

471
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:13,259
What can I do?

472
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,431
If you want,

473
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,260
I can tell you how
to walk back your statements.

474
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,800
Good news, Lonnie.

475
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,367
I've coaxed the genie
back into his bottle.

476
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:35,350
Article ain't happening.

477
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,460
So your firm can host
my fundraiser

478
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,376
and we can continue
this little symbiosis of ours.

479
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,945
Another fucking
chicken farm.

480
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,274
Actually
that one's not a farm.

481
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,140
It's a quarantine facility.
Sick birds.

482
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:07,821
Gross.

483
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:10,344
Try him again.

484
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:13,532
I've called him a dozen times.
He's not answering.

485
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:18,407
Maybe somebody else got to him,
paid him to fuck up the index.

486
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,680
Hall, what do
you have?

487
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:31,464
Well, they sealed up
the cracks in their system.

488
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,640
We lost
digital access.

489
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,600
We knew they would.
But that was quick, no?

490
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,220
Like I said: I know their guy.
He's got some moves.

491
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,922
Anyway, digital access is gone,
but I have what's left to us.

492
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:44,477
- What's that?
- A visual.

493
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,672
How?

494
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,640
You have something
on one of their employees?

495
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:50,470
Taylor would be able to root
out a guilty conscience.

496
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,640
Most people who want
privacy in this city

497
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,430
have privacy glass.

498
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,618
If they don't, they have
their windows treated.

499
00:22:56,828 --> 00:22:58,977
That is privacy glass.
Of course it is.

500
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:01,110
You're telling me Taylor
doesn't have privacy glass?

501
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,282
They do.

502
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:03,766
But I have this...

503
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,289
It's Israeli.

504
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,050
It uses a spatial
light modulator,

505
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,640
and that allows me
to take pictures

506
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
that people don't
want me to take.

507
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,134
Very handy.

508
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,470
The Israelis
do not fuck around

509
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,680
when it comes
to their spy equipment.

510
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,657
But why is it
in your hands

511
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:26,430
instead of set up
taking goddamned pictures.

512
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,828
Oh, it is.
This one's for personal use.

513
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,438
Don't you love the notation
for bolding?

514
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:48,657
The double stem?

515
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:50,140
Yes. I do.

516
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,760
Finding a satisfying answer
is a good thing.

517
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,664
Probably why you and I were
always at our best

518
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,760
when we kept things
mathematical.

519
00:23:57,846 --> 00:24:00,418
Sure. But even when one
keeps things mathematical,

520
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,800
a satisfying solution
isn't always available.

521
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,930
So you change
the math.

522
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,891
Human beings can't
command math.

523
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,532
You can't bend it to your will.
It doesn't exist to satisfy you.

524
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:13,727
This is an example.

525
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,100
Linetsky knew if he were
to create a derivative,

526
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,600
it would develop organically
in a way he couldn't control.

527
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,157
His only options were
to learn to understand

528
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,680
and accept where it was
taking him, or step away.

529
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,149
He had to be able
to live with that.

530
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,303
Yeah.

531
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:31,414
We're all trying
to understand and accept.

532
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:48,970
Casa de Chicken?

533
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,390
This is it.

534
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,298
I told you
he wasn't around.

535
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,087
Oh fuck...

536
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,173
He's fucking dead?

537
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,986
Most people don't
nap in that position, so yeah.

538
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,548
Dead seems like
a real safe bet.

539
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:15,986
Get out of there.

540
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:17,890
Figure out who's gonna
take his place.

541
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,760
and find a way to motivate
that person in our direction.

542
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,525
Otherwise your chicken business
will consist of you asking:

543
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,939
you want original recipe
or extra fucking crispy?

544
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,486
On top of it...

545
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,890
Chicken Man is dead.

546
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,822
And so is our position
unless Bill can figure out

547
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:36,259
a way to defibrillate it...

548
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:40,431
Anything on tap?

549
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,260
Order in.
School night.

550
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,760
- Yeah. Me too...
- You!

551
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,876
- Fuck you, Connerty.
- What am I missing?

552
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:51,853
Your boss here fed me
a bogus story.

553
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:53,392
What? No I didn't.

554
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,204
Ray Cruz just
rescinded his offer

555
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,180
to go on record
for the article.

556
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,103
Now why would he do that
if the whole story

557
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,673
wasn't bullshit
from the start?

558
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,572
I'm not sure,
but the story's not bullshit.

559
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:04,028
You know, Chuck Rhoades
tried to warn me

560
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:05,494
you were
smoke screening me.

561
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,720
I should have listened to him,
but I...

562
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Uh. Excuse me.
Hi. I'm Kate Sacker.

563
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,100
- Lucien Porter, editor of...
- I know who you are.

564
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:13,720
And I know
the SugarVape case well.

565
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I have no idea
what Chuck told you about it,

566
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,470
but I do know
that he's motivated to lie

567
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,254
for his own benefit
on this one.

568
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,918
Doesn't matter.

569
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,562
Cruz isn't going
on record anymore.

570
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,738
I've got a big chunk
of empty column space.

571
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,918
And you've been
a fat waste of time.

572
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,600
Start thinking
of a make-up call.

573
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,930
It's the least
of what I'm owed.

574
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,777
Listen, whatever Chuck
pulled with Cruz,

575
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,949
I will undo tomorrow.

576
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,973
I will do this because I can,
and because I'm generous...

577
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,363
Which you will see
in the near future.

578
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,779
In return,
give us a day.

579
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,600
And when Cruz corroborates,
you'll be able to

580
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:45,010
run your story as planned.

581
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:54,445
Mmm.

582
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,140
You could not get uni
like this back home.

583
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,930
Back home is hundreds of miles
from any body of water.

584
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,390
Yeah. But you know
it's all frozen

585
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,800
on the boat and flown in,
anyways.

586
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,380
- Right?
- I'm aware.

587
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:07,833
But the best stuff
gets bought up

588
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,167
at the New York
fish market

589
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,884
before the rest of it
gets loaded onto the plane

590
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,481
for the short hop flight.

591
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:21,903
Thing of beauty,
isn't it?

592
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,930
All written out
like this.

593
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,200
It is.

594
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:31,600
Hey kid.

595
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,380
You know
I don't think that

596
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,966
'woke' stuff is all worthless
or for idiots

597
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:37,692
just because
I'm no good at it.

598
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:38,974
Right?

599
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,849
I know it matters.

600
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,239
Right.

601
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:06,224
Do I need
a girlfriend?

602
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:08,770
Do you?

603
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,684
Suddenly have a craving
for antiquing

604
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,800
and long walks
in the Hamptons?

605
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,263
Post-brunch reach-arounds
anyway...

606
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,115
Got something for you.

607
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:26,050
It's a giant
Reggie Bar, right?

608
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,220
Better.

609
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:28,824
Let's see it.

610
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:38,764
You lied.

611
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,770
It's not better
than a Reggie Bar.

612
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:40,848
There's no nougat.

613
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,050
Reggie Bar didn't have
nougat either.

614
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:47,098
But it was a thing of beauty.
Like this.

615
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:52,169
This is the can opener
in the fallout shelter.

616
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:53,640
Nicely done.

617
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,005
My pleasure.
Enjoy.

618
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:01,680
Wiki me up to speed.

619
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:04,122
Taylor knows I'm front-running
their positions.

620
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,720
They figured it out.

621
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,140
This is their solution to that,
how they're gonna spin it

622
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,430
to pick up the basis points
that we were stealing.

623
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,850
Obvious.

624
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,300
So obvious...

625
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,600
You don't need to come
to the casino thing.

626
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,138
If you're not up for it,
I mean.

627
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:32,630
Of course I do.

628
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,013
I thought killing
that article

629
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,349
would have cured
this migraine.

630
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,489
They're tension
headaches.

631
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,864
Well, there is
one practice

632
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,716
I've found helpful
in tension relief...

633
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,888
I'm not a dispensary
handing out palliative care.

634
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,220
But if you're in the mood
for something mutual,

635
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:04,075
I can go make sure
the kids are asleep.

636
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:07,184
I've literally got
the proverbial...

637
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,747
Headache.

638
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:10,720
Sure.

639
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:15,600
Really, Wend.

640
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,100
I don't want to drag you
up there with me if it's...

641
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,731
You can pretend
you're not a politician,

642
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,364
and I can pretend
I'm not a politician's wife.

643
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,598
But we agreed getting you back
to being a prosecutor,

644
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,260
it's your calling.

645
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,020
So that's where we are
right now. And what we are.

646
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,344
You're right.

647
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:32,970
I know, you're right.

648
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,302
And you still have
those headaches...

649
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:36,645
because, article or not,

650
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,430
Jock and Connerty
are still coming after you.

651
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,760
Right about that too.

652
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,760
Just not sure what to do
about it yet.

653
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,140
Ow.

654
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,800
We got
six more stops.

655
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,220
Let's get a good, quick count,
and we'll be on the road.

656
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,890
Ah, shit.

657
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,473
They've sent
in the flying squad.

658
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,927
There's fucking
seven of them.

659
00:32:57,013 --> 00:33:00,098
Well, then you got six more guys
to deal with than anticipated.

660
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:02,079
What are the chances
they can all be bought?

661
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:03,255
It doesn't look good.

662
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:04,833
Arnold Rothstein bought
the White Sox,

663
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,169
including Shoeless Joe.

664
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:07,724
Get it done.

665
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,513
All nighter?

666
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,263
I always forget
you can do the math.

667
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:15,895
What can't I do?

668
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,434
Field surgery?

669
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,528
Keep talking,
we'll find out.

670
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:26,364
If you don't mind my asking,
why the cold feet?

671
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:29,304
Man who hangs kitten-Jesus
in his living room

672
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,760
doesn't usually
get cold feet.

673
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,850
It's my ma's.
I'm an atheist.

674
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:34,430
Sure.

675
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,350
- Well.
- It's not cold feet.

676
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,550
I just...
I can't risk what I got left.

677
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,770
And I definitely don't want
to put my ma in danger.

678
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,305
Yeah. I know it's been
a hard ride for you.

679
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,513
But it's not
an outrageous question.

680
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,013
Right when you have a chance
to get some steam

681
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,583
behind your case
with this article,

682
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,333
right when you almost have
the justice that you deserve,

683
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:56,260
publicly,
you back out.

684
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,720
I just want to know why.

685
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,260
I really appreciate
you looking out

686
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,919
for the little guy in the ring,
and that you think

687
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,955
it's the right thing to do
to stand in his corner.

688
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:05,890
But it isn't.

689
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:07,484
No.

690
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:10,594
The right thing is to get
his ass out of the ring

691
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,220
so he's not
taking punches.

692
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,390
No, the right thing to do
is to get Triple G

693
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,872
to go in the ring for him
and fuck the other guy up.

694
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,036
So come on.

695
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,849
I'm the Triple G
of the Southern District.

696
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:26,510
Lemme get in the ring
for you.

697
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,536
And I'm sure you are.
But no thanks.

698
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,300
At the end of the day,
I just don't wanna get sued.

699
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:35,890
Mm. So that's
what you think.

700
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,800
Yeah.

701
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,434
Well, I have an idea
who told you that.

702
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:43,760
But Chuck Rhoades
lied to you.

703
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:45,809
He said
you'd say that.

704
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,677
Did he also remember to tell you
about your payout?

705
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,596
SugarVape's not gonna sue you.
Or your mother.

706
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,393
You're going to sue them.
And you're gonna score.

707
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:58,550
Wait, what?

708
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,390
- I am?
- That's right.

709
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,800
Because I'm going
to prosecute SugarVape myself,

710
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,807
and even though I cannot
promise a conviction,

711
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,018
I can promise that
I will make damn sure

712
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:11,503
to bring out all the facts
that'll allow you to qualify

713
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,640
as a federal
whistleblower.

714
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,518
And get paid.

715
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,049
Big time.

716
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:24,930
Your guest room
is comfortable.

717
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,350
Flatscreen in there...

718
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,485
4K?

719
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:28,815
Five.

720
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:33,979
You know,
you make me proud.

721
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,682
My little girl
did well for herself.

722
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,018
I'm sorry.

723
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,260
To me, you're still
my little girl.

724
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,167
No, I'm not.

725
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:45,600
You were once.

726
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,346
Not really.

727
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,470
Well, I'm proud.

728
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:52,229
You challenge yourself.
Even more than I do.

729
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,229
See?

730
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:56,874
You put the spoon on the bottom;
it's harder than the fork.

731
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:58,680
Only one point of contact
with the surface

732
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,729
as opposed
to a full line.

733
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,159
Harder.

734
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:08,978
You win.

735
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,550
You know
you get it from me.

736
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,300
Define "it."

737
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,956
That unyielding compulsion
to get it right.

738
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,760
Precision.
Perfection.

739
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,714
Just like me.

740
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,050
If you want, you can stick
around for a few more days.

741
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,379
Yeah?

742
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:25,230
Your mother won't miss me
getting in her way

743
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,168
back home
for a little while longer.

744
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,472
Of course, I'll have to eat
the cost of the flight home,

745
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,440
but it's worth it.
I'll pay for it.

746
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:32,866
I wasn't...

747
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,550
All this?

748
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,480
I could have done it.

749
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,265
But they didn't even have
hedge funds back then.

750
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,890
Not that I'd heard of.
So I went aerospace.

751
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,640
Figured I'd build
something...

752
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,890
I wish I'd been able
to give it all to you,

753
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,547
is what I'm saying.

754
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:56,109
Ah.

755
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,745
Don't listen to me, kid.
Just rambling.

756
00:36:58,831 --> 00:36:59,961
Okay.

757
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:01,539
I won't.

758
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:03,969
Well.

759
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,148
I'm glad we'll have
more time together.

760
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:07,570
I am too.

761
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,430
I'm glad
you're happy.

762
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,765
I hate to interrupt you
while you're on the verge

763
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,890
of solving pi,

764
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,969
but they're about to put out
a new count on the bird surplus.

765
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:32,850
Shit...
Shit...

766
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:35,890
Number's high.
We're out of position.

767
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,820
Costing us plenty.

768
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:44,297
Fuckin' Bill.
Bill!

769
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,220
I got a solution
to our chicken problem...

770
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,852
A final solution.

771
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:52,470
Bill?!

772
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,359
Did he just say...?

773
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:59,734
Oh shit,
it's a chicken holocaust.

774
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:48,054
Shit.

775
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:58,260
Fuck!

776
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,970
I guess you can hear the bells
ringing for the departed

777
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,720
from all the way Upstate.

778
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:25,470
Son, did you actually
prosecute anyone

779
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,680
when you were
US Attorney?

780
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm skipping
the casino.

781
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:32,300
Damage control is best performed
without an audience.

782
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,523
And yes, by the way, thousands.
Most successfully.

783
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:37,010
So you say.

784
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,094
And absolutely not
on skipping this event.

785
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,820
It's more important
than ever that you show up.

786
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:42,211
We both know
your fundraiser's.

787
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,273
gonna be canceled,
if it hasn't been already.

788
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,641
You hide in shame now
and people will wonder

789
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,461
what other weaknesses
and depravities

790
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:50,720
there are to discover.

791
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,300
You'll get up here,
wear a nice suit,

792
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:55,820
put your arm around

Bill.

804
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,680
Bill, what are
you about to do?

805
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:47,680
What I always do for you:
whatever I have to.

806
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:49,617
Yes, but specifically,

807
00:40:49,703 --> 00:40:51,343
what are you about to do
right now?

808
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:54,523
What's in the bag, Bill,
what's in the bag?

809
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:58,242
A capon with a case
of H5N1-B.

810
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:59,859
Just enough
to freeze transport

811
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:02,172
on a few hundred thousand
infected birds.

812
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:04,680
Prices will
skyrocket.

813
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,351
You intend to kill a few
hundred thousand chickens?

814
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:08,680
They're getting
killed anyway.

815
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,328
This just accelerates
the process, that's all.

816
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:12,516
That's a good point.
Right, so...

817
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,601
But there is
a cost-benefit analysis

818
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:16,125
to take into
consideration here...

819
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:18,555
That of poisoning
the food supply.

820
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:20,773
One I am familiar with.
As you know.

821
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:23,180
One that requires
meticulous calibration.

822
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,008
Or else we're all
in Contagion:

823
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:26,430
Gwyneth Paltrow
dead on the gurney

824
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,890
and Matt Damon as the last
living man on earth.

825
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,883
If I don't do this...

826
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:33,391
...it's gonna
be a huge loss.

827
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:36,100
- He's right about that.
- It's okay.

828
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,102
It's not okay!

829
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:40,117
I'm the guy
who delivers.

830
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:41,930
Yeah.
Most of the time, you are.

831
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:45,391
But, and I can't believe
I'm fucking saying this:

832
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,555
we can't all be right
all of the time.

833
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:52,550
Sometimes...

834
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:55,350
you just gotta
take a loss.

835
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,625
Forget it, Bill.

836
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,180

All of them.

901

Nice spot...
For one of us to go over.

902

I don't want to be

Yeah.

904
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,016
I got that you were
proposing armistice

905
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:16,930
the second I looked
at the algorithm.

906
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:20,266
But you should have considered
the joys of peace

907
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:22,680
before you assassinated
the Archduke.

908
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:25,180
It's a distraction.
To me, and to you.

909
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:28,531
It prevents us both from
operating at our full potential.

910
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:30,789
Oh. So you'd like to
calm the blood feud

911
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,640
for the sake
of self-actualization?

912
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,359
I'd like to end it because
it's the rational thing to do.

913
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:37,570
That's convenient,
that you can fall back

914
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:39,195
on what's rational
just 'cause you don't like

915
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:40,600
the consequences
of your actions.

916
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,969
Bullshit.

917
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,500
You're frustrated.

918
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,461
Good.

919
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:47,970
It's gonna get worse.

920
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,836
You're not
seeing the board:

921
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,617
You walked into a trap
with Grigor.

922
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,719
You bought into
a worthless robotics company

923
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,350
to deny me leverage,
which I got anyway.

924
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,850
And now you've killed a day
going through a numbers game.

925
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,742
And here you are.
And here you are.

926
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:03,100
Unable to operate
unencumbered.

927
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,100
Waiting for
the next attack.

928
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,008
Wondering where
it's gonna come from.

929
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:08,510
Yes.
Sure.

930
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,078
But you aren't able
to operate freely either.

931
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,930
You're planning attacks.
Then defending from a response.

932
00:48:14,211 --> 00:48:15,300
Let's stop.

933
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,000
Not waste ourselves
on each other.

934
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:19,633
Our time and energy
are too valuable.

935
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:22,945
Is that all?

936
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:27,422
I'll offer you attractive terms
to invest in my firm.

937
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:29,164
The Street will know
that I am blessed by you,

938
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,414
but also,
that I am giving you a look.

939
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:35,640
In reality, I won't be
giving you that look...

940
00:48:35,774 --> 00:48:37,453
And since I sealed our leaks
you won't be getting them

941
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,930
on your own either.

942
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,578
But the story will be enough
for it to appear

943
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:42,328
that you are
in the dominant position.

944
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:47,703
Okay.

945
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:49,562
Fine.

946
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:51,969
Can I trust you
on this?

947
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,211
You're the fucking genius,
figure it out.

948
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,430
Did you agree
to a truce?

949
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:14,050
Did they buy it?

950
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:16,172
Well.
They're a trusting person.

951
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:18,086
So we'll see.

952
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,984
Time to set up
the next part.

953
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,680
<i>♪ Steel bars
wrapped all around me ♪ plays...</i>

954
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,430
<i>♪ I've been your prisoner
since the day you found me ♪</i>

955
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:41,140
<i>♪ I'm bound forever
till the end of time ♪</i>

956
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,640
<i>♪ Steel bars ♪</i>

957
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
<i>♪ Steel bars ♪</i>

958
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,720
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

959
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,430
It's incredible.

960
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,850
He's never stopped.

961
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,350
He's never let
his audience down.

962
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,510
Never quit on them.
Yeah.

963
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,578
And they never quit
on him, either.

964
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,234
Some are built
that way.

965
00:50:07,844 --> 00:50:09,470
The rest of them quit

966
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,672
or die...

967
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:15,758
That's the way
a legend oughta be.

968
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,477
That's the way
a legend oughta be.

969
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,140
I'll never quit.

970
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,805
I'll never die.

971
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:34,141
Head still
pounding, huh?

972
00:50:34,227 --> 00:50:35,397
Yeah.

973
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,055
Don't worry about
all these motherfuckers, my boy.

974
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:43,470
Just stay standing.

975
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:47,180
Longer than the next guy.
And the guy after that.

976
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,930
Do whatever you need to do
to outlast him.

977
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,445
If he loses,

978
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,453
you win, son.

979
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,600
Please
welcome back

980
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:11,720
Michael Bolton!

981
00:51:18,266 --> 00:51:20,720
The difference
between us, Bob...

982
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:23,300
One of the many...is:

983
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:25,992
I've spent the last
8 or so years

984
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:27,961
putting people in jail.

985
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:31,466
You've spent them making people
unbelievably wealthy.

986
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,841
Mm. My way tends
to gather more friends.

987
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,623
That it does.

988
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:39,060
And yet,
here we are.

989
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:40,896
Friends.

990
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,037
Of a sort.

991
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,763
Oh, I have traded pleasantries
and handshakes

992
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:58,380
with some truly
disagreeable people.

993
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:02,599
And whatever it says about me
as a person, I'll admit,

994
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:04,800
I'm willing to do it

995
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,904
with a million more of them
to achieve my ends.

996
00:52:08,177 --> 00:52:10,333
Willingness to fraternize
with the depraved...

997
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,550
Powerful weapon.
Oh.

998
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,680
You have to be willing.
Yeah.

999
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,470
'Cause someone else out there
certainly is.

1000
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,841
Mm.

1001
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,466
It's not enough
this time though.

1002
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,395
I'm not going to win
this election by that alone.

1003
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,220
No?
No.

1004
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,100
I need your assistance
on this one.

1005
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,286
Starting with the primary.

1006
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,350
And I don't just mean money.
Though I also mean money...

1007
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:46,600
- That's a big ask.
- Well.

1008
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:49,680
The only way I take office
is if I outlast the other guy.

1009
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,970
And right now he's got
plenty in the tank

1010
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,510
to get him
to the finish line.

1011
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:56,340
I need you to help me
drain him of that.

1012
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,059
You want me
to help put you

1013
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:00,731
in the State Attorney
General's office.

1014
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:02,176
I do.

1015
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,762
Last time you were a lawman,
it wasn't so good for me.

1016
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:08,075
This time
it'll be different.

1017
00:53:08,629 --> 00:53:12,028
You sure about that?
I've seen a lot of Westerns.

1018
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:14,100
A man changes when
he puts on that star.

1019
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:17,481
No sir.
Not on the inside.

1020
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,161
I wear the badge,
I'll be able to do for you.

1021
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:23,192
Favors reap favors.

1022
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,325
And I'm sure
there's a favor or two

1023
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,801
I could help you with.

1024
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,510
I have something
in mind, yeah.

1025
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:46,036
Name it.

1026
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,890
I'll do that on
the other side of the war.

1027
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,390
Thank you.

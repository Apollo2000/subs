1
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,104
Mmph.

2
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,673
You're in need of correction,
aren't you?

3
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,110
Yeah.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,287
I might leave marks.

5
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,522
Not a great idea.

6
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,525
That's not a no.

7
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,766
Mnh! Oh!

8
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,669
Ohh!

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,506
That's got to burn.

10
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,642
Let me fix it.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,152
Ahhh.

12
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,073
See, what you have to
understand, Michael,

13
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,141
is that this is
a fuck-up-free zone.

14
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,510
Guys who sit in Chuck's chair
become mayor.

15
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,745
Governor.

16
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,147
We have to be beyond reproach.

17
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,452
So no tinder
at the goddamn office, okay?

18
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,691
It feels like yesterday
I was telling you all this.

19
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,159
Mm, 18 months ago.
Huh.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,295
Added some stuff
of my own in there.

21
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,696
Yeah. Tinder.
I heard.

22
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,332
Come on.
He's waiting.

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,336
Well, off the record,
the, uh, Attorney General's

24
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,238
always happy to take
my recommendations

25
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,108
on who to appoint
to the federal bench.

26
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,043
Uh-huh.

27
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,544
Very good.

28
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,712
Thank you.

29
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,180
Sir.

30
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,999
Okay, guys.
What do we got on deck?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,117
Okay, guys.
What do we got on deck?

32
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,085
Progress report on two
of the open investigations.

33
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,987
Ari spyros from the s.E.C...

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,088
Call back.

35
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,323
Is here.

36
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,125
I'm sorry, sir.
He... he wouldn't...

37
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,093
It's fine, Kim.
It's okay. Thank you.

38
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,462
Well, spyros.

39
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,730
What's the occasion?

40
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,599
We're not interviewing
right now.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,335
Funny. Here.

42
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,171
This got your panties
all sticky?

43
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,472
Drenched.

44
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,475
Suspect trading pattern
on pepsum pharmaceuticals.

45
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,710
Uh-huh.

46
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,999
One of my grunts
riding the midas

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,013
one of my grunts
riding the midas

48
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,615
spotted a days-long
buy spike.

49
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,253
Yeah, get me spyros.

50
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,989
Take a look.

51
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,460
You can all study the charts,

52
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,529
or I can give you
the answers to the test.

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,497
Please.

54
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,365
Lenny bosco...
Old oaks investments.

55
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,434
Peter Decker...
Quaker Ridge financial.

56
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,370
Dan margolis...
Century capital.

57
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,638
These three small firms

58
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,974
all knew exactly when to buy
and when to sell the stock.

59
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,999
They had inside information.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,277
They had inside information.

61
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,111
You must get pings like that
every day.

62
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,013
We do.

63
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,014
So? Get them talking
and fine them.

64
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,249
It's bigger than that.

65
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,255
All three firms have links
to Bobby axelrod.

66
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,263
Bobby fucking axelrod.
Man of the people.

67
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,000
You only have that exact look on
your face when you're here.

68
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,303
The pizza's just
really fucking good.

69
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,371
Take a bite.

70
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,376
Mmm. It's good.

71
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,512
Good?
That is a thing of beauty.

72
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,115
That's why we lived in here
when we were kids.

73
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,249
Hey.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,551
I don't usually open
for breakfast, guys.

75
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,020
You want another?

76
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,423
I do.

77
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,158
We want 'em all.

78
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,560
All?

79
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,197
I want to come in with you.

80
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,199
Partner up.

81
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,268
What the fuck
did you tell him, kid?

82
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't want no charity.

83
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,270
I don't want no charity.

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,972
Look, all I told him
was the truth, Bruno, okay?

85
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,340
That I got a call from a guy

86
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,742
who said he was coming in here
with a falafel shop,

87
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,377
and would I contract
the rebuild.

88
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,979
And when I asked you about it,

89
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,181
you said that you were getting
squeezed by a new landlord.

90
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,750
And when I got that call,
I made a couple calls of my own.

91
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,519
Falafel shop goes in the mall.

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,554
We lock in you in
on a 20-year lease,

93
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,556
and I cover the overage.

94
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,691
I-I-I don't know, Bobby.

95
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,260
Come on.
What is there to know?

96
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,228
You let me slide for weeks
without paying

97
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,330
when I was coming in here
every day after school.

98
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,999
That was just 'cause
you were a good customer.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,233
That was just 'cause
you were a good customer.

100
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,434
Which I want to keep being.

101
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,737
Nothing changes.

102
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,679
Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,748
I'd love to tell you
I knew you'd grow up

104
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,183
to become what you did,

105
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:21,320
but to be honest, I had no idea.

106
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,588
That makes two of us.

107
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,324
Come here.

108
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,594
Thanks.

109
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,071
Bobby, we are ready to
roll on something sweet.

110
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,339
I think you'll
want to piggyback.

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,407
What do you got?

112
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,576
Lumetherm power getting bought
by electric sun.

113
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,411
Price is $41.
Stock's trading at $35.

114
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,979
We're looking at a 17% bump

115
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,514
in two weeks
when the deal closes.

116
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,082
Annualized, that's $442...

117
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,283
I'd love to size up.

118
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,019
Maybe you buy 2 million shares
for the main fund.

119
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,688
Sounds about right.
Great.

120
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,691
Scott kazawitz's name is being
floated as the new chairman.

121
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,999
Kazawitz.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,627
Kazawitz.

123
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,428
That's a new piece
of information.

124
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,263
Well, that's what
you pay me for.

125
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,431
Who said this deal
is gonna close?

126
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,699
Ben said it would this morning.

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,500
Me?
Everyone's saying it.

128
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,635
Who is this?

129
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,103
My new analyst.

130
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,639
Well, if we hired you,
you must be a genius.

131
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,974
Yale?

132
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,642
Stanford.
Then wharton.

133
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,344
Okay, Stanford-wharton.

134
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,247
Electric sun is
controlled by kazawitz.

135
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,382
He also owns 19.3%
of lumetherm

136
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,384
backdoored through his stake
in Southern wind.

137
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,187
You see that block trade last
Thursday come out of merrill?

138
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,255
Yeah. That was fortress

139
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,000
cashing out their shorts
before the merger.

140
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,690
Cashing out their shorts
before the merger.

141
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,459
Wasn't it?

142
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,594
Trade was at 12:52,
when everyone was at lunch,

143
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,763
which tells me they wanted it
to be missed.

144
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,366
You guys caught it,
which is something, I guess.

145
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,268
But you're looking at it
backward.

146
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,136
Electric sun's offer
was just a ploy

147
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,638
to temporarily prop up
lumetherm.

148
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,574
Typical kazawitz play to bail
on a loser. He's an animal.

149
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,977
The block trade was kazawitz
getting out of Southern wind,

150
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,245
getting out of lumetherm.

151
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,147
He rode the story, now he's out,

152
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,615
which means you need to be out.

153
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,983
In fact, short.

154
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,999
It'll slide to $32 and change
after word breaks.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,687
It'll slide to $32 and change
after word breaks.

156
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,254
Wow.

157
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,024
That's a good catch, axe.

158
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,560
My cholesterol's high enough.

159
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,097
Don't butter my ass, danzig.
Just get smarter.

160
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,267
Your read was good
with the information you had.

161
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,536
You're new.
You'll figure it out.

162
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,273
Or you'll be gone.

163
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,675
Jesus Christ.

164
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,278
Yeah.
And he went to hofstra.

165
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,381
This is big.
It's criminal.

166
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,000
And I want to be a part
of treeing Bobby axelrod.

167
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:33,018
And I want to be a part
of treeing Bobby axelrod.

168
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,386
Hey, I want to be an astronaut,

169
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,056
but, uh, you know,
I get airsick in choppy weather.

170
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,258
Your burden of proof is lower.

171
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,392
They'll talk to you

172
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,329
because they're happy to pay
a fine and move on.

173
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,563
I'm at the coalface.

174
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,566
And I really don't appreciate
you strolling in here

175
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,735
and telling me how to deploy
my resources

176
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,271
because you can't build
your own fucking case.

177
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,973
I get it.
You guys are rock stars.

178
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,607
Yeah, we get it.
You want to be one, too.

179
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,176
None of that matters.

180
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,999
Uh, spyros, if you've locked on
to some trail of bread crumbs

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,280
uh, spyros, if you've locked on
to some trail of bread crumbs

182
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,181
that leads to Bobby axelrod,

183
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,615
that could be a win
for everyone.

184
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,051
So, leave your stuff,
we'll take a look,

185
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,520
and we'll let you know
if it rises to the level

186
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,688
that we can prosecute,

187
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,291
one that won't be reversed
on appeal.

188
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,527
You know, I understand
the source of your reluctance.

189
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,630
Mm-hmm.
I have a wife, too.

190
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,099
But it's your job...

191
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,500
Hey, you got your answer.

192
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
We're done.

193
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,234
I loved and remember each
and every one of your fathers,

194
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,436
so I'm proud of all of you

195
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,999
who are ready to head off
to school in the fall.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,040
Who are ready to head off
to school in the fall.

197
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,375
26 of ours put through college

198
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,277
by the memorial foundation
so far.

199
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,413
And this year's group...
So let's bring them up,

200
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,315
and let's give them a round of
applause for their achievement.

201
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,118
Freddie aquafino, off to Duke.

202
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,457
Freddie, Freddie.

203
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,226
I traded shoulder to shoulder
with your father.

204
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,663
He'd be so proud of you today.

205
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,267
First year's tuition and board.

206
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,999
All right, come here.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All right, come here.

208
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,108
That's what this
is all about, guys.

209
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,277
Not only how our firm
survived 9/11,

210
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,546
but how we didn't give up.

211
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:45,217
How we committed to each other,
to our family.

212
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,454
And I am so moved by how we've
all flourished together.

213
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,323
Some flourishing
more than others.

214
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:56,261
It's just wrong that you're
the one standing there.

215
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,429
All right, that's enough.

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,999
No, no. It's okay.
June...

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,533
No, no. It's okay.
June...

218
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,268
I'd feel the same way.

219
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,337
I get it.

220
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,973
You got to be thinking,
"why was he spared?

221
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,042
Why is my husband gone?"

222
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,077
For months after the planes hit,

223
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,147
all I could do
was ask myself why.

224
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,649
Why was I the only
surviving partner?

225
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,650
Why wasn't I there?

226
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,486
Could... could I have done
something?

227
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,287
Why was I the only one
out of the office

228
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,590
on meetings that morning?

229
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,061
We'll never know.

230
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,000
So I made up my own "why."

231
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,041
So I made up my own "why."

232
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,167
Because of you.

233
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,004
You put it all
on your back, Bobby.

234
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,708
Am I the greatest guy
in the world?

235
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,109
Hell, no.

236
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,312
I just did what I knew the
partners and friends I'd lost

237
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,515
would've done for my family.

238
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,718
What your husband
would've done, June.

239
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,055
And you know I'm sorry.

240
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,598
'Cause I miss rake every day...

241
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,636
just as my beautiful wife, Lara,

242
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:14,207
misses her heroic brother Dean.

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,647
Bobby axelrod
is Mike Tyson in his prime.

244
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,716
And you do not want
Mike Tyson in his prime.

245
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,219
Remember what happened to
the guys who fought him then?

246
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,754
Yeah, they got their faces
pushed in.

247
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,999
But eventually he got beat.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,190
But eventually he got beat.

249
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,257
Buster Douglas knocked him
on his ass.

250
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,258
Right.
Ketchup?

251
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,360
"Eventually" is the key word.

252
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,596
When Tyson was ready to go.

253
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,198
Since my appointment,

254
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,500
this office is undefeated
in financial prosecutions...

255
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,601
81 and 0.

256
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,070
And that's because I know
when the time is right.

257
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,340
I get it, but...
This would be a big one.

258
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,343
Bryan, what do you think
happened here this morning?

259
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,979
We got significant information.

260
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,482
Maybe. Or maybe it was spyros
setting us up.

261
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,999
Now, we go in first
and lose in the criminal action,

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,653
now, we go in first
and lose in the criminal action,

263
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,556
spyros in the s.E.C.
Can still get him civilly.

264
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,360
Now, we win, spyros wins.
We lose...

265
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,095
Spyros still fucking wins.

266
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,297
Damn.
The ketchup's empty.

267
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,500
We've got to be playing
three-dimensional chess.

268
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,503
Axe is a folk hero in this town.

269
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,240
The guy gave the New York City
firefighter's foundation

270
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,176
$100 million last year.

271
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,078
Police gave him a plaque
at ground zero

272
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,446
with his goddamn name on it.

273
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,381
Spitzer's name was on all
the highway signs, too.

274
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,000
Signs come down.

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Signs come down.

276
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,019
That's why I love you, man.

277
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,157
But a good matador doesn't
try to kill a fresh bull.

278
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,428
You wait until he's been
stuck a few times.

279
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,999
We need an opening,
however small.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,668
Then we get the guy
the moment that he's gettable,

281
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,969
just like the others.

282
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,439
But not if there's
a chance we lose.

283
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,044
What about...
The other issue?

284
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,000
The one spyros mentioned...
Home?

285
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,681
The one spyros mentioned...
Home?

286
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,685
Was he right about that?

287
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,554
No.

288
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,532
I-I don't...

290
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,467
You know what, it's a
tough day for everyone.

291
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,436
I don't know what...
Oh!

292
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,437
Just...

293
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,573
I just had to sell the oceanis.

294
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,110
Rake just loved that boat.

295
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,579
I am sure that's why
it upset you.

296
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,049
You know, me,
I never set foot on a yacht

297
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,583
until I started dating Bobby.

298
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,718
In inwood, growing up,

299
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,089
the only boating we ever did
was the staten island ferry.

300
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,458
Big Irish family.
Five sibs.

301
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,994
Close, though.

302
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,264
Firemen, cops, nurses.

303
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,633
Then, when I moved up here,

304
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,303
this world, I saw
how everyone looked at me.

305
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,999
I never judged.

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,306
I never judged.

307
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,742
Of course not.

308
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,744
So I got my act together.

309
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,047
And I'm comfortable
in this life.

310
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,083
But certain things
you learn in inwood,

311
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,085
they never leave you...
You know, like the idea

312
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,753
that if someone
has a problem with you

313
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,455
and they come to you in person,

314
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,523
you do what you can
to take care of it.

315
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,626
But if they take
that beef public,

316
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,130
the ground just falls out from
beneath them where I'm from.

317
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,967
You find yourself all alone.

318
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,000
Are you threatening me?

319
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,137
Are you threatening me?

320
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,339
You're fucking right I am.

321
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,143
It's how I grew up.

322
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,750
Excuse me, sir?

323
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,585
Yes?

324
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,718
I may be speaking out of turn...

325
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,520
I probably shouldn't have even
been in the room

326
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,988
where axelrod was discussed...

327
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,023
But you know the Norton place
out at the beach?

328
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,425
Why would we? Not you.
The U.S. attorney.

329
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,693
His father's house
is around the jetty.

330
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,994
Yes, I know the house.
What?

331
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,131
I just heard Bobby axelrod
is trying to buy it.

332
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,975
Where did you hear that?

333
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,310
Court clerk's cousin works for
the realtor and mentioned it.

334
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,112
How much?
$83 million.

335
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,547
Really?

336
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,382
That would be widely reported.

337
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,717
Widely.

338
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,020
People hate guys
who buy things like that.

339
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,470
I just lost my mojo
somewhere along the line.

340
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,739
It's fucking gone.

341
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,342
And you're Mrs. mojo,
so I booked the appointment.

342
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,144
It's Dr. mojo.

343
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,580
Right.

344
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,550
I hear it happens
to guys my age.

345
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,718
Maybe I'm depressed.

346
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,022
Maybe I should try
some Prozac, Effexor...

347
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,024
Uh-huh.
We'll get to that.

348
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,000
Now, have you been eating,
sleeping, exercising?

349
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,028
Now, have you been eating,
sleeping, exercising?

350
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,629
Yeah, more or less.

351
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,165
Maybe not so much
with the sleeping.

352
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,501
And things with your wife?

353
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,702
Okay, mostly.

354
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,337
Sex?

355
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,705
Normal.

356
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,707
I've been married 10 years,
so...

357
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,977
So down to just once a day.

358
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,712
So, it's really just the book?

359
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,381
I'm down 4%...

360
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,084
Year to date.

361
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,654
Everyone else
is up double digits.

362
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,657
I'm down.

363
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,027
I'm fucked.
You don't need meds.

364
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,296
You're just listening
to the wrong voice.

365
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,365
You're tuned into
the one yelling at you

366
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,634
over the loudspeaker
that you're fucking stupid

367
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,270
and your performance blows.

368
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,707
And you're ignoring
the quiet one inside

369
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,276
telling you where the Alpha is.

370
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:55,347
Now, that's the voice
that got you here.

371
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,484
And it's still there
if you're willing to listen.

372
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:00,000
What's that voice telling you?

373
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,089
What's that voice telling you?

374
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,491
That even though
I've stiffed a few

375
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,126
that I'm pretty damn good.

376
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,327
Unh-unh.

377
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,595
Stand up.

378
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,099
Stand up.

379
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,968
What'd you take down last year?

380
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,169
$7.2 million.

381
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,139
$7.2 million.

382
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,012
$7.2 mill... feel that.

383
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,247
$7.2 million.

384
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,000
Bring it close.

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bring it close.

386
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,652
$7.2 million.

387
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,453
So, what's it saying?

388
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,389
That I'm awesome.

389
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,356
There you go.

390
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,391
And what does it have
to say back

391
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,359
to that loud, critical voice?

392
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,394
It's saying, "fuck you."

393
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,995
Good!

394
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,398
Sit down.

395
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,068
Now, I want you to go back
to your bloomberg

396
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,971
and cut bait on your losers...
You know the ones.

397
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,239
The ones you've been defending,

398
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,373
hoping they'll come 'round,

399
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,608
but, secretly,
you know never will.

400
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,443
I want you to just commit

401
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,999
that you're in it
for the long haul,

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,980
that you're in it
for the long haul,

403
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,380
that you will succeed.

404
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,616
And once you do that,
the new ideas,

405
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,718
the winners,
will present themselves

406
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,120
because you are a winner.

407
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,356
You're in the special forces
here.

408
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,725
You are a Navy seal.

409
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,126
And there's a reason for that.

410
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,696
Did the s.E.A.L.S make a mistake
signing you up?

411
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,497
No.
They did not.

412
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,167
The s.E.A.L.S
don't make mistakes.

413
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,273
So get out there
and do what needs to be done.

414
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:30,000
We have to stop here.

415
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,143
We have to stop here.

416
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,067
Hello, guys.

417
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,036
Daddy!

418
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,069
Oh, how are you?
Hm?

419
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,638
How was school?
What'd you get up to?

420
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,000
It was boring.
It was boring.

421
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,306
It was boring.
It was boring.

422
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,274
Boring. Fantastic.
Money well spent.

423
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,310
Those go off after dinner, okay?

424
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,444
Okay!

425
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,413
Hey, babe.

426
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,014
Hi, honey.

427
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,615
What are you working on?

428
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,150
Just session notes.

429
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,318
Oh.

430
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,454
Wall-to-wall oedipal complexes
making them all go limp?

431
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,555
Pfft!

432
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,724
You have an amazing
understanding of people.

433
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,226
What are we drinking, here?

434
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,994
The usual.
Mmm.

435
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,429
How's crime fighting?

436
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,198
The usual.

437
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,999
Mm.

438
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Mm.

439
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,143
You good with your situation?

440
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,146
I know you said you might've
been feeling bored a while back.

441
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,482
That's not exactly what I said.

442
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,650
Hmm.

443
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,688
You said, uh, you weren't sure
if you were still growing.

444
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,991
What's this about?

445
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,160
I was talking
to the head counsel of g.E.,

446
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,495
and they're looking
for a new head of h.R.

447
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,364
I can put in the word
if you want it.

448
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,000
Uh...

449
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,633
Uh...

450
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,235
Is there s...

451
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,338
Is there some reason
I can't keep doing my job?

452
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,741
No.
What do you mean?

453
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,645
I heard about a position,
so I presented it.

454
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,514
Don't you get enough
of moving the pieces

455
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,716
around the board at work?

456
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,452
Okay. You don't want to hear
about opportunities, fine.

457
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,587
Are you prosecuting
somebody at axe?

458
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,722
What's going on, Chuck?

459
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,423
First off, no.

460
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,660
And second, you know
that we don't discuss that.

461
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,999
So quit your fucking job.

462
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,197
So quit your fucking job.

463
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,002
Hey, kev, will you take
your sister upstairs

464
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,237
and, uh, start the bath?

465
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,107
I'll be up in a minute, okay?

466
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,410
Thank you.

467
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,178
Take it easy, okay?

468
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,981
I'm the goddamn
U.S. attorney, Wendy.

469
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,484
So? I've been working there
since before we were married

470
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,285
and long before
you were in office.

471
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,454
Look, not that we're there,

472
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,999
but we did always discuss
that the day might come

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,159
but we did always discuss
that the day might come

474
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
when there was a conflict.

475
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,529
That was before I was making
eight times what you make.

476
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,599
And before you started making
Chuck sr. Plays like this.

477
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,235
Leave him out of it.
Okay?

478
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,203
And who makes more money?
Really?

479
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,639
Is this, uh, what
we're teaching the kids?

480
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,207
Oh, are we teaching them
that daddy's job

481
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,342
is always more important
that mommy's?

482
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,144
I work for the public good.

483
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,412
No, you work for the good
of Chuck rhoades.

484
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,348
Maybe sometimes they intersect.

485
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,716
Oh, my god.

486
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,386
Would you turn off
your fucking shrink switch?

487
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,557
Mm-hmm.

488
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,627
Let's take this down a notch.

489
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,131
Yeah.

490
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,168
I just... I don't know
where all this is coming from,

491
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,036
and you know I don't like
to be manipulated.

492
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:45,971
I'm not manipulating.

493
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,272
Not that that's
what you were doing,

494
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,393
but that's what I felt like.

495
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,677
And of course
your job's important.

496
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,180
You're a superhero.

497
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,000
And I'm super proud of you.

498
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,287
And I'm super proud of you.

499
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,556
But my thing matters to me, too.

500
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,725
Of course.

501
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,262
You're killing it.

502
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,342
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Watch it, there, elmo!

503
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,610
No! Get down, boy!

504
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,979
Easy, big guy.

505
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,714
Ah, let him be.
Hey, let him be.

506
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,000
Let him be. It's okay.
Let him go free.

507
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,550
Let him be. It's okay.
Let him go free.

508
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,220
He's a live wire, that one.

509
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,988
Ooh, yeah.
He chewed up a custom sofa.

510
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,323
We've got to calm him down.

511
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,424
Send him to obedience school.

512
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,159
He's going to the vet
to get fixed.

513
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,227
Ooh.

514
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,261
Enjoy, guys.

515
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,096
All right, boys.
What do we say to chef Ryan?

516
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,365
Thank you!

517
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,735
Boys, boys, look.
Look. Look at this.

518
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,438
Look, look.
He's marking his territory.

519
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,206
He's peeing on the furniture.

520
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,009
Yeah. Yeah, but he's showing
Ryan who's boss.

521
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,477
That's why it's called
a pissing contest

522
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,000
when two men try
and stake out their turf.

523
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,246
When two men try
and stake out their turf.

524
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,381
I don't love it
when men do that, either.

525
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,516
Elmo, outside now!

526
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,486
Come on. Poor guy.

527
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,123
Dean, seventh president.
Hint... two after Monroe.

528
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,192
Jackson.
Andrew Jackson.

529
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,426
Gordie, where was he from?

530
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,161
Let's talk Yankees.

531
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,697
'Cause you don't know.
Don't switch the subject.

532
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,999
I do know.

533
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Prove it.

534
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,735
Seattle?

535
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,970
There was no Seattle
back then, idiot.

536
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,238
I bet I'll get it
on the next guess.

537
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,306
Bet you don't.

538
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:28,974
How much?

539
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:29,999
10 push-ups.

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,042
10 push-ups.

541
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:31,342
Deal.

542
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,046
Border areas near the carolinas.

543
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,682
You can't fall for that
every time, Dean.

544
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,551
See, he knows his customer,
and he sets you up.

545
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,655
He's willing to look foolish
short-term to win long-term.

546
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,356
You got to remember that.

547
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,293
And, gordie,
don't sucker your brother.

548
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,395
All right, come on.
Pay your bet.

549
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,164
We don't welsh.

550
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,301
See what you got.

551
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,999
One. Two.

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,506
One. Two.

553
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,507
Lower.

554
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,008
Three.

555
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,999
Sir? The leniency
conference starts in 10 minutes.

556
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,960
Sir? The leniency
conference starts in 10 minutes.

557
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,442
Afternoon.

558
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,446
Thank you for agreeing
to see us.

559
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,314
What the fuck are
you doing here, dad?

560
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,049
Trying to get me disbarred?

561
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,319
Christ. You're more dramatic
than your mother.

562
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,255
We are not breaking
any rules or regulations.

563
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,058
Mr. rhoades is not being
compensated to appear here.

564
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,361
Oh, I know how careful he is...

565
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,996
And why you brought him.

566
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,999
But believe me,
it's already backfired.

567
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,132
But believe me,
it's already backfired.

568
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,166
Hear us out.

569
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,202
Skip knows that he did wrong.

570
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,670
Now that he's been,
uh, convicted, sure.

571
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,472
But when he had a chance
to plead out...

572
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:08,606
That's the past.

573
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,743
Right now, we are trying
to set something up

574
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:15,346
that will allow skip
to show his rehabilitation

575
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,083
and for him to contribute
to society.

576
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,052
By what?
Oh, I know.

577
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,620
Uh, paying a bigger fine

578
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,490
in exchange
for reduced jail time?

579
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:29,999
What are we talking about,
uh, $5 million?

580
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,027
What are we talking about,
uh, $5 million?

581
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,362
We were going to
suggest $10 million

582
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,697
in exchange for house arrest.

583
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,500
Which represents a far more
reasonable settlement than...

584
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,368
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
So, that way,

585
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,271
instead of worrying about
actually going to prison,

586
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,140
you can get right to
doing charitable works

587
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,374
and warning your buddies

588
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,176
about the pitfalls
of being a bad actor.

589
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,744
Exactly.
Yeah.

590
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,180
This is skip.

591
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:52,116
And it is a fair offer.

592
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,552
Yeah, it sounds reasonable.

593
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,622
And it's the type of deal

594
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,999
that has been made in this
library... Countless times...

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,461
That has been made in this
library... Countless times...

596
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,135
by my predecessors,

597
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,539
but not by me.

598
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,041
You don't buy your way
out of justice here.

599
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,511
You thought, because of our
history, bringing my father,

600
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,147
this would afford you some
kind of a fucking courtesy?

601
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,016
No. He volunteered.

602
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:28,587
Well, you all
miscalculated... Badly.

603
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,091
You know, instead of
using my father,

604
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,559
you should've emulated him

605
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,361
and built your fortune
without crossing the line.

606
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,063
You didn't.

607
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,698
So now your cronies
are gonna see

608
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,401
that they better not trade
on inside information

609
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:47,338
or abuse their positions, or
they're gonna end up like you.

610
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,643
Broke, humiliated,
and incarcerated...

611
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,278
As per the law.

612
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,682
I am not prepared for this.

613
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,222
I... I can't.

614
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,556
Please.

615
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,159
Chuck...

616
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,728
You know I am not a bad man.

617
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,631
I can't.

618
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,069
This was to be about leniency.
Have some mercy.

619
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,573
My father always told me
that "mercy" was a word

620
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,078
that pussies used when they
couldn't take the pain.

621
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,999
I love you, dad.

622
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,182
I love you, dad.

623
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:32,049
But if you walk into my office

624
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,185
and try to use
your influence again,

625
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,522
you are gonna walk out of here
in handcuffs.

626
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,197
Mr. wolkows...

627
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,471
Skip.

628
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,007
I've known you
since I was a boy.

629
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,177
I remember you and my dad
exchanging sets

630
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,000
on the tennis court out east.

631
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,161
On the tennis court out east.

632
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,282
I never wanted to see you
like this.

633
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,750
I never wanted you to.

634
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,619
Yeah, but here we are.

635
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,721
So please hear this.

636
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:15,560
I know that you have the
strength to get through it...

637
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,363
And come out the other side
a better man.

638
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,500
I wish you well.

639
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,020
Hey.

640
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,389
Yo, axe.

641
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,491
Really? Here?

642
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,428
They were gonna obliterate each
other on superior auto.

643
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,663
Has to be your call.

644
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,536
We've got to stay long,
superior.

645
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,999
We should increase
our position, I think.

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,973
We should increase
our position, I think.

647
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,241
You think?

648
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,077
Aluminum wheels for cars
and light-duty trucks

649
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,745
have totally replaced steel.

650
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,513
And the numbers
out of the factory

651
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,283
are telling me superior is
producing the shit out of them.

652
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,051
"Dollar" bill...

653
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,320
What does the cheapest man
in America think?

654
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,755
That "the pouch" is wrong.

655
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,557
Numbers out of the factory
tell me

656
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,259
that they over-produced
this quarter.

657
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,460
They're stuck with merch
they can't move,

658
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,461
and the stock's gonna dip.

659
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,696
Short.

660
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,700
What's your level of certainty?

661
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,158
I am not uncertain.

662
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,629
We're done here.

663
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,999
Why didn't you tell me
you were certain?

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,198
Why didn't you tell me
you were certain?

665
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,599
Why would I?

666
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,167
Do your own fucking work.

667
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,069
Okay, come on!

668
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,105
Any time you can disrupt
a criminal enterprise,

669
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:12,176
that's a good result,
and that is what happened here.

670
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:16,647
Once again,
over 400 kilos of cocaine,

671
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,182
dozens of weapons seized.

672
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,586
$2.8 million off the streets
in this takedown.

673
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,089
All defendants
have been indicted

674
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,258
and are also off the streets.

675
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,060
Mr. rhoades!

676
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,000
All right.
Thanks, guys.

677
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,093
All right.
Thanks, guys.

678
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,562
You're proud
about small-time convictions

679
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,230
of small-time players... Hey, hey.
That's enough.

680
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,366
Uneducated minorities
with limited options.

681
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,302
That's enough. What about the
hundreds of millions... billions...

682
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,171
In fraudulent gains
in the financial sector?

683
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,040
Why aren't you prosecuting
the investment banks

684
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,443
and hedge funds
for insider trading?

685
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,611
You're bragging
about netting minnows,

686
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,148
but you won't touch a firm
like axe capital.

687
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,422
My office is soft
on financial crime.

688
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,999
Go ask the 81 convicted felons
of financial crimes

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,026
go ask the 81 convicted felons
of financial crimes

690
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,127
currently serving time.

691
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,496
But you have a very specific
conflict of interest

692
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,431
right in your own home.

693
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,600
Growing up, I saw firsthand

694
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,470
the corrosive power
that big business can have,

695
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,638
and I am determined
to check that.

696
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,708
Take skip wolkowska.

697
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:22,179
Now, he has many
influential friends,

698
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,416
but their entreaties on his
behalf were not entertained.

699
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,351
As your own paper reported,

700
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,999
Mr. wolkowska will serve
his full sentence,

701
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,422
Mr. wolkowska will serve
his full sentence,

702
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,490
effective immediately.

703
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,359
That's all the time
I really have. Thanks.

704
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,295
Who let the fucking journal in
with the blindsided questions?

705
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,664
He was not supposed to...

706
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,444
That guy you know over
at skadden on axe's team...

707
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,446
Yeah, orrin bach.
He was my law professor.

708
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,714
Yeah. Get with him.

709
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,650
And tell him to tell axe
not to buy that house.

710
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,000
Not to buy...?

711
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,286
Not to buy...?

712
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,622
Nice.

713
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:08,326
I need spyros at the s.E.C.

714
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,533
Spyros.

715
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,634
Do you know the story

716
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,270
about the mouse that starts
roaring like a lion?

717
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,638
No.

718
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,007
Yeah. It doesn't end well
for the goddamn mouse.

719
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,976
Do the people you work with
pretend they're impressed

720
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,244
when you speak in riddles

721
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,547
like some kung-fu instructor
from the movies?

722
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, let me be direct.

723
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,682
Well, let me be direct.

724
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,318
I know you sent that reporter
in to ask about axe capital.

725
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,221
Why would I do that?

726
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,424
We're on the same side.

727
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,327
You're on your side.
I'm on mine.

728
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,728
Well, we can both benefit.

729
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,731
And besides,
it's the right thing to do.

730
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,100
Spyros, you wouldn't know
the right thing to do

731
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,970
if it kneeled down and sucked
your tiny goddamn cock!

732
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,206
You pull any shit
like that again

733
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,143
and I will loose
holy fucking hell on you!

734
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:13,123
So, this is how a man with
no conscience spends his time.

735
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,426
It's how
a grown-up does.

736
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,529
You know, I remember
when you were my professor,

737
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,233
you told us a lawyer's calling
was beyond mere recompense.

738
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,703
It was to serve the spirit of
the law regardless of gain.

739
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,238
Yeah. It is.

740
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,740
Until it's not.

741
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,675
What?

742
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,043
You'll see.

743
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,212
Once you sell out
and play for the defense, too.

744
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,747
Nah, I've found my calling.

745
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,382
Okay, Claude dancer.

746
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,685
One day you'll be
coming to me just like this,

747
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,621
asking for a job.

748
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,357
The good news is this...
When you get out of there,

749
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,693
you're starting
at $1.4, easy.

750
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,230
Nail a few
headline cases... $1.7.

751
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,365
Better news?

752
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,399
I'll hire you.

753
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,167
I'm staying.

754
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,602
No, you're not.

755
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,999
Hey, speaking of headlines,

756
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,003
hey, speaking of headlines,

757
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,106
is this shit we're hearing
about the beach house real?

758
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,041
'Cause that's a headline
you don't want.

759
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,443
Since when's a rich guy
buying a house illegal?

760
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,312
There's the way things look
and the way things are.

761
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,647
You taught me that.

762
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,283
It's like he's slapping my guy
in the face with a white glove.

763
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,484
You know what happens next.

764
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,186
If there were any doubt,
we'd tie him to his chair.

765
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,522
World's full of snipers.

766
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,658
But Bobby runs a clean shop.

767
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,661
So he just keeps a top defense
firm on retainer at $800 an hour

768
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,162
because he loves lawyers?

769
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,497
Must be.

770
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,166
And we're $1,000 an hour.

771
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,240
There's nothing there.

772
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,209
Like Warren buffett says,

773
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,614
you put a police car
on anyone's tail for 500 miles,

774
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,017
he's gonna get a ticket.

775
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,094
Hey. Come in.

776
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,330
Bite?

777
00:34:58,331 --> 00:34:59,999
Oh, god, no.

778
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, god, no.

779
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,467
I'm glad you came in.

780
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,336
I was gonna come see you.

781
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,637
About?

782
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,440
A purchase I'm considering.

783
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,741
An impulse purchase?

784
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,976
Naturally.

785
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,078
Sizeable?

786
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,514
I'm guessing it's something you
may not even particularly need.

787
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,684
People are saying if I do,
it'll unleash the hounds...

788
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,087
Which makes me
want it even more.

789
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,355
That's good.

790
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,623
Back when we started,

791
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,325
you wouldn't have been able
to recognize the motivation

792
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,760
until long after you bought it.

793
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, back when we started,

794
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,328
well, back when we started,

795
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,198
I was just rich,
not super-rich.

796
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,168
You know, being a billionaire...

797
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,672
I never get to talk
about this with anyone

798
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,273
'cause who's gonna give a shit?

799
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,210
But being a billionaire,
when you walk into a room,

800
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,580
it's like being a woman
with a perfect set of tits.

801
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,682
Or great legs.

802
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,350
Or eyes like yours.

803
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,519
You know exactly
what everyone's looking at,

804
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,322
and you know exactly
what they want.

805
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,000
You know what that's like.

806
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,492
You know what that's like.

807
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,427
Okay, player.

808
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:07,297
Identifying the fact that buying
can be a surrogate for power

809
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,200
and that outside authority
isn't something you do well,

810
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,069
this is progress.

811
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,038
You've come a long way
since we started.

812
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,339
I guess...

813
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,409
Considering when we started
I was staggering around crying

814
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,679
along with the half of us
still breathing.

815
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,082
But knowing isn't enough.

816
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,317
You've got to exercise control.

817
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,586
Don't get into a bitch fight
over nothing.

818
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't buy it.

819
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,356
Don't buy it.

820
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,162
You nailed lumetherm power.
Deal crumbled.

821
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,630
I covered at $31.19.

822
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,231
Nice.

823
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,600
You said $32-ish, but I saw it
was going even further,

824
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,003
so I waited.
Whoa, living dangerously.

825
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,571
All right. Good job.

826
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,174
You just made us
another $18 million.

827
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,509
Yeah.

828
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,546
Thanks.

829
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,250
We got sidetracked.

830
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,987
You came to me.

831
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,995
You're thinking about leaving.

832
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,967
Uh, well, it's...
Crossed my mind.

833
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,570
Is this about comp?

834
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,171
No.

835
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,272
God, no.

836
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,374
You've... you've
always made that clear.

837
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,377
I'm better paid than anyone
in my med-school class

838
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,999
except the guy who invented
the synthetic bladder.

839
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,115
Except the guy who invented
the synthetic bladder.

840
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,982
I'll short his company,

841
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,051
give some speeches,
chop him down to size.

842
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,220
It's not about comp.

843
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:43,293
But it is about
value... mine...

844
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,465
And growth,
as in whether I'm still growing.

845
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,300
I love this place,

846
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,470
but I do miss seeing more than
a handful of other patients.

847
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,507
At-risk adolescents,
women in crisis.

848
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,542
You know,
using those other muscles.

849
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,999
Where's this coming from?

850
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Where's this coming from?

851
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,316
It's been on my mind.

852
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,420
Your value to the firm
is absolute.

853
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,590
You just saved me
from making a huge mistake

854
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,727
for dick-measuring
purposes.

855
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,397
So let's do this.

856
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,635
Spend as much time
away from here as you want.

857
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,070
See other patients outside.

858
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,607
But stick with me.

859
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,316
Thank you.

860
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,574
Hi, mom.

861
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:04,708
Hello, dear.
I hear you've been very busy.

862
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,043
Yeah.

863
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,745
He's in the den.
Okay.

864
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,624
What the hell was that stunt?

865
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,359
Skip wolkowska's an old friend.

866
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,662
He asked for help.
I didn't want to refuse.

867
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,999
But I was 90% sure
you'd react the way you did.

868
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,068
But I was 90% sure
you'd react the way you did.

869
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:32,970
It's a win any way
you look at it.

870
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,172
How is that a win?

871
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,375
I knew that skip's lawyer
would spread it,

872
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,344
and it'd land in the news.

873
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:44,114
And if you treat me that way,
they'll all fear you.

874
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,117
That's what you need right now.

875
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,052
You'll be seen
as tough on wall street.

876
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,320
Hmm.

877
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,390
Some audible to call.

878
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,192
You're welcome.

879
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,127
Now, listen.

880
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,999
You didn't smile enough
during the presser.

881
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,064
You didn't smile enough
during the presser.

882
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,465
You let them get to you.

883
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,733
You're right.

884
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,068
And I didn't like that question
about axe capital.

885
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,103
What prompted that?

886
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,504
Spyros planted it.

887
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,107
S.E.C. Wants me
to move on axe.

888
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,542
It's difficult to convict
a popular man.

889
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,244
Yes, I know.

890
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,381
Well, if you move on him
and take that risk,

891
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,182
you have to get the reward.

892
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,019
You can let the s.E.C.
Do the mopping up,

893
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,657
collect their fines, but they
can't be seen as leading it.

894
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,359
A lot of people have axelrod's
back in this city.

895
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,000
He's made them a lot of money.

896
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,762
He's made them a lot of money.

897
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,030
And you know the line
if you're gonna strike

898
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,298
against the king.

899
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,000
The king is house shopping
right now.

900
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,969
Prime beachfront, heritage.

901
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,337
Hasn't even come on market yet.

902
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,440
That's a mistake.

903
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:48,378
A conspicuous buy like that
in the news?

904
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,381
He goes from a billionaire
that you can pull for

905
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,283
to just another rich asshole.

906
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,119
If he turns the populous
against him,

907
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,021
he gives his edge to you.

908
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,999
I passed word that,
uh, he shouldn't buy it.

909
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,759
I passed word that,
uh, he shouldn't buy it.

910
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,330
If he's innocent, he passes,

911
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,465
because he's a disciplined
player

912
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,068
and he knows that's
the disciplined move.

913
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:14,705
But a guilty man,
he buys that house

914
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:18,308
to show me he's got
nothing to hide.

915
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,078
Smart.

916
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,213
Maybe I can have a friend
make a bid,

917
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,515
get the competitive juices
flowing.

918
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,616
I like that.

919
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,720
Roger could always use
a new house.

920
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,000
And I know Denny dantone
is actively looking.

921
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:33,324
And I know Denny dantone
is actively looking.

922
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,028
You guys know
I only drag food into this room

923
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,296
for the super bowl.

924
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,231
Come on, Charles.
I made the pot pies.

925
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,966
I should have some time
with my son.

926
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,669
We'll be right there.

927
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,604
Your mother.

928
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,473
That's a loyal woman.

929
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,574
Don't.

930
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,342
I'm just saying that your mother

931
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,311
would never let
her job interf...

932
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,346
She never left the kitchen, dad.

933
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,349
That's what you wanted
in a wife, not me.

934
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,000
Still, Wendy's making things
difficult for you.

935
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,585
Still, Wendy's making things
difficult for you.

936
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,220
Why is she still working?

937
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,288
We started to discuss it.

938
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,724
Legally,
there's no conflict yet.

939
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,626
She'll do the right thing.

940
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,397
Better hope so, son.

941
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,733
Danny fucking margolis.
What brings you back?

942
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,602
When I saw you at sun valley,

943
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,471
you said you were happy
as a clam in shit at century.

944
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,340
Well, I am.

945
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,641
I was.

946
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,209
You know how it is.

947
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,412
Things are good there.

948
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:29,999
I like Jerry,
but I miss the family.

949
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,248
I like Jerry,
but I miss the family.

950
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:31,515
Well, you had to go it
on your own

951
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,116
with a bigger chunk of the pie.

952
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,218
Yeah, true.

953
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,654
Place looks great, by the way.

954
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,158
Is that your rolling art
out front?

955
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,260
The lambo?

956
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,396
No.

957
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,331
I like to sit tall in the seat.

958
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,967
Look, um, I have some ideas,

959
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,669
and I'd love
to share them with you.

960
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,405
I'd love to hear them.
Come to the next dinner.

961
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,674
We'll bang some steaks,
talk some concepts.

962
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,576
Yeah, okay. But I was just
hoping that maybe, you know...

963
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,000
No, I know what you were hoping.

964
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:01,446
No, I know what you were hoping.

965
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,282
Door's always open.

966
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,384
Yeah.
Yeah, that's cool, Bobby.

967
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,386
I-I will.

968
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,721
Uh, take care.

969
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,496
Hall.
I need to see you.

970
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,309
This is cozy.

971
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,512
It's secure.

972
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,281
I checked with my sources
in Washington.

973
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,150
There's no case file
against you,

974
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,619
but Dan margolis <i>was</i> arrested.

975
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,487
He was released
on his lawyer's recognizance,

976
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,389
and his arraignment's
currently on hold.

977
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,424
Which tells you what?

978
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,361
That he's cooperating.

979
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,030
Did you hear it okay?

980
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,331
How the hell did you know?

981
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,999
He was making
too much eye contact.

982
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,234
He was making
too much eye contact.

983
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,468
Barely blinked.

984
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,004
And his pulse was hammering
like he was running a marathon.

985
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,106
You were smart to stay quiet.

986
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:39,075
Look, the s.E.C.
Isn't the thing.

987
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,577
Fines are a part of life.

988
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:43,380
The attack you have to worry
about is the U.S. attorney's.

989
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,748
Now, here's what
you're gonna do.

990
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,517
One... that reporter
from <i>the journal,</i>

991
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,587
the one that was asking about
you, he needs to be handled.

992
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:53,757
I would do it myself,
but then he's out of the game.

993
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,058
No value added.

994
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,394
Better if you make him
your best friend.

995
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,999
And two... remember, you don't
have to outswim the shark.

996
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,565
And two... remember, you don't
have to outswim the shark.

997
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:05,669
You just have to outswim the guy
you're scuba diving with.

998
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,070
You want me to do that?

999
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,672
You remember that night
in Reykjavik?

1000
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,106
Wish I didn't, but I do.

1001
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,244
You said there was only one
thing you were afraid of.

1002
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,645
Windbreakers.

1003
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,248
Guys in windbreakers
walking in your office saying,

1004
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,016
"step away
from the computer."

1005
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,285
And you told me you'd make sure
it wouldn't happen.

1006
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,388
So, let me make sure.

1007
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,258
Look there.

1008
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:30,000
Steven birch?

1009
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,261
Steven birch?

1010
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,663
It's either him or you.

1011
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,300
Memorize that.

1012
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,672
Well, if it's gonna be someone,
it may as well be that fraud.

1013
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,107
We're sharing the stage

1014
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,711
at the delivering Alpha
conference this week.

1015
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,447
He acts like he's my best friend

1016
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,583
despite short squeezing me
on hmos last year.

1017
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,720
So do it.

1018
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,000
Hall.

1019
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Hall.

1020
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,264
Wendy rhoades
tried to quit today.

1021
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:11,134
We've been fighting back-to-back
in the trenches for 15 years.

1022
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,003
But today she tried to quit.

1023
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,205
Still trust her?

1024
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,708
I want to.

1025
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:25,015
I didn't know this place
was open for lunch.

1026
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:26,082
It's not.

1027
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,084
Thanks, Tony.

1028
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,999
My pleasure,
Mr. axelrod.

1029
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,154
My pleasure,
Mr. axelrod.

1030
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,554
We're off the record.

1031
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,024
If you fuck me,
I never talk to you again.

1032
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,191
Got it.

1033
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,329
Good. If you ever want to
come here, just call me.

1034
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,364
Now, why was my name
coming out of your mouth

1035
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,399
at a press conference?

1036
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,101
Hey, that was before
you asked me to lunch.

1037
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,238
Jump in.

1038
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,407
Let's talk about those kids
you put through college.

1039
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,443
That's the one question gets me
walking away from the table.

1040
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:54,711
That's between them and me.

1041
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:56,380
I don't talk about it
with anyone else.

1042
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,523
Bon appétit.

1043
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:07,757
What's next?

1044
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,026
Softball. Underhand.

1045
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,562
Give me some insight into how
you process information.

1046
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,598
The press acts like
information's a dirty word.

1047
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,667
Everyone has access
to the information.

1048
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,203
We just know how
to analyze it better.

1049
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,372
You answer me one.

1050
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:25,542
When did it become a crime
to succeed in this country?

1051
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,744
America used to salute
the guy in the limousine.

1052
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,612
They wanted to be the guy
in the limousine.

1053
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,000
They still want to.

1054
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,581
They still want to.

1055
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:32,182
But now they throw eggs at it.

1056
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,085
I only ever went egging once.

1057
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,087
Biggest house
in the neighborhood,

1058
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,622
and they never gave out
any candy, so they deserved it.

1059
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,524
We destroyed that place.

1060
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,626
Once?
You're an altar boy.

1061
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,495
That was every Halloween for me.

1062
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,030
You're from around here, right?

1063
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,432
Yeah, grand concourse.
Then white plains.

1064
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,235
Yeah, me too. Well, yonkers,
but it wasn't nice back then.

1065
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,370
Hey, man, yonkers
used to be a place

1066
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,051
where you could
really get your ass kicked.

1067
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,708
You're a good kid
for a fucking hack.

1068
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,999
And you're a good guy
for a bankster.

1069
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,344
And you're a good guy
for a bankster.

1070
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,580
All right, fuck it.

1071
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,148
I wasn't gonna give you this,

1072
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:08,185
but you're here for a story
and now I like you, so...

1073
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,387
Steven birch.

1074
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,454
Piedmont capital.

1075
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,022
Yeah.

1076
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,558
That swap deal he did
on arcadian railroad...

1077
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,027
The timing is very curious.

1078
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,229
What kind of swap?

1079
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,398
I'm not gonna write
the article for you.

1080
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,534
Do an autopsy on the deal,

1081
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:27,271
you'll find yourself a pulitzer
in the carcass.

1082
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,542
Here's my cell.

1083
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,980
Don't call
until the market closes.

1084
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:38,682
No voice-mail.

1085
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,319
No e-mail.
Understood.

1086
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,689
Enjoy your lunch.

1087
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,297
How do you respond to
the criticism that hedge funds

1088
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,433
are the scavengers
of the financial sector

1089
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,999
and that a select few have
undue influence on the markets?

1090
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,104
And that a select few have
undue influence on the markets?

1091
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:03,273
Any public statement you make
or position you take

1092
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,275
can send a stock soaring
or falling.

1093
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,143
We're not scavengers.

1094
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,979
We're white blood cells
scrubbing out bad companies,

1095
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,081
earning for our investors,
preventing bubbles.

1096
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,149
Excuse me.

1097
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,051
A hedge fund like mine
is a market regulator.

1098
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,520
I want people like Bobby axelrod
on that wall.

1099
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,422
I need them on that wall.

1100
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:23,026
Axe makes my life easier by
shouting if he sees something.

1101
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,129
The moment I let someone
in a boardroom...

1102
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,999
or a government office tell
me what I can or cannot buy,

1103
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,534
or a government office tell
me what I can or cannot buy,

1104
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:35,205
I may as well close the shop,
and I'm not closing the shop.

1105
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,041
Let's touch on the role
of the activist investor

1106
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,108
in today's market.

1107
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,577
I'm not just playing for myself.

1108
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,245
I'm playing for all
shareholders,

1109
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,380
like my good friend
Steven birch here.

1110
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,384
Bobby axelrod, Steven birch,
thanks to you both.

1111
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,000
Um, that, uh, thing
we were talking about,

1112
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:01,731
um, that, uh, thing
we were talking about,

1113
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,033
they are levered four to one.

1114
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,002
When their accounting comes out,

1115
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,670
it's not gonna look pretty,
right?

1116
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,473
Those fucking guys.
I wasn't told.

1117
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,742
I don't know why Brooks
saved those seats for them.

1118
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,344
I'm gonna find him
and skin his ass.

1119
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,411
Enough.

1120
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,613
I'm gonna get me that scalp.

1121
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,681
You crushed it.
Crushed.

1122
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,150
Let's get out of this rat fuck.

1123
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,455
Watch out.
He may buy the building.

1124
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,457
It's an a-minus building.
Needs overhaul.

1125
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,659
He doesn't consider anything
less than triple-a.

1126
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,000
Yet he hired you.

1127
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:31,327
Yet he hired you.

1128
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,462
Easy, Bryan.

1129
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,763
Learn anything from my talk?

1130
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,266
Volumes.
You staying for mine?

1131
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,968
I know your act.

1132
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,473
You sending me messages?
'Cause I'm here.

1133
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,609
Well, the kids in my office

1134
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,645
really thought
you might buy that house.

1135
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,514
I told them you got big balls,

1136
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,516
but not that big.

1137
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,653
Yeah, right.
I'll probably pass.

1138
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,155
It's so nice, though, you know.

1139
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,000
Feels like you're part
of the beach and ocean.

1140
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,425
Feels like you're part
of the beach and ocean.

1141
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,761
And all that air out there...

1142
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,497
Shit, you know about it.

1143
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,299
Your daddy's got
a little place out there.

1144
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,502
He must let you use a bedroom
some weekends if you say please.

1145
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,637
Walk away.

1146
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,239
I should.

1147
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,676
But then again, what's the point
of having "fuck you" money

1148
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,246
if you never say "fuck you"?

1149
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,416
You're a smart man.

1150
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,118
So you know
when I bring an action,

1151
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,000
not some county or even state,

1152
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:32,288
not some county or even state,

1153
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,691
it's the United States versus.

1154
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,993
Don't give me a reason.

1155
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,029
Oh, I know who brings an action.

1156
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,433
And I know what you feel about
your perfect record, too.

1157
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,669
You can't afford a mark
in the loss column.

1158
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,672
There's a saying in baseball.

1159
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,442
Towns fire managers.

1160
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,044
Owners just give them
the bad news.

1161
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:59,048
You're the only one running
the big money they cheer for.

1162
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,000
But that's because
you worked that 9/11 shit

1163
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,284
but that's because
you worked that 9/11 shit

1164
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,285
for all it's worth.

1165
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,687
Fuck yourself.

1166
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,991
I have never sent out
a single press release,

1167
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,726
given one interview.

1168
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,662
I lost every one of my friends
that day.

1169
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,232
And you've managed
to make some new ones since.

1170
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:21,604
But like I said,
they may be cheering now,

1171
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:26,210
but believe me,
they are dying to boo.

1172
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,712
And now from the other side,

1173
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,000
the man whose job is to ride
herd over the bulls and bears,

1174
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,583
the man whose job is to ride
herd over the bulls and bears,

1175
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,452
Chuck rhoades.

1176
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,741
Yeah.

1177
00:52:58,742 --> 00:52:59,999
Denny dantone's coming in
with an offer

1178
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,110
Denny dantone's coming in
with an offer

1179
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,979
on the Norton house...
$62 million.

1180
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,981
Prepared to close
in less than a week, I hear.

1181
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,516
How the fuck did he see it?

1182
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,484
He didn't.
He knew the house.

1183
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,319
Been to parties there.

1184
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,489
Son of a bitch.

1185
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,102
Hey, babe.

1186
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,737
Hey, babe.

1187
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,999
What the hell's wrong with elmo?

1188
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,074
What the hell's wrong with elmo?

1189
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:33,277
He went to the vet
to get fixed, remember?

1190
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,190
The house, I want it.

1191
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,392
Okay, let's take a beat.
People are gonna say that...

1192
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,727
They might.

1193
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,129
Offer $63 million cash.

1194
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,164
Take it or leave it on the call.

1195
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,367
Wire goes out first thing.

1196
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,054
Yeah.

1197
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,355
Mike dimonda from <i>the journal.</i>

1198
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,456
Sorry to wake you.

1199
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,758
I was up.

1200
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,559
I'm calling for comment.

1201
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,061
On?

1202
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:28,332
Skip wolkowska, your father's
friend, committed suicide.

1203
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:30,000
No comment.

1204
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,535
No comment.

1205
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,726
Shh, shh.

1206
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,035
Rough morning.

1207
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,309
But a reminder
like this is useful.

1208
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,514
What we do has consequences,

1209
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,452
intended and, uh... Unintended.

1210
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,722
The decisions we make,
the actions we bring,

1211
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,392
have weight.

1212
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:34,597
I'll have to carry this one.

1213
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,400
So...

1214
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:41,204
Would I have given a break
to some drug dealer?

1215
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,072
No.

1216
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:47,744
So, why would I give
one to a businessman?

1217
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:55,352
None of this should
change your mission.

1218
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:59,999
Come to work every day
and be just and strong

1219
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,090
come to work every day
and be just and strong

1220
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:03,994
in the actions you bring,
and don't waver.

1221
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,069
All right, that's it.
Back to work.

1222
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,472
This'll cheer you up.

1223
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,408
Front fucking page of the <i>post.</i>

1224
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,448
It's like he's daring you.

1225
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,997
Gotcha!

1226
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:52,709
You like it?

1227
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,111
I love it.

1228
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,582
Hey!

1229
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,088
Hall.
What do you got?

1230
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,124
There's movement.

1231
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,295
It's likely they've opened
a case file on you.

1232
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,997
You know what?

1233
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,699
I'm ready.

1234
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,668
They could be coming after you.

1235
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:21,004
Fuck 'em.

1236
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,461
You waited up.

1237
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,496
I made sure the kids
were asleep.

1238
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,267
I wanted to see you.

1239
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,040
Me too.

1240
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,619
That hurts.

1241
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,457
I'll bet it does.

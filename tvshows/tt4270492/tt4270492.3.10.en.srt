1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,534
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

2
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:09,936
We're doing a massive cap raise.
And quickly.

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:13,204
First money post-indictment
precludes institutional investors.

4
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,640
We need the icebreaker<i> now.</i>

5
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:15,908
<i>We need Grigor Andolov.</i>

6
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>There was this little boy.</i>

7
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:21,914
And I take his mother
away from the square.

8
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:23,882
Behind the soldiers.

9
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:27,719
After, I leave her <i>for</i> the soldiers.

10
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:30,922
This little boy, do you know
what happened to him?

11
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,457
No.

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,492
No one ever knows.

13
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:36,427
Bryan Connerty,
meet the head of the New York office.

14
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:37,628
Assistant Director Frances Lynch.

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,663
Hi.

16
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:40,431
- You cool here, Kate?
- Yes. I am.

17
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,133
Unless you're going to swing
on me like some Irish punk?

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:45,336
They say you can't ride
two horses with one behind,

19
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:47,971
but in today's business world,
it's a smart move,

20
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:49,940
Still pretty sharp for an old dog.

21
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,275
When we spoke this morning,
you were in California.

22
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:53,944
<i>You came to help
me with the algorithm?</i>

23
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,612
<i>To keep you company.</i>

24
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>You are now officially but unofficially</i>

25
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,884
the proud owner of half of
my half of Panay's fund,

26
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,186
You decide what's
right and what's wrong.

27
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,753
With no one to appease.

28
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,388
You're forgetting Jock Jeffcoat.

29
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,791
<i>His thumb pressing down on me...
I don't like it.</i>

30
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:10,058
<i>It's not enough to resist</i>

31
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,094
<i>or not resist Jock anymore.</i>

32
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,897
You have to assassinate
this motherfucker.

33
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,144
They call it the... wood,

34
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,812
isn't that right, Mr. Kornbluth?

35
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,814
That they do. The front page.

36
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,917
Even though almost no one
reads it on paper anymore.

37
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,586
Oh, they'll bring back the
bulldog edition for this one.

38
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:16,454
Carrie Caminetti...

39
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,222
Buffalo mayoral candidate?

40
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,792
Buffalo bunko man. Pay to play.

41
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,561
Corruption. Bribery.

42
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:24,195
It's all in there

43
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:27,966
and, though we're indicting,
you didn't get it from me.

44
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:30,000
What do you want in return?

45
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:34,972
Everything you have...
every innuendo, allegation,

46
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:38,475
intimation...
that you couldn't substantiate,

47
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:40,143
that you've been too scared to run,

48
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,612
that your editor has killed...

49
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,413
On?

50
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,015
Jock Jeffcoat.

51
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,016
You're going after your boss?

52
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,117
Or am I protecting him?

53
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,819
By finding out what's
floating around on him.

54
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,956
You'd be pacing the perimeter
with only a walkie and pistol.

55
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,725
He's already well insulated
behind the moat and drawbridge.

56
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,460
Texas style.

57
00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:00,463
The thing is: he's a rich man.

58
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:01,598
Everyone knows that.

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,732
What's he worth, ten, fifteen mill?

60
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:07,102
No, Chuck.
Whispers are: twenty times that.

61
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,837
Has PR folks whose sole job

62
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,073
is to keep him<i> out</i> of
the financial press.

63
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:12,574
Even when he was governor.

64
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,710
There always have been rumors
as to the way he earned it.

65
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:16,211
Many center around his brother.

66
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:17,713
The televangelist.

67
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:20,848
Right, and the ownership of
the networks he broadcasts on.

68
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,516
Wow.

69
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,720
All that hidden money. Amazing.

70
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,688
Most folks these days
want everyone to think

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,056
they're richer than they are.

72
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,826
Unless they don't want
questions about how they got it.

73
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,606
I've received a tip that
I'm honor bound to pursue.

74
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,674
On Jock Jeffcoat.

75
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:48,675
Mm.

76
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:50,777
Sweet Mary the Mother Blessed.

77
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,765
And Joseph the Carpenter too.

78
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:57,582
I'd like your help to investigate.

79
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:58,724
Need it.

80
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:03,221
But this is dangerous. For both of you.

81
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,490
So I want to give you
the chance to bail,

82
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,160
right now, at no cost to you.

83
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,169
Good.

84
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,305
Noted and appreciated.

85
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,907
Now...

86
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,210
Jock's brother is a Billy
Graham revivalist type...

87
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,411
Yes.

88
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,813
During the Attorney
General vetting process,

89
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,181
they went deep on him, I remember...

90
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:33,183
Oh, me too. Instead of a tent,
he has a mega-church.

91
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,319
They broadcast to a loose network
of cable TV stations nationwide.

92
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,254
Which may be the open flank.

93
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:42,159
As the story is:
the brother <i>owns</i> those stations.

94
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,561
And that never came out publicly.
Even during the vet.

95
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,628
They must've planned
for that years ahead.

96
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,831
So they must have a reason
for wanting to hide it.

97
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,066
We'll dive into that.

98
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,401
People inside the organization
are likely to be loyal.

99
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:56,138
So find some who left.
Accountants. Lawyers.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,174
The New York Jews he'd hire

101
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,143
who got tired of the
Texas Two-Step and quit.

102
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,443
Maybe there's some rancor.

103
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,512
I'll spread some rootie-tooties around,

104
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:05,814
make something happen.

105
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,048
Okay.

106
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,758
Ask the question.

107
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,193
Well, I couldn't help
but think of a person

108
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,628
who knows a thing or
two about media deals.

109
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:25,365
Mm. I'm going to have to insist
that we leave my father out of this.

110
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,434
I can't have his name written
down and talked about.

111
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,437
I cannot have him becoming
a target for Jock.

112
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,805
Of course.

113
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:34,274
I won't ask you to go to him.

114
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,908
Thank you.

115
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:55,160
Ohh!

116
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,334
She says you have a real forehand.

117
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,636
Do a thing, do it well.

118
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,171
Your mother teach you that?

119
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,539
The opposite, maybe.

120
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,040
Thanks for setting this up.

121
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,476
Listen, Axe, I'm pulling capital.

122
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:15,279
All of it?

123
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,882
1.5 billion.

124
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,583
Oh, that's almost half the investment.

125
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,786
I got a good opportunity.

126
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,087
Good for you.

127
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:24,822
A Russian oil venture.

128
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,290
What you would call a "mortal lock."

129
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,092
Your money just landed.

130
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:32,561
I put it in, I take it out.
I shake it all about.

131
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,563
You know I normally
have a quarterly gate

132
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,765
for people with new money.

133
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,866
But as a courtesy to you

134
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,802
I let you come in
without that restriction.

135
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,337
And I appreciate the courtesy.

136
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,239
Now I must take advantage.

137
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:53,648
What'd he say?

138
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,717
To let you win next time.

139
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
I told him that's never gonna happen.

140
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,487
You're way too smart
to believe that anyway.

141
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,955
You got that right.

142
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:05,893
Thanks. It was awesome.

143
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:09,596
Wags, rally the team.

144
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,166
We need to step up the
timeline on the raise.

145
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,338
The AG is here.

146
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:21,607
When you say "here"...?

147
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,776
Mr. Jeffcoat is in the library.

148
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:31,885
General! Had I known,
I'd've organized a marching band.

149
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:33,720
In no mood to be serenaded.

150
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,988
On my way in from the airport
I couldn't help but notice

151
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,192
what a... shithole some areas are.

152
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,261
Yes, well,
there's underprivileged people

153
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,495
living out there in low-income...

154
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,331
Shitholes, Chuck.

155
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,066
Gave me an idea.

156
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,834
Well, it was
Giuliani's brainstorm first,

157
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,736
back in the golden era of Reagan.

158
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,238
But I'm gonna bring it
back like bell bottoms.

159
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,206
We are.

160
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,208
Federal Day.

161
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,878
I don't think a Federal Day
is really going to change very much...

162
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,013
It will for a spell.

163
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,514
That's more than you've done.

164
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,216
You and your counterparts
are going to grab up

165
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,585
every city and state drug case tomorrow

166
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,353
and make them <i>our</i> cases.

167
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:13,690
We are going to prosecute. And hard.

168
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,360
You want to deploy federal resources

169
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,562
in prosecuting dime bag amounts
in housing projects and the like?

170
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:22,132
It is my fondest wish.

171
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,235
Ooh, by the by, um...

172
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,104
I have the missus in tow
with me on this trip.

173
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:30,439
And, uh, she's mentioned
how she's grown tired

174
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,241
of restaurant eating on the road.

175
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:33,376
Oh.

176
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,380
We both have...

177
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,714
Oh, well,

178
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:42,084
why are you eating in restaurants,
when Wendy and I live here?!

179
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,920
- Oh, Chuck...
- No, no, you'll, uh...

180
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,788
you'll come for dinner.

181
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,791
What a neighborly offer.
We gladly accept.

182
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,259
Good.

183
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:53,895
Great. Well, all right.

184
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,997
Great. Okay. Very good.

185
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:02,036
Okay, we need to move
quickly on the cap raise.

186
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:04,638
The Sex Wax is going on
the surfboard as we speak.

187
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,241
Getting into the spirit
of talking to the primes...

188
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,044
I mean to say: we are well positioned.

189
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,378
I've been backchanneling with them,

190
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,114
and landing that Grigor money
lubricates as you said it would...

191
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,682
it's telling the story that we are back.

192
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:18,818
- Danger, Will Robinson!
- The fuck, Spyros?

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,421
I couldn't stop him,
he said it was DEFCON six urgent.

194
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,922
The DEFCON scale only goes to five...

195
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,023
Exactly.

196
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,659
- And one is the most severe.
- Whatever.

197
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:30,229
We just had 1.5 big ones
pulled out of the firm.

198
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:32,432
- Oh, shit...
- Yeah.

199
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,799
That can only be one person...

200
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,035
It's Grigor Andolov.

201
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,904
And just so you know for the future:

202
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:41,706
you don't have walk-in privileges.

203
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,909
Sugarpova?

204
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:47,179
High end!

205
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,113
Yumster!

206
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,786
You knew? You were going to have
us lie in the raise meetings.

207
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,555
I thought I had a few more
days until the redemption,

208
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,624
which meant all the meetings
we had wouldn't have been lies.

209
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,860
The Street will see the drop
in assets under management

210
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,062
and read it as one of two things:
redemptions or loss.

211
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:06,263
Either way fucks the cap raise.

212
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,764
Yeah, so. We lever up big, and quick.

213
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,133
Leverage on that scale
would have to flow

214
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,167
from the institutions.

215
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,568
The Street will know we're fucked.

216
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,770
Well, you have an alternative?

217
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,839
I do. Frotty Anisman.

218
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:18,741
- Gross.
- Who?

219
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,143
Liquid as hell.

220
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,878
He works outside the
main of the business.

221
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,114
He's a middle man for big money...

222
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:26,482
Middle Eastern money,
South American money,

223
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,084
dictators, anyone who's got it.

224
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:30,519
Sounds somewhat ideal.

225
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,121
You don't know him.

226
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,089
That is an unpalatable idea, Wags.

227
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:35,957
Does that mean it's a no?

228
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,627
It's an unpalatable idea...

229
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:43,431
Taylor, scour the floor
for any quick plays

230
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,899
to make up the shortfall.

231
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,635
Obscure the reason,
but make it clear the timeframe is now.

232
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,075
Say it.

233
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:57,345
Carly. Victor. Panay.
All the satellite funds.

234
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,379
Bring them onboard.

235
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,447
Now, that's a fucking good idea...

236
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,982
But the one thing more
important than giving oxygen

237
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,718
to the fire of Axe Cap is
keeping my escape hatches open

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,522
in case those pricks from the government
ever come after me again.

239
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:11,358
So, maybe, Raul.

240
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,625
Time to call the cops.

241
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,227
Bring his fund back to the mothership.

242
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:19,865
Raul, I got a treat for you tonight.

243
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,269
This is the ramen that blew
Osakisan's mind in Tokyo.

244
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,338
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Ivan.

245
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,976
This is for you.

246
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,045
It's your piece of Panay.

247
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:37,215
The PIN is the date you came to Axe Cap.

248
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,250
Prosperous day for us both.

249
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:41,553
As they shall continue to be.

250
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,921
More so once you've come back.

251
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:47,725
Shit. Come on, we've had
some quiet success with Panay.

252
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,760
With your hand on the wheel, sure,

253
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,630
but my board of directors likes quiet.

254
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:56,533
Your board likes Devin Hester returns

255
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,202
and I'm the only one
who can take their money

256
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,370
a hundred and nine yards
to the promised land.

257
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:02,072
You're doing that. Through Panay.

258
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,507
Still too soon.

259
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,078
Okay, if you're not
gonna come back yourself,

260
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,713
go to work for me.

261
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,816
Firefighters pension fund,
Sanitation workers fund,

262
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,651
Corrections officers...

263
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:18,321
convince 'em to come onboard Axe Cap.

264
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:20,656
Come on, feed me some red meat, man.
You'll get a cut.

265
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,525
You putting me out on
the street like I used to

266
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:25,093
with my runny nosed junkie CIs.

267
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:28,330
Yeah, that drive in your pocket's
gonna give you a lot more motivation

268
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,565
than the crumpled twenties
and the methadone tabs

269
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,134
you used to give them.

270
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,769
I'll make some calls.

271
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:38,206
And I won't ask why you're so desperate
for this immediate cash infusion...

272
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,511
<i>I almost didn't take this meeting.</i>

273
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:46,913
Because Kate would have called me,

274
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,982
told me the agenda

275
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,952
if it were something
on the<i> actual</i> agenda.

276
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,055
So you both need something from me...
but you're here alone.

277
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,191
You didn't want her
compromised by asking.

278
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,028
Well, uh...

279
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,830
there's a reason you're where
you are in life, Franklin.

280
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,199
- There are many.
- Mm.

281
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:07,534
Luck prominent among them.

282
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:08,555
Mm.

283
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:13,206
And, yes, certain tools,
skills, abilities.

284
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,574
How can I use those
to benefit you today?

285
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:19,278
Good. Let's go right at it. Yes.

286
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,314
I'm trying to understand how
a particular set of deals

287
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,816
would have been made several years back.

288
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:29,388
Local television station deals.
In Texas.

289
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:34,659
By powerful government officials.

290
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,328
Dangerous ground for anyone
to look at these days.

291
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,829
More so for you.

292
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,567
Kind of man would I be if
I let that danger stop me?

293
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:47,104
Are you particularly focused on deals
that revolve around a religious center

294
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:50,039
and its ability to broadcast
its message widely?

295
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:52,375
I am.

296
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,877
I should be.

297
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,446
Right?

298
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:59,115
Follow me closely here.

299
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,418
I can't engage.

300
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,920
Can't talk specifically about it.

301
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,122
I have a duty to my board
and shareholders...

302
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,023
not to get the company on the shit list

303
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
of the most powerful
lawman in the country...

304
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,060
and I must hew to that.

305
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:17,099
Let's speak more broadly, then.

306
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,500
Philosophically...

307
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:24,372
Not going to sit here and run
you through how land deals...

308
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,940
Whose land?

309
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,975
Exactly.

310
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,378
How those deals were struck a decade ago

311
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,947
to allow wires to run
across half the state.

312
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,850
How land leases, conservation areas

313
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:39,654
and water rights might have been
eminent domained and such.

314
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,321
And what that might have cost who.

315
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,724
And who might have benefited.

316
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,393
I'd never ask you to give
me that kind of info,

317
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,394
for the record.

318
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,662
No, that'd be helping me.

319
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,799
Which you are not.

320
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:56,002
The last time I was in Texas,
Jock was still governor.

321
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,770
And had oversight over the entire state.

322
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:58,771
You know that.

323
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:02,007
What you don't know is the ways
in which he wielded that influence.

324
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,278
We all, every one of us
in the media landscape,

325
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,480
had to kiss his ring.

326
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,383
After that, I thought:
been there, done that.

327
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:11,484
And stayed away.

328
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:14,952
Never thinking he'd end up in a place
where he could do more damage.

329
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:18,390
Unless someone, somehow stopped him.

330
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,302
You're white-knuckling your necktie.

331
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:32,291
What is it?

332
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:39,443
Um... we're having dinner
with the Attorney General and his wife.

333
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,511
Tonight.

334
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:44,114
Oh.

335
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:45,783
Where are we going?

336
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:49,118
Well, they've, uh...

337
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,355
they've, uh, tired of restaurant eating.

338
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:53,756
Restaurant eating?

339
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,559
That's like being tired of air flying.

340
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,093
What other kind is there?

341
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:06,901
I'm really supposed to
cook for these people?

342
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,740
Do we know anything about Mrs. Jeffcoat?

343
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:15,777
Uh... goes by Anne.

344
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,347
Actually, that's her name.
Probably goes by Mother.

345
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:20,114
So we're doing this?

346
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,617
Fuck. We're doing this.

347
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,655
Well, I'm not putting on an apron.

348
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,990
That's not a story they're leaving with.

349
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:33,093
What then?

350
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,032
A quick thing?

351
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,403
Sure.

352
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,636
<i>Spartan-Ives for you.</i>

353
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,473
<i>Axe, I've got Kansas City in town.</i>

354
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,575
<i>The Heavy Construction
Laborers Union fund.</i>

355
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:49,642
They heard you got your icebreaker.

356
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,043
They're coming to you for a meeting.

357
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,480
Starting investment is 500 million.

358
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:56,182
Well, we'll see about upping
that number. Send them in.

359
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,650
Just a warning: they're straitlaced.

360
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,786
I'm taking them to<i> Cats,</i> not The Box.

361
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,221
Okay. So we'll give them
milk with their Michter's.

362
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:05,724
And when we're sitting
at the table with 'em,

363
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,594
you sell them the car with
the Tru-Coat sealant you hear?

364
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,262
Go Bears!

365
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,830
You came in for something.

366
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,398
A minor key personal thing.

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,066
Can you arrange NoMad for me
and some out of town guests?

368
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,403
Sure. Oscar isn't wired in New York?

369
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,838
He is, but I want to deliver
this for him as a present.

370
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,840
It's a business thing,
a little celebration.

371
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,009
Okay. I'll call Will Guidara now.

372
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:30,947
<i>You really are starting a war.</i>

373
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,082
Like Costner did in<i> Wolves.</i>

374
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,619
Riding right up to the enemy line,

375
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,387
letting 'em take their shots at you,

376
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,456
almost daring them to kill you.

377
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,025
Like him,
I am the walking wounded already.

378
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,693
Might as well go out Bon Jovi style.

379
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,328
<i>Blaze of Glory,</i> huh?

380
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,530
You've worked for me a long while, Kate,

381
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,864
you've studied hard. Good one.

382
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,232
So we can't talk you out of this one?

383
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,301
No.

384
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:55,704
But we can be more careful
than Mr. Costner was.

385
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,541
So as not to tip off Main Justice
until the case is built.

386
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,476
Not easy.

387
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,179
We refer to this defendant as
"Anonymous"

388
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,414
so we don't have to notify
the Inspector General

389
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:10,718
and do a Special Grand Jury,
which would blow this whole thing up.

390
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,821
We have to build this one alone.

391
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,690
And yeah. That ain't gonna be easy.

392
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,693
But, hey, if we wanted to be
in the "easy" business,

393
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,262
we'd have gone to med school.

394
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,296
I really have taught you well.

395
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:26,700
So the guy you need
to see is Ashley Cutler.

396
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:28,769
He's a principal at
Cutler Wealth Management.

397
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:30,904
It's that New York City
hedge fund that manages

398
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:33,173
the financial assets of
Jock's brother's megachurch.

399
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,508
Why don't I go over there?

400
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,945
Because Cutler Wealth
Management is a front.

401
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:47,787
<i>It's a broom closet in Midtown.</i>

402
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:49,655
What's behind it?

403
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:50,723
We don't know yet.

404
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,125
But we drilled down
and found his residence.

405
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:54,694
Expensive property outside of Newburgh.

406
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:57,829
His EZ Pass and his phone
have him at the house.

407
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,900
You can't take your government car.

408
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,236
Rental, in my name, in the garage.

409
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:06,638
Good.

410
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,874
I should get on the road,

411
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:12,110
I have a dinner I really can't miss.

412
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:14,177
I thought we were making progress.

413
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,946
When I'd heard you'd
stood up to Dollar Bill.

414
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,280
Me too!

415
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:19,116
But it didn't last.

416
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:22,786
I think the snap back made
me even more timid, somehow.

417
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,488
What happened today?

418
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,057
You know we're looking for
short term cash generators.

419
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,325
<i>I have one.</i>

420
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:35,297
I'd like to talk, um, to you later.

421
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,435
I have, maybe, I might have an idea
to generate alpha, quickly.

422
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:40,369
Go!

423
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:42,805
Here?

424
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:45,942
This is where it all happens. Let fly.

425
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,809
Now.

426
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:48,844
I've...

427
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:50,546
uh...

428
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,881
been tracking rental
car companies for years.

429
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,282
Is this an automotive play?

430
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,251
Because we're
well covered in that space.

431
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,754
It isn't.

432
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,857
But there's a kernel of
an idea that's grown...

433
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,209
And?

434
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,862
<i>But I couldn't pitch it.</i>

435
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:11,699
And then, I couldn't even... go...

436
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:14,301
Go?

437
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:22,042
It's hard to concentrate with
all of you watching right now.

438
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,211
<i>Pee. I had pee fright.</i>

439
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,984
Come on. Let's walk.

440
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,021
We do assessments of
everyone who works here.

441
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:38,356
To see who might be a candidate
for one of these offices.

442
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,758
The C-suite offices?

443
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,093
That's right.

444
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,260
Most of the time it just confirms

445
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:44,029
that most folks are exactly
where they should be.

446
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,600
They've topped out.
Or worse, are going to bottom out.

447
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,868
Is that what mine says?

448
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:52,471
Would I have brought you up here
if you were bottoming out?

449
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:53,872
No...?

450
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,107
Well, actually, I might.
If I thought you needed a jolt.

451
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,375
But this is not that.
This is: right now, at this moment,

452
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:02,213
if you want to finally live the fuck up
to your potential instead of spiraling,

453
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,916
you must find a way
to shift the paradigm.

454
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,653
That could be your office,

455
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:09,654
or that.

456
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:11,122
CIO, picking the strategies.

457
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:12,756
COO, managing the risk.

458
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:13,690
Eh...

459
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,459
Maybe even...

460
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:17,828
Owner?

461
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,764
Yes, instead of being down there,

462
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,198
with them.

463
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:24,501
But that's where I'm comfortable.

464
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,269
No. It's where you've made yourself fit.

465
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:29,972
Because you're so bound
up in being the smallest,

466
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:33,142
most helpful,
unobtrusive version of yourself.

467
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:35,544
Just like your mother
shits on your head for.

468
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:38,080
Now, what you need to do
to prove her wrong,

469
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:40,315
and prove it to yourself, is something

470
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,718
totally out of character, big and bold.

471
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Something public,

472
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:48,023
that terrifies you,
in order to free yourself.

473
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,826
Like... recite a sonnet to a crowd.

474
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,030
Invite the office to see you skydive.

475
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,497
Become a Toastmaster.

476
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,400
Something totally out of character.

477
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,235
You have to break through
the confidence barrier,

478
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:05,839
because then... you'll break through
the C-suite barrier, too.

479
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,930
Sorry man, firefighters won't touch you.

480
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:33,900
They sprint into burning buildings
but they're afraid of us?

481
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,535
It's not fear, Wags,
they're still pissed about 9/11.

482
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:38,003
A little bit.

483
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,470
What about Sanitation?

484
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:41,973
Too many retired firefighters
in that union. It's a no-go.

485
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:44,876
If it's one thing I know about you

486
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:47,079
it's that that wasn't your only idea.

487
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:48,947
You'll move on to the
next one and make it work.

488
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:50,949
Not sure the next one's fully formed.

489
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:52,483
That's because you
keep looking backwards

490
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,852
to the kind of people who
used to invest with you.

491
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:56,420
Instead of forward

492
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:58,689
to the sort of folks you can get now.

493
00:22:58,791 --> 00:22:59,857
You have to change.

494
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,959
That's what I learned on the job.

495
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:04,394
Six percent of the class
gets promoted to lieutenant.

496
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:05,629
Other guys, they got a choice.

497
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,832
They either accept that
they were left behind.

498
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,734
Or they claw themselves
forward taking shit assignments

499
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,401
no one else is willing to take.

500
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:14,604
Hope to edge up from there.

501
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,247
Alright.

502
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,850
Let's book that unpalatable
meeting on City Island.

503
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,672
Hello.

504
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:54,075
I'm here to see Mr. Cutler.

505
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:57,444
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Cutler's not here.

506
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:58,512
Really?

507
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:01,382
'Cause I have information
that says he is.

508
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:03,784
He packed some things. He's gone.

509
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,821
Look, uh...

510
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:10,891
I am the United States Attorney
for the Southern District of New York.

511
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,160
It's an official matter.

512
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:14,727
You can check...

513
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,980
Cutler's on the lam
or he went to the AG.

514
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,714
Either way,
he didn't want to be tracked.

515
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:39,717
Uh... impossible. He couldn't
have known you were coming.

516
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,120
Have you two been making your
calls on government landlines?

517
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,788
Encrypted wireless.

518
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,889
Good.

519
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,057
We have to find him.

520
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,026
Sacker, you got FBI you can trust?

521
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,028
Yeah, I got a guy I can ask. He's solid.

522
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,062
Do it.

523
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:03,340
Let's make this quick.

524
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,342
Gotta get back for Gordie's birthday.

525
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,714
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

526
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:18,221
Mmm. Hey, listen,
I could do about six more of these.

527
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:19,755
I'll bet.

528
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:20,990
You want?

529
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:21,958
No?

530
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,959
Oh!

531
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:25,161
Ah, shit!

532
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:28,496
Alright. Look, Axey,
you're sitting with me.

533
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:31,833
So I know you must be desperate
as a fraternity pledge

534
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:34,535
who can't find a date for
the screw-your-brother dance.

535
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:36,371
Yeah, well,
there's a window into your youth

536
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,839
I could've done without right now.

537
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:39,875
No.

538
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:42,844
But what you must need is capital.

539
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:44,544
I'll provide it.

540
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,713
I'll move in my Jordanian investors,

541
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:49,516
as a purchase of twenty percent
of your fund, passively,

542
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:51,352
no controls at all

543
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,787
on investment, management,
risk, anything like that.

544
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,356
So what do you want,

545
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:57,724
apart from the payout
that you get year to year?

546
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,394
There are men who would
be too proud to tell you.

547
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:01,761
You're not one of them.

548
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:04,998
I want you to slap my name

549
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,033
on the ass end of yours,

550
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:11,637
so it's Axe/Anisman Capital.

551
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:14,107
There'll be no ass slapping
of any kind, Frotty.

552
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,175
It's Axe Cap. And it will stay that way

553
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:19,644
until they drop me in a
hole and toss the dirt in.

554
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,713
Fine. Alright. Forget the name.

555
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,716
But, uh... I need your glow.

556
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:30,322
I want you to hug me in public.

557
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,057
Come to my conference in Tulsa,

558
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,260
tell folks I am a wise counselor
whose words have great weight for you.

559
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,929
You think standing next to our boy

560
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,532
will make that mirepoix
of psoriasis, dandruff,

561
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,901
and irritable bowel syndrome disappear?

562
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,637
I don't have IBS. Technically.

563
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,739
And yes I do think so.

564
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,474
Because while he's surfed above it all,

565
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,675
I've been treated like Eddie
Mush with a pocketbook.

566
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,676
Mm?

567
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,746
If you want my Jordanian money,

568
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,848
you got to cuddle up.

569
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,158
I'll agree.

570
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,927
With one condition:
If I want to buy you out in a year...

571
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,563
give you your money back
with a profit... you have to let me.

572
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:15,664
I need that freedom.

573
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,302
Well, that's why
you couldn't make this deal

574
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:21,303
with an institution.

575
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:23,005
No one would ever agree to that.

576
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:25,874
Fine.

577
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,876
At a forty percent premium.

578
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:34,648
Okay, Frotty.

579
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,853
We'll sign the deal at Axe Cap tomorrow.

580
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,223
I can't wait to fucking announce this!

581
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,691
Hey. Alright.

582
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,793
You guys want one of these, huh?

583
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:47,861
They're Wellfleet's.

584
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:51,031
They're plump and briny,
like my dream dates.

585
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:53,566
Hmm? No?

586
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:55,002
Hey.

587
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:56,103
Alright.

588
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:02,475
Hey boys...

589
00:28:04,678 --> 00:28:06,512
Hi, Dad.

590
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:08,814
Nice you showed up
for your own kid's party.

591
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:09,815
An hour late.

592
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:13,319
Well, looks like everybody's got
right into the spirit of it without me.

593
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,287
Should we have waited to get started?

594
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,256
Wow, you open any door
in this fucking city,

595
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,125
the dregs blow right in.

596
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:24,195
Well, this is my apartment.
So can't keep me out.

597
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:25,796
Enjoying that?

598
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,032
Hells to the yeah.

599
00:28:27,134 --> 00:28:29,434
Pizza's ready in five minutes!

600
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,308
Bruno...

601
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,849
Sorry to encroach.

602
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,421
I had a feeling I'd see ya,
but Gordie likes the pies.

603
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:52,888
Well...

604
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:57,293
Look, whatever went down between us,

605
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,162
I'd do anything for your kids.

606
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,930
Oh, fuck...

607
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,867
I never meant for business
to get between us.

608
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,536
Eh...

609
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:09,871
I should've never brought it
to you in the first place.

610
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,639
Friendship should stay clean.

611
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:19,247
Cent'ann'.

612
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:20,882
To your beautiful family.

613
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,455
Alright.

614
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,824
Let me ask you something.

615
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:33,527
When you started out way back,

616
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:34,761
everybody else in the neighborhood,

617
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:39,400
they took juiced up money,
Shylock money, mob money.

618
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:41,569
So how did you stay away
from it all these years?

619
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,971
Ahh, kid, the kind of money
those guys give you,

620
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:49,309
I mean, it's not like the
points on a regular loan.

621
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:52,479
You end up renting out
a hundred percent of your own ass.

622
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,414
Huh?

623
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:56,182
No seed money is worth that...

624
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:02,087
So I scraped it together myself.

625
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:03,422
Right.

626
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:07,792
And I had my family looking
at me like I was a hero,

627
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:09,060
a good man.

628
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,433
I never wanted to lose that.

629
00:30:18,037 --> 00:30:20,004
You kid...

630
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,741
Alright, come on!

631
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,843
I got pizza! Hot and ready. Come on!

632
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,878
- Hell yeah!
- I got a Margherita.

633
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,380
I got a clam with bacon.

634
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,482
I got a pepperoni coming up...

635
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,885
You grind up about
four pounds of fresh meat.

636
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:40,423
Anything's acceptable...
rabbit, possum, unidentified.

637
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:42,225
Stay away from skunk, though,

638
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:46,329
since its odiferousness tends to have
a negative effect on the final result.

639
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,198
And that's Texas Roadkill Chili?

640
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,766
It is indeed.

641
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:51,467
Smells a little bit like this tuna.

642
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:52,768
Hm.

643
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,571
Your cook seems good.

644
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:56,805
Mm.

645
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:58,240
Where's Chuck?

646
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:06,515
Fuck.

647
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,231
Oh, motherfucker.

648
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,271
No service.

649
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,475
Oh, motherfucker.

650
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:37,544
MOTHERFUCKER.

651
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:02,133
Could you perchance
raise him via telephone,

652
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:03,535
find out what's keeping him?

653
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:07,305
I mean, if it's something big,
maybe I should be in on it, too.

654
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:11,676
Is it? Big?

655
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:14,312
Did he say where he is, what he's up to?

656
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:15,979
I have tried.

657
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:18,449
He must be stuck on the subway.

658
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,150
I rode it once and was warned

659
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:22,686
that they expose themselves
to women down there.

660
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:24,154
Who's "they"?

661
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,890
You know, in Japan
they took out all the seats.

662
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,892
So now they're all crushed up together

663
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,562
like they're on some death
camp train from the Deuce.

664
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:34,731
Let's put Japan
on the never list, then.

665
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:36,532
Oh, it is, sugar. It is.

666
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,436
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

667
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:41,537
Finally.

668
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:43,606
Who's the help?

669
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,074
Axe's chef.

670
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:47,143
Let's not share that with our guests.

671
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,881
- Oh, hello. Forgive me.
- Oh, there he is!

672
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:53,815
Very sorry.

673
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,016
You remember my one and only?

674
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:56,885
Yes, of course. What a pleasure. Hello.

675
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,453
Where ya been? On a hot one?

676
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:00,121
You know, just making the rounds,

677
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:02,791
seeing that all the patients
are in bed and well tended to.

678
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,593
- You know.
- Federal Day?

679
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:06,060
Uh, you know it. Yeah.

680
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:06,960
No.

681
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:10,398
I don't think that's where you were.

682
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,000
You wouldn't be late 'cause of that.

683
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:14,535
Really.

684
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:17,237
You're working something...

685
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,878
It's big, isn't it?

686
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,842
But you don't want me
to know anything about it.

687
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,618
You want to surprise me with a big win.

688
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,353
Hm? Do I have it?

689
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,057
Nailed me.

690
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:42,761
Shall we all to table?

691
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:45,130
- Absolutely!
- After you, sugar.

692
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,732
- Thank you.
- Please.

693
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:53,639
Welcome.
This is compliments of Mr. Axelrod.

694
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,674
Dom Perignon P2.

695
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:57,108
Enjoy.

696
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:59,677
Well, to Genometech Atlas,

697
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,380
and the closing on our
final round this week...

698
00:34:02,482 --> 00:34:04,749
And to the man who built it,
Peyton Breen,

699
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,484
a unicorn walking among us.

700
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,553
Could not have done it
without you, Oscar.

701
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:12,357
Well, you could have,
but how would you have paid for it?

702
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:15,726
So, genomic mapping and decoding.

703
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:19,162
A home-use diagnostic kit
with an app-linked database...

704
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,930
That's how we monetize.

705
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,600
Send in a sample, map your genome,

706
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:25,836
find out exactly what drugs
you should be taking,

707
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:29,105
for what deficiency,
what disease, how much, when.

708
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:31,907
It will start as a shortcut
for doctors and patients,

709
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:33,843
but eventually, there won't be doctors.

710
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,745
Only the app and the patient.

711
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:38,681
That's how we <i>really</i> monetize.

712
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:40,549
I never thought I'd be
excited to hear someone

713
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,351
cut the human interface out of medicine

714
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:45,120
but I think I am.

715
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:47,456
Thanks.

716
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:49,123
We have so few nights together,

717
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:50,992
thank you for spending one on this.

718
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:53,862
Thank you for including me in your work.

719
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:56,264
You're incredible.

720
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:09,042
Anisman should be here any minute.

721
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,478
Grigor and his fucking money.

722
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,079
I never take it, he never pulls it.

723
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,615
I'm not even considering this.

724
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:21,955
I feel like Rick in<i> Casablanca,</i>
selling out to Signor Ferrari.

725
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:24,857
Hello.

726
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,091
Ah.

727
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:31,464
Bill.

728
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:37,837
Oh, Jesus.

729
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,238
Frotty Anisman.

730
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,306
I should have sniffed him out

731
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:43,775
from all the Sadelle's
they carted in before.

732
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,243
The fuck they call him Frotty?

733
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,645
Short for 'frottage.'

734
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,481
As in: stay out
of close quarters with him.

735
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,849
I'm still lost.

736
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:54,619
The practice of rubbing against
another person's clothed body

737
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,054
in a crowd for sexual gratification.

738
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,724
But for the record,
it's pronounced frot-tahge.

739
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,292
- Ohhh...
- Ohhh...

740
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,627
Totally gross

741
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:07,064
unless you're ScarJo
and JoGo in<i> Don Jon.</i>

742
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,499
Then it's hot as fuck.

743
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,604
He's here.

744
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,139
I'm gonna go greet.

745
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,150
Hey, how was NoMad?

746
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,719
It was perfect.
Thank you so much for setting it up.

747
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,821
Oscar loved it.
And so did Peyton Breen...

748
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:36,324
Good. Glad to hear it.

749
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,626
So you're really doing it,

750
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,260
selling off a piece of Axe Capital.

751
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,029
Will it be worth it for the cap raise?

752
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,598
Well, we'll see.

753
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:49,269
Oh!

754
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,539
Ah, shit!

755
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,444
So, you ready to go?

756
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,448
Okay. Okay.

757
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:04,551
All right. I guess
this is what we're doing.

758
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,085
It seems to be.

759
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,057
All right.

760
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,959
We're almost there, huh?

761
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:15,629
Almost closed on the deal of it all.

762
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:16,763
We<i> have</i> a deal.

763
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:18,197
Yes, we do.

764
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:19,566
Alllllmosst.

765
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:22,601
Because I got to thinking
about what I am buying.

766
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,736
And I realized

767
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,505
I'm leaving the most
valuable part untapped.

768
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:27,540
And what's that?

769
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:28,473
Your trades.

770
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,244
I can make far more money following you

771
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:33,445
than I even will owning you.

772
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:35,447
You won't be owning me.

773
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,616
You'll be owning a small
piece of my company

774
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:39,083
that I can call back.

775
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:41,619
All the more, sir, all the more.

776
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:44,221
I need total transparency.

777
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,891
And you're gonna give it to me
because you got nothing else.

778
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,860
Gornisht. Bupkis. Nul.

779
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,433
I can't do it...

780
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:58,936
I won't do it...

781
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,740
Go home. I pass.

782
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,143
You need me.

783
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:09,947
You're not getting anywhere
without me and my money.

784
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:12,982
Frotty, I got billions of dollars,
hundreds of employees,

785
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,117
and two kids at home
who think I can fly.

786
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,687
What the fuck do you have?

787
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,589
The only thing you need.

788
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:20,590
More.

789
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:25,394
All the same, get the fuck out.

790
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,532
Fine.

791
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:34,903
Fine.

792
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:45,346
You know I love it when you move
with the mystery of Yahweh,

793
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,647
but what the fuck?

794
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,682
I hope you have something

795
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,985
because you just threw
out the thing we had.

796
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,722
I might.

797
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:56,356
I just might.

798
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:59,493
<i>We got Cutler.
Dive motel in Newark.</i>

799
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:05,397
He bought a plane ticket from
Newark to Caracas, in cash.

800
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,800
But he entered his TSA
number when he checked in.

801
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,736
So we canvassed all the local hotels.

802
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:10,937
Nice work, Dancshazy.

803
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,039
You want us to take
him in for processing?

804
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:14,607
Not sure what charges you're bringing.

805
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,609
Even sitting on him for
this long gonna be a problem

806
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:18,111
unless you've got something on him...

807
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:20,346
You can go. It's just a chat.

808
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:23,248
By the time we're done
he won't be filing any complaints.

809
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,622
Sir.

810
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,892
Mr. Cutler.

811
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:37,928
Sweltering in Caracas right now.

812
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:40,064
Unbearable.

813
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:43,500
Why the sudden trip in the worsted wool?

814
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:45,636
I heard on the wind
it'd be a good time to go.

815
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:48,906
Ahh, New York finance whiz like you,

816
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:52,143
you're probably making a
currency play on the Bolivar.

817
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,911
Oh, but that's right,

818
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,246
you're not a New York finance whiz.

819
00:39:57,348 --> 00:40:00,016
Why the New York bust out shop?

820
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:02,118
I keep an address.

821
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,020
It's a move that's widely practiced.

822
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,760
Tell me about the Jeffcoats' business

823
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:13,195
and you'll be on your flight
to Venezuela in no time.

824
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,565
Let's call the Jeffcoats.

825
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,934
Together.
If you're so fucking interested.

826
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,703
Mm.

827
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,238
Sure, we can call them,

828
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,908
but would they be
happy to hear from you?

829
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,610
You've been on a hell of a
losing streak with their money.

830
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:30,978
Markets are tough.

831
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,647
Oh, a pack of monkeys
throwing darts at a board

832
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,380
would do better than you...

833
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:39,987
ten, twelve,
fifteen million dollar losses...

834
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,056
Ten years running!

835
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:46,693
The church has a longer horizon
than ordinary investors...

836
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:49,662
Come on, we both know
you're not executing any trades.

837
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,998
You know who that sounds like?

838
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,366
I'll give you a hint,

839
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:56,103
you'll be rooming with
him at Camp Butner.

840
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,005
That's right, Madoff.

841
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,541
Because I know the church
is 'investing' with you,

842
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:04,977
and you're kicking it back as cash
and writing it off as losses.

843
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:11,350
Now, where the fuck did
Jeffcoat get all this money

844
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:12,584
he put with you?

845
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:15,054
I tell you, I get to leave?

846
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,389
You're fresh out of conditions.

847
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:20,324
Jail or not?

848
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:21,559
Alright...

849
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:26,631
The cable company. TexasSouthCable.

850
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,667
Jeffcoats made their money
by letting it run its lines

851
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,304
underneath the family ranchland
for monster licensing fees.

852
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,007
Four times market.

853
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:37,474
They kicked back a chunk of that

854
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:39,977
to the cable company president,
of course...

855
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,044
They got rich.

856
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,781
How come the money never
showed up as income?

857
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:45,348
Charitable donations.

858
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,951
- The church.
- Yep. That was their laundry.

859
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:51,554
And they split up the cash,
bought some television stations.

860
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:53,456
Parishioners donated their money.

861
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,991
The church feeds that to me.

862
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:56,492
I... you know, with the books.

863
00:41:56,594 --> 00:42:01,097
And cut the shell corp checks.

864
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:05,434
And to save yourself,
you are willing to testify

865
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:09,471
Jock Jeffcoat profited
along with his brother?

866
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:11,039
<i>Still</i> profits.

867
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:12,207
I know he does.

868
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:18,847
Good thing is there's no paperwork.

869
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,215
The Chuck Rhoades Special.

870
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:22,517
So which case
are we filing the OT under?

871
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,987
Nah, we gotta eat this one
for Kate. I owe you...

872
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:27,689
Have a good night.

873
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,759
You're Agent Dancshazy.

874
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,561
You're the new Special Counsel.

875
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:35,830
We know each other.

876
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:39,399
We've met...
night at the bar a while back...

877
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:42,469
Just want you to know:
I have no beef with you.

878
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,238
Yeah. Sure. No problem.

879
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,739
Same team right?

880
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:47,874
Right.

881
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,542
You. Me. Director Lynch.

882
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:52,545
Sacker. Chuck Rhoades.
All of us. All the way.

883
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:53,579
Hm.

884
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:55,414
Yeah.

885
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,560
Have you done it?

886
00:43:08,662 --> 00:43:10,128
N-Not yet.

887
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:11,196
I just...

888
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:13,198
Don't you say the word 'can't' to me.

889
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,199
You<i> will.</i>

890
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,103
The only question is when.

891
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:27,845
Beyond our long-short
strategies and derivatives

892
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,915
we look for options inefficiencies
in convert arb situations.

893
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:32,884
We get the stability of a convert arb

894
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,986
plus the multiplier effect of
using those inefficient options.

895
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:38,321
Taylor's pitching a shut out in there.

896
00:43:38,423 --> 00:43:40,556
These Kansas City yokels
are lapping it up.

897
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:42,692
Between that and playing you
like the great and powerful Oz,

898
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,227
too busy for the meeting, it's working.

899
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,262
- Good.
- Groups like this

900
00:43:45,364 --> 00:43:46,363
never say yes in the room.

901
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:47,530
I'll text you when the meeting breaks.

902
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:49,799
Okay. Hey, I'll catch you
down by the elevator...

903
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:51,868
"I had to at least say hello..."
and ride down with them.

904
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,602
And, you know, try to ram it home.

905
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:56,338
Squirt some of that winner musk
all over 'em.

906
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,108
I plan to.

907
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,419
- Hey folks, folks.
- Oh. Hi, Axe.

908
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:13,922
I really wish I could've been
in on that meeting with you,

909
00:44:14,024 --> 00:44:17,258
but I couldn't let you out of here
without looking you in the eye

910
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,193
and shaking your hand.

911
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:22,297
Eh, you know what,
I'll ride down with you.

912
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,965
Thanks, Bobby. We appreciate that.

913
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,034
Yeah, thank you. Sure you're busy.

914
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:29,202
And so,
how is our fair city treating you?

915
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,975
Not now.

916
00:44:35,077 --> 00:44:36,343
Not now. Ben!

917
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:38,678
You tried Carmine's yet?

918
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,846
- Not now. Psst. Ben! Ben!
- Not yet.

919
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,514
We're going tonight before<i> Cats.</i>

920
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:43,450
Isn't it great they brought<i> Cats</i> back?

921
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:44,683
Absolutely...

922
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,341
Ben!

923
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,079
Ben...

924
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:17,548
Ben?

925
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:19,950
Ben!

926
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:40,403
You know, when it comes
to pension fund managers,

927
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,705
these groups never give
an answer in the room.

928
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:44,240
But they did this time...

929
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,441
The answer was no...

930
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,642
It was 'heck no.'

931
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:49,278
They didn't like it?

932
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:54,649
Found it offensive,
called us unprofessional.

933
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,586
So... what the hell was that?

934
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,627
I've been tracking rental
car usage in business cities,

935
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,063
developing relationships
with managers there.

936
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,763
Based on lots of activity in Milwaukee,

937
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:12,099
I've deduced a big move is going down...

938
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:13,700
Talk more.

939
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,003
Managers of the main airport
locations have confirmed

940
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:20,207
that there are lots of Dutch passports
being presented for car rentals.

941
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:22,609
Holland Inter-Bev's going
after Beer National.

942
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:25,079
My sources were able to confirm, by GPS,

943
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:27,480
that all these cars have been
going from a Courtyard Marriott

944
00:46:27,582 --> 00:46:28,781
seven miles to...

945
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:30,783
Beer National's Milwaukee headquarters.

946
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:31,784
Right.

947
00:46:31,886 --> 00:46:33,119
I think there's a merger coming,

948
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:34,421
if not an outright purchase...

949
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:36,456
And Axe Cap will have
positions in both companies,

950
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,491
ready for the ride up
on the announcement.

951
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:46,998
Well fucking done, Ben Kim.

952
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,136
Maybe next time, keep your shirt on...

953
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:16,427
_

954
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:18,461
What the fuck?!

955
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:21,731
This is where<i> you</i> would
make some kind of reference

956
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,865
to a gangster movie betrayal.

957
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:24,033
As in: I went to the barber

958
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:25,502
and ended up on the
floor like Joey Gallo.

959
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:27,870
And you were the only one who
knew I was getting a haircut.

960
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:29,005
I probably would. Yeah.

961
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:30,974
But Joey Gallo got killed at Umberto's.

962
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:33,243
It was Anastasia
who got it at the barber shop.

963
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:34,910
Also: I didn't kill you.

964
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:36,612
You are standing here in my office,

965
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,214
not bleeding out on the linoleum.

966
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:39,548
Same difference in our world.

967
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,484
What, exactly, did you do?

968
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:45,654
- Breen.
- Bobby Axelrod.

969
00:47:45,756 --> 00:47:48,157
Now I know I'm in New York.

970
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:50,593
It's like seeing the Empire
State Building or something.

971
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,060
Well, I'm gonna give you the
view the tourists never get.

972
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:56,063
The floor<i> above</i> the deck with
the coin operated binocs.

973
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,199
Uh, what do I pay for that privilege?

974
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:00,935
No, no, no, the question is:
what do I pay?

975
00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:03,070
How do I get you to break
your letter of intent

976
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,405
with Oscar Langstraat?

977
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,744
Bought 50 percent of Breen's company,
at 200 million,

978
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,880
which placed its paper
value at 400 total.

979
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:16,950
NASDAQ have already confirmed
they are ready to accept

980
00:48:17,052 --> 00:48:20,754
our public offering at a
valuation of 2.4 billion.

981
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,090
That is a billion added to the value
of our balance sheets

982
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,092
and 800 million in gains this month...

983
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,061
It basically solves our problem.

984
00:48:29,164 --> 00:48:31,497
You sold out my relationship
in order to do it.

985
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,432
No, no. You did.

986
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,101
That's why you told me
he was at your dinner.

987
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:42,807
Congratulations, by the way.

988
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:46,278
You've earned out on your advance
and you're way into bonus already.

989
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:49,147
Hey...

990
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,217
I'm sorry.

991
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,186
No, you're not.

992
00:49:13,206 --> 00:49:14,871
What happened?

993
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:24,013
I'm sorry.

994
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:53,998
I just spoke to my dad.

995
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,232
Mm.

996
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:58,502
I figured you would.

997
00:50:58,604 --> 00:51:01,237
Was there really no other fucking way
that you could've accessed that info?

998
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,840
Perhaps. But I couldn't think of one,

999
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:06,310
and he was happy to help.

1000
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:07,477
For me.

1001
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:08,912
Yes.

1002
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:10,814
And that's good for you.

1003
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:15,018
It's like a Senator writing a letter
nominating someone to the Naval Academy.

1004
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,585
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

1005
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:20,022
I told you I need for
him to avoid jeopardy.

1006
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:22,658
And I need to succeed on my own.

1007
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,694
As do I.

1008
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:29,131
And yet, I have found my own father
to be an endless source of help.

1009
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,534
Especially when I'm certain
that I don't need it.

1010
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:34,101
I should be the one
to decide that, Chuck.

1011
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:35,804
Sometimes.

1012
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:37,706
But you came here to work for me.

1013
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:41,576
Yeah, in a business
that rewards various connections

1014
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,612
and keeps track of favors and chits.

1015
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:46,781
Sure, I did.

1016
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:50,484
Still, it just feels, uh...

1017
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:52,386
Kind of shitty.

1018
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:54,688
Right.

1019
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,623
And also kind of good, in a way,

1020
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:59,125
that my father came through.

1021
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:02,162
And that you went to him.
And now I own that chit.

1022
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,734
Fuck.

1023
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:09,869
You really might have
taught me too well.

1024
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:14,907
That could bite you someday.

1025
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:18,310
Well, I will gladly take that chance

1026
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:20,212
to have you with me today.

1027
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,009
My children.
You'll notice they don't whine.

1028
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,677
You've trained them well.

1029
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,213
Credit these women with that...

1030
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:59,449
my wife, my ex, my mother,

1031
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,784
but no.

1032
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,219
The kids came out that way.
We were lucky.

1033
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:08,190
Also, not American,
which when it comes to whining,

1034
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:09,692
really fucking helps.

1035
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,728
That it does.

1036
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,730
But you trained yourself though.

1037
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:17,733
I took from you. You didn't
make a squeal or spill a tear.

1038
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:19,501
Very un-American.

1039
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:20,769
Would it have worked?

1040
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:24,172
Only to make me never
think of you again.

1041
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:29,144
And somehow like the<i> man,</i>
Teףfilo Stevenson,

1042
00:53:29,246 --> 00:53:31,712
you boxed your way out of the corner

1043
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:34,615
and found a way to cover your losses.

1044
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,484
Well, what were the choices?

1045
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:38,218
Exactly as I'd see it.

1046
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:41,956
In the end, I decided
not to make the oil deal.

1047
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,993
For you?

1048
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,394
No.

1049
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:50,864
Eh, maybe a little bit.

1050
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:54,367
But now I put the money back.

1051
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:58,371
Along with a promise
to give you a warning

1052
00:53:58,474 --> 00:54:00,874
before I pull it again.

1053
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:02,809
Best I could hope for.

1054
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:04,878
I know you must've broken things...

1055
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,946
people, deals,

1056
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:09,515
someone's hopes and dreams...

1057
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:13,819
in order to get money
back into your firm.

1058
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:21,679
But you swallow it, here, now,

1059
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:23,862
because this is business and life

1060
00:54:23,964 --> 00:54:26,130
and who cares what it costs you?

1061
00:54:26,232 --> 00:54:27,599
Indeed.

1062
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:29,367
I tell you...

1063
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:33,938
you must always have a three
year old in your house,

1064
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,640
to make you appreciate life...

1065
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:39,343
And you must also have
your mother close.

1066
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:41,311
To keep the line unbroken.

1067
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:57,527
There is plenty I would kill for,

1068
00:54:57,629 --> 00:55:00,162
you know, if we're being honest.

1069
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:03,633
And there's no reason not to be.

1070
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,968
But family, Axe,

1071
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,037
I would do things for these people

1072
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,072
that you couldn't imagine.

1073
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,343
As they have all done for me.

1074
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,948
Especially her, my dear mama.

1075
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:36,196
You're the boy.

1076
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,165
Aren't you? In your story.

1077
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,536
Who took the wine from the stranger?

1078
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:45,873
If that were true,

1079
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,008
what would you be
saying about my mother?

1080
00:55:52,614 --> 00:55:56,683
That she did what she had
to do to protect her family.

1081
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,985
And you.

1082
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:00,453
And didn't complain.

1083
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,824
I am fortunate to have her.

1084
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:08,393
You are a fortunate man, Grigor.

1085
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,462
We are both so.

1086
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:14,466
And fortunate to have met when we did.

1087
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:12,920
Robert.

1088
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:15,923
Hi Mom.

1089
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:00,084
We either get to the other side
and line dance on Jock's grave,

1090
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:01,620
or he will dance on ours.

1091
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,344
I did more than just run your money,
I kept us alive.

1092
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:06,792
If you stop performing,
you will be replaced.

1093
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:09,989
There are men undermining
our sacred purpose.

1094
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,759
I want a hard target search
of every online footprint.

1095
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:14,327
I'm just not sure it's strictly legal.

1096
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:15,695
We can do it.

1097
00:58:15,797 --> 00:58:17,063
Most people pick their spots.

1098
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:18,364
Well, I pick every spot.

1099
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:20,567
And a win isn't a win
unless it's a kill.

1100

00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,375
he was just like I was
at that age.

319
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,958
Found myself wondering if he
was burning to get out too.

320
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,709
You should dig into that
when you go for dinner.

was worthwhile.

Hmm. I've been told.

00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:11,958
But this moment isn't about me.

372
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:16,167
Those words:
"Let Axe know."

373
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,876
They can't have felt good
coming out of your mouth.

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,834
I don't need a pep talk.

375
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,167
Well, you need something, bub.

376
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,626
'Cause you're scared
out of your fucking mind.

377
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,792
Bullshit.

378
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,792
I've been painting
since the fifth grade.

379
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,958
I sold my first painting
in the ninth.

380
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,417
So why does this
feel so different?

381
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,667
Who said it does?

382
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,215
Do I need to stare at you again?

383
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,542
Okay. Alright.

384
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,958
When I start a new one,

385
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:43,626
I-I like to walk around
the city a lot

386
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,958
until I feel special.

387
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:48,958
Until I know I'm the only one
in the world that can paint it.

<i>Self-hypnosis.

390
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,424
But lately?

391
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,250
We sure someone's not suffering

392
00:16:57,274 --> 00:17:00,500
from a dose of
imposter syndrome?

393
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,257
I know what I can do.

394
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,257
So you're fine then.

395
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:09,674
Yeah.

396
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,924
<i>Alright.
Alright. Alright.</i>

397
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,958
I can't get the feeling.

398
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,584
Ever since I-I-I signed
the contract

399
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:28,000
and I agreed to
the commission, I-I...

400
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,000
TANNER: The walks
are getting longer,

401
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,542
and 'special' doesn't seem
to be around.

402
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:36,250
Accepting this commission
is a new step for you.

403
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:39,751
And you can't figure out
what it means...

404
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,208
What it says about who you are.

405
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:44,417
<i>No. I know what it says...
I'm a sellout.</i>

406
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,417
Nah.

407
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,250
Too simple.

408
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:51,375
I mean, you can vilify
the money, if you want.

409
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,792
Blame it for your blockage,
if it helps you get past it.

410
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:57,876
It's like Oscar Wilde said:

411
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,375
"When bankers get together
for dinner, they discuss art.

412
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:04,208
When artists get together for
dinner, they discuss money."

413
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,834
The money shouldn't
change anything.

414
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,459
But it does.

415
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,042
It's got me all up in my head.

416
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,542
That's because
you're thinking of it

417
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,208
as the measure
of your artistic value,

418
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,459
and that's never been
what's motivated you before.

419
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,375
Whenever I work,
I-I don't even...

420
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,250
I don't even imagine
a buyer's face.

421
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,250
<i>I don't even think about it.
I force myself not to.</i>

422
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:25,667
And all I can think about now
is his reaction to my work.

423
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:28,876
That's because someone,
at some time,

424
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,375
probably your mom or dad,

425
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,459
made you feel like
a disappointment.

426
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,917
So now you're substituting
him for them.

427
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,417
Maybe a gym teacher.

428
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:41,173
<i>Nope. I was
good at sports.</i>

429
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:49,876
Point is:
You're on the precipice

430
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,584
of the kind of success
very few artists ever have.

431
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,125
But you have
created an obstruction

432
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,417
between you and that success.

433

- The old patch.
- That's right.

466
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:58,167
I got big plans:
A pedestrian mall downtown...

Revitalized shopping, cultural,
residential, office space.

Where Robert Axelrod made
similar financial inroads

955
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:46,792
into the community.

956
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,250
How did that work out, Marc?

957
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,584
<i>Honestly?
Not too well.</i>

958
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:53,208
MARC: There was a lot of
rosy talk about the future

959
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:54,917
and promises were made.

960
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:57,417
Only for our town's financing
to be ripped away

961
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,542
like one of those wax jobs
in a beauty salon.

962

MARC: <i>Hmm?
It really stung.</i>

963
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,542
And our town
will be recovering...

For generations to come.

you have the floor.</i>

Let me tell you what went wrong
in Sandicot.

972
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,958
It's true I made
a big investment there...

973
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:39,042
and we all had high hopes for
the future... until this man...

00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,459
<i>No, no! You're a sore
goddamned loser...</i>

975

Decided to pull his casino,

976
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:45,667
for no reason other than
his own greed,

977
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:48,375
and moved it to land
he held elsewhere.

978
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:51,876
He left us all holding the bag.

979
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,584
Now, efforts
are still being made.

980

But that callous style
of development

981
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:59,208

for me here...

982

Back in the mid-1800s,
whaling was like Facebook.

1128
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,125
Blubber was the oil that
lighted the Western world.

1129
00:50:14,149 --> 00:50:16,250
But by the second half
of that century,

1130
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:17,709
whale oil was replaced
by kerosene.

1131
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,417
Whaling became MySpace.

1132

the invention of electricity.

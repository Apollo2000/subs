1
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:06,532
<i>Previously on Billions...</i>

2
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:08,491
Taylor wants to destroy us.

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,782
They took the firefighters not because

4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,241
they needed that particular money

5
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,088
but as a straight-up "fuck you" to me.

6
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,866
What would Axe say if
he knew about this?

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,283
This has nothing to do with him.

8
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,657
Commissioner Sansome,
I wonder if I could trouble you

9
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:24,074
on the small matter of a carry permit
for a client of mine.

10
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,546
I'd like your permission to
see someone professional.

11
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,782
A dom?

12
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,866
You know I'm committed
to my government post...

13
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,616
The Secretary of the Treasury.

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,325
But, I do like to keep an
eye peeled for opportunities.

15
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,283
We need a strategic partnership.

16
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,450
Brian Dana's the right
partner for this project.

17
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,200
Taylor needs to be the one to crush it.

18
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:43,116
That will be the most devastating blow.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,845
With their dad in town,
they're working on something together.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,454
- Sounds sweet.
- Right. Yeah.

21
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,824
Could be big too.

22
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:52,033
Applying for a wiretap.
On Charles Rhoades, Senior.

23
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,491
Junior, too, actually.

24
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,033
FBI observed father and son

25
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,782
on the building site in question.

26
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:20,699
You said 'emergency.'

27
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,499
Look out there.

28
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,249
It's a Belgian Malinois.

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,041
Is that your dog?

30
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,583
Neighbor's.

31
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,249
- Is it...?
- Dead? Yes.

32
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,451
Are you drunk?

33
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,015
No.

34
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,166
I've been drinking. It's different.

35
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:54,041
What the fuck did you do?

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,499
The wife and I had a fight.

37
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:03,724
She decamped to the Baccarat.

38
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,099
That storm earlier?

39
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:07,849
Rain was coming down.
It was dark as hell.

40
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,682
I hear this banging at the back door,

41
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,807
saw a figure and fired.

42
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,058
It was instinct. I'm a man of action.

43
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,724
Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:17,558
Why did you call me?

45
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,849
You're my Michael Clayton.

46
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:24,141
I'm the Attorney General
of the State of... No.

47
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:25,682
Cops come yet?

48
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,558
I'm hoping anyone around
who heard the shot,

49
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,849
they thought it was thunder...

50
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:32,308
Who's that?

51
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:34,849
The cops. You know, "They don't call."

52
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,516
Uh, I can buy us some time,

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,266
but we're in a big fucking jackpot here.

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,516
You'd better engage a lawyer.

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,766
Try this one.

56
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,058
Now I'm gonna go out
there and try to make it

57
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,266
that you don't get arrested tonight.

58
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,224
Oh, hello, officers.

59
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,558
Perhaps you recognize me.

60
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:10,183
Mr. Secretary.

61
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,766
Mr. Attorney General.

62
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,350
Ah, you can call me Jock.

63
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,535
Jock.

64
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,224
I always assumed you got your nickname

65
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:19,475
because you were an athlete.

66
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,391
Yeah, not exactly.

67
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:23,891
I see that.

68
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,766
Those little flies painted in the basin,

69
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,807
they're good targets, aren't they?

70
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:33,350
Indeed.

71
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,183
Yeah, men need targets.

72
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,807
Keep things neat.

73
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:40,891
Sometimes men become targets.

74
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:44,600
No one likes to get pissed on.

75
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,433
You should know that you are a target.

76
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,183
Chuck Rhoades has you in his sights.

77
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:02,058
I'd appreciate any
details you could provide.

78
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,266
Well, I have been singing the
tune of the tufted titmouse,

79
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,641
but now I gotta go silent.

80
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:25,932
You want some Uova Picante Purgatorio?

81
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,391
- That's Eggs in...
- Purgatory, yes.

82
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:29,932
But no.

83
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:32,037
Close enough to that place as it is,
Commissioner.

84
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,389
That's why I'm here.

85
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,641
Sure is.

86
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,141
Come on.

87
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,600
Oh.

88
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,016
There it is, huh?

89
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,974
The Little League trophy!

90
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:49,600
To the victor.

91
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:52,058
You know, I'm glad I was
able to help you with that.

92
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,558
That thing's in the rearview.

93
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,099
I'm already onto next year.

94
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:57,433
Ah.

95
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,891
Right to it, then.

96
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,058
This is why you don't put a weapon

97
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,724
in the hands of an amateur.

98
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,291
I suppose we both bear
some blame for that.

99
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,224
Unh-unh-unh. I bear nothing.

100
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,849
And you're gonna make sure of that.

101
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:10,558
Yes. And to that end,

102
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,724
the neighbor might not
yet know his dog is dead.

103
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,475
Even when he finds out,

104
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:19,099
he won't find this.

105
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,724
You brought that fucking thing here?

106
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,266
So we can make it go away.

107
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,224
Hey, stop with the "we" shit.

108
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,308
Neither of us should be
in the middle of this.

109
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,849
Well, Brogan says I'm his fixer.

110
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,016
What, like Michael Clayton?

111
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,932
We did get him the carry permit,

112
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,974
so it's reasonable that he believes...

113
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,682
We again! Stop that or I'll
brain ya with the trophy.

114
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,099
What the real Michael
Clayton would know is,

115
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,058
we are the exact people who can't.

116
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,600
I can't. My signature's on the permit.

117
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,600
It'll look like I'm helping myself.

118
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,891
No, counselor.

119
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:52,350
You, alone, have to make this right.

120
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,932
For all of us.

121
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,849
Because if it comes out
that you influence peddled

122
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:57,807
a gun permit that killed a dog,

123
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,266
our reps and our careers
are gonna be deader

124
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,682
than that poor mutt.

125
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,391
It was a pure-breed.

126
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,849
Just like you.

127
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,183
So go fix it.

128
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,932
Now.

129
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,516
Leave me to my damn eggs and gravy.

130
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,600
Let's call this off-site to order.

131
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,475
That's a little extreme, isn't it,

132
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,308
meeting here in your secret clubhouse?

133
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,099
Well, no one needs to see this...

134
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,974
or you coming in and out of Axe Cap

135
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:26,386
while we're about to give you this task,

136
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:29,391
should you choose to accept it.

137
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,807
Besides...

138
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,183
this idea's a winner for you.

139
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,932
Aerospace innovation.

140
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,976
Plenty of upside,
or I wouldn't have brought it to you.

141
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,183
Brian Dana, 375Y. He's the VC partner.

142
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,724
Smart guy, good shop, for his scale.

143
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,766
I'm not gonna lie to you.

144
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:47,475
The developer behind
this tech is Douglas Mason.

145
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,766
Taylor's father.

146
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,766
Big fucking drop.

147
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,849
But it's a solid play. It's been vetted.

148
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,189
Vetted for making money

149
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,141
or for making Taylor's head
explode like in Scanners?

150
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,600
Bit of both.

151
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,932
Glad to know up front this time.

152
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,974
And know this up front,

153
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,308
I'll lock in a price so
that I can buy it from you

154
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,849
once you control it,
at a healthy profit.

155
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,558
So get in there.

156
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,141
Make 'em an offer they can't refuse.

157
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,766
Go in on an entire slate,

158
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,016
so you can disguise the intent.

159
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,183
Oh, I will.

160
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,224
That's what I do.

161
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,183
We have already won.

162
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,475
We've doubled up.

163
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:30,016
Big VC player... Rebecca Cantu...

164
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,558
wants to put in a hundred million

165
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,558
and ramp up the timetable to production.

166
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,433
That's what I'm talking about!

167
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,641
People seeing the intrinsic value.

168
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,183
What kind of controls will we have?

169
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,058
What kind of say when
it comes to development,

170
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:42,932
deployment, personnel on a go-forward?

171
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,641
All to be negotiated.

172
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,516
But my father,
he'd still be driving the R&D,

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,807
the production...

174
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:49,682
Exactly what I was going to ask.

175
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:53,266
This Rebecca Cantu is
clearly a very smart woman.

176
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,475
She's buying your idea,
she's buying you, right?

177
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,391
It's a good point.

178
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,682
So you'll sit with her
as soon as we close.

179
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,475
I imagine the moment she sits with you,

180
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,807
she'll realize how crucial you are.

181
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,558
"Imagine me and you. I do.

182
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:08,016
Happy together."

183
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,475
Most folks think that's a love song,

184
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:11,350
but if you listen closely,
you'll hear it's about

185
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:15,058
a relationship that
never actually happened.

186
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:18,183
The key to unlocking it
is that word, "imagine."

187
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,766
Taylor and I are going to
step out for a microsecond.

188
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,350
I see where you're going with this.

189
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,058
And now is the pause

190
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,682
where we think this
through before you do.

191
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,766
Because we would clear
38% on our investment...

192
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,099
in a matter of months.

193
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:46,350
And your father walks
with over five million...

194
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,600
The walking part is the problem.

195
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:51,391
They will broom him...
if not right away, then soon enough.

196
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,766
Returns like this could
tell the story of our firm

197
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,891
for the next five years.

198
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:57,350
You're right.

199
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,724
And you were right to pull me out here,

200
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,308
so I could have a moment to think,

201
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:02,308
hear what I need in order
to frame the decision.

202
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,600
This is exciting, but...

203
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,807
Taylor Mason Capital passed.

204
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,516
Really?

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,957
You pass? How can you pass?

206
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,308
Keeping my father in place
is my highest priority

207
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,990
and the key to our success.

208
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:35,905
If we can't guarantee that,
then there is no deal.

209
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,475
And if this is just the early action,

210
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:38,766
I'd rather let the interest grow...

211
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,350
We'll do even better later.

212
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,974
Okay, Taylor.
If that's what you want to do,

213
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,849
that's what we'll do.

214
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,558
I'll walk you out.

215
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:49,682
Thank you.

216
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,516
Taylor chose their father

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,682
over the short term hit
for their business.

218
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,766
Great stressors can be bonding agents

219
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,766
instead of tearing them apart.

220
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,891
And Taylor will feel quite good
about themself right now.

221
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,766
Fuck.

222
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,766
But the other pressure...

223
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:08,141
living up to this perfect vision
of who they're trying to be...

224
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:11,516
everything to their father...
that will build.

225
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,016
How fast?

226
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,724
- Depends.
- Can you accelerate it?

227
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:16,475
How far do you need me to push this?

228
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,849
- All the fucking way.
- You really wanted this,

229
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,807
and I'm sorry that I couldn't
make it happen for you.

230
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:23,641
No. No, it was a useful attempt.

231
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,141
Just showed me there may not
be a standard business solution

232
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,350
to get Taylor to betray their father.

233
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,724
Well, then I guess we're done
looking for standard solutions.

234
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,849
Goody gumdrops.

235
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,724
I'll be at the office.

236
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,558
Thinking. Planning.

237
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,641
Sure, say it, scheming.

238
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,099
All righty.

239
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,183
Uh, get you gentlemen anything?

240
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,058
How are your whiskey stores?

241
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,891
Shut for winter.

242
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:59,058
Well, hold onto your shtreimels,
because I got this done.

243
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,558
Purchased your neighbor's
silence for 100K.

244
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:08,224
- Okay.
- Oh, and a new Malinois puppy,

245
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,224
of show quality.

246
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,391
Fuck.

247
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:14,724
That's gonna cost me thousands more.

248
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,974
Especially if I have to jump
up the line at a top breeder.

249
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:18,183
Mm.

250
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,724
Mm.

251
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,600
Feature me in a beret
and I'll paint you a picture.

252
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:28,724
You'll do time for illegal
discharge of a weapon.

253
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:31,641
My public service career
will be burnt toast.

254
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:36,641
And you'll be known the world
over as a drunken dog-killer.

255
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:40,724
Well, when you put it that way,
I accept the deal.

256
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,391
- Ready to hit it?
- Yeah.

257
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,849
Hey, Bobby, heard you were talking about

258
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:52,099
buying something before,

259
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,350
and I've been waiting to tell you

260
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,932
about something like that too.

261
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,099
Now seems like the best time.

262
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,224
I got an offer to sell this place.

263
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,224
Had my eye on a property in Florida.

264
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,350
I can roll the money right into it.

265
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,099
They offered me close
to a million dollars.

266
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:11,350
You imagine that? An old paesan like me.

267
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,308
Okay. So we'll open in Florida?

268
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,724
No, kid, can't. You can't.

269
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,516
The water's not the same so
the crust wouldn't be either.

270
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,724
Well, I'll fly in the New York water.

271
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,350
People do it.

272
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,641
Nah.

273
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,891
You know, beach time for me.

274
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:28,350
Calm, calm.

275
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:30,724
Let's do this.
I'll advance you the money

276
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,141
so you can get that
property that you want.

277
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:33,849
Against a purchase price.

278
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:36,558
Meanwhile,
you train a replacement for here,

279
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,891
spend a couple of months
in the winter down there.

280
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,641
Come back refreshed.

281
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:44,058
And we plan for, what,
five years from now,

282
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,558
transition is complete,

283
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,558
and you're living down there full time.

284
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,516
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,308
Sure, Bobby, if you think
that's the way that's best.

286
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:54,766
Yeah, good.

287
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,558
- Okay, good. It's settled.
- Good.

288
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,099
And we'll work out a number.

289
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,141
Whatever you think.

290
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:04,308
You should head back
to the city ahead of me.

291
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,932
I'll catch up later.

292
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,558
All right. Bye.

293
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,308
I need to use the back office
for the next few hours.

294
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,682
Go right in there. Help yourself.

295
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,391
All right. Sure.

296
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:18,974
So, are you downsizing?

297
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:22,516
Uh, no. It's...

298
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,433
Right now, a change feels necessary.

299
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,682
I understand. We'll find just the buyer.

300
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,558
I'll let you know
what price I recommend.

301
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,641
This place will be a hit on Zillow.

302
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,391
You're going to do
very well when we sell.

303
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,600
Great.

304
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,391
We haven't listed it yet.

305
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,224
I should hope not.

306
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:50,141
But I did ask her to come
over and put a value on it,

307
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:51,849
a price at which she thinks it'll move.

308
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:55,516
I don't remember us talking about this.

309
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,807
Oh, I know why. Because we didn't.

310
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,350
I don't want to blow up our family.

311
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,807
Or accept that you did.

312
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,350
But I don't see us staying intact here

313
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,433
after everything that's happened.

314
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,099
I mean, you sent us
out of this very house,

315
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,516
that another woman could come in and...

316
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,641
Using our house was your idea.

317
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,391
You didn't have to say yes to it.

318
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,433
But that's not nearly all.

319
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:24,600
This place doesn't feel

320
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:27,724
very much like a home to me right now.

321
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,724
I know that feeling.

322
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,350
It's how I felt, often, growing up.

323
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:45,891
I promised myself I'd never
create an environment where...

324
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,849
Have I ever told you
the pancake eater story?

325
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,641
No, I'd remember the name
of something like that.

326
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:57,869
Yes, you would.

327
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,516
Sundays as a kid,

328
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,891
it was when we were the closest thing

329
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,807
to what most folks
would consider a family.

330
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:13,183
I'd wake up to the smell
of pancakes and bacon

331
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,641
inundating the apartment.

332
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:21,099
My mother always gave the
girl the day off on Sundays.

333
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,807
That's how she'd put it anyway.

334
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,600
And took great pride in preparing

335
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,058
this incredible spread.

336
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:29,475
Orange juice,
fresh squeezed in a carafe.

337
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,974
The effect was stunning.

338
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:35,058
And as my mother put out these
perfectly prepared pancakes...

339
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,807
pat of butter on top,
syrup running down the sides

340
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,641
right on the plate,

341
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,807
Dad would sit down with the paper,

342
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,807
at the head of the table,
and he'd tell her,

343
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:47,141
and me, that... oh, ho... this...

344
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,641
this was living.

345
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,766
Oh, Chuck, it's spooky when you do that.

346
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,932
You sound just like him.

347
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:57,974
Look like him, too...
Maybe don't do it again.

348
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,641
Spooky part's coming.

349
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:03,600
Usually,
he'd congratulate her on the effort.

350
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,641
Thank her.

351
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,724
Let her know that, uh,

352
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:11,724
this was his ideal way
to spend a Sunday.

353
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,682
And as you might infer,

354
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,891
this brought me great lightness.

355
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,308
A respite from the norm.

356
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:22,724
But then, uh, maybe
once a year, perhaps twice,

357
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:25,183
upon landing at his seat,
but before sitting,

358
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,350
a scowl would come across his face.

359
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,682
And my father would

360
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:35,391
sweep the bacon, carafe of juice

361
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,350
and, yes, those perfect pancakes,
off the table

362
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:41,516
and onto the floor in a fit of rage.

363
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,932
And he'd look at my
cowering mother and scream,

364
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:49,350
"What the hell do I look like,
a goddamned pancake eater?"

365
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,766
And then he'd storm out.

366
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:55,807
And my mother would fall to pieces

367
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,807
even as she scrambled to clean
it all up and put it away.

368
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,224
She'd spend the rest of the day

369
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:04,766
fretting over what she'd
done to set him off,

370
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,600
and hoping he'd come home.

371
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:12,308
And eventually, he would.

372
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:16,224
And she'd apologize to him.

373
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:19,641
Good lord.

374
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:21,516
Yeah, that's not the punchline.

375
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,224
No, the punchline is the night

376
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,141
when I was about eight-years-old,

377
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,932
and he came into my room,

378
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:29,600
after one of these fractious mornings.

379
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,724
"You know why I did what I did, Sonny?

380
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:36,807
"Keep things fresh and exciting for her.

381
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,641
"So she doesn't take it all for granted.

382
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,224
"And to make her appreciate

383
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:43,682
"the Sundays I don't break it all apart.

384
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:46,099
"A woman has a subconscious
desire to be dominated.

385
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,099
"Remember that.

386
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,058
Use it."

387
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:53,183
I...

388
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,391
That's where I come from, Wend.

389
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,891
I don't get violent,
throw things or cheat.

390
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:04,224
But I can't seem to be normal either.

391
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,266
I'm trying though.

392
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,391
As hard as I know how.

393
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:15,682
And I implore you,

394
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,516
don't put our home up for sale.

395
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,433
But rather work with me,

396
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,183
love me as I do you,

397
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:28,016
and, uh, let's find our way back.

398
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,891
I'm touched by you going this deep.

399
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,382
This excavation. I understand

400
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:42,391
what it takes
to go there and pull it out.

401
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:45,641
And I want that all to be enough...

402
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,641
And maybe it would've
been if you told me

403
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,016
before your own pancake
eater moment on TV,

404
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,224
in front of the whole world.

405
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:55,016
Yeah, I know, I know.

406
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,141
But can you just...

407
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,974
I'm trying to.

408
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,641
The best I know how.

409
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,224
But I can't promise you anything, Chuck.

410
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,308
Your mother's gonna love this place.

411
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:17,600
She'll think it too expensive.

412
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,475
Do you?

413
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,974
I wouldn't have offered it
to you if I did.

414
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:23,641
Besides, the company will pay for it.

415
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,724
As it should.

416
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:29,058
It's exactly what I needed.

417
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,849
Enough room to pace.

418
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:35,141
Enough buildings and sky
to induce productive ideation.

419
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,891
And it will convince Mom,
as well, I hope.

420
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:40,641
I can't wait for her
to be here, too, actually.

421
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,807
Feelings she also holds.

422
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,266
I can't tell you the number of times

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,974
she wanted us to come visit.

424
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:49,183
I just wasn't...

425
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,099
It's good you're ready now.

426
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,974
Yeah. It is.

427
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:01,224
Reunited and it feels so good.

428
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:04,266
Dad, did you just quote a pop song?

429
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,099
I guess it's catching.

430
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,558
I come bearing my war club,
to join with yours.

431
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:21,183
Who are we bludgeoning?

432
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,350
I'm here to tell you that our interests

433
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,266
are finally 100 percent aligned.

434
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,266
Yeah. I got that part. Who?

435
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,391
Chuck Rhoades knows about
my Cayman Islands activity.

436
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,016
We can take him out together.

437
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,016
It's what you've always wanted.

438
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,641
Ah, so that dogged prosecutor
has picked up your scent.

439
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:41,849
- Not fun, is it?
- No.

440
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,600
Got that river of sweat
running down your crack

441
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,516
like a bombing comedian?

442
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,391
Yes. Mm.

443
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:48,516
Will you help me?

444
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,974
Of course, Todd.

445
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:51,849
You merely had to ask.

446
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,558
Shall we prick our thumbs
and bleed them together

447
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,974
like Tom and Huck?

448
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:56,932
You know, to become blood brothers?

449
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:59,308
I feel we already have.

450
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,183
Jesus, that pizza smells sweet.

451
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,266
Can I get a slice to go?

452
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,141
I'll trade ya a whole pie,

453
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,141
plus solve your Rhoades problems,

454
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:12,516
for an introduction to a certain
guy who works for your outfit.

455
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,391
Yeah, anybody. Who?

456
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:15,974
Robert Beaufort.

457
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,475
"Hard Bob" Beaufort, huh?

458
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,350
He brooks no bullshit.

459
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:22,766
But sure. I'll make the intro.

460
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,224
You'll have to take it from there.

461
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,766
Then I'll go get that pizza.

462
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,558
Make it a Sicilian?

463
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,724
I don't have much experience with this.

464
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,516
Picking out furniture?

465
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,433
With setting my parents up in a place.

466
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,974
Getting it furnished. All of it.

467
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,058
And, yes, I want to use
your eye for style.

468
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:57,891
You have a great and specific
sense of style yourself.

469
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:00,391
Thank you. But they don't
necessarily share my...

470
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,433
Ah.

471
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:04,766
I'm closer in age to them than you are.

472
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:07,475
Yes, but you're not like them at all.

473
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,433
If they were here,
all they'd notice is what things cost.

474
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:10,766
Argue about it.

475
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:13,224
Instead of noticing how these
things might make them feel.

476
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,849
How the clean lines and angles

477
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,058
make for a calm, ideal environment.

478
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,849
Yet you're clear you want them here.

479
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,849
I do. But it'll be different.

480
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,558
It is.

481
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,932
It's a good thing.

482
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,266
Family.

483
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,350
For you.

484
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:32,308
But that doesn't mean it'll be easy.

485
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:33,641
Or should be.

486
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,558
Like when someone...
man, woman, whomever... has a baby.

487
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:41,099
It's undoubtedly good,
but it's not cost neutral.

488
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:44,891
Family creates obligation and stress,

489
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:48,724
distraction, pain, vulnerability.

490
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,266
I mean, the hope is that the connection,

491
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,141
the shared history,
the love matters more.

492
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,641
Some people use it as a brand
new source of motivation.

493
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,099
They do.

494
00:22:58,183 --> 00:22:59,766
Then I guess I do see it that way.

495
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,350
That's the justification.

496
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:02,974
We have a new start at a family.

497
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:05,350
And I really want it to work.

498
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,350
Then I'm sure it will.

499
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:11,224
And whatever cost will be small
enough to not even matter.

500
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,224
In the grand scheme.

501
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,516
Mr. Beaufort, come on in.

502
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:21,932
They call me "Hard Bob,"
and you know why?

503
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:23,724
I have an idea.

504
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:25,766
'Cause I brook no bullshit.

505
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,641
Neither do I.

506
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,224
Now the reason I wanted to talk to you

507
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,891
is because I have something
of a special favor.

508
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:34,807
I only took this meeting because
the Secretary asked me to.

509
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,516
But that doesn't mean
I have to do what you ask

510
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,475
or even listen to your ask.

511
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:41,141
Got it?

512
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,807
Sonny.

513
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,183
Hello, Dad.

514
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:53,058
Is this the daily "I love you" call?

515
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,058
Son, I have neither time nor inclination

516
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,807
to dicker around with
protestations of emotion.

517
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,849
If you need my words
as reassurance of affection...

518
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,641
Oh, no, no. No, sir.

519
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,433
Your feelings are made
manifest with each interaction.

520
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:07,516
I should hope so.

521
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,475
Now, look.

522
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,475
I have run into a financing
snag with my development.

523
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,641
Banks used to be set up
by gentlemen, for gentlemen.

524
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,974
But a couple of Keatings and
Madoffs behave unscrupulously,

525
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:25,682
and now the personal touch,
the respect, is gone.

526
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:30,099
Banks have... have become
businesses without souls.

527
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:31,849
I'm pretty sure banks
never had souls, Dad.

528
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,308
What's the problem?

529
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:35,183
They want too much collateral.

530
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,350
Assets that I've otherwise outlaid.

531
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:41,558
Now, I know you have some
banking contacts these days.

532
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:43,350
Highly placed.

533
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,475
If I could find some favorable terms...

534
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:47,807
And you want to discuss
this with me here,

535
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,391
while I'm at the epicenter
of New York law?

536
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:53,891
While I'm in the Attorney
General's very chair.

537
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:56,849
I'm talking to you as a son, not the AG.

538
00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:00,308
And you know how you know that?

539
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:04,433
Because I would never
tell some random AG

540
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:05,849
how much I love him.

541
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,849
Okay.

542
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:11,224
Fine, old man,

543
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:12,849
I'll try to help.

544
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:14,099
Know why?

545
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:16,475
Because I love you, too.

546
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,766
Oh, for the love o' Christ.

547
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,682
So how are we going to skin this...

548
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,433
Who we looking to field dress,
Secretary Krakow?

549
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,558
You sold me over, you sonofabitch.

550
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:50,641
That's a very untextured
way of thinking, Todd.

551
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:52,558
Don't do it.

552
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:58,266
I know this isn't what
you were looking for.

553
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,558
But this is the best... and only...

554
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,891
option out there for you

555
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,849
once you ended up on
law enforcement radar.

556
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:05,350
He's right.

557
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,558
And it won't be all bad.

558
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:11,099
Oh.

559
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:17,682
Now have a seat, Mr. Secretary,
we have much to discuss.

560
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,183
Starting with your
activities in the tropics

561
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,974
but perhaps ending
with you a free man,

562
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:26,350
without any harm to your
future prospects or reputation.

563
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:28,932
See? Not all bad.

564
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,058
Okay, counselor.

565
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,600
Hit me.

566
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,183
It'll be a couple of weeks
until the long form contracts

567
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,558
are ready to be signed, but...

568
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,724
I'm eager to proceed.
I don't want paperwork

569
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:57,183
to stop us from making
certain project deadlines.

570
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,891
Great. If we can start ordering
the materials and equipment...

571
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,224
God, I hate interrupting.

572
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:04,516
But some guy from the government is here

573
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,932
and kind of demanding to see you.

574
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,891
Hello, folks.

575
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:13,558
I'm Robert Beaufort.

576
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:17,641
I'm from the Bureau of
Industry and Security.

577
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,974
I've become aware of your tech

578
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,016
from my brethren over
in the patent office.

579
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,974
In fact, they stuck a flag in it

580
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:28,932
and fired it over to me
in the old pneumatic tube.

581
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,164
Being humorous. We don't use the tubes.

582
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,433
They emailed me.

583
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:39,266
Anyhow, we're going to need
to hold up any production plans.

584
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,724
That's an insane request.

585
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,682
This is intended for private sector,
non military use.

586
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:45,641
This is not a request.

587
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:47,433
This is sensitive technology

588
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:49,641
with national defense
and security implications.

589
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,558
My understanding of the Bureau's...
your department's...

590
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:53,974
role is to aid and support

591
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:55,433
innovation in the private sector.

592
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:57,308
It can be, and it is.

593
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,475
But above that our mandate is security,

594
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,475
especially when it comes to the
export of sensitive technology.

595
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,308
We have,
under authority of the government,

596
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:07,433
the power to seize and control said tech

597
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:09,016
in the name of our nation's safety.

598
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,475
It's true.

599
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,807
We have determined that US 18/287,134

600
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:18,224
is vital to national
security at this time.

601
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:20,058
You do have the right to challenge

602
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:21,849
at an administrative proceeding.

603
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,350
If we do that, the tech gets public.

604
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,475
Exactly. Which is why we prefer

605
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,516
to forgo the hearings
and the attendant publicity.

606
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
We do in extraordinary cases like this

607
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:35,016
offer to cover R&D spending to date,

608
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,516
plus an 8% premium on investment
for an NDA on the matter.

609
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,433
We're going to need an opinion
of counsel before any...

610
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:42,974
Of course.

611
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,016
Didn't expect anything signed today.

612
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,475
I will, however, leave you with this.

613
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,391
This is an order
outlining which materials

614
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:54,891
I expect to be turned over immediately.

615
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,058
You have my card.

616
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:00,391
We'll be in touch.

617
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:07,433
Listen, folks,
my investment is entirely contingent

618
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:09,891
upon you making this problem disappear.

619
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:12,682
Instantly.

620
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:14,849
I've got a meeting.

621
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:21,058
Shit.

622
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,141
This was Bobby Axelrod.

623
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,391
Holy fuck this one felt good.

624
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,350
You think about how to entice a man.

625
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,932
What he loves.

626
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:39,849
Of course, it all starts
with girls and money.

627
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:41,807
But it gets more
complicated from there...

628
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:46,724
Yeah, cars, property, jobs,
access to special doctors,

629
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,891
schools for their kids,
life dreams, goals.

630
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:51,724
You know, sometimes
it even gets spiritual...

631
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,766
Vatican tours,
with the Pope washing their feet,

632
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:56,099
meeting the Dalai Lama, whatever.

633
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:58,308
And in this case? Was it Vatican City?

634
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,891
This case? Oh, no.

635
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:01,891
This case, no, it turned out
to be girls and money.

636
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:08,849
Hard Bob Beaufort is a film fan.

637
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,600
Turns out, he really loves the classics.

638
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:14,724
Ladies,

639
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,807
this is Hard Bob.

640
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,724
Hello, Hard Bob.

641
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:19,932
I'm Lisa Ann.

642
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,849
I know.

643
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:24,308
I know. And you're...

644
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,224
That's right, Hard Bob, I am.

645
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,308
Well, this is not the zoo, Hard Bob.

646
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:35,600
You can come as close as you want.

647
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:44,141
Look at this picture.

648
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,766
Really look at it.

649
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,807
Ah.

650
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,308
Mr. Vivian.

651
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,807
Uh, may I call you Shel?

652
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,016
Shelby. Sure.

653
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,391
Mr. Eisen here is a trusted friend.

654
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:58,058
And when he asked
if I could see you, I said yes.

655
00:30:58,141 --> 00:30:59,807
But I fail to see...

656
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,682
Well, I can see
how special the animal was,

657
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:05,350
but I can't see how I have
anything to do with this matter.

658
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:07,433
You can't, Mr. Rhoades?

659
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:08,766
Can I call you Charles?

660
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,807
Chuck.

661
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:13,766
Chuck. Sure.

662
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:17,766
Well, Eisen here wants me
to settle for 100K.

663
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,433
You did settle for 100K.

664
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,183
I have the papers. Signed.

665
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,308
And I gave you a check.

666
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:26,183
Here's that check right back at you.

667
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:30,308
And here's another picture
for you to look at, Chuck,

668
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:32,932
which might tell the story

669
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,849
as to why I am in your office.

670
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:39,932
I know what this whole thing is.

671
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,224
Cover up.

672
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,724
- No such thing.
- That's a wildly overblown term.

673
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:49,308
Look.

674
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:53,682
The loss of my Charlemagne

675
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:56,849
was worth more than the
100,000 and a new puppy.

676
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:59,974
Mm.

677
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,932
How much more?

678
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:06,475
I get 250,000 dollars, or I go public,

679
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,099
way public,
with this whole damn conspiracy.

680
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:13,266
There is no conspiracy... Shelby.

681
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,516
But I see how pained you are.

682
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,682
And I'm moved by it.

683
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:20,391
Mr. Eisen here will get with Mr. Brogan

684
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:23,350
and produce the amount required.

685
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,141
Just got off the phone with the lawyer.

686
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,600
She said what we're facing
is similar to eminent domain.

687
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:41,016
They can do it, we can push back.

688
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,516
- Can we win?
- She says maybe.

689
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,516
How long will it take?

690
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,266
Two and a half, three years.

691
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,891
I spun like Katarina Witt in Sarajevo

692
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,350
but there's nothing new out
there ready to come on board.

693
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,266
I made the rounds
with our current investors, too.

694
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,016
We may lose some.

695
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,807
I need to sit with the Firefighters.

696
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,558
Get me a meeting with Ken Shaddock.

697
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:19,516
Your ex-protיgי is a
hell of a businessperson.

698
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,016
Sniffing out the initial trap was smart.

699
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,807
They are indeed.

700
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:25,766
That's what's gonna make it so rewarding

701
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,266
when they take the
smart business decision

702
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,807
to crush their father.

703
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:31,724
Because what they won't know,
until it's too late,

704
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:34,974
is how hollow it will make them feel.

705
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,807
Uh, remind me to never
stab you in the back.

706
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,058
Consider yourself reminded.

707
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:43,807
Mm-hmm.

708
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,600
What's that you're devouring

709
00:33:45,682 --> 00:33:47,141
like a gluten-free croissant over there?

710
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:48,682
Oh, kiss my ass.

711
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:50,766
You know I don't fuck with gluten-free.

712
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:52,016
And this is my next thing.

713
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,141
Saler's department stores.

714
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,807
Huh.

715
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,183
That chain's like a wheezing elephant

716
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,641
ready to stumble to its knees.

717
00:33:57,724 --> 00:33:59,391
Uh, until I get a hold of it

718
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:02,183
and hit it in the ass
with a giant shot of B-12.

719
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:03,724
You're gonna restore it
to its former glory?

720
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,058
Oh, you're fucking right I am.

721
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:06,974
There's a lot of debt against it, babe.

722
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:09,433
- It's not gonna be easy.
- Well, I don't do easy.

723
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:10,849
If I wanted that I'd move to Florida

724
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,224
and work on my tan with Bruno.

725
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,724
Yeah.

726
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,266
It's good that he seemed
happy with what I laid out.

727
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,849
Mm.

728
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,433
No?

729
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:25,475
That is some sweet deal I'm giving him.

730
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,974
Are you gonna speak or just
sit there silently doubting?

731
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:31,308
Um...

732
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,350
Bruno knows you get what you want.

733
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:34,682
So he's made peace with that.

734
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:37,682
But he wants to live in Florida.

735
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:40,932
What kind of life would it be?

736
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:43,433
Playing canasta with a
bunch of other retirees.

737
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,183
Shuffleboard.

738
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,475
Dragging down to the drugstore
to get his prescriptions?

739
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:48,766
I don't want that kind of life for him.

740
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:50,849
Nothing to fight for.

741
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:54,391
Nothing to make him feel
like he's still in it.

742
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,932
It's giving up. Dying.

743
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:58,350
For you. For you, it would be giving up.

744
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:01,183
But maybe for him, after a lifetime

745
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,891
in front of a hot oven,
it would finally be living.

746
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,016
You put your faith in me.

747
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:11,682
There's something sacred in that.

748
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,724
And I'm not the sort to use that word.

749
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,308
No, no, it is a sacred trust.

750
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:17,099
There is no other word.

751
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,932
You made me believe you understood that.

752
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,932
And that you wouldn't let
these firefighters down.

753
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,932
I won't.
Even as I wage this other battle.

754
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:28,350
You know, before the department
I was in the service,

755
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:31,058
so I'm a bit of an
expert on two-front wars.

756
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:35,183
What happens, no matter how well trained

757
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,016
and capable the army is,

758
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,308
more people die.

759
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:40,516
I will personally be down in the muck...

760
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,141
Yeah, see, why is that a good thing?

761
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,641
In a firefight, an infantryman's job

762
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,099
is to zero in on his target and shoot.

763
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,891
To the exclusion of all else.

764
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,600
But he can't see anything
else besides that target

765
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,391
through the aperture
of his rifle sights.

766
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,099
It's a very small picture.

767
00:35:57,183 --> 00:36:00,266
That's why a leader,
as much as he wants to fire,

768
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,266
needs to keep his weapon
at full port arms

769
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,516
and scan the entire battlefield.

770
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
To see it all.

771
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:08,558
Let's measure it.

772
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,266
For a normal, disciplined person,

773
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,099
this kind of engagement
would cost 50 percent.

774
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,974
So even for you,

775
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,558
will it cost you 20,

776
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:22,016
or 10, even 3 percent?

777
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,516
Let's say you're right,
for the sake of argument.

778
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,308
At 97 percent focused,

779
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:28,891
I am certain you will not
see any change in results.

780
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:31,391
But to guarantee that, let's do this.

781
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,224
Stay with me as long as we're positive.

782
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:36,016
But the moment
I slip into negative territory,

783
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,600
I return your money that day.

784
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:39,766
It's virtually risk proof for you.

785
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:42,475
No deal, Mason.

786
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,433
You dump the other company or we go.

787
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:47,558
I'm sorry this didn't work out.

788
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,932
I know we would've done
great work together.

789
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,058
Okay.

790
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:05,724
So?

791
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,099
He put me to a decision
and I had to let him go.

792
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,641
Shit.

793
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:11,475
How went it with Dana?

794
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:13,224
He's out, too.

795
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:16,682
He says sorry and hopes
to see us down the road.

796
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:19,433
And I talked to the lawyer,
the bank and accounting.

797
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,974
You're gonna have to drive this
yourself, carry the risk.

798
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,974
Bank's gonna want you to
put up the money yourself.

799
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:25,391
Your bonus from last year.

800
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,807
Or we get the broker
to do a securities loan.

801
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,475
Fine. But no margin.

802
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:32,391
Yeah. I can get that done.

803
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:34,475
I'm not sure you should.

804
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:36,308
It's a big fucking commitment.

805
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,224
A big commitment has already been made.

806
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,391
And it holds. It has to. To my father.

807
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:42,350
You have another.

808
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,849
To Taylor Mason Capital itself.

809
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,641
You have to make both work.

810
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,058
Or none of it will.

811
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:54,974
I just got word.

812
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:57,099
The Firefighters Fund is gon-zo.

813
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:01,308
That's check.

814
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,433
You ready to go topple the king?

815
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:10,682
Hello?

816
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,266
I need to see you.

817
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,600
Now.

818
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:18,849
Promise me this
conversation stays private.

819
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,183
That's the understanding
we've had the whole time.

820
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,682
I just want to restate it.

821
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,475
Because I need to tell you something,

822
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:27,475
and it's... it's a big risk for me.

823
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,224
You have my word.

824
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,475
Axe knows you lost the Firefighters.

825
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,141
He said they were the air support

826
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:38,682
protecting the rest of your ventures.

827
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:41,183
He said you chose your
father over your business.

828
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,974
I admire that.

829
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,849
He may not, but I do.

830
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:53,058
That you can be one of the
people that finds the balance.

831
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,600
Who can be happy at enough.

832
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:02,266
He could never do that.
But you didn't let the fact

833
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,058
that your father exploited
your need for his approval

834
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,807
stop you from choosing family.

835
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:10,058
That's truly impressive.

836
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,141
But Axe is coming for you now,

837
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,099
and nothing's going to stop him.

838
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:18,058
So you came to warn me.

839
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,224
He's so far gone... with negativity.

840
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:25,558
Annihilation.

841
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,350
Annihilating you, in particular.

842
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,724
I've never seen such single-mindedness.

843
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:34,308
It's toxic.

844
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:39,932
Corrosive. I went to work
for a financial genius,

845
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:41,807
not Shiva the Destroyer.

846
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,058
It gets hard to be around.

847
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:47,516
How can you even stand
working there anymore?

848
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,266
I'm not sure I can.

849
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,350
I'm not sure I can be a part
of what he's planning.

850
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,016
I'm thinking about quitting.

851
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:01,183
Nope. Fuck.

852
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,807
You're not here to warn me.

853
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:05,266
"I'm thinking about quitting."
That's one too many.

854
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,016
I've trained myself to recognize

855
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:09,932
when someone overplays their hand,
and you did, just now.

856
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,183
But you've built the perfect box.

857
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:17,350
No escape without catastrophic loss.

858
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:30,350
That furniture will
look good in this place.

859
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,433
I hope your parents are happy here.

860
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:57,433
Ken Shaddock, please.

861
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,558
Positive news, Dad.

862
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:06,433
My prostate is gonna shrink
back to its former size?

863
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:09,266
Not that, but it may
make you smile just as much.

864
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,266
Qatar State Bank is going to be
taken off the restricted list

865
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,600
and it's ready to give you
a sweetheart of a loan.

866
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:18,308
Well, you're right,
that does bring a grin.

867
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,308
Are you sure about this?

868
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,600
Got it straight from
the Secretary Of The Treasury.

869
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,724
You know Jewish people
have 613 rules... mitzvot...

870
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,600
for determining what's kosher in life?

871
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:32,974
- "Hey, what don't you know?"
- "Innit?"

872
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,558
And in this country we've got

873
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,183
about a million banking regulations...

874
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,350
and this has got to
violate a bunch of them.

875
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,974
Oh, this shit is definitely not kashrut.

876
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:42,682
- Oh hoh.
- You're not the only one who lives in the big city.

877
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,600
Now, unless the bank came
off the list legitimately,

878
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:47,099
- in which case...
- In which case

879
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:48,932
we could take a look at
why it came off the list.

880
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:51,016
How, exactly? Why now?
Who was behind it?

881
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:52,197
You want to start getting those answers?

882
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,807
- Love to.
- Great.

883
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,558
Dad, I have something for you.

884
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,058
What the fuck is this?

885
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:11,682
A check for 1.3 million dollars.

886
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,141
You caved.

887
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:17,641
You folded and took the deal?

888
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:22,141
Government's gonna mothball my project.

889
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,974
Or worse, deploy it as they see fit.

890
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:27,682
I assessed all the options
and it was the only one left.

891
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:29,600
It was not the only one.

892
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:32,391
It was the only one that allowed
me to get the Firefighters back,

893
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,849
which will save this place,

894
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:35,766
because without it, there is nothing.

895
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:39,516
There's my life's work,

896
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,058
my tech,

897
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:44,058
my fucking dream.

898
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:49,682
Which to you is nothing in the face of

899
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,308
recoupment of your investment

900
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:56,724
plus 8 fucking percent.

901
00:42:58,224 --> 00:42:59,891
I'm sorry it worked out this way.

902
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:03,099
It's unfortunate but my enemies
seemed to have found a way

903
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:05,724
to aim the government at us
like a nuclear weapon.

904
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,849
How did they know where to aim?

905
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,516
How did they know to hurt this venture?

906
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,183
I did it.

907
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:14,682
I told Wendy about your dad.

908
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,766
Not... Not really. She seemed to know.

909
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:19,391
I just said the word 'startup.'

910
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:22,433
How, exactly, did you
and Wendy Rhoades end up talking?

911
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,807
S-She just...

912
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:25,350
She was supposed to meet a friend,

913
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,641
and the friend didn't show.

914
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:30,308
Oh, Taylor, I got played.

915
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,433
No, Mafee, I got played.

916
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,058
You were mere confirmation.

917
00:43:34,141 --> 00:43:35,849
I, too, spoke with her.

918
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:37,516
At first, I thought it was benign.

919
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,275
Then I thought I could use the forum,

920
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,974
gain from it,
but instead I was infected.

921
00:43:42,058 --> 00:43:44,391
The fact that
you have enemies like this,

922
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:46,516
the fact that you were once aligned

923
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,932
with such despicable people,

924
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:52,391
maybe give that some
thought while I'm gone.

925
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:55,016
So you're leaving? We could try ano...

926
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,724
You're damn skippy I'm leaving.

927
00:43:56,807 --> 00:44:00,766
What's possibly going
to keep me here now?

928
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,433
Yeah.

929
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,600
This is one time I'm sorry
my thesis proves out.

930
00:44:06,682 --> 00:44:08,183
Thesis?

931
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,350
You taught me, don't just have an idea.

932
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:13,391
Build the model that proves it.

933
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:16,766
Sara, call Shaddock
with the Firefighters.

934
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:19,350
Tell him I did what I said
and we're back in business.

935
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,099
Wait, this is all a test?

936
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:25,558
Not a test. A confirmation.

937
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,891
I needed to remind myself
who you really are.

938
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:28,977
Wendy said it.

939
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:31,224
I didn't want her to be right,
but she was.

940
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,391
I didn't chose the Firefighters
over you, Dad.

941
00:44:33,475 --> 00:44:35,600
I chose what you wanted
over what I needed.

942
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:39,099
Don't you need me?

943
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,308
Yes, and I always have.

944
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:43,475
But the version of you I really need...

945
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,682
the one who's a father first...
he doesn't exist.

946
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,099
'Cause all he cares about
is his own advancement.

947
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,849
I'm leaving.

948
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:59,391
And I'm taking my fin
technology with me.

949
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:01,891
No, you're not. I owned it.

950
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:03,641
And I sold it to the government.

951
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:07,099
You people.

952
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:12,641
All you care about is fucking money.

953
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:24,799
You know what, kid?

954
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:26,849
You are just like me.

955
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,141
Only colder.

956
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:29,724
Yeah.

957
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:32,224
So maybe I'll actually win.

958
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:36,099
Maybe, but I'll say this.

959
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:39,641
It won't feel like it.

960
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:02,183
Sir, you're gonna need to come with us.

961
00:46:02,937 --> 00:46:04,224
Why? What the fuck?!

962
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:05,891
- Come on.
- Don't make us cuff you.

963
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,724
Hey!

964
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,974
Rhoades.

965
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:14,932
I'm not easily scared.

966
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:17,600
Especially because you have
no cause of action to arrest me.

967
00:46:17,682 --> 00:46:19,183
Oh, no, no, no, no.

968
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:20,932
You're not under arrest.

969
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:24,391
No, in the old days
they called this a 'rousting.'

970
00:46:24,475 --> 00:46:26,224
Now, that's old-fashioned policing,

971
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:27,932
designed to send a message.

972
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,308
And where can it go?

973
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:32,224
Well, you can be brought in.

974
00:46:32,308 --> 00:46:34,433
Put in holding.
You ever visit the Tombs?

975
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:38,308
It makes for a very
edifying 24 to 48 hours.

976
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:41,516
Or you might be found
to be 'resisting,' on the street,

977
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,058
and then the boys get
a little baton practice.

978
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:48,724
And these men are my personal force.

979
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,433
There's nothing that
they won't do for me.

980
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:53,350
But I don't want to talk
about any of that.

981
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,391
No. I want to talk about dogs.

982
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:58,641
And the people who own 'em.

983
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:01,099
I love a good dog.

984
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:02,849
I, myself, have had one for years.

985
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:06,224
But I don't fool myself, as so many do.

986
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:07,974
- Fool yourself?
- Mm.

987
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,058
About which way the
loyalties really run.

988
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:15,308
Do you know what happens
when a solo pet owner dies alone?

989
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:17,641
Nope.

990
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:20,141
Oh, you don't want to admit
to yourself that you know.

991
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:22,183
But you do.

992
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:25,558
At some point,
the pet decides that its own survival

993
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,350
matters more than its
fondness for its owner.

994
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:31,099
And what do they do?

995
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,682
Well, most often, they go for
the nose or cheek flesh first.

996
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,266
Now, is that because
their love is so great,

997
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,766
they want to be one with
their former best friend?

998
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:41,807
I don't choose to think so.

999
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,641
No, I just bet those are
the most delicious morsels.

1000
00:47:45,724 --> 00:47:47,849
And I don't blame 'em at all.

1001
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:51,183
Because when their very
lives are at stake,

1002
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:52,600
how can they stand on ceremony?

1003
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:57,016
After all, their owner is already dead.

1004
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:59,891
But I'm not in desperate straits
as the dog in your story is.

1005
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:02,308
Oh, but you are.

1006
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:06,224
You don't really think
Eisen put you in front of me

1007
00:48:06,308 --> 00:48:08,475
without us knowing
what would happen, do you?

1008
00:48:08,558 --> 00:48:11,141
He brought you in so that,
in front of a witness,

1009
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:12,475
you would try to extort

1010
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,807
the sitting New York Attorney General.

1011
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,433
With threats to expose him
if he didn't pay you off.

1012
00:48:17,516 --> 00:48:19,891
That's an open and shut case.

1013
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:22,558
Your own lawyer would
force you to take a plea

1014
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:24,391
the first day you engaged him.

1015
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:30,016
But, because, as I said, I'm a dog guy,

1016
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:32,433
I understand why you felt you had to.

1017
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:34,891
Still the dog is dead.

1018
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:39,558
And you are sitting here starving.

1019
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,433
I see.

1020
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:45,849
But, and here's
the day brightener for you.

1021
00:48:45,932 --> 00:48:48,891
I have no need to bring
this into open court.

1022
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:53,932
What I propose to do instead is

1023
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,807
give you this.

1024
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,058
Ah.

1025
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,224
That's a purebred
Belgian Malinois puppy.

1026
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,682
With papers.

1027
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:06,974
And it's yours.

1028
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:10,099
Along with the 100,000 already paid.

1029
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,724
And you sign this.

1030
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:19,058
Which says I drop my complaint.

1031
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:21,141
It sure does.

1032
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:24,724
Now and forever.

1033
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,266
- Hi, Mafee!
- Not now, Ben.

1034
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,807
You.

1035
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:41,350
Do you have any fucking
idea what you've done?

1036
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:43,766
I used to think you were this
idealized version of a person

1037
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,308
with all the answers
and the ability to make

1038
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:46,891
each of us the best of who we could be.

1039
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:48,974
I trusted you. We all did.

1040
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:51,600
Because you charmed,
manipulated, worked us to.

1041
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:53,724
All with that bullshit Buddha smile.

1042
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:56,099
And now I know that
what was behind that smile

1043
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:57,682
wasn't some serene and wise teacher.

1044
00:49:57,766 --> 00:50:00,141
- Hey!
- It hid a sick, vicious phony.

1045
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:02,516
Now I know that's what you really are...
a goddamned monster.

1046
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,766
Hey! Traitorous motherfucker.

1047
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:06,682
Yeah, leave her alone, you fucking goon!

1048
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:08,350
You tried to sabotage this firm!

1049
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:10,141
- Fuck you, Bill!
- You don't talk to a man

1050
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:11,475
like Dollar Bill Stearn like that.

1051
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:12,682
- Fuck you, too!
- Guys. Mafee...

1052
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,308
I am gonna kick your ass!

1053
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:15,600
Bring it, asshole!

1054
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:16,849
Let it happen. We both want it.

1055
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,224
No fighting where Mr. Axelrod is liable.

1056
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,516
- I'll sign whatever!
- That's two of us!

1057
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,849
Get him outta here!

1058
00:50:20,932 --> 00:50:22,600
Let's do it in the ring then, fucknut!

1059
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:25,141
Any time, any place, motherfucker!

1060
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:28,600
Rumble in the Jungle!
Thrilla in Manila! Zaire!

1061
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:30,016
You're a garbage person, Wendy.

1062
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,183
That's what you are.
It's what you all are!

1063
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:36,600
Fuck you.

1064
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:38,932
I guess we hit the target.

1065
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,807
It's done.

1066
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:56,224
Done means signed, sealed, delivered.

1067
00:50:56,308 --> 00:50:57,974
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I am.

1068
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:00,558
He acknowledges that his dog
was a repeated menace

1069
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,600
and you acted in self-defense.

1070
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:04,266
He releases you from responsibility

1071
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,600
and will not tell or sell the story.

1072
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:08,641
Welp. Now we know, definitively.

1073
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:09,974
You really are a power broker.

1074
00:51:10,058 --> 00:51:12,682
And, uh, I'm gonna say it directly,

1075
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:15,391
so it's between us and acknowledged.

1076
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:19,475
Down the 'pike,
I will ask something of you.

1077
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:21,849
Something hard.

1078
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:24,558
Something that will be
very costly for you to do.

1079
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:28,433
And you will deliver it for me.

1080
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:30,475
I will.

1081
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:33,350
You've shown me, by example,
what might happen if I don't.

1082
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:38,807
Can I have it back?

1083
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:47,391
That thing goes off again,

1084
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:50,058
lose my number.

1085
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:29,807
Wendy says don't touch it.

1086
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:32,558
Smells too good to leave untouched.

1087
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:36,099
It's here to create the sensory
impression of a perfect home.

1088
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:38,974
That smell that drove you
to get out fork and knife,

1089
00:52:39,058 --> 00:52:41,724
even though moments before
you had no idea you wanted pie.

1090
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,308
It brings warmth.

1091
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,974
Contentment.

1092
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:46,724
And that's what's called for right now.

1093
00:52:46,807 --> 00:52:48,849
Mm-hmm. Why?

1094
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,932
People are coming to look at the house.

1095
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:52,308
Real buyers.

1096
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:54,183
Your kids are out with the babysitter.

1097
00:52:57,698 --> 00:52:58,932
And where's Wendy?

1098
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,849
Out.

1099
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:04,932
It'd be good if you were out, too.

1100
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:23,641
Hey, Bobby.

1101
00:54:23,724 --> 00:54:25,224
Just catching up here.

1102
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,350
Bruno.

1103
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,807
Tell me what you really want.

1104
00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:35,224
Don't matter.

1105
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:36,974
That other deal, I told 'em to get lost.

1106
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:38,475
'Cuz we got a deal.

1107
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:40,641
I asked what you want.

1108
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:46,391
The way I drew it up in my head?

1109
00:54:52,558 --> 00:54:54,266
Walk down to a cafe each morning,

1110
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,391
bright and sunny,

1111
00:54:56,475 --> 00:54:58,475
have an espresso.

1112
00:54:58,558 --> 00:55:01,016
Go and do some surf casting,

1113
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:04,266
catch some pompano, some snapper.

1114
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:08,224
Pack 'em in salt and bake 'em al forno.

1115
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,308
Eat 'em with a nice vermentino.

1116
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:14,849
Hit the track, hit the... hit the links.

1117
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:17,891
Definitely roll some bocci.

1118
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,724
Walk home along the beach at night.

1119
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,849
Kids come down and
visit for the holidays.

1120
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,099
Maybe...

1121
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,433
meet a nice widow to share it with.

1122
00:55:28,516 --> 00:55:30,600
Uh huh.

1123
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:32,932
That's it.

1124
00:55:34,475 --> 00:55:36,641
Go do it.

1125
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:39,266
I'll buy you out.

1126
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,558
Tonight.

1127
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:44,849
With enough to set yourself up
as you want down there.

1128
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,141
And sell the place to you?

1129
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,724
Yeah.

1130
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:55,475
And what are you gonna do with it, huh?

1131
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:58,058
- Make it a museum?
- No.

1132
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:03,475
One thing you're gonna need
to realize, kid,

1133
00:56:03,558 --> 00:56:07,807
your childhood, your heart,

1134
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:10,641
it ain't in that pizza oven.

1135
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:12,391
It's inside you.

1136
00:56:12,475 --> 00:56:14,558
Yeah, that may be true.

1137
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,849
But that oven makes a damn good pie.

1138
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:19,308
That's a fact that.

1139
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:21,099
Come on.

1140
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:22,974
I think you got a full house out there.

1141
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,932
Oh, yeah!

1142
00:56:36,682 --> 00:56:38,974
What did you do? What did you do?

1143
00:56:39,058 --> 00:56:40,974
The family just wanted
to show you some love.

1144
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:42,807
Hey, thanks for inviting me, Axe.

1145
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:44,391
Hey, 'course, Freddy,
you're family, too.

1146
00:56:44,475 --> 00:56:46,516
- Thank you.
- Here's to you, Bruno.

1147
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:52,516
Love you. Hey, salud, everybody.

1148
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,224
Salud!

1149
00:56:54,308 --> 00:56:55,516
Oh.

1150
00:58:42,738 --> 00:58:44,809

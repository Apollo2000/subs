Let's all tip our
hats to Taylor,

179
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,041
who outperformed the benchmarks
by a half point in my absence.

180
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,375
No mean feat...

181
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,583
But, I'm not gonna waste time
now that I got the con back.

182
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,417
I have been thinking
about this moment

183
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,959
since the second I
gave up trading:

184
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,417
Clear the board.

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,291
Unwind all current positions.

186
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,166

Oww!

Taylor, frag the quant
experiment too.

190

some good plays lately

199
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,959
You know what The Beatles did

200
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,208
when they got back to England

201
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,458
after their first whirlwind
tour of America?

202
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,291
I imagine they all
went to their doctor

203
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,291
and got a shot of
penicillin in their dicks.

204
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:32,476
Yeah. Sure. But after that...

205
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,000
They recorded their next album.

206
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,208
That they did. One every
six months, in fact.

207
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,125
So instead of basking
in their victory,

208
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,250
they consolidated it.

209
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,973
They were young. And
there was only upside

210
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,375
in pressing their advantage.

211
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,709
There is always only upside
in pressing your advantage.

212
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,417
That's the whole point of
having an advantage to press.

213
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,792
Which we finally do.

214
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,542
So we're getting out
our selling shoes?

215
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,709
Going on a raise.

216
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,667
We're doing a massive cap raise.

217
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,583
And quickly. Twenty
bill within six months.

218
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,667
But we position
ourselves as the buyer.

219
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,041
We make them beg us
to take their money.

220
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,000
Just like we did back in 2015.

221
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,000
This isn't then.

222
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,083
That's not a very
Wendy thing to say...

223
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,291
- But accurate.
- Look.

224
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,333
This will be good for all of us.
Especially you, Taylor.

225
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,125
You've never been on a raise.

226
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,917
This is the other
half of the job.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,500
And the results that we've
generated are the seeds.

228
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,917
And the horseshit we will
spew is the fertilizer.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,125
Horseshit works.

230
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
But it doesn't get
rid of the weeds.

231
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,898
By which you mean
our recent history.

232
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:32,333
Our legal troubles. All
of which are in the past.

233
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,457
I'm saying if I were on the
other side of the table,

234
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,959
I'd have questions.
And reservations.

235
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,125
Where's the rah rah
shit to counter this?

236
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,959
I'm not sure that's
what's required.

237
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,201
Taylor, when you come with us,

00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,375
you will see that this man
parries those questions

239
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,208
like Charles Van Doren.

240
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,709
Van Doren was fed the answers.

241
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,542
But he got the money.
As will we.

242

Nothing makes me feel more
like the best of myself

[Wendy] This is your third divorce,

[Wendy] Any ideas?

992

My idea was the drinking, women,
and drugs in perfect balance.

An infinite Zen garden.

Simplicity, harmony between
the elements, purity,

995
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:37,570
that's what makes it a Zen garden.

it with the AVN Awards.

1002
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:53,569
push past your
rationalizations and defenses.

1003

Or you can tell me what
the fuck is going on.

How?

1005
00:43:58,448 --> 00:44:00,183
Isn't the point of
analysis that we don't know?

1006

Which is why I'm not in that racket.

1012
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:16,482
Now, whatever caused this
didn't make you retreat.

1013
00:44:16,484 --> 00:44:19,221
You didn't become depressive.
You chose distraction.

Give me an immediate answer.

I mean, it doesn't have to be
right, just... just blurt it.

You saw your hero,

a man you deemed better than you, laid low.

Why did his plight cut you so deep?

What made you so vulnerable

1
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,902
<i>Previously on "Billions"...</i>

2
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:09,537
<i>You've been with him longer than</i>

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,172
<i>you've been with me. You and Axe...</i>

4
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:15,276
that's deep, and I fucking hate it.

5
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:17,644
<i>I've got a source, a janitor.</i>

6
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:19,814
That's as high as I
can nail down so far,

7
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,415
but he's already coming through.

8
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,650
I'm gonna get you back from
Eastern and make you happy.

9
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:26,153
- I'd like to be happy.
<i>- Got this made</i>

10
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,455
'cause I was so fucking proud of Chuck

11
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,490
for pushing back.

12
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,025
You know I didn't drive all
the way up here to Westport

13
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,794
to give out "attaboys."

14
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,663
Had to bring the kick ass... with love.

15
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:38,765
Bad day. Something happened.

16
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,301
- But I'll fix it.
- Wendy?

17
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,503
- You can't trust her.
- I need an adjustment.

18
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,471
You're finally ready for a real session.

19
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:46,739
I take care of my people...

20
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:49,342
<i>same as when Mick Danzig
gets tackled on his lawn</i>

21
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,211
with a machine gun in his fucking hands.

22
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:53,012
<i>I'm the one who pays off the cops</i>

23
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:56,782
<i>to make the problem go away.
That's what I do here.</i>

24
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,852
Took me apart, put me together again.

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,626
Mm. Red!

26
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,062
You didn't get permission from Wendy?

27
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,731
She's intractable.

28
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:39,056
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,815
I woke your assistant and made
her tell me where you were.

30
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,850
I need to have her fired.

31
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:09,985
That's what I'd do, but
you're nicer than me.

32
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,220
That I am.

33
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:16,058
Our comp meeting will
happen as scheduled.

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,393
Your bonus will reflect

35
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,762
your overall contribution
to the firm, as always.

36
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,599
But I needed to do
something else for you...

37
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,535
...after what you did
for me the other night.

38
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,771
Something special.

39
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,041
- That's for you.
- Axe.

40
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,283
This is un-fucking-believable.

41
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,217
Thank you.

42
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:54,228
Okay. I gotta go.

43
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,197
I'm on my way to meet Wags.

44
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,666
Starting a capital raise.

45
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,935
After our session,

46
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:04,172
I had the sudden clarity
that we were ready,

47
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,606
that I was ready.

48
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:15,749
I see it...

49
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,487
...looking at you, that you're ready.

50
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,356
But they may not be. At least...
not yet.

51
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,978
Good to see you, man.

52
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:51,985
- Ah.
- Welcome back, Lonnie.

53
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,720
- Can't thank you enough.
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,524
- Please.
- Excellent.

55
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,095
Uh...

56
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,230
Don't even unpack.

57
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,732
I've got an assignment
that has to happen now.

58
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:07,966
I'm listening.

59
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,403
There's a tip that I need
you to bird dog for me.

60
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,970
Well, I'm birdy as a springer spaniel.

61
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:13,172
What is it?

62
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:16,708
Criminal behavior perpetrated
by Bobby Axelrod.

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,710
I thought the office
got that case pulled.

64
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,112
Well, this case would be different.

65
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:23,982
It's not white collar.
Uh, federal firearms.

66
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:25,250
Bribery.

67
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,218
That's a monster.

68
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,254
Yeah. It can't be tied to me.

69
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:31,990
- Ah.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,825
Start in Greenwich.

71
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,894
Mick Danzig.

72
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,263
D-a-n-z-i-g.

73
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,630
Now you loop Connerty and his team in

74
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,566
when the time is right, but again...

75
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,502
...leave me out of it, Lonnie.

76
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:46,171
Yeah. I'll jump right in,

77
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:48,373
keep your involvement <i>entre nous.</i>

78
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,708
Very good.

79
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,811
Why do I have to carry this shit?

80
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,747
I'm not gonna carry it.
You know the drill.

81
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,449
Principal comes in unburdened,

82
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,517
free but for his brilliant ideas.

83
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,653
And the COO... he lugs the books
like a schoolboy with a crush.

84
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,622
There's no reason to
even have these books.

85
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:06,824
This info can fit on the flash drive.

86
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,492
Do you know why we wear ties?

87
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,260
To signify seriousness of purpose.

88
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,628
Ours is not to question why,

89
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,762
...but to do, if...

90
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:15,966
...like the schoolboy, we want our kiss.

91
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,204
Roller coasters are great
at an amusement park.

92
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,805
I love 'em.

93
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,873
The ups and downs are what
make it worth riding.

94
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,609
Not so much in an investment vehicle.

95
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:30,046
Unlike a roller coaster,
our returns only go up.

96
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,620
But your life, Axe...
The fund's profile.

97
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,287
You went from managing 10
billion in outside money

98
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,489
to half that.

99
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:42,191
- All of it yours.
- That's true.

100
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,693
A year like that makes
you question everything.

101
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,429
Makes you find new answers, too.

102
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,664
What'd you figure out?

103
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,733
That it's all about my why.

104
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,602
I don't get to think

105
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:55,671
about business in such
an esoteric manner.

106
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:59,142
I have to evaluate risk, reward, return.
That's it.

107
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,276
And to that end...

108
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,745
my people have a few questions.

109
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:04,446
Your Sharpe Ratio's very low.

110
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,349
How does an idea turn into
an investment at your shop?

111
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,685
What's your mosaic
theory at Axe Capital?

112
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:13,288
Fees from funds like ours
used to pay your overhead.

113
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,492
How are you dealing with
floating it all yourself?

114
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:20,662
I can't allow myself to care about that.

115
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,164
What I do care about

116
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,668
is making decisions to benefit
a greater number of people.

117
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,271
Now when I'm only working
for myself or my staff,

118
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:31,573
I'm sharp enough.

119
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,976
But when I'm making
decisions for<i> you</i> as well as me,

120
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,578
that's when I'm twice as
careful, twice as focused,

121
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,983
because I cannot live with
losing somebody else's money.

122
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,651
That's my why.

123
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,553
Have you had your Carter
Staley meeting yet?

124
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,854
Is he allocating to you?

125
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,057
He's a lemming.

126
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,359
soon as you net one major
allocator, he'll be in.

127
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,960
He was supposed to<i> be</i>
the major allocator

128
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,496
that would make the others comfortable.

129
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,198
We just one need domino.

130
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,934
Yeah. Greenwich PD.

131
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,339
Thank you for bringing that in, Robin.

132
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,639
My pleasure, sir.

133
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,374
Duty rosters for the
last several months,

134
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:11,144
along with vacations times
and radio call log.

135
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,546
If your subpoenas are in order,

136
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:14,981
would you mind telling me
what you're looking for?

137
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,683
Yes.

138
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,186
Yes, I mind telling you.

139
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,823
So you are that
confident you can get back

140
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,325
to the numbers you were at.

141
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,927
No doubt. I have
meetings lined up all week.

142
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,161
Terrific.

143
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,831
- Is Staley aboard yet?
- Not yet.

144
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,898
Doesn't matter.

145
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,401
I'd be thrilled to be first money in.

146
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,169
Wunderbar.

147
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,907
- Another whiff.
- Yep.

148
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,876
If it's that's easy, you
know they're not coming in.

149
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:46,045
Nope. Just there for the story.

150
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:49,581
"Axe pitched me. How the
mighty have fallen."

151
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,851
We gotta close Carter Staley.

152
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:02,761
Officer Salter responded
to a disturbance call

153
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:04,162
at the Danzig residence

154
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,232
but found no reason to pursue
matters with Mr. Danzig.

155
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,534
My client has nothing further to say.

156
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,169
We're going to be interviewing
the rest of the shift

157
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:12,637
that was on that night.

158
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,405
<i>I'm gonna make it very clear to them.</i>

159
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,975
<i>Cooperation results in candy canes.</i>

160
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:18,910
<i>Obfuscation will get you coal.</i>

161
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,246
<i>Now let's talk about this vacation</i>

162
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:24,282
<i>your client took to Vanuatu
in early September.</i>

163
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,918
- What was the purpose...
- Recreation.

164
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,819
If you want to lodge formal charges,

165
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,421
let's rock and roll. Otherwise, you...

166
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,591
Don't you worry. We're about
to rock like Cameo in '86.

167
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,796
You're smashing back every
one of their questions

168
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,431
...when they fucking ask them.

169
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,100
Like Agassi in his prime. The
dam is gonna break soon.

170
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,002
I don't need the Coach
K bullshit right now.

171
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,904
Well, what do you need?

172
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,772
Not sure. Something.

173
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,448
Throw those books aside.

174
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,484
No, take those books,
go back to the office,

175
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:02,819
and I'll see you after.

176
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,039
Here's how simple it is.

177
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,375
I've outperformed the S&P by 38.7%

178
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,177
over the past 15 years.

179
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,813
But that's not at issue here.

180
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:35,283
The issue is the turmoil,

181
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:39,455
the aspersions cast on my fund and me.

182
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,690
I'm talking about 9/11,

183
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,459
arrests,

184
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,228
whether I run a clean shop.

185
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,731
And I understand that.

186
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,199
In your shoes,

187
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,901
I'd factor it in, too.

188
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:54,135
But I'd also factor in

189
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,804
the true cost of missed opportunity.

190
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,776
In the span of... say, what? A year?

191
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:05,013
Nobody's gonna give a
shit about any of that.

192
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:07,782
But the growth that you
will have missed out on?

193
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:09,751
That's gonna eat you from the inside.

194
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:13,053
In a year's time, I'd
be happy to revisit.

195
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,255
In a year's time,

196
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,290
you're not gonna be able
to get me on the phone.

197
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,760
When I walk out that door today,

198
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:20,795
we are friends for life,

199
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:23,998
or you don't exist to me ever again.

200
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,170
I'm about to go on the
run of a lifetime.

201
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,439
I am aligned. I feel it.

202
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,575
And I know you can see it.

203
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,578
I'm here, but in ten seconds,

204
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,847
the bullet train leaves.

205
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:45,752
And if
you wanna make money,

206
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,821
climb the fuck aboard.

207
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:48,955
<i>Yes!</i>

208
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,156
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

209
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,494
I shouted out when you called me.

210
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,195
Holy<i> fuck,</i> we're back!

211
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,863
Great, boss.

212
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,632
Come on. Come on!

213
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,600
Can't imagine how the bonus
comp sessions would've gone

214
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,036
if it went the other way.

215
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,304
- Welcome back.
- Good to see you.

216
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,805
Good to see you, man.

217
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,706
So... wanted to
hit the ground running,

218
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,144
but wanted you guys looped in
on what I'm working... Axelrod.

219
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:14,046
Mandate to find extracurricular crimes.

220
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,280
You found one?

221
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,749
Bribery of police officials.

222
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,586
Yeah, I got a pair of,
uh, Greenwich cops

223
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:21,954
with links to an Axelrod PM

224
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:24,723
taking a vacation to Vanuatu
a little while back.

225
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,759
Yeah, you know who vacations there?
No one.

226
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:29,762
Oh, that place is a haven
for offshore banking.

227
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:33,031
Wait, you think these cops went
to visit their payoff money?

228
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,632
Set up their accounts?

229
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,068
Yeah, I had 'em turn
their heads and cough,

230
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,502
and they didn't give anything up,

231
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,771
but... once
the money's been tracked,

232
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,573
they won't have a choice.

233
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,108
I'll e-mail you guys what I have.

234
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,676
- This could really be something.
- Yeah.

235
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,678
- How'd you step into it?
- On a hunch.

236
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,145
I reviewed arrest records
of all Axe Capital...

237
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:49,948
There were no arrests. We checked.

238
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,317
Right. So then I looked into the
suspicious activity reports

239
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:55,553
in the Greenwich PD's dispatch log.

240
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,722
Found a few that raised a
red flag that hadn't gone

241
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:58,823
all the way through the system.

242
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,925
Huh.

243
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,127
That's some fucking hunch.

244
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:43,500
Don't hand me that card.
I gave you that card.

245
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,935
Raul.

246
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:48,004
Okay, you went this
far, get right to it.

247
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,407
You have a problem.

248
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,941
You greased some fellows in my union.

249
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,676
If you say I did.

250
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:55,177
I do.

251
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,346
And it worked.

252
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,549
Word is the US Attorney's
office knows something about

253
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:03,920
an... automatic weapon, paid off cops,

254
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:05,154
and one of your guys.

255
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,722
You wouldn't know anything
about it, would you?

256
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,357
I think I had a dream about it once.

257
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,791
Further word says they're
rolling through people,

258
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:13,328
rolling over them to get
to the truth of the story.

259
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,264
How'd it get to you?

260
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,699
I make it my business to
still know what's going on.

261
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:19,301
I have three sons and six nephews

262
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,303
in various branches, and
we don't miss much.

263
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,871
That's for sure.

264
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,844
I'll say a more complete
thank you at a later date,

265
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:33,782
but... thank you for being a friend.

266
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,416
Always.

267
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:38,687
And slow down on these
goddamn winding roads,

268
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:41,122
Or next time it won't be the
US Attorney that gets you.

269
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,606
If one of the officers flips,

270
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,008
confesses, or if they
find the money or gun

271
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,309
and can trace it...

272
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:05,412
They cannot trace the
funds back to us. Yet.

273
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,247
They were securely handled,

274
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:10,383
intermediaries, overseas banks.

275
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:13,087
But eventually, everything has a trail.

276
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,589
The laws regarding this type of thing...

277
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:17,424
bribery of public officials,

278
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:20,360
automatic weapons possession, discharge,

279
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:23,096
are not open to interpretation.

280
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:26,566
No judge's personal bent
is going to help us here.

281
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,101
If Rhoades knows about it,

282
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,504
then one of the cops is already talking,

283
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,640
because Danzig doesn't know
how we did what we did.

284
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:36,275
And they haven't
picked him up anyway.

285
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:40,013
Orrin...

286
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:42,115
you should leave for this part.

287
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:45,785
Thanks for your counsel, as always.
Invaluable.

288
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,387
I serve at your pleasure.

289
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,164
How?

290
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,668
Wendy Rhoades.

291
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,640
I had a session.

292
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,508
Careless, I know.

293
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:16,181
You needed connection. Few of us don't.

294
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,183
Should I
prepare the materials for her?

295
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,952
Yes.

296
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:25,122
It would be best if you
continue on with her as is,

297
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,624
so we can monitor her.

298
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,859
You're right.

299
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,033
Hey.

300
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,137
Kids ate.

301
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,906
I waited for you.

302
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,111
Come here.

303
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,804
You were right about Wendy Rhoades.

304
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,840
I told her
something compromising,

305
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,975
and it's coming back on me.

306
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,945
Fucking knew it. I told you. I<i> knew</i> it.

307
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,181
She needs to be shut down. Tight.
Right fucking now.

308
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,651
Yeah, when the time is right.

309
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,819
But for now...

310
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:34,757
remember the contingency
plan we discussed?

311
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,759
It's
time to put it in motion.

312
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,162
Fuck.

313
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,532
It's really happening.

314
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,801
Yes.

315
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,939
How are you gonna play it?

316
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,809
Like nothing's wrong.

317
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,849
So when we tie Axelrod to bribery

318
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,386
of law enforcement officers
and obstruction of justice...

319
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,254
We are sitting pretty in Schaefer City.

320
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,458
This is Axelrod in jail.

321
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,560
Real jail time, too.

322
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:15,563
This is criminal behavior
that, if proven,

323
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,498
takes away any middle ground
between right and wrong

324
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,566
and marks him wrong forever.

325
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,135
It does.

326
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:24,872
I am frankly astonished.
This is<i> excellent</i> work.

327
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:26,740
I never should've detailed
you over to Eastern.

328
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,810
How did we let him go, Bryan?

329
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,211
I-I don't actually know.

330
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,280
How the hell did it happen, Chuck?

331
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,181
This kind of go-get-em attitude...

332
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,550
...and competence...

333
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,185
We've missed that around here.

334
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:42,122
Haven't we, Bryan?

335
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:45,158
I guess so.

336
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,527
Very good, gentlemen.

337
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,762
What are our next steps?

338
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,636
Good morning.

339
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,705
It is.

340
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,512
- So?
- "So"?

341
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,116
That's what you have to say to me?

342
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,120
Wait.

343
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:17,623
I feel like I walked in
halfway through the play.

344
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:21,961
I decided I wasn't gonna say anything,

345
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:24,964
but now, looking at you,

346
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:28,133
sitting there, smiling in my face,

347
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:31,270
fuck it.

348
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:34,306
You sold me out.

349
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:35,640
What?

350
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,210
I tell you something compromising,

351
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:41,446
and the next thing I
know, the fucking feds,

352
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,248
your<i> husband,</i>

353
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
is up my ass again.

354
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:50,856
Hmm?

355
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,728
Just so you know, and...

356
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,332
I wanna be clear as daybreak on this...

357
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,069
If I go...

358
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:07,738
You go with me.

359
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,846
I have your web traffic
on our server here,

360
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:17,548
and from your laptop.

361
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,450
You got quite a dark side, don't you?

362
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:21,752
I would imagine this would make

363
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:24,722
Dr. Wendy Rhoades look
very unprofessional.

364
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,624
And, of course, the whole world,

365
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:28,893
including the office of the US Attorney

366
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,728
for the Southern District,
and the Attorney General,

367
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,397
would see it, too.

368
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,335
It's funny.

369
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,738
I never instructed my man to take these

370
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,041
when he set up the baths, but...

371
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,108
I suppose on, uh,

372
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,246
on some deep level, I knew he would.

373
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,782
And<i> you,</i>

374
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:56,085
being such a master of
the subconscious...

375
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,754
or is that mistress?

376
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,224
I suppose you would've known, too.

377
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,163
I didn't sell you out.

378
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,765
Polygraph me, motherfucker.

379
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,733
I tell you about my issues with Danzig,

380
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:15,237
and then in, ooh, the
space of, what, 48 hours,

381
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:18,207
there's a fucking
investigation underway!

382
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,019
Twelve-thousand
square feet of living space

383
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,922
and, of course, complete privacy.

384
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:36,524
It's lovely.

385
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,627
For people in our... situation,

386
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:40,962
which would you recommend?

387
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,663
Well, you can pick a
school based on the villa

388
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:43,931
or vice versa.

389
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:47,035
I have a packet of all
those options for you.

390
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,803
And the timing can
work as we've planned?

391
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,706
Yes. These particular schools are used

392
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,875
to business people's
children coming and going

393
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,510
for a variety of reasons.

394
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:57,478
Will you be enrolling them
under their real names?

395
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,914
What?

396
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,416
Some don't. The stigma.

397
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:06,186
They want their kids to have a
clean run at their new lives.

398
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:10,724
We can provide fresh
passports for all of you.

399
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,359
No.

400
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:15,129
Yes, their real names.

401
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:19,333
If I may,

402
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:22,536
I knew I might be doing this
for your husband one day,

403
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:25,038
but his choices aren't always yours.

404
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,373
You and the children,

405
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,576
you don't have to go.

406
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:32,211
But are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

407
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:34,147
Because you know you can't come back.

408
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:40,353
We're all going together.

409
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:43,423
Let's
talk about travel.

410
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,258
Yes.

411
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,368
Mmm.

412
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,705
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

413
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:02,575
I've been thinking about this
burger at least twice a week.

414
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:07,312
Exiled and then returned.

415
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:08,681
Damned and saved.

416
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:12,417
I'm just saying I miss
the burger, Bryan.

417
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,720
It's what you're not saying
that has my attention.

418
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,922
What the fuck?

419
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:21,259
Dude.

420
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,694
Are you okay?

421
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,862
Uh, I'm kind of...

422
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:27,532
fucked up, honestly.

423
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:29,534
That makes sense.

424
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:33,304
Here's what makes sense. You didn't...
stumble upon

425
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:35,272
this Danzig-Axelrod thing.

426
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:38,542
Someone fed it to you.

427
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:42,246
I've developed sources.
One came through. Yes.

428
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:44,482
One just happened to come through

429
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:48,685
the minute you walk back in the door?

430
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,755
At exactly the
right time for you

431
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:53,991
to pull that out for Chuck and
the rest of the squad, huh?

432
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,826
Look...

433
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:57,794
I understand
how you're feeling

434
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,863
with everything you've put into this.

435
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,999
But we can work together.

436
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,634
We can share the win.

437
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:08,438
Chuck's
the one who gave it to you.

438
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,509
He got it somehow, and he's
using you as his shill.

439
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:15,178
All right, check yourself, right now,

440
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,813
before you come at me with some bullshit

441
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:19,516
that wouldn't work on a
street corner drug dealer.

442
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:22,918
You are gonna get hurt here
in ways you can't see,

443
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,021
and I'm trying to stop
it from happening,

444
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,690
for all of our sakes, but
you gotta give me the real.

445
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:34,197
Beneficent as hell, but I'll pass.

446
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,533
Look, I know you bootstrapped
your way to where you are.

447
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,101
But I want you to take
one look into my eyes

448
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:43,438
and tell me if you<i> really</i> think
that I had it any easier.

449
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,944
If you have an issue with
Chuck, take it up with him.

450
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:53,582
Otherwise, don't piss on my integrity.

451
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:56,985
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
back to eating my burger.

452
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:04,125
Breaching a country's Air
Defense Identification Zone

453
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,728
in Europe today, very tough.

454
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,096
Dangerous for everyone involved.

455
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,431
Which is why I'll pay you double.

456
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,033
Come on, guys, are we solving this,

457
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,868
or am I gonna find someone else who can?

458
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,808
All right, then.

459
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,854
Hi. Where are the kids?

460
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,856
I sent them to Nancy's
so we could do this.

461
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,793
"This"?

462
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,301
I know what you did.

463
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:53,841
I don't believe this.

464
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:56,476
Everything I've done, no matter what,

465
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,078
is for us.

466
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,547
I don't believe that, not anymore.

467
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,782
Not after you broke into my computer,

468
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:05,852
opened my files, and
read my session notes.

469
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:07,687
You stole the evidence you needed.

470
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,256
I had no choice.

471
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,059
We all have choices.

472
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:14,394
That's right.

473
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:17,096
That's right, and I'd do it again.

474
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,766
Because even if you can't put together

475
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,868
what he's done to us, I can.

476
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,936
And that gives you the right
to break into my computer?

477
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:25,171
If you give someone your
password, is it really

478
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:26,639
- ...breaking in?
- Yes, it is.

479
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,641
Do not come at me with another
word of lawyer bullshit.

480
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:30,910
You can talk yourself into
any kind of justification.

481
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:33,512
Sure. Yeah.

482
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,381
But, you know, it's no
worse than you and your,

483
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,883
"I'm there for my patients" bullshit,

484
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:40,686
because these patients that
you see are criminals.

485
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:42,087
That's the point.

486
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:47,660
And all the proof I could ever
need is in that computer.

487
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:49,661
In my own house.

488
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:51,797
I know this much about the law...

489
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,832
You can't use what you found there.

490
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,801
It's privileged and inadmissible.

491
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,435
And if you do and you're caught,

492
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:59,137
I won't lie on the witness stand.

493
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:00,438
Don't worry. A wife can't
be compelled to testify

494
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,840
against her husband.

495
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:04,176
Oh, I won't have to be compelled.
I will volunteer.

496
00:26:07,947 --> 00:26:11,382
Jesus Christ, you<i> really</i> are
one of them now, aren't you?

497
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:12,784
Holy shit.

498
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:14,251
Are you really turning this on me?

499
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,621
You betrayed my trust.

500
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:18,756
After you were out all night.

501
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,024
And don't give me this crap

502
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:21,859
about how it was all business either,

503
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:23,760
because I saw the two of you out there.

504
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,796
Cozy as a couple of teenagers

505
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:28,498
sharing a cigarette
after a backseat fuck.

506
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,468
Wow. You spied on me, too?

507
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:35,139
No. I wasn't there to spy.

508
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:36,506
Uh, it was to talk to you.

509
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:40,210
'Cause I'm desperate, Wendy.

510
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,179
I wasn't up there because of the case.

511
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,882
It was personal.

512
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,051
This man, this motherfucker,

513
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:51,388
is destroying our lives.

514
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,290
He's driving us apart,

515
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,658
and he's doing it deliberately.

516
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,260
No.

517
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:00,396
You are. He is an outside factor.

518
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,799
This<i> problem</i> is here.

519
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:05,969
You could've walked away
from this a million times.

520
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,703
- You told me you had.
- I can't.

521
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:10,006
It's not that simple.

522
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:12,742
Even this, uh, the reason
we're here right now

523
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,276
having this conversation,

524
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:16,479
he knew that I was acting on the bribery

525
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,247
before anyone could've known it.

526
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:22,451
<i>He</i> will not let<i> me</i> just walk away.

527
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:25,421
He will not stop until he ruins me.

528
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:26,989
Now you sound like a crazy person.

529
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:30,959
He had me followed, all right?

530
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,228
'Cause he's trying to trip me
up, he's trying to trap me.

531
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,830
So I had to play dirty
right back at him.

532
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,632
Followed? Where?

533
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,902
Trapped you how?

534
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:50,211
Uh...

535
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:54,682
After I saw
you and Axe together,

536
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:57,952
I got very worked up,

537
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,755
past the point of, uh...

538
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,490
I went to see Troy.

539
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,432
And like I said, he had
someone on me and, uh...

540
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:14,767
well, if I didn't get lucky,
there would be pictures

541
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,038
on the front page of today's<i> Post.</i>

542
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,776
You went to see her
without fucking tell me.

543
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:27,212
Nothing happened.

544
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:30,015
And I couldn't go through with
anything anyway because, uh...

545
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:33,252
Because you weren't there.

546
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,754
How touching.

547
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,490
I'm cut off.

548
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:43,462
I'm cut off from you, from us.

549
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:45,931
And you sit there and you try
to claim moral high ground.

550
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,199
Oh, oh, oh, oh. I<i> claim</i> it?

551
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,468
While you go on working at
a criminal organization,

552
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,237
and you can't even fucking
admit it to yourself, Wendy.

553
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,742
And you prop it up

554
00:28:57,744 --> 00:29:00,411
and you suck in all that it gives you...

555
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:03,181
status, money, control.

556
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:04,749
You know what? It gives
me a hell of a lot more

557
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:07,418
than you do, <i>including</i> honesty!

558
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,787
Really?

559
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:14,959
What? Like this?

560
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,260
How'd you earn...

561
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,162
...that new hunk of metal
that's parked outside?

562
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:19,563
What's that worth? A quarter mil?

563
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,199
I don't know. I didn't
have it appraised.

564
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,034
You know, what
you should be appraising

565
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:26,003
is your conscience.

566
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,938
'Cause you can lie to me
about how it makes you feel,

567
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,040
but you can't lie to yourself.

568
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:35,880
And if you're right there
in the middle of it

569
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:38,081
with a bunch of criminals,

570
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,985
what do you think that makes<i> you?</i>

571
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:48,225
You don't get to ask me
that question anymore.

572
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:50,994
I am going to take a walk.
Pack your shit.

573
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:53,130
When I get back,

574
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,198
be gone.

575
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,325
Good news, boss.

576
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:59,860
Uh, banking authorities
in Vanuatu have revealed

577
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:02,230
that our cops have
significant holdings there.

578
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:03,531
It's gonna take some time...

579
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,299
these fuckers are not cooperative...

580
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,267
before we find that source of the funds,

581
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,103
but we know what we're going to find.

582
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:12,039
Case is terminated.

583
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:22,015
What the fuck is going on?

584
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:30,290
Looked like
a winner, but it's not.

585
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:33,260
'Cause there is no gun.

586
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:34,894
Uh, there will never be a gun.

587
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,800
That's good legwork, Lonnie. Thank you.

588
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,436
But I don't want you
burning out your legs

589
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,404
chasing another ghost.

590
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,611
Bryan...

591
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,051
Okay.

592
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,023
It's Chinatown, Jake.

593
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,190
Been here a while?

594
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,757
Yes.

595
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,629
I didn't expect you back so
soon after how you left.

596
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:52,136
<i>I don't believe
that, not anymore,</i>

597
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,740
<i>not after you broke into my
computer, opened my files,</i>

598
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,742
<i>- ...read my session notes...</i>
- Jesus.

599
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,976
<i>You stole the evidence you needed.</i>

600
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,844
<i>I had no choice.</i>

601
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:06,917
<i>'Cause you can lie to me</i>

602
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,553
<i>about how it makes you feel,
but you can't lie to yourself.</i>

603
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,188
<i>And if you're right there
in the middle of it,</i>

604
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,123
<i>with a bunch of criminals,</i>

605
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,626
<i>what do you think that makes you?</i>

606
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:20,263
That's a hell of a question
to have to answer.

607
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,866
I know.

608
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,775
I am so sorry to have doubted you.

609
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,143
This is the part where you
tell me you're gonna destroy

610
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,077
everything you showed me, right?

611
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,213
I will destroy all copies of it,

612
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,215
whether you believe me or not.

613
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,684
What else are you prepared to do?

614
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,457
Your bonus.

615
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,825
I was planning to give you two million.

616
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,227
It just went up to five.

617
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,863
How do I know you mean it,

618
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,964
that I won't walk down to my office

619
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,265
and find it's one million

620
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,634
and another four you're
keeping invested here for me?

621
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,637
I'll wire it to you now,
to your own account.

622
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,776
Wags, five sticks wired now

623
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:09,411
to Wendy Rhoades' personal account.

624
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,980
<i>Whoa! Powerball winner.</i>

625
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,884
Check your
e-mail in two minutes.

626
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,152
I will.

627
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:19,288
I'll triple
it for that recording

628
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,989
you played me just now.

629
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,759
It's worth that much to you?

630
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:27,628
Consider that my opening offer.

631
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:34,235
He's still the father of my kids.

632
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,973
I had to try.

633
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:50,818
I quit, Bobby. Chuck was
right about one thing.

634
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
I can't be in denial about...

635
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:56,924
...what this place is,
what you are, any longer.

636
00:34:56,926 --> 00:35:00,527
Not after what you showed me.

637
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:03,163
I know you trade on inside information

638
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:06,366
and by other illegal means.

639
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,135
Or you let it be done for you.

640
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:09,336
You encourage it.

641
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:11,171
Are you taping<i> me</i> now?

642
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:13,540
No.

643
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,942
I just need to hear myself say it.

644
00:35:15,944 --> 00:35:17,977
Look, I can explain...

645
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:20,213
Good luck with that...

646
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:22,816
and with everything.

647
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,784
Goodbye.

648
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,226
Yeah?

649
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:05,949
Where's Connerty?

650
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:07,383
I don't know. He left.

651
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:12,488
I know you're pissed.

652
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,591
I get it. But let's
channel that, shall we?

653
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:20,263
How did you know that Tara
Mohr was leaking information?

654
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:22,098
She just felt wrong.

655
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,400
She was always just
around, hovering. Why?

656
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:27,603
She can't be the only one.

657
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:35,644
We're gonna need
personnel files for this floor,

658
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:37,145
and banking records.

659
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,582
I wanna know who else is wrong.

660
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:41,350
Yeah, you got it.

661
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:06,172
Hey.

662
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:07,674
Everything's set.

663
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,644
All we have to do is...
get it to the plane with us.

664
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:12,846
You're amazing. Thank you.

665
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:15,749
But we don't have to go.

666
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,950
No?

667
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:22,122
The leak was Wendy,

668
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,656
but not how we thought.

669
00:38:23,658 --> 00:38:25,858
She didn't sell me out.

670
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,595
Still, case is done.

671
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,898
Rhoades can't act on what he has.

672
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,534
Oh, fuck.

673
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:36,202
We really
don't have to go.

674
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:37,436
No.

675
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:39,572
Oh.

676
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,440
Ohh.

677
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,711
I am so goddamn glad we
don't have to turn our boys

678
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:47,246
into fondue eaters.

679
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,250
And Wendy?

680
00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:53,919
Gone.

681
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:57,056
For good, I think.

682
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:04,196
Well, it's for the best, you know.

683
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:07,266
She outlived her utility
as a weather vane

684
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,334
of what her husband was gonna do.

685
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,871
She's more than that, Lar.

686
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,008
You know, I don't really want
to talk about her anymore.

687
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,446
Look at this.

688
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,281
There was a time when this was more than

689
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:27,518
we ever could've imagined
having, you know?

690
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,922
We'd always talk about doing
without, living simple.

691
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:33,558
Hard to think about going back.

692
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,759
Yeah.

693
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,296
Really is.

694
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:42,266
Well, I'll return it all
to the bank tomorrow.

695
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,070
You know what? Don't.

696
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:47,437
Leave it here.

697
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:50,440
You never know.

698
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,888
That's him.

699
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,759
African-American gentlemen,
Jefferies, Clement. Age 62.

700
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:13,563
Okay. Let's see if we can
Tinker Tailor his ass.

701
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:19,435
- Dale.
- Sir?

702
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,504
The team needs the latest
on our Axe Capital wire.

703
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,740
I need the latest on
the wire myself bec...

704
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:26,242
Don't answer me back. Conveying
the intel is your job.

705
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:27,376
The FBI can't put those wires up

706
00:40:27,378 --> 00:40:28,678
and then not share on the comeback.

707
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,748
Sir, all due respect,
I'm awfully confused.

708
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,616
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll straighten it all out.

709
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:36,418
I'll book a meeting with you and Terri.

710
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:54,169
What are you eating?

711
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:55,270
Nothing.

712
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:57,639
Not here. Too good to pass up.

713
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,840
Bruno, what's hot?

714
00:40:58,842 --> 00:41:01,009
I got a fresh nonna pie
and a hot pepperoni.

715
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:02,243
Nonna pie.

716
00:41:04,848 --> 00:41:07,448
Hey.

717
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,617
Enjoy, eh?

718
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:13,087
And lock up when youse are done.

719
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,556
Good night, Bruno.

720
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:30,470
Jesus.

721
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:33,340
Okay. Now what?

722
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:38,412
I don't wanna ruin your appetite
just as you started digging in,

723
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,248
but... I need to
tell you that your boss got

724
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,118
that bogus information
on Axe and the cops

725
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,188
by accessing his wife's private notes.

726
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,159
Fuck!

727
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:54,894
Right.

728
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:58,732
I'm sure by now he's dropped it.

729
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:03,103
He has.

730
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:06,405
Then my
part is done for now.

731
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:13,178
Oh, what the fuck? Come on.

732
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,581
Hang for a minute, Bryan.

733
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,952
Listen to what Bobby has to say.

734
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,789
I can't sit with you.

735
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,359
Sure, you can.

736
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,961
You want to.

737
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,496
Same way you want to stare
at the lions at the zoo.

738
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,667
Bach
walks around thinking

739
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:37,936
he's better and smarter than everyone.

740
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,906
- And you know why?
- 'Cause he is.

741
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,174
That's right,

742
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:46,010
only he says you're just as smart.

743
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:49,748
Even more focused, younger, hungrier.

744
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,048
Dangerous.

745
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,086
I don't know about any of that.

746
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:56,254
I know hard work.

747
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:59,257
Yeah, you work hard.

748
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:02,660
But it's much more than that.

749
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:06,230
You're driven the way only
someone brought up from nothing,

750
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:08,599
the way we were, can be.

751
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:11,568
Chuck Rhoades, for all his ambition,

752
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,604
he can never need it the way we do.

753
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:16,040
But the guy's had a
safety net all his life.

754
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,909
You and me? We never had a fucking net.

755
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:25,081
That's why it can never work,

756
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:29,085
in the long-term, you under him...

757
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:32,022
Because he can't understand

758
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:33,957
what matters to you the way I can.

759
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,792
Hmm.

760
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,132
I spend every minute of my day

761
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:43,834
going after guys like you.

762
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:47,971
That attitude, that
focus, that ability...

763
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:51,073
it's not being fostered
where you're at, is it?

764
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,343
It's being thwarted, in fact.

765
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,978
And eventually...

766
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,447
what you're feeling

767
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:00,316
will turn to disgust and self-hatred,

768
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,553
and in the end, apathy,

769
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:04,754
if it hasn't already.

770
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:06,956
Oh, that's your diagnosis?

771
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,091
What's your cure?

772
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:12,261
You know what it is.

773
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:16,498
Come work for Bach's firm on my account.

774
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,636
It's a different kind of integrity

775
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:24,773
where at least you know you're
never lying to yourself.

776
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:28,810
I'm offering challenging work.

777
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,144
You'll be allowed to win...

778
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:34,148
expected to, on your own terms.

779
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,818
And, of course, you'll be rewarded.

780
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,688
Seven figures, starting.

781
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,657
And an ability to help your
family,<i> really</i> help them.

782
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:47,862
Your mom... she won't have
to work so hard, not at all,

783
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:51,332
unless she wants to.

784
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:55,069
Time to take your seat
at the grown-ups' table.

785
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:01,542
That's not who I am.

786
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:03,043
I can't picture it.

787
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,546
Oh, I think you can picture it now.

788
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,983
The Bryan Connerty at the
settlement conference...

789
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:13,954
he would've stormed out of
here the moment I walked in.

790
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:15,722
But you stayed,

791
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:17,257
and you listened.

792
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,027
Hmm.

793
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:22,462
And like you said...

794
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:26,433
I stare at the lions at the zoo, too.

795
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,968
Doesn't mean I wanna be one.

796
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:32,705
Sure, it does. Everyone
wants to be a lion.

797
00:45:32,707 --> 00:45:36,810
Most people just never get the chance.

798
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:39,612
I'm offering you one now.

799
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,331
Thanks for the pizza.

800
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:12,177
I didn't hear "no."

801
00:46:27,794 --> 00:46:29,660
Yeah?

802
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,662
<i>Source says Rhoades
has listening devices</i>

803
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,064
<i>in place at Axe Cap.</i>

804
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:35,766
Fuck. Fuck!

805
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:39,370
Okay, get a sweep going now.

806
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,772
Already in progress.

807
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,279
Welcome to the club, sir.

808
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:51,682
Chuck Rhoades. We spoke earlier.

809
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,118
As I said, I'm sorry, we don't
have any suites available

810
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,452
on short notice.

811
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:57,287
I'll let you know as
soon as one opens up.

812
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,356
Thank you.

813
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:39,262
<i>You've reached Wendy Rhoades.
Please leave a message.</i>

814
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:15,729
All clear again, just
like the last two times.

815
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:17,198
Are you sure you and your guys

816
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,133
were thorough?

817
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:21,635
You watched. We hit every
inch of the place.

818
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:25,038
So what do we do now?

819
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,908
There's nothing more we
<i> can</i> do on this level.

820
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,376
We can only go deeper.

821
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:35,782
Then go deeper.

822
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:37,617
All the way down.

823
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,331
Fuck!

824
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,833
Fuck!

825
00:49:44,517 --> 00:49:47,418
There's nowhere left to check.

826
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,687
We've gone down to the rivets.

827
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:52,856
I say there's nothing here.

828
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:54,458
Are you sure?

829
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:01,765
You can never be sure.

830
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,633
I thought your kind could
only come in when invited.

831
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,605
Look at what you did
to this fucking place.

832
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:48,144
I wonder what would've made you
feel you needed to do this.

833
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,679
But you do know we were never
able to get a warrant to bug it.

834
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,215
Oh, not having a warrant
wouldn't stop you.

835
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,951
Or maybe there is one buried
in the ceiling somewhere.

836
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:59,555
I can't... I can't really remember.

837
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:03,091
What the<i> fuck</i> are you even doing here?

838
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,093
I come bearing gifts.

839
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,234
Open it.

840
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,745
I want you to have that.

841
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,382
- As a reminder.
- I don't need a reminder.

842
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,983
The memory of shoving that up your ass

843
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,885
makes me laugh at least once a day.

844
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,920
Yeah, I bet it does.

845
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,123
But I'm not laughing.

846
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,592
Oh, you should.

847
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,526
The studies say that laughter
does more to contribute

848
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:42,229
to a general sense of well-being
than almost anything else.

849
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:44,131
Oh, yeah. No, of course.
I love to laugh.

850
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,268
I'm not laughing<i> now</i> is
what I should've said.

851
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,803
Oh, why is that?

852
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,605
Because my wife kicked me out.

853
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:53,808
Good for her!

854
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:58,278
But she's not here either,

855
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,013
if you're trying to find her.

856
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:04,751
We've both lost her.

857
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:07,821
Oh.

858
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:11,224
Well, then maybe you have
a sliver of my pain,

859
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,659
because you stripped away
everything that matters to me.

860
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:15,761
<i>You</i> came at<i> me!</i>

861
00:52:15,763 --> 00:52:18,497
Because you're a criminal,<i> Bob.</i>

862
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:23,803
And it's my job to shut 'em
down and put 'em in jail.

863
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:27,373
Well, if that's true,
you're not very good at it.

864
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,974
You're also full of shit.

865
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:35,180
What have I done wrong? Really?

866
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:39,051
Except make money, succeed.

867
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:44,089
All these rules and regulations...
arbitrary,

868
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,025
chalked up by politicians
for their own ends.

869
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:50,495
And these fines you're
always going after...

870
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:54,066
Where do they go? Who gets them?
The poor? No.

871
00:52:54,068 --> 00:52:56,434
The Treasury, the government.

872
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:59,371
It's taxation by other means.

873
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:03,842
Save the civics lesson and
the Ayn Rand bullshit.

874
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:06,678
The fines are the minimum of
what you should have to pay.

875
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,979
Oh, you decide what cases to take,

876
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:10,715
and you only take the
cases you won't lose.

877
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:13,084
But you got it wrong with me,

878
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:14,886
...because this country...

879
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:17,722
...was built on industry
and competition.

880
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:20,424
So they will<i> always</i> have a place for me.

881
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh.

882
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:25,096
And maybe a few generations from now,

883
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:27,664
they'll tell stories about you,

884
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:28,966
...like they do Jesse James...

885
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:30,834
....or Billy the Kid.

886
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:33,971
Oh, the myth is so fuckin' romantic.

887
00:53:33,973 --> 00:53:35,739
The rugged individual
who won't back down

888
00:53:35,741 --> 00:53:39,877
to the unimaginative,
do-gooder authorities.

889
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:42,546
Only in reality, those
guys stole and hurt

890
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:44,047
and destroyed lives.

891
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:47,217
Now you say you don't think
you've harmed anyone.

892
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:49,352
I say that the effect is
the same, worse even,

893
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:52,522
because you infect the entire world.

894
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,558
You throw the whole system off balance,

895
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,295
leaving chaos and poverty in your wake.

896
00:53:58,297 --> 00:54:01,031
I make the system run.

897
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:06,403
I have contributed hundreds
of millions of dollars

898
00:54:06,405 --> 00:54:08,638
in taxes and philanthropy.

899
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:15,177
I am employ hundreds of people directly,

900
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:18,080
thousands indirectly.

901
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:21,717
What do you do?

902
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:23,753
Nothing...

903
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:26,355
besides suck from the municipality,

904
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:28,390
feed off of it.

905
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:31,760
And in exchange, you what? Keep order?

906
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:34,796
You're a traffic cop
hiding in federal robes.

907
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:39,835
I'm moved.

908
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:43,572
I am... that is gonna play
huge to the other guys

909
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:46,007
...on your cell block.

910
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:48,009
Oh, you're sure to become
President of the, uh,

911
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:51,279
Libertarian Club of
Danbury Federal Prison.

912
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:55,016
'Cause no matter what you say,
that's where you're ending up.

913
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:57,418
Keep that as a memento.

914
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,853
And every time you look at it,

915
00:54:58,855 --> 00:55:01,289
know that deal is as good as
it is ever gonna get for you.

916
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:03,657
And one day, you are gonna
wish like fucking hell

917
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:05,293
that it was still on the table.

918
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:09,797
Then you should've kept half
of that for yourself, too.

919
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:13,001
Because when I pull a
deal off the table,

920
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:15,936
I leave Nagasaki behind.

921
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,550
You know the only enemy more dangerous

922
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:33,953
than a man with unlimited resources...

923
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:38,291
...is one with nothing to lose.

924
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:43,530
And that is what you are looking at

925
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:45,499
right here.

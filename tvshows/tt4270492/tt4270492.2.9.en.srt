1
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:11,040
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,681
Sandicot's not getting
the gaming license.

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:15,707
The committee chose the
location that will bring

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,916
the greatest benefit to the
greatest number of people.

5
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,624
The gaming license
was the guarantee

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,105
that Sandicot would
pay off the notes.

7
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:24,124
So, it's fallen upon all
of you to figure out

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,874
how to get us un-fucked.

thought it would be.

You care to be a
little more specific?

12
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,707
I'm supposed to give
their lawyer a heads-up,

13
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,541
but I think I'm pretty
safe to talk...

14
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,165

18
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,239
I have said those
words to myself

19
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:51,874
the first morning
of every trial.

20
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,165
- You can still say the words.
- Hello. I'm Taylor.

21
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,207
My pronouns are "they,"
"theirs," and "them."

22
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:01,707
You see things differently.
That's an edge.

23
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,541
That's Camelot right there.

24
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:06,207
That is a picture of a
man running for office.

- Yes, but not for you.

What was the nature of
your job at Axe Capital

321
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,457
as you understood it?

322
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,040
I was to be next to
Axe in every meeting,

323
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:10,040
to be the firewall against
illicit dealings.

324
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,791
I was a witness and to make sure

325
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,874
things were being
done above board.

Tell me about Axe.

327
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,916
He was unreadable.

328
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,833
At three o'clock, he
was writing checks

329
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,332
to aid earthquake victims
in the Caribbean.

330
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,374
At 3:45, he was
cornering the market

331
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,290
on Churchill first editions
just to stick it to an enemy.

And then one day, he
just fragged my ass.

333
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,040
I never really saw it coming.

334
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,290
Did he give an explanation?

335
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:43,290
No. I guess he just didn't
want a witness anymore.

336
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,124
Referred to himself
as a Terminator.

What does that mean?

338

A cybernetic organism,
programmed to kill.

Living tissue over
robotic endoskeleton...

I've seen the movie.
I just meant...

He has some sort of
programmed mission,

342
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,041
and I was standing in the way.

343
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,251
The day before he fired me,
Bill Stearn approached

344
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,582
with a play that was
clearly over the line,

345

They didn't talk about it...
because I was in the room.

00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,541
But without me, one
or both of them

349
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:17,999
would have circled back,
no doubt about it.

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,791
Or else Axe would've
filled my position.

351
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,999
No. He wanted no impediments
to illegal activity,

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,541

wrote their names on the ages

A proprietary process
called Flash-Pas.

It is within reach.

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,874
Well, if it comes from you,
he'll take it more seriously.

441
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,582
If I make the call, then it's
tantamount to me endorsing it,

442
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,958
which is... not something
I can do right now.

This is the one that
I've been waiting for

446
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,457
to get me out of that
goddamn law office.

447
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,207
I do know that you
would not be here

unless the deal was a winner.

449
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,290
- I'll...

450
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:46,457
Let me think.

451
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,249
Of course. Of course.

452
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,750
All right.

453
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,290
Look what Wags got me.

454
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,833

455
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,874
Luxury survival bunker.
It's a scam.

456
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,416
Why does everything
need to be a scam?

457
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:06,541
When the Armageddon comes,
the doors will be locked.

458
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:10,124
I think it's a good
idea, a fail-safe.

No VR sales tours.

And I was clear about that,
and I've stuck to it.

Uh...

Yeah. I don't know if you heard,
but I was up in Sandicot.

It's a real mess up there.

Hmm. What's that about?

My readjustment back
at Axe Cap has been...

524
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,541
more difficult than I
thought it would be.

How so?

526
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,041
I've felt manipulated.

527
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:20,999
I may have done
some of that, too.

528
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,360
I may have given
you the impression

529
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:26,541
that I was happy there, and
I may well end up that way.

Oh, you don't have
to answer that...

No, it's what I've
been asking myself.

For good fucking reason.

Because there's certain
guys you just know about.

00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,791
You look 'em in the
eye, and you know.

00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:23,791
Other guys, you
know things about.

to cold dish me.

I just don't know that
he's past it yet.

Oh.

637
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,208
Why don't you ask him yourself?

638
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:36,416
Look him in the face.

639
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,457
That's your present.

- Got it.
- It's kind of a miss,

649
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,582
so I went back into
the Sandicot file

Who is Bobby Axelrod to you?

I also know about that

- I see something I like...
- Nah.

No one will believe that.

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,582
Oh, not when we run 'em through

688
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,749
the litany of business
dealings you've engaged in

689
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,249
that could, uh, most charitably
be described as shady

690
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,165
and most accurately as criminal.

00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,541
Fraudulent loan applications,

union payoffs, stiffing vendors,

and yet, writing off the
expenses on your account.

694
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:06,333
You do everything to save a
buck on the business end.

695
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,708
Are you leveraging me?

696
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,749

Oh, I bet you'd like to
put me in that hole...

They never find 'em when
you do that, do they?

702
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,624
No one wants to tear a
whole building down,

703
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:36,500
but you can't now. Now,
you're respectable... ish.

704
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,374
You've changed your narrative.

705
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,499
So let me suggest a new
chapter in your story,

706
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,958
one in which you are the
unindicted co-conspirator

707
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,290
rather than a defendant.

708
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,040
Which story is that?

709
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,332
The story of Sandicot.

710
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,374
Let me tell it to you,
then you tell it back,

711
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,250
if it's true, of
course, which it is.

712
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,585
You and Axelrod entered
into a criminal conspiracy

713
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:03,582
to bribe Marc Capparello
for inside information

714
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,958
on the deliberations of
the Location Committee

715
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:08,083
and where they were
gonna put your casino.

716
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,624
Wow.

717
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,249
You're some fucking gangster,

718
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,082
swaggering up here,
making threats.

719
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,707
From you, "fucking gangster"
sounds like a compliment.

720
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,958
Not how I meant it.

721
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:26,666
Axelrod is not your friend.

Not so much.

762
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,040
buy some offsets.

Donate to the

764
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
As a matter of fact,
if you do that,

765
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:40,416
I'll have Deb book the plane for ya.
Done. Move on.

766
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,624
It's not just that. It's...

767
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:46,374
I never thought I'd be thinking
about living this life.

768
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,291
You're living it already.

769
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,166
Do you think I ever
thought I'd be here?

770
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:55,999
I never thought I'd be more than
just a numbers guy at the track.

771
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,959
Aqueduct?

772
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,833
Nah. Trotters. I'd
still be at the track

773
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,791
if it weren't for this
one guy, a gambler.

774
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,666
He worked a seat at Commodities.
He thought I'd be good.

775
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:08,541
So he took me to Four World
Trade, and I saw it immediately.

776
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,416
I could read the tape just
like the odds on the board.

777
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,707
It was like walking
into something

778
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,290
between a casino and the U.S.
Mint.

779
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,999
So I bought a seat at
the exchange for 64K,

780
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,332
and that was it.

781
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,916
Is that a common
career trajectory?

782
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,916
Not anymore. Wasn't
back then either.

783
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,874
And you're glad
it went this way?

784
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,874
Yeah. Why shouldn't I be?

785
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,715
So before I let you get
back to your childhood,

786
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,916
the moral of the story is...

787
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,874
just get on the
fucking plane, huh?

788
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,457
No.

789
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,082
The moral of the story
is, you get one life,

790
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,333
so do it all.

791
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,249
Why did I have Thayer
dead to rights,

792
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,707
and he wasn't even nervous?

793
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:28,999
Why were you sitting with
Thayer in the first place?

794
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,290
How does that help you with
headlines, blind items...

795
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,582

796
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,999
Oh, you weren't encouraging
me to be smart.

797
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,916
You were protecting
one of your own.

798
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:42,165
Did you handpick
him for the deal?

799
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,499
Did I make a mistake with you?

800
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,959
Are you fighting for
inches or yards?

801
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:55,124
I am so close to getting Axe.

802
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,749
I can run on that.

803
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,499
I can win on that.

804
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,749
That's what we both want.

00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,541
If you are the man I think and...
and hope you are,

806
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:08,791
you will get him...

Axe has gone bad on something.

953
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:23,874
You have to know before I do it.

954
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,667
You want me to break
my public vow?

955
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,124
The moment that
I'm transitioning

956
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,082
into elected office?

957
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:34,958
It's only damaging
if it gets out.

958
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:38,332
I'll invest silently.
Your role will be hidden.

959
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,833
We'll replace the funds as soon
as we sell some of the stock.

960

Hmm.

you over to the house enough.

Thanks for the invite.

And I appreciate the
personal follow-up.

977
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,457
Chuck was, um...

978
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,249
quite surprised
to hear from you.

979
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,082
Well, I'm glad you came.

980

Bobby will really
value you being here.

981
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,127
Hmm. I couldn't tell when
I spoke to him at work.

982
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:45,457
Oh. I thought you weren't
really talking at work.

983
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:50,249
I'm sure it must be hard for
you to not have access to him,

984
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,040
but we think it's
best for everyone.

985
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,333
Clear boundaries this time.

986
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,040
Right...

987
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,416
which is why I set the policy.

988
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,937
It was the only way
I could work there.

989
00:52:03,961 --> 00:52:05,082
I couldn't keep seeing him.

990
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,707
It wasn't like doctor-patient
or even athlete-coach.

991
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,958
It was more Hannibal-Clarice.

I thought it was important

Let's get outta here. Fuck this.

999
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,207
It's a mistake.

1000
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:26,207
I see how we made it...

1001
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:28,874
because we forgot.

1002
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,416
I forgot... where I'm from.

1003
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:36,040
I forgot that I don't give
a fuck about any of this.

I wanna be with you.

1007
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:50,000
I wanna take you
somewhere that matters.

Everyone's waiting for you.

Wags is about to
give his speech.

1010
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:06,040
I've had quite a
challenge this week

1011
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:10,999
to put together words,
ordinary words,

1012
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,833
to describe the most
extraordinary man I ever met.

1013
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,124
A man as steely as
a Roman centurion,

1014
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:21,165
cooler than Jean-Paul Belmondo.

1015
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:25,416
He's a jaguar shark,
an American Sniper,

1016
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,457
every decision in the
space of seven breaths.

1017
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,207
If you cross him,

1018
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,083
he'll put a fucking
ding in your universe.

1019
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:37,583
But these are all
exaggerations, derivative.

1020
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:43,291
They don't limn the truth
of an indefinable essence.

1021
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:48,666
They don't speak to
my real feelings.

1022
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,124
It's no exaggeration to say

1023
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,707
that Bobby Axelrod is the
man who gave me my life,

1024
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,249
or at least let me keep it.

1025
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:00,124
But even more than that,
he's given me friendship...

1026
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,885
the kind of friendship,
it's more than money,

1027
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:05,916
it's more than talent, it's...

1028
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:07,791
almost family.

1029
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:11,290
But unlike family,
he never turns away.

1030
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:14,750
He's the only one who truly
sees me and doesn't judge.

1031
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:20,624
He accepts me as I am,

1032
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,457
and that kind of
friendship is...

1033
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:27,457
everything.

1034
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,792
It is the stuff of life itself.

1035
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,999
So thank you...

1036
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,875
for my life.

1037
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,999
Traders trade.

1038
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,165

1039

1041
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,667
wherever you are.

1042
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:56,666
Way to go, Wags!

1043
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,457
Axe didn't show up?

1044
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,165
Who does that, skips
his own party?

1045
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,290
That's fucking fantastic.

1046
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,166
Maybe he's an introvert, too.

1047
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,999
No, he's not an introvert.

1048
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,791
He just remembered
he's an outlaw.

1049
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:11,417
A fucking desperado.

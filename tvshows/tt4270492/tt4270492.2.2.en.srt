1
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,933
Previously on "Billions"...

2
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,099
An investigation has begun
into your office,

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,299
and the man leading the
investigation... Oliver Dake.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,866
The payment that your wife
received from Axelrod,

5
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,466
it may not be a bribe,

6
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,432
but, dang,
if it doesn't look like one.

7
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,632
Well, Lawrence Boyd pissed
right in my face.

8
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,299
He didn't show.
What the hell do we do now?

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,132
Bobby Axelrod could run
through the Serengeti

10
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,599
and not break a sweat.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,566
You do what you do
just as well as him.

12
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,833
Maybe better.

13
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,399
You can't allow yourself
to get drawn in

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,566
to an unwinnable fight.

15
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,733
Victory will be swift.

16
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:46,566
That will save us ten million
on this trade.

17
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,165
This is why I need to keep you.

18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,032
I'd believe the same thing
were I you.

19
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,899
- Whoa!
- You've been served.

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,566
-With a lawsuit?
-One hundred and twenty seven
of them.

21
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:57,032
Wendy was at Krakow
Capital earlier today.

22
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,866
You have an amazing
level of insight

23
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,466
- into how we hedgies think.
- Yes.

24
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,799
I don't mean Axe Capital.
I mean Bobby himself.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,466
- He was looking to hire you?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,532
That motherfucker is just trying
to poach my most valued...

27
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,265
I'm not your anything.

28
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:14,199
We handle ourselves and Chuck
gives someone Head of Crim.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,299
Or we cooperate with Dake
and try our luck

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,199
starting over with
Chuck's replacement.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,466
You know what Rhoades is.

32
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:21,299
You know he should be
out of the job.

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,866
That was the attorney general.

34
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,599
She's summoned me to Washington,

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,799
where she will greet me warmly,

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,967
and then she'll fire me.

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,399
There was a moment in time

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,065
when the only two people
who knew what it was to fly

39
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,199
were the Wright Brothers.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,999
And we are like them in a way.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,632
Although
we have to stay airborne

42
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,299
a lot longer than nine seconds,

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,733
we and have to go into much
thinner air when we do.

44
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:05,099
But how do you do it, Todd?

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,599
How do you stay aloft?

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,232
One of the nine poets,
Pindar, said it best.

47
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:16,265
Become who you are
by learning who you are.

48
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,165
You wouldn't know Pindar
from Pantera,

49
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,532
yet you act like you read
the Harvard shelf

50
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,933
with your morning oatmeal.

51
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,699
Who wrote this shit for you?

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,099
Lawrence Boyd, I respect you

53
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,999
more than anyone in this game.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,499
But the idea that Todd Krakow
or anyone else but you here

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,299
is a thought leader
just because they've got

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,599
a few dollars in their pocket
is laughable!

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,966
Let me respond.

58
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,165
It's a sad fact
of the business today.

59
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,699
Hedge funds like Axelrod's,
they're out of ideas,

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,866
so they cut corners

61
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,799
and go looking
for that black edge.

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,299
But I'm good enough

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,466
that I didn't have
to get close to the line.

64
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,566
Really?

65
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,566
What about
the $45 million in fines

66
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,866
you paid to the U.K.?

67
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,733
That...

68
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,966
No one understands those laws.

69
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:04,399
Larry, you ever found yourself
afoul of British law?

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,332
No, some of us have never run
afoul of any international laws.

71
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,165
Larry, you have teams
of lawyers at Spartan-Ives

72
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,265
and locals in those
countries who ensure

73
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,165
you don't get screwed
the way I did.

74
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,165
Oh, okay, okay, okay,
I'm only the referee here,

75
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:22,666
not taking sides,
but you overstepped.

76
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,933
Apologies.

77
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,599
And let that
be the first apology,

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,132
not the last, to this audience,

79
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,265
who have paid three grand
for the privilege

80
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,799
of hearing your barbaric yawp.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,532
- Axe, Axe, Axe.
- Here's a thought.

82
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,933
If any of you want
to continue the conversation,

83
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,833
I'll be over by the bar
with my team.

84
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,265
Sure... hit, run,
and hide, huh?

85
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,766
You been showing the SEC
the same moves for years.

86
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,265
But, eventually, they catch you.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,632
Krakow, whatever
cocktail party tutor

88
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,532
you used to prep you
for this panel

89
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,866
owes you a goddamn refund.

90
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,165
Well, that was stimulating.

91
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,799
Okay, okay, let's move on.

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,399
Tag, Global warming...

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,799
I called the car around
so you can go.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,599
Why would I leave now?

95
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,733
That's what you get for trying
to steal my fucking employees.

96
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,933
Don't blame me
for your fuck-up.

97
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,099
Word of advice, Axe...

98
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,265
you don't want to lose a
valuable asset,

99
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:23,599
don't let her walk
out the door, huh?

100
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
Here comes Boyd.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,432
Sorry about your panel.

102
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,032
Sorry. The only reason you put
Ric Flair in the ring

103
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,766
is to get that heat
from the crowd.

104
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,799
I didn't pick that panel
by accident.

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,165
I knew you'd incinerate it.

106
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,833
You just made sure
Spartan-Ives

107
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,799
is all the Street's talking
about for the rest of the month.

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,499
They'll be killing themselves
they weren't in the room.

109
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,666
And the only way
they get in there next year

110
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,299
is by making you their prime.

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,100
I'm the bull,
you're the red sash every time.

112
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,766
Hey, Chuck.
Come in.

113
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,733
I drove by Katz's
on the way here.

114
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,265
Oh.
You're killing me, man.

115
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,632
No?
Well, I'm going in.

116
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,233
Uh-huh.

117
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,966
Oh.

118
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,566
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

119
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,666
Talk to me.

120
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,766
Well, it's thorny.
So many old cases aggregated.

121
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,499
Taken all together,
it looks like

122
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,232
a pattern of overreach,
misconduct.

123
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,733
That's why the papers think
it's such a good story.

124
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,265
And there's the Axelrod case.

125
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,833
- We never even brought charges.
- That's good.

126
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,766
You're protected
by qualified immunity.

127
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,866
Chances are, we get it
thrown out of court.

128
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,532
That will depend on the judge.
We gotta find a very...

129
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,265
Chuck,
I'm gonna make this go away.

130
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,332
That's why you came to me
instead of going

131
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,299
with whatever lawyer
Justice gave you.

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,133
Justice isn't defending me.

133
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,432
Whoa.

134
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,132
They only do that when, uh...

135
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,799
Well, they never really do that.

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,099
No.

137
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,199
Well, I'm not billing you.

138
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,599
Oh, come on.
You gotta bill me, Ira.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,132
It's $1,400 an hour.

140
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:11,232
Half price.
Friends and family.

141
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,734
Why aren't they defending you?

142
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,065
The Attorney General's
called me down to Washington.

143
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,766
She's gonna fire me.

144
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,966
Shit. Dake.

145
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,566
Oh, it's a lot of things
over years.

146
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,399
But the stain
of this investigation

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,165
has hobbled me politically.

148
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,232
I got no back channel
out of this.

149
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,299
You gotta prove your loyalty,
then, show her you're a soldier.

150
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,833
Yeah.
I thought about that.

151
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,632
A new case
the administration smiles on.

152
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,499
Let the General
take the credit, sure,

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,966
but there's just
no fucking time.

154
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,032
The A.G.'s got
a lot of enemies, Chuck.

155
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:47,032
Take out an enemy...
a big, hard-to-kill one.

156
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,532
It's tough to fire you then.

157
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,933
Finding the right target
might be enough.

158
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:55,099
One so... gaudy,

159
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,199
so outlandishly difficult
to bring down

160
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,432
that my replacement
would certainly fail.

161
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,065
How much time do you have?

162
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,933
Three days.

163
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,100
Do you know what this is about?

164
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,399
Starting immediately,
you have a new mandate.

165
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,966
Find me a case
that's screaming for justice.

166
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,799
One that no one else would have
the courage to take on...

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,232
even if... no, especially if

168
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,833
it seems impossible to win.

169
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,966
Where do we begin?

170
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,733
I want to kick
into the C-suites...

171
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:39,232
those Teflon corporations

172
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,165
that defraud the American people
on a grand scale.

173
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,999
No one was ever prosecuted
for the financial crisis, no.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,299
When we went after Wall Street,
we got what we could get...

175
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,933
rogue traders, chip shots.

176
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,032
That ends today.

177
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,766
Anything else you can say
that would narrow the target?

178
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,833
You want us to get back up
on Axe Capital?

179
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,265
- Um, we know that they're...
- No, no.

180
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,866
Steer wide
around Axe Capital for now.

181
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,433
That's not gonna help.

182
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,699
Help what?

183
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,099
Be creative.

184
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,567
I look forward to your ideas,
and I want them in 24 hours.

185
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,232
Why's he want
an impossible case?

186
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,933
It's hinky.

187
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,499
I'm gonna steer wide
around all of it.

188
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,099
Hey, Axe,
you know what today is?

189
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,666
It's fuck Todd Krakow
in the ear day.

190
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,766
Why do you think
I'd want to do that?

191
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,132
That panel was Godzilla
versus Mothra.

192
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,799
Do you have a plan?

193
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,399
Or are we just gonna jump him
and break his kneecaps

194
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,065
when he gets out of his McLaren?

195
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:46,232
Okay, so Krakow's been running
his mouth about China, right?

196
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,299
I...
You can tell the way he talks.

197
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,599
- The way he talks?
- Yeah.

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,599
Last year, he said,
"watching factories grow."

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,699
It made me wonder,
"How's he seeing this?"

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,699
Really, Mafee?
You expect me to believe

201
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,466
you suddenly swapped
Ali G reruns

202
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,199
for videos of Todd Krakow's
speeches on China?

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,466
Okay.

204
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,232
My analyst caught it.

205
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:10,366
Yeah.
Then get him in here.

206
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,866
Hello.
I'm Taylor.

207
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,232
My pronouns are they,
theirs, and them.

208
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:25,232
Okay.
You have two minutes.

209
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,265
After your dispute with Krakow,
I presumed roiling antipathy,

210
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,065
so I catalogued
all of his public statements

211
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,666
going back two years.

212
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,632
In January 2016, Krakow's
tone on China changed...

213
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,666
more bullish, omniscient,

214
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,766
which led me to think
satellite images.

215
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,399
So what?

216
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,666
All the big funds
are using satellite images.

217
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,966
How many cars are in the parking
lot at Walmart

218
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,400
indicates how big a quarter
they're gonna have.

219
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:57,099
But this, let me see.

220
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,599
You found out which
satellite company Krakow uses.

221
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,933
AR Metrics.

222
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,933
Assuming Krakow would be
the biggest user...

223
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,532
Their most-viewed images,

224
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,933
and you deduced that's what
he's been looking at.

225
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,265
A microchip factory
in the Pearl River Delta.

226
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,999
And now you know what he knows.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,299
Since you're in my office,

228
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,999
you think you know
what he doesn't.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,699
China's not just cooking
the books,

230
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,866
they're going full
Iron Chef with that shit.

231
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,432
Everyone knows that, Mafee.
Then why is Krakow long?

232
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,265
Come on, time's almost up.
What happened in January 2016?

233
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,432
The Chinese factory
went from totally dormant

234
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,165
to bustling
with trucking activity.

235
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,132
Which meant
foreign investment followed.

236
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,799
But tell me
what really happened.

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,999
An article came out
on satellite-detected

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,699
discrepancies
between Chinese sites

239
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,299
and what had been reported
by government statistics.

240
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,733
And after that, they knew
they were being watched,

241
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,632
so the trucks started moving...
a show for the satellites.

242
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,632
Factory's a fake.
It's a shell to milk investors.

243
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,733
And what is the next move?

244
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,966
- Short the...
- I asked Taylor.

245
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,466
Short the Chinese parent company
Krakow's invested in.

246
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,866
It's not good enough.

247
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,733
As Chanos says,
China's a pig on LSD...

248
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,632
you never know
which way it's gonna run.

249
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:04,332
So who is this fake factory
supposed to be supplying?

250
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,399
What does this ripple out into?

251
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,999
You find that, you find
Krakow's real investment.

252
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,466
How long you been here?

253
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,666
Three months.

254
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,933
I'm leaving in two weeks
for grad school.

255
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,132
I'm an intern.

256
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,500
How did everything go?

257
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,466
Salutations, my dear.

258
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,766
Oh.
Um...

259
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,799
I think Chuck's working tonight.

260
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,332
I wanted to talk to you.

261
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,667
Pas devant.

262
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,567
We'll see you tomorrow.

263
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,633
I know what pas devant means.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,499
I was looking for some
cufflinks I lent my son,

265
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,966
but I couldn't find them
in the bedroom.

266
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,232
You were in my bedroom?

267
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,566
And most of Chuck's suits
seem to be gone from the closet.

268
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,966
You didn't come out
to Brooklyn for cufflinks.

269
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,600
Is Chuck living
at the Yale Club?

270
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,799
Some gal in accounting
messed up,

271
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,532
sent me a charge for a breakfast
on a day that I was not there.

272
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,132
So I asked for the chits,

273
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:24,432
and it was Chuck's signature
on the line at 6:30 a.m.

274
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:28,099
Yes, we've separated...
for now.

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,833
And you've kept it from me.

276
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,799
I asked Chuck directly,
but he denied it.

277
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,934
He lies better than I do.

278
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,999
This is idiocy.

279
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,265
And to think we didn't come
running to you with the news.

280
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,933
Because I would tell you
the truth.

281
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,466
This is selfish,

282
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,032
destructive to your children.

283
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,466
We're not uprooting the kids.

284
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,966
They're staying in the house.

285
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,966
Chuck spends three nights
a week with them.

286
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,532
No, I'm not talking about that.

287
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,132
I'm talking about their legacy.

288
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,332
Do you think that this makes it
easier or harder...

289
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,666
for Kevin to meet
his station in life?

290
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,966
You must mean
for him to be happier.

291
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,065
They are the future of my name.

292
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,332
And yours.

293
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,566
You think you and Chuck
are the only ones

294
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,966
who've grappled with
some upheavals in a marriage?

295
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:20,733
Unless it is broken plates
and steak knives,

296
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,332
you gut through it.

297
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,132
If one of you has an itch,
you'll work it out.

298
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,366
You don't move out.

299
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,766
It wasn't an itch.

300
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,699
And what about you?

301
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,532
You'd really rather have
your three nights a week

302
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,099
than be First Lady
of the State of New York?

303
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,599
Maybe I would.

304
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,599
And if you want
to continue this,

305
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,433
do it with your son.

306
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:54,299
Oh... I will.

307
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,833
Bobby.
Your order's there.

308
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,199
White clam is on top.

309
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,166
Thanks, Bruno.

310
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,132
Say hello to my nephew, Marco.

311
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,466
Kid just got elected

312
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,132
to county executive
up in Sandicot.

313
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,299
I'm Marc. An honor to meet you,
Mr. Axelrod.

314
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,667
Sit down, have some wine.

315
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,099
Is this yours?

316
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,066
Made it with my own two feet.

317
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,265
Eh?

318
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,232
Hey, look, I'll stay next time.

319
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,799
- Kids are hungry.
- Okay.

320
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,265
Ciao, Bobby.
Enjoy.

321
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,733
Good to meet you.

322
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,999
That's a busy man.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,366
Yeah.

324
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,366
There'll be time.
There'll be time.

325
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,666
- You told my father.
- I didn't tell him.

326
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,366
He's like you.
He figured it out.

327
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,432
No, he had a theory,
which you confirmed.

328
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,933
- He's hounding me now.
- What about these lawsuits?

329
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,599
Were you gonna tell me
about them?

330
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,766
Why did I have to read
about it in the Times?

331
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,632
Nuisance suits.
Minor distraction.

332
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,933
Didn't rate a discussion.

333
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,599
This investigator...
Oliver Dake.

334
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,199
Yeah, well,
I told you about him.

335
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,599
He's questioning me later.

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,734
Please, come in.

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,966
So, Chuck...

338
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:16,799
do you still feel as if
you're under attack...

339
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,734
by unseen forces?

340
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,467
Carolyn, can we have the room
for five minutes?

341
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,466
Look, I don't know
what to say to him.

342
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,466
He knows you dropped the case.

343
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,499
He thinks it's connected to me.

344
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,866
If he puts together
the session notes...

345
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,966
That will be
a career-ender for me.

346
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,666
I'm aware.

347
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,199
You're the expert
on this sort of thing.

348
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,599
How should I spin it,
what kind of...

349
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,933
language should I use?

350
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,833
Should I have
an attorney present?

351
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:00,165
Mmm, no.
That will make it look worse.

352
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,799
No, don't spin it at all.

353
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,165
Answer his questions truthfully,

354
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,666
don't put any lies
on the record no matter what.

355
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,132
I don't...

356
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,566
I don't want you to lie for me.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,132
Probably gonna go down anyway.

358
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,065
I don't want you
going down with me.

359
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,667
Kids are gonna need one parent
not in custody, right?

360
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,733
We should probably
let her back in.

Your relationship
with your husband,

374
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,065
would you say it's been healthy?

375
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,165
We have our ups and downs.

376
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,566
When did you stop
living together?

377
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,165
Is that relevant?

378
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,866
Was it before or after you
were given five million dollars

379
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,600
by the target
of his investigation?

380
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,165
We separated right before that.

381
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,233
I find the timing convenient.

382
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,532
Are you married,
Mr. Dake?

383
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:06,232
My status is none
of your concern.

384
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,232
So you are.

385
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,867
But it's new... two years?

386
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,199
I hope you don't find this
out personally,

387
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,899
but separating
is never convenient.

388
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,799
If you are
legitimately separated...

389
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,466
- That's been established.
- Has it?

390
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,032
Or did the two of you
work in a separation

391
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,165
to make Axelrod's payment
more palatable?

392
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,734
They're not connected.

393
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,933
How long after the payment

394
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:29,833
did you end your employment
at Axe Capital?

395
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,466
The same day.

396
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,733
What an eventful day.

397
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,899
How would Axelrod
characterize the payment?

398
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,899
It was compensation.

399
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,132
A bonus for services rendered,

400
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,899
a very complex session
for Axe himself.

401
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,766
What did you talk about?

402
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,332
I'm a medical doctor,

403
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,899
and that's privileged
information, as you well know.

404
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,232
So if you're trying
to trip me up, try harder.

405
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,666
You can come back
with a court order, lock me up,

406
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,032
and I'd still never tell you

407
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,833
a goddamn thing
about my patients.

408
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,466
I just wonder what could have
been said in such a session

409
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,065
to justify such an enormous sum.

410
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,733
It was commensurate with other
bonuses at Axe Capital.

411
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,966
So five million dollars
is not a large bonus?

412
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,966
What a rarified world
you live in, Ms. Rhoades.

413
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,265
Did something else happen

414
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,799
to increase your value
to Axelrod?

415
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,433
Such as?

416
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,199
Did you provide him information?

417
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,733
I'm not sure what you mean.

418
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,766
Details about the investigation

419
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,599
or its status,
past, present, or future?

420
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,332
No, nothing.

421
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,066
I see.

422
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:41,099
Do you think that your husband

423
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,265
was really recused
from the Axelrod case,

424
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,232
as he claimed?

425
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,733
He told me he was.
I took it at face value.

426
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,766
Did you ever hear him
discuss the case

427
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,966
with colleagues or on the phone?

428
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,499
I can't say for sure that I did.

429
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,100
But you can't say you didn't.

430
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,266
No, I can't.

431
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,132
We're going to need
to talk formally again.

432
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,432
Okay, I really don't have
anything more to say.

433
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,132
You can confirm
that Chuck Rhoades

434
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,666
was secretly directing
the Axelrod investigation.

435
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,799
He wasn't really recused,
was he?

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,632
Are we gonna do this
over the phone?

437
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,599
No.
In your office.

438
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,866
And you will give me
what I need.

439
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,366
Or maybe we'll have
a pepperoni slice in Yonkers.

440
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,299
You can invite your boss.

441
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,432
I can influence the vector
of your future, Mr. Connerty.

442
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,632
And you'd do well
not to forget that.

443
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,065
I got more on Krakow.

444
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,667
No. Get your
better half in here.

445
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,632
Anata-Tek... rising market share
in wearable computers.

446
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,232
I know it.

447
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,933
It's a hedge fund group grope,
Krakow leading the party.

448
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,332
Yes. Anata-Tek's IPO
two years ago was lukewarm,

449
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,699
but the stock is soaring

450
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,632
ahead of the release
of their flagship.

451
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,265
- It's called the Ring.
- I know about the Ring, Mafee.

452
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,599
It's a great prototype.

453
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,599
But can they scale up,
can they ship product?

454
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,432
Not if the microchips
are supplied

455
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,332
by a fake Chinese factory.
Booyakasha!

456
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,866
Short two million.

457
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,933
Wake me up when the
stock's down ten percent
from the current levels.

458
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,766
That's where we want to cover.

459
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,799
This is gonna be fun.

460
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,933
Okay.

461
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:39,599
After they've completed
the order,

462
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,966
send a tweet from my account.

463
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,299
Say,
"Who's supplying Anata-Tek?

464
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,733
Next Lumber Liquidators,"
question mark.

465
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,199
From your account?

466
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,966
That may be a little...
blatant.

467
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,799
Good.
I don't want to be subtle.

468
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,199
I want him to know it's me.

469
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,132
Dr. Gus
is on the premises.

470
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:58,466
Okay. Start pushing everyone
through, mandatory sessions.

471
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,467
Are you a hard-ass, badass,
jackass, or no ass?

472
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,065
Sorry?

473
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,899
And that is one
of the three things

474
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,099
that people say in that spot.

475
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,332
It's kind of like
the "dick-for" thing.

476
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,699
If you apologize after
I've said something confusing,

477
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,999
that is on you, my friend.

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,632
If you say so.

479
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:29,265
What I say is,

480
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,099
we used to live in a world
that rewarded those

481
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,933
who were very good
at their jobs.

482
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:36,432
Do you know what you get now
for being very good?

483
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,767
You get keistered.

484
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,300
Do you want
to get keistered, Ben?

485
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,933
No.

486
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,366
I almost said "sorry" again

487
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,666
because I barely understand
what you're...

488
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,466
And we will work on that.

489
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,299
Replace "sorry" with,

490
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,466
"What the fuck
are you trying to say?"

491
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,733
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable with that.

492
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:04,099
I'm not interested
in your comfort.

493
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,399
Axe Capital is not interested
in your comfort.

494
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,232
I am interested in you becoming

495
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:12,899
a goddamn giant-killer.

496
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,899
Do you want to be
a giant-killer, Ben?

497
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,265
Sure.

498
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,566
What the fuck
are you trying to say?!

499
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,733
Yes.

500
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,933
I want to kill giants.

501
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,265
There ya go!

502
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:29,600
There you go.

503
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:36,032
I thought we were gonna talk
about the path

504
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,966
from analyst
to portfolio manager.

505
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,766
That is all
we are talking about,

506
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,432
and you are a long way from
making the trek up that path.

507
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:45,499
Holy fuck,
do you people need what I do.

508
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,766
Go!

509
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,132
Tell Gayle
to make an appointment

510
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,533
for you to come and see me
next week.

511
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:10,833
You are currently engaged
in a legal action

512
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,165
against Mr. Rhoades.

513
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,599
Yes.

514
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,733
Do you harbor suspicions
of additional misconduct

515
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,299
that you opted not to include
in your public filings?

516
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,499
Suspicions?

517
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,666
Sure.
I'm full of suspicions.

518
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,265
I'm suspicious of
all-you-can-eat buffets.

519
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,065
Each and every 10-K
I have to read.

520
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,466
I'm suspicious
that the folks you work for...

521
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,799
the federal government...
occasionally fuck up.

522
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,999
Hey, you get me started,
I'll admit I'm suspicious

523
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,299
that not all prize fights
are on the up and up,

524
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,999
that Warren Buffett
and Bill Gates

525
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,099
may not really like each other
as much as they claim.

526
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,933
I'm even suspicious that maybe

527
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:46,632
you don't really need
those glasses to see.

528
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,132
I do.

529
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,966
I think you see pretty clearly.

530
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:55,132
But those are all the suspicions
that I'm prepared to share

531
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,632
with you today
in your professional capacity.

532
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,766
Were you aware
that the U.S. attorney

533
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,432
was pursuing charges against you

534
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,799
in connection
with a firearms disturbance

535
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,834
by one of your employees?

536
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:08,966
Yeah.

537
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,132
Mr. Axelrod finds
the question irrelevant.

538
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,733
Consider him aware now.

539
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,499
The same day
the U.S. attorney

540
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,899
ended the pursuit
of said charges,

541
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,099
his wife received
a five million dollar payment

542
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,165
from this company.

543
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,733
Highly irregular.

544
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,933
In your world.
Not in this one.

545
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:27,099
I don't think a judge or jury is
likely to discount the linkage.

546
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,733
My client allowed you here
as a courtesy.

547
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:34,332
No one at Axe Capital
works under a contract.

548
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,132
Each are compensated
at my client's sole discretion

549
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:39,099
based on their value
to the firm.

550
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,432
I think you misunderstand
my intentions, Mr. Bach.

551
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,999
The DOJ has authorized me
to offer the whole menu.

552
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,966
We would be willing
to give Mr. Axelrod

553
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,432
immunity from prosecution...

554
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:55,265
if he were to testify
that the five million dollars

555
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:59,366
was, in fact, a bribe
of the U.S. attorney.

556
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:03,366
After all, uh, hedge funds
will do what they do,

557
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:06,432
but Mr. Rhoades answers
to a higher authority...

558
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,566
justice.

559
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,566
Cue the orchestra.

560
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:13,566
You'll hear from us.

561
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,566
Lay it out.

562
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,099
If you take the deal,
claim it was a bribe,

563
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,466
your reputation
may take a hit, but...

564
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,933
it would be the end
of Chuck Rhoades.

565
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:38,966
Because although I know
it wasn't a bribe,

566
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,899
the facts line up.

567
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,332
He would be disgraced.

568
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,099
Removed from office, indicted.

569
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,300
But Wendy Rhoades
would be indicted, too.

570
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,833
Indonesian?

571
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,199
Oh.

572
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,599
Oh, God, yeah.

573
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,966
You obviously heard
my stomach's cries for help.

574
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,366
Thank you.
Mmm.

575
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,899
So how's it going?

576
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,899
You coming up with anything
for the big case?

577
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,866
Nah, not yet.

578
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,666
Maybe we should pool
our resources.

579
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,332
I have a few things.

580
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,733
They might sound better
coming from you.

581
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:24,432
No, I... I think they'll sound
great coming from you.

582
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,432
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

583
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,799
We're all thinking it.

584
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,399
There's obviously
more going on here,

585
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,999
and none of us want
to get caught

586
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,432
in another Chuck Rhoades web.

587
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,099
No idea what
you're talking about.

588
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,566
Here's how I see it, though.

589
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,566
Whoever comes up
with this impossible case

590
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,165
is in the lead for Head of Crim.

591
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,966
Counterpoint... whoever comes up
with this impossible case

592
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:46,432
is then going to have to win
said impossible case.

593
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,666
And then if they don't,
they're fucked.

594
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,132
That's what Connerty thinks.

595
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,265
And that's why
I'm not in his office.

596
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,699
Is that what Connerty thinks,

597
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,099
or is that what
he wants you to think?

598
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,432
I'm hearing
that multiple former AUSAs

599
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,566
are gonna come forward
against you.

600
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,232
Fuck.
Who?

601
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,432
No names yet.

602
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,532
The claim is that
you were capricious,

603
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:10,065
that, uh, you expected them
to use intimidation

604
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,199
to get settlements.

605
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,599
Oh, bullshit.

606
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,366
Well, this gives the case teeth.

607
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,899
There's no way a judge
is gonna throw it out now.

608
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,766
As your lawyer,
I gotta advise you

609
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,699
to consider the idea
of a settlement.

610
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,065
No.
I won't settle.

611
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,733
Can't.

612
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:27,065
No, any appearance of guilt
puts everything at risk.

613
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:29,265
Every conviction
my office has ever made

614
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:30,733
would be in question.
No.

615
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,933
Well, you can't afford
to think in absolutes.

616
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,065
I'm gonna fight this
all the way to a trial

617
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,066
if it comes to it.

618
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,666
Buddy, you gotta understand.

619
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,632
One hundred and twenty seven
cases, if you're found liable

620
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:43,099
even for a portion of them,
it could bankrupt you.

621
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,432
So if this gets sticky,

622
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,599
how big is your trust,
how bulletproof is it?

623
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,399
You might...
You might want to think

624
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,999
about going offshore with it.
No.

625
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,165
It's a blind trust,
and I made a public vow.

626
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,165
I can't touch the money
or direct it

627
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,632
as long as I'm in office.

628
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,966
Well, there's one good thing
about getting fired.

629
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,265
Boy, it's much better
to be the lawyer...

630
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:07,032
and go home when the hour's up,
get some sleep.

631
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,066
If you're the client,
you're up all night.

632
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,199
Aha, ah.

633
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,366
I was wondering why
we were at a four-top.

634
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,866
Taiga.
I met her at SoulCycle.

635
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,532
She brought
a friend for you, too.

636
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,599
No, no, I told you.
Just give it a chance.

637
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,032
She's great.
She's an artist.

638
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:25,532
She's got a new show in Soho,
in Queens.

639
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,432
Actually Hoboken.
Whatever. She's cool.

640
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,733
Hey, babe.
Hi.

641
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,733
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

642
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:33,966
Hi. Ira.
Nicole.

643
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:34,967
- Charmed.
- Taiga.

644
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:36,632
Nice to meet you.

645
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,933
So you have to try
the Green Dream.

646
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:41,632
The mixologist here
makes them with Ice Juice.

647
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:44,232
It's this new cold-pressed
raw juice bar.

648
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,899
It's literally the best thing
in the world.

649
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,466
The guy who owns that company
is a client of mine.

650
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,467
I'll slide you guys
some gift cards.

651
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,399
Anata-Tek had a brutal
sell-off after hours.

652
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,065
We covered.
Short it again.

653
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:01,132
If it cracked this much from
just a tweet, they're terrified.

654
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,599
We can break the rest of it
if we throw a rock.

655
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Okay.

656
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,866
And wait for
the dead-cat bounce.

657
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,899
As soon as the stock's
up one percent,

658
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,265
start whacking bids again.

659
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,466
It'll dump, maybe by half.

660
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,999
All right.

661
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:17,266
Where's Wags?

662
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,467
He's here.

663
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,432
Continue.
I want Wags to hear this.

664
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,499
The Krakow play,
your hostility toward him,

665
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,065
what's really animating it?

666
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,699
Is it coloring your strategy?

667
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,466
Perhaps if you show restraint...

668
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,466
Restraint?
Take a good look at the floor,

669
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,632
because you don't know where the
fuck you're standing right now.

670
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,733
- It's in my purview...
- You are here

671
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,399
to keep the Visigoths
outside of the city walls,

672
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,399
not to impugn judgment
of the Caesar.

673
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,632
No, it's a smart question.

674
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,866
Krakow knows
your personal animus.

675
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,933
He could be counting on a
certain hasty economic response.

676
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:05,066
It could be a trap.

677
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,599
Inform Mafee.

678
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,133
Hold on Anata-Tek until
we've heard from Dollar Bill.

679
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,099
I usually depend on you

680
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,366
to know what's in my heart,
Wags.

681
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,266
You okay?

682
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,165
Never better.

683
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,699
Good, 'cause there's
something I need you on.

684
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,466
I need to diversify.

685
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:37,466
I'm not talking
about portfolios.

686
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:40,432
I want to make a fundamental
change in our standing.

687
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,299
We can't live inside
those city walls forever.

688
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,966
Change is coming.

689
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,833
Stay ahead of it.

690
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,799
Start looking.

691
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:57,299
I can't help feeling
these ideas are uninspired.

692
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,967
What else do you have?

693
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,399
We go after tech companies,
the media darlings,

694
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,933
the "don't be evil" crowd.

695
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,165
They're hypocrites,
dodging billions in taxes.

696
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:12,232
No.
Think smarter, bigger.

697
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,733
I need a narrative,
victims and villains.

698
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,999
What if we went
after Spartan-Ives?

699
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,766
That's as big as it gets.

700
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,466
No, thank you.

701
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:23,466
That place is a finishing school
for treasury secretaries.

702
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,799
And we muck in there
and step wrong,

703
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,599
we'll all be shaking cups
outside of the Bar Association.

704
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,632
He's right. That's exactly
the opposite of what we need.

705
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,766
Look, I get it.
I get it.

706
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:44,866
We've all been bred
in a culture of perfection.

707
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,999
Valedictorian, Phi Beta Kappa,

708
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,999
Head of Crim.

709
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,165
You ever get a "B," Kate?

710
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:56,499
Third grade, in Art.

711
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,966
- I did extra credit, got it up.
- Yeah.

712
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:03,132
Nobody wants to gamble on this,
get yoked to a loser.

713
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,599
But you need to understand
it is not a gamble,

714
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,165
it is a calculated risk.

715
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:12,733
So go naked into the street

716
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:17,100
and snare me a thundering,
monumental fucking case...

717
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:21,265
...because none of you
are gonna get what you want

718
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,000
until you cut yourselves open.

719
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:45,332
What's going on, Bryan?

720
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,165
I think we're doing our best
with what we've been given.

721
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:51,199
Well, seems to me
you're a step slow.

722
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,332
It's a big challenge,

723
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,132
an expansion
of our moral mission.

724
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,799
Normally, I'd expect you'd tear

725
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,532
into a piece of red meat
like that.

726
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:59,799
It just takes time.

727
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,799
I'll have something by tomorrow.

728
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,000
By end of day today.

729
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,566
Right.
You're in D.C. tomorrow.

730
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:21,232
Hey.

731
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,766
If you don't want to work
together on this thing, great.

732
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:26,065
Do not steamroll
my idea before I...

733
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,166
That was me doing you a favor.

734
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,299
The Spartan idea was a loser

735
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,099
because of what Chuck's
not saying.

736
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,699
I'm listening.

737
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,299
Spartan-Ives is a friend
to the administration.

738
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,165
Lawrence Boyd and the A.G. went
to fucking Horace Mann together.

739
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,799
- So what Chuck's looking for...
- Is an enemy.

740
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,299
He wants to bring him a trophy.

741
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,632
I've got one.

742
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,699
Executive e-mails
leaked by a whistle-blower.

743
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,400
This is the case
that he's looking for.

744
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,600
Well, why don't you give it
to Chuck yourself?

745
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,065
Might sound better
coming from you.

746
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,399
Hmm.
Well, you really do think

747
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,232
that finding the best case
would be a trap.

748
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,566
But if you're wrong,
you don't want to risk

749
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,933
Connerty bringing it in
and getting the credit.

750
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:25,399
Maybe.

751
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,132
But this could be
very good... for you.

752
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:33,833
Or very bad.

753
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,833
I don't care.

754
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,265
I'll give it to Chuck anyway

755
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,099
because it's the right thing
to do.

756
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,799
It's what Chuck wants.

757
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,433
It doesn't make it right.

758
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:54,265
All right, let's take a break.

759
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,532
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

760
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:01,032
About your next chapter.

761
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,866
I think we should start
something... a business.

762
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:06,399
Interesting.

763
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,766
What did you have in mind?

764
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,499
I don't know.

765
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,233
It should be unique, you know,
something that fits us.

766
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,799
Nothing in the warehouse,
nothing in the truck.

767
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,232
It's a quiet racket.

768
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,299
I can get you more dirt
if you need it.

769
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,733
Whole Chinese economy
works like this.

770
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,666
So my guy likes
to get his beak wet...

771
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,733
Let's stay on point.

772
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:31,666
Anata-Tek is a company
with no tech.

773
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,899
Just as Taylor anticipated.

774
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,399
She spotted that
from outer space?

775
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,466
Not she. They.

776
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:49,767
Get it hard,
keep it hard, use it!

777
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,032
He hasn't fucked his woman
in six months.

778
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,699
Should you...
be sharing that?

779
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,366
Not in the "should" game.

780
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,799
Welcome aboard, Gus.
Thanks.

781
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,299
I know it was your plug
that got this done for me,

782
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,466
and I have an elephant dick
of a memory.

783
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,366
So when are you coming in
for a session?

784
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,966
You want to go now?

785
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:12,466
I'm not under the same mandate
as the other staff.

786
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,899
You sure?

787
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,899
Lot of changes around here.

788
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,099
More out there.

789
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,399
It'll hit ya.

790
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,399
Guys like you and me,
we're getting older.

791
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,899
We got to fight for every scrap

792
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,466
of what used to be ours
by right.

793
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,632
No.

794
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:29,132
Then let me buy you a steak.

795
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,900
Not necessary.

796
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:37,734
Omakase menu at Nakazowa.

797
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,632
You are good.

798
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,999
Have you talked
to the source of the e-mails?

799
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,232
An hour ago.

800
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,933
Said it's even worse
than what's there.

801
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,933
CEO Kurt Williams knew about it,

802
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,599
could have stopped it,
directed it to continue.

803
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,599
Well, that'll be
he said, she said.

804
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,599
Now, this case is far
from showroom ready,

805
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,933
but it's a real start.

806
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:00,866
- Subpoena the company documents.
- Right away.

807
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,734
Ace work.

808
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,099
Mr. Rhoades, if you're looking
for a good whiskey bar

809
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,899
near the A.G.'s office,
I got one.

810
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,032
Opens early.
Not necessary.

811
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,532
I just need you to loop me in
with the new deputy.

812
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,566
I will happily connect you
to Fred Reyes.

813
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,567
That would mean...

814
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:18,899
That I have something

815
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,432
the General would want
to hear about.

816
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,099
...that my part in this is done.

817
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,632
Don't worry.
Reyes knows who juiced him in.

818
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,265
Adam.

819
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,165
Fred, I got Chuck Rhoades
on the line.

820
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,265
Chuck.

821
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,065
Thanks for the good word.
I appreciate you putting me up.

822
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,499
Well, I'm looking forward

823
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,466
to a harmonious relationship
going forward.

824
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,566
- Chuck, about tomorrow, it...
- No worries.

825
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,065
I just want to make sure
that the A.G. knows

826
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:46,065
that I'm preparing an action
against retail giant GoodStop.

827
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:47,332
They've bilked employees

828
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,933
out of millions
in unpaid overtime

829
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,299
and engaged in a cover-up
at the highest level.

830
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,566
- And you can prove that?
- Evidence in hand.

831
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:54,999
It's early stages,

832
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,866
but, uh, Kurt Williams
is swimming in a dirty pool.

833
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,499
The same Kurt Williams
anonymously funding

834
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,866
a super PAC
ripping her a new asshole?

835
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:05,466
Well, that's an incredible
coincidence, Chuck.

836
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,966
The A.G.'s wanted
to take them down for years.

837
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,432
Let me sell her on it.

838
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,899
I think she's gonna let you
bring it home.

839
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,467
Much appreciated.

840
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,132
Anata-Tek is bleeding out.

841
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:21,366
Lost half its value.
Krakow fired the CEO.

842
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,933
Do you want to make a statement?

843
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:25,366
No.
I've said enough.

844
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,899
Congratulations
on rooting this out.

845
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,232
A very good day for us.

846
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:31,933
Thank you for backing the idea.

847
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:35,666
It really means a lot.
What do you care?

848
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,733
I know you already
turned down a job here.

849
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:39,499
There's nothing
on the line for you,

850
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,833
so what do you care?

851
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,265
I just like being right.

852
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:44,999
No.

853
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,766
There's something else.

854
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,100
You were testing me,
and you still are.

855
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,399
You wanted to know
if I could see you,

856
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,933
behind Mafee, see what you saw.

857
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:04,265
I wanted to know
if you're as good as they say.

858
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,599
I am.
So why are you leaving?

859
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,866
I just wanted a moment with you.

860
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:12,533
Best advice you'll get.
Don't settle for just one.

861
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,432
Seven fifty a year.

862
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,499
That's double entry level
for an analyst.

863
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,165
I'm getting my MBA in Chicago

864
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,099
under Eugene Fama,
the Nobel Laureate.

865
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,466
Come on.
Fama's an egghead.

866
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,799
Get an education right here.
Make it a million a year.

867
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,632
What?

868
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:32,265
Three seventy-five
or 750 or a million,
it's all the same to you?

869
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,000
It's an abstraction?

870
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,299
I don't know
if you can understand...

871
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,999
maybe me being the way I am,

872
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,566
but just breathing the air here
can be discomforting.

873
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:48,800
The air is thinner.

874
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,299
Nah.

875
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,966
You don't belong here.

876
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,499
You're outside it all.

877
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,265
Sometimes you catch yourself
watching all the people

878
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:04,099
like they're another species.

879
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,265
So you retreat...

880
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:10,833
behind your aquarium walls,
watching.

881
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,666
But you don't realize, Taylor,

882
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:17,432
that glass, it's not
a barrier, it's a lens.

883
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,165
It's an asset.
It's what makes you good.

884
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,132
You see things differently.

885
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,166
That's an edge.

886
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,599
What about
a week-to-week deal?

887
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,132
Done.
We'll prorate the million.

888
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,265
Nineteen thousand...

889
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:34,099
Nineteen thousand,
two hundred and thirty
and seventy-seven cents..

890
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,466
Hourly, $240.38.

891
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:36,999
One hundred and fourteen
and forty-seven cents.

892
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,165
Eighty hours a week?

893
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,999
There's 168 hours in a week.

894
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,599
That's what you're paying for...
everything.

895
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,299
Twenty-four seven.

896
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,799
All right, Wags,
call me tomorrow,

897
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,633
and I'll give you the rest.

898
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,699
I think I just found the thing.

899
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,899
- How do you feel about football?
- Which team?

900
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,399
Not sure yet, but a franchise
is talking to bankers

901
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,065
about putting itself
on the block.

902
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:01,899
Good.
Go further.

903
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,767
Nice.

904
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,432
Axe?

905
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:12,799
Can I help you, Todd?

906
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,799
How many hours did you spend
obsessing over my positions?

907
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,499
Ah, it paid for itself.

908
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,332
Or, rather, you paid for it.

909
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,999
You got me, Axe.
You did.

910
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,265
But don't worry.
I'll get you back.

911
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,999
I'm not here for another
recruiting pitch.

912
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,466
From the look in your eyes,
I'd say you have

913
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,332
no real idea why you're here.

914
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,433
I just had to get out
of that office.

915
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,265
Now it's come to this, the one
person I can turn to... you.

916
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,467
That's what the game
does to you.

917
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,800
I'm glad you called.

918
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,733
Nothing's straightforward
anymore.

919
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:07,799
It's barely recognizable.

920
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,165
When I was in your class
in law school,

921
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,065
we didn't exactly cover...

922
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:14,165
- The vagaries?
- Right.

923
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,899
What was I going to say,
"When you leave these walls,

924
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,933
none of what you do
will even resemble

925
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:20,799
the ideals discussed
in this building,

926
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,934
what is so cleanly laid out
in the books"?

927
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:29,934
When I look around the office,
I do not see friends.

928
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,766
There was a-a woman...

929
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,799
a colleague.

930
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,866
Something good was starting.

931
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,766
But, uh, she saw me
for what I was,

932
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:44,866
what I was becoming,
and then it was over.

933
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:48,199
To think that real
relationships are possible

934
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,366
in such a cauldron.

935
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,432
I didn't count on that.

936
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,366
But I guess

937
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:57,065
I did count on a shared mission.

938
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:00,632
Yet you stay.
Yet you're loyal to Rhoades.

939
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,833
I can't claim
the moral high ground anymore.

940
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,632
The Crim job.

941
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,733
If I'm this conflicted now...

942
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,799
There's never been
a leader of any merit

943
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,999
who was free of those doubts.

944
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,132
But you can't stop now.

945
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:17,232
You need to feel what it will
be like to sit in that office,

946
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:20,232
to be the one
making the decision.

947
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,399
And to resolve
those conflicts...

948
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,233
both the ones in the office
and inside yourself.

949
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:31,266
Yeah, maybe I'll ride it out
long enough to see.

950
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,299
Mmm.

951
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,666
speaking Japanese

952
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,766
speaking Japanese

953
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,632
No fucking way he gets that job.

954
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:50,666
'Cause he can't do that job!

955
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,499
- He's a piker...
- Fucking cellphones.

956
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,632
...trying to swim laps...

957
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,999
In this temple.

958
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,799
You don't put ginger
on the fish.

959
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,499
It's to clear the palate between
pieces, not drown it out.

960
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,899
And it is already
precisely sauced.

961
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,599
Doesn't need a soy bath.

962
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,432
Chill out, Mr. Miyagi.

963
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,666
No.

964
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,899
I won't, you fucking heathens.

965
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,432
This man is an artist.

966
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:34,766
He had to spend ten years
learning how to make the tamago.

967
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:37,666
The egg.
The egg!

968
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:40,199
Your expense accounts
don't entitle you

969
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,366
to fuck his art up the ass!

970
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:43,766
Dude, that's it.

971
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:45,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, settle.

972
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:47,699
- Settle, Wags.
- Fuck, hold up.

973
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,099
It's Mike Wagner.

974
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,867
Axe Capital.

975
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:56,533
Apologies for the disrespect.

976
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,599
speaking Japanese

977
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,734
speaking Japanese Hai.

978
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,099
Sorry you saw that.

979
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,899
It was a bit too revealing.

980
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,566
Yeah, it was.

981
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,599
I loved it.

982
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,799
That is passion, man.

983
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,132
When are you and I gonna go
a few rounds, huh?

984
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:27,165
Let me tell you an open secret.

985
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,799
These traders I jack up all day,

986
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,599
they are middle-school
children.

987
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,766
You, you are Mike Wagner.

988
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:40,332
But you need to ask yourself
where are you at right now?

989
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,632
What's churning
those waters up so much

990
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,100
that a little cub like that
can break the levee?

991
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:59,165
Things can't be that bad
for you here

992
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:02,432
if you still have the A.G.'s
picture on your wall.

993
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:06,599
Dad, uh...

994
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,099
about Wendy and me.

995
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,599
You thought you could
keep it from me.

996
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,866
Nah.

997
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:15,232
These things have a way of
floating up out of the murk.

998
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,466
Our separation
is about needing space.

999
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:24,733
And I think that extends to you.

1000
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:26,132
So I have to ask you...

1001
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:29,432
I have something for you.

1002
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,733
It occurred to me
that your problem is money.

1003
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:33,232
- Always has been.
- I disagree.

1004
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,599
She has more money than you,

1005
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,899
and that's outside
the natural order of things.

1006
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,966
But it's only because
everything you have

1007
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:41,632
is bound up in this silly trust,
and you can't use it.

1008
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:43,899
You're effectively a cripple.

1009
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,733
I'm rewarded
by a different metric.

1010
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:47,299
But I have a solution.

1011
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,866
A signature from me
as your trustee,

1012
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,466
and it goes where we need.

1013
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:55,433
You didn't.

1014
00:47:58,133 --> 00:48:00,733
I bought a ring.

1015
00:48:00,734 --> 00:48:02,299
We're in my office.

1016
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,866
It's not a gift from me.

1017
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:06,899
I bought it with your money.

1018
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,532
Give it to Wendy.

1019
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:15,866
Show her you're serious...

1020
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:18,032
- ...about maintaining the union.
- No.

1021
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,733
No. That's not a move.
That's not who she is.

1022
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,799
It's a six-figure ring, son.
It's who they all are.

1023
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,299
What time does your thing start?

1024
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,299
- Stuckey Brown told me...
- Stuckey Brown.

1025
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,599
...he once had a woman
upstairs in his bed...

1026
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,232
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,399
...when he heard his wife
walk in the front hall.

1028
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,899
Uh, Dad, I need to, uh...

1029
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,265
So Stuckey called down to her,
he said, "Elizabeth,

1030
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:43,666
if you don't put
one foot on the stairs,

1031
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,566
I'll wire two million dollars
to your account."

1032
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,065
- Uh-huh.
- And what did she do?

1033
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:50,599
She walked right back
out the front door.

1034
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,265
Take the ring.

1035
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,433
It's a balm, it's a way...

1036
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,699
Thank you, Dad.

1037
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,899
I appreciate the gesture.
I do.

1038
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,866
But, uh...

1039
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:08,532
And I'm sorry that I kept
our situation from you.

1040
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,733
I know it hurt your feelings.

1041
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:15,065
- No, I'm fine.
- But I cannot accept the ring.

1042
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:17,899
I cannot invade my trust
in any way,

1043
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,866
in this life or the next.

1044
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:23,699
It would be... unethical.

1045
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,299
You have to take it back.

1046
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,866
You're talking like a man
with a terminal disease.

1047
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,366
Have a good time at the show.

1048
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,632
You make sure that he gets
to his car.

1049
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,999
Yeah, talk to me, Fred.

1050
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,332
I underestimated this, Chuck.

1051
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,132
The General is not looking
for pelts.

1052
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:46,566
She said that Kurt Williams
would be a huge case

1053
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,099
for whoever takes over
your office next.

1054
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,666
Understood.

1055
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:53,899
See you tomorrow.

1056
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,066
I'm sorry I couldn't do more.

1057
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:15,132
Sorry I had to skip the recital.

1058
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:17,499
It's been a balled-up
kind of a day.

1059
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,666
You don't have to apologize
to me.

1060
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,667
Just your daughter.

1061
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,632
I talked to Oliver Dake.

1062
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:32,632
I didn't have to admit
to anything too damaging.

1063
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,933
But he'll be
on your recusal next,

1064
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:38,467
and... he is not
gonna stop.

1065
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,132
You have that look.

1066
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,166
That bad, huh?

1067
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:01,766
I have this exercise I do
with my clients called the 180.

1068
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,566
When they've really lost
the thread,

1069
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:05,232
when they're so fixated
on a stock,

1070
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:08,132
they can't see it's a dumpster
burning in front of them.

1071
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:11,199
Maybe they can cut their losses.

1072
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,466
But only a great few

1073
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,766
can go the opposite way,
can pivot,

1074
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:18,933
and see
that it's really a short.

1075
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,933
You're a prime candidate for it

1076
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:24,599
because whatever...
choices you've been making,

1077
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,767
they sure as hell
aren't working.

1078
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:40,667
One-eighty, Chuck.

1079
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,699
One-eighty, Chuck.

1080
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,466
What if we went
after Spartan-Ives?

1081
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:30,767
That's as big as it gets.

1082
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:40,799
Ari Spyros.

1083
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,766
There's something I need you
to do for me.

1084
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,966
Kornbluth.

1085
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:48,132
I want to go on record
to say that the SEC

1086
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:53,132
has no plans to investigate
Spartan-Ives or Lawrence Boyd.

1087
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:56,466
I cannot speak for
the United States attorney.

1088
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:58,466
No, I will not confirm that.

1089
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:01,833
Do you deny there's an active
investigation of Lawrence Boyd?

1090
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:04,099
If my office undertook
such a radical endeavor

1091
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,566
against a bedrock company

1092
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:08,065
that has been such a friend
to the administration,

1093
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,566
we would only do so
with the full support

1094
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:12,432
of the Attorney General's
Office.

1095
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:15,766
But, no, I cannot confirm that.

1096
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,232
So you have no comment
on the investigation?

1097

00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:48,599
If I fire you now, it'll look

1109
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,699
like the administration
is protecting Boyd,

1110
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
obstructing justice.

1111
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:53,165
Hmm.

1112
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,666
They might even investigate
you for that, General.

1113
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,966
You think you're a bold player?

1114
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,899
Going after Spartan-Ives
is asinine.

1115
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,599
A man facing a firing squad
has only two choices...

1116
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,332
accept it or push against
his restraints.

1117
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,599
And I don't accept anything.

1118
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,799
You were facing hard labor.

1119
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,399
Now you're in the firing line,

1120
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,299
and you pulled me
right there with you.

1121
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,099
Not so.

1122
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,265
Oh, if I win, Boyd goes down,

1123
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,165
and we celebrate
on the podium together.

1124
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:23,299
If I lose,
the failure is all mine.

1125
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,099
"If Boyd goes down."
You really think it's that easy?

1126
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,900
There's a reason
no one's done this.

1127
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,799
So go ahead and swing
your hatchet at the case.

1128
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,766
I'll just fire you
in a few months

1129
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,432
after the searchlights pass.

1130
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:38,833
All you've bought is time.

1131
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:00,099
I got news last night
I never wanted to get...

1132
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,699
Chuck Rhoades, coming at me.

1133
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,799
I have lived my life
as an exemplar of rectitude

1134
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,466
so as to never have to deal
with this kind of thing.

1135
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:11,566
Still... he comes.

1136
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:14,232
You did what I'm about to.

1137
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:16,733
You squared off with him,
walked away unmarked.

1138
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:19,566
I need your playbook,
I need to know how to beat him.

1139
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,966
Will you help me?

1140
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,065
I don't remember your
reassuring hand on my shoulder

1141
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:28,433
when it was my time of trouble.

1142
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:32,899
What I do remember is you,

1143
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,232
the exemplar
of Wall Street rectitude,

1144
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,165
steering clear
and making damn certain

1145
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:40,366
that my stink didn't waft
anywhere near you,

1146
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:42,600
lest it stick.

1147
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:48,599
Now, before I decide,
answer this.

1148
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,766
Are you a bastard?

1149
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:55,332
Because for you to have
a chance against Rhoades,

1150
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,432
you need to be.

1151
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,666
Even though
there will be lawyers,

1152
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:03,799
there are no fucking rules...
not if you want to win.

1153
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,132
You will have to crawl
through a river of shit

1154
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,666
and risk bleeding out a hundred
yards short of victory.

1155
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,566
You have to be prepared
to do things

1156
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,132
that are entirely
outside the bounds

1157
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,800
of conventional morality.

1158
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,632
What do you imagine I had to do

1159
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:25,233
to get to the top
of Spartan-Ives?

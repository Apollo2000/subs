1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,670
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:08,838
I have the case,
I just don't have the evidence.

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:11,441
- Wrong answer.
- If you ain't got video,

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:12,542
you ain't got shit.

5
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,643
Well, we ain't got video, Oliver.
We got theories.

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,779
I'm granting Mr. Connerty one more week.

7
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,514
At that time,
the prosecution will produce

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,483
evidence compelling
enough to sustain the case.

9
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:22,952
Or I will grant
Mr. Axelrod his dismissal.

10
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,420
<i>We know Axelrod used a doctor</i>

11
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:26,055
<i>to help develop the toxicant.</i>

12
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,191
I told you: I disposed of the slide.

13
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,625
How?

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,493
<i>How?</i>

15
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:31,660
Talk me through it.

16
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:32,962
You have to trust me.

17
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:35,931
One particular fund
made a killing that day.

18
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,934
It's Wendy's. So I get a buddy
of mine who works for the NSA

19
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,202
to find out where she was...

20
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,870
You had the NSA look into Wendy?

21
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,072
<i>- I</i> could end up...
- Jail.

22
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:44,607
But I will not let that happen.

23
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:46,119
If one of us goes to prison, we all do.

24
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:49,077
We are all going to sit here
and calmly discuss how to undo this.

25
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:52,581
Full transparency.

26
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,182
I give you my word.

27
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:56,518
You want transparency?

28
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,024
How fucking clear is this?

29
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,611
I was a bookish kid.

30
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,780
Read a great deal of military fiction.

31
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:28,949
Accounts of great battles. Histories.

32
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,651
That sort of thing.

33
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:34,187
I was fascinated by the paratroopers...
in World War II.

34
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:37,624
And the moment right before they leapt.

35
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,192
The point of no return.

36
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:41,561
That's what they would say, yes.

37
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,929
"No shame in backing out now, son.

38
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,566
It's a suicide mission."

39
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,801
And the young soldiers
would set their jaws,

40
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:51,571
clip onto the static lines and jump.

41
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:54,807
I didn't realize the military
gave them the chance to back out.

42
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:58,144
Fiction. Of course,
despite the sergeant saying

43
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:59,926
there was no shame,
everyone knew there was

44
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:02,748
nothing but shame, so they jumped.

45
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:07,053
And that's where we are.

46
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:11,723
The slide is being planted at
Axelrod's this very instant.

47
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,293
Oh, Jesus.

48
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:16,628
- How? Where?
- As to the how,

49
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:19,164
that involved distraction
of the principal,

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,033
subterfuge, stealth.

51
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,536
The trifecta of chicanery.

52
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:28,272
As to the where:
His refrigerator, of course.

53
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,041
To keep it cold.

54
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:34,045
Tape it to the bottom of a
ketchup bottle or something.

55
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,715
So he won't see it until...

56
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,316
Exactly.

57
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:42,821
Federal agents will burst in while
Axelrod is having dinner with his boys,

58
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,223
and discover the slide.
With that physical evidence,

59
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,725
he will be immediately brought to jail.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,993
The courts will deem him a flight risk,

61
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:54,198
so he will be behind bars for
the duration of his trial.

62
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,337
I almost feel bad.

63
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,539
As do I. Almost.

64
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,111
Are you certain you can
stand up to all this?

65
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,213
That you can swallow framing someone,

66
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:12,750
even if that person is, in fact, guilty?

67
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,584
I can live with it.

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,720
I need to be sure.

69
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:20,056
'Cause we are, as you just said,
at the point of no return.

70
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:22,859
It's no different than
emergency room triage

71
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,327
after a mass casualty event.

72
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:29,266
You save who you can and force the fate
of the rest out of your mind.

73
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,937
I hoped you'd see it that way.

74
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:46,715
So we agree this thing
can never go to trial.

75
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,084
We all know what we're doing?

76
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,718
My number one priority:

77
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,920
Getting Wendy clear
of her short position.

78
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,121
That's my priority too.

79
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,023
I believe you.

80
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,258
But how?

81
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:57,993
Connerty has my trade, from Spyros.

82
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,995
Yeah. And the log with your visit to me.

83
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,998
And he can draw that to look
like many things: co-conspirator

84
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,133
in your scheme... or mine...
chief amongst them.

85
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,702
And nobody will believe
it was a marital tiff,

86
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:09,004
which is what it was.

87
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,772
Oh. You guys fight? Who'd've figured?

88
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,274
Cell phone records

89
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:14,910
will show me calling
Mafee from Chuck's office.

90
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,711
I'll handle that part.

91
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:20,248
I have people who will work to...
massage those records.

92
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,685
My mouth is dry.

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,420
Adrenaline leaving the body, right?

94
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,722
Mm.

95
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:34,762
So should we talk about the part
we've been avoiding in front of her?

96
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,331
You mean who we're dumping this on?

97
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:38,199
That's right. When there's a body,

98
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,935
as the corpus of this juice
company most certainly is,

99
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,070
there has to be a gunman
in the depository window.

100
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,039
Otherwise,
they keep looking for the killer.

101
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,186
Yeah. And there'd need to be
a financial trail laid in,

102
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,675
showing how he profited too.

103
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,378
So that'll be your department.

104
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:54,315
You've proven yourself quite
adept at financial trickitude.

105
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,015
<i>No one's</i> proven that, actually.

106
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,985
Which is all the proof I need
that you can pull this off.

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,389
Well, I imagine I can...

108
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:05,191
But we couldn't have
this going to trial,

109
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:08,895
with this person ending up on the stand
revealing all the holes...

110
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,398
No. He needs to be put in a mortal vise,
so he takes a plea.

111
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,999
That's the only way the pilot light

112
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,934
on Eastern's case can be
snuffed out completely.

113
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,370
This player would need
to be leveraged. Broken...

114
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,939
That's dirty work. You have the stomach?

115
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:23,109
Of a billygoat. When necessary.

116
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,277
For her.

117
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:26,479
For her.

118
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:30,115
You think she can handle framing
someone who didn't do it?

119
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,851
Wendy's got steel in her,

120
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:33,986
but I've never known her
to go that far. No.

121
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,489
So we're either gonna have
to keep it from her or s...

122
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,329
So who's going to be our patsy?

123
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:46,365
Come on, boys,
I think we all know someone

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,901
needs to go down for this.

125
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:54,006
No,

126
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,808
the Fulbright is a capstone,
the Marshall is for real scholars.

127
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,310
Both prestigious, though?

128
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,979
Yeah. Absolutely!

129
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,180
- I'm getting one...
- I'm getting one too.

130
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:07,184
Oh. Well, I'm gonna get
some more ice cream.

131
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,353
Does anybody want some?

132
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:15,460
- FBI!
- Fan out!

133
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,094
Step back. Everyone.

134
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,897
Dr. Gilbert this is a properly
executed search warrant.

135
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,865
- Um...
- Dad? What's going on?

136
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,867
- Why are these men here?
- It's a mistake.

137
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,502
I-I haven't done anything wrong.

138
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:29,140
You sure about that, Doc?
Get after it, people.

139
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:30,374
You've got this backwards.

140
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,043
I've been working with Rhoades...

141
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:33,877
Oh.

142
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,779
Oh. He didn't.

143
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:39,049
- Not the ketchup.
- Oh, my God. Ari!

144
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,332
I guess I'm not the
only one who can triage.

145
00:06:55,367 --> 00:07:00,036
Dr. Gilbert, my name is Chuck Rhoades.

146
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:04,307
I am the United States Attorney
for the Southern District of New York.

147
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:09,846
Are they watching us?

148
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,549
No one is watching.

149
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:17,052
Ah. 'Course not. You would never
let them know you did all this.

150
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,555
Oh, on the contrary, sir.

151
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:23,993
I am here this fine evening
to offer you the chance

152
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:30,199
to admit that you're the one who planned
and executed the Ice Juice sabotage.

153
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:33,835
To avoid the embarrassment
of a public trial.

154
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,973
Avoid embarrassment?

155
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,442
You had me arrested
in front of my children!

156
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,143
And you know I'm innocent.

157
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:44,846
Innocent?

158
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,515
No.

159
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,917
I cannot credit that assertion.

160
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,623
I want my lawyer. I want a trial.

161
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,558
I want to stand up in open court

162
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,359
and tell them exactly what happened.

163
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,061
I will admit to everything I did,

164
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:03,231
just so I can air out
what everyone else did.

165
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,233
What<i> you</i> did.

166
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,969
When your lawyer arrives,
they'll notify me.

167
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:13,241
But... if I escort him in here,

168
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,375
the FBI comes along.

169
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,278
And they won't be interested
in your fanciful stories.

170
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:22,049
Only in the physical evidence
they found in your refrigerator.

171
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,618
And the profits you
made around Ice Juice.

172
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,924
I didn't make any 'profits'.
And I still want a lawyer.

173
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,092
Think.

174
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,299
I'm going to step out
for a cup of coffee. Huh?

175
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,369
Why's it always a cup of coffee?

176
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,604
Car salesman pretends to get coffee.

177
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,674
Cops on TV.

178
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,042
You.

179
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:52,645
Well, it goes down easier than hemlock.

180
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,020
There are few days such as this, huh?

181
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:04,557
It's like when the custom cutters
show up at grandpa's farm.

182
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,559
It's a true day of reckoning.

183
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:11,297
Circled on the calendar for a year
and your crops better be ready.

184
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,634
You've had your week to prepare,
Mr. Connerty.

185
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,504
Begin.

186
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,172
I'm happy to
report there's new evidence,

187
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,574
there are theories on the crime

188
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,644
and the larger picture
has come into view...

189
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,445
<i>Status?</i>

190
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,214
We've run into an impediment.

191
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,516
What kind?

192
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,418
Cyber. OneSky Wireless.

193
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,186
Wendy Rhoades's cell provider...

194
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:37,522
And we are currently unable
to hack it and manipulate

195
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,491
call records related to the short.

196
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:40,691
Time frame?

197
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,127
Eight to ten days.

198
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:43,694
Too long.

199
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,531
I pay you to accomplish
tasks in the window required.

200
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:53,403
This entire thing is a
wide ranging conspiracy.

201
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,106
"Conspiracy"?

202
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,607
That's a four syllable word

203
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,976
which means you'd better
be able to prove it.

204
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:01,646
Respectfully, Your Honor.
The only conspiracy here

205
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:05,149
is the daft one my opposing
counsel is engaging in.

206
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,483
Though, in fairness to him,

207
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,986
it might be more of a complex delusion.

208
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,288
Respectfully,
the pathetic delusion here is that

209
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,590
your client might avoid trial,
much less prison.

210
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,026
Well, one thing is absolutely clear.

211
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,662
Neither of you know the meaning
of the word respectfully.

212
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,531
The government has had

213
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,200
ample time to present...
not even evidence,

214
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,335
but the evidence that
there is evidence...

215
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:26,736
and they have not done so.

216
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:29,739
If there was a conspiracy,
someone else is behind it.

217
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:33,176
There are witnesses who
have described a bald man,

218
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:34,744
with a goatee, dressed in black.

219
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,513
This is a smokescreen,
designed to distract the court

220
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,183
from the real villain in this matter,
now as always,

221
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,218
Bobby Axelrod.

222
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,472
Have you given much thought
to the nature of guilt.

223
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,577
- Where's my attorney?
- En route.

224
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:11,213
Guilt is tricky, isn't it?

225
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:13,348
You know more about that than I do.

226
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,617
And you're guiltier, too.

227
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,786
Oh, no. That is a question of fact.

228
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:22,657
But guilt is also a state of mind.

229
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:29,431
Some of our greatest works of literature
probe this very issue. What is guilt?

230
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:32,166
Who should be punished, for what?

231
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:36,670
What is the cost...
the grinding, wearing, price...

232
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:42,643
of carrying internal culpability
even while escaping external blame...

233
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:47,181
And often as not, right
at the very center of the question,

234
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:51,552
stands a great man who has transgressed.

235
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,420
But I haven't.

236
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:55,856
And you are the one person who knows,

237
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:59,727
with absolute certainty,
that I am not guilty.

238
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:03,597
Oh, I'm not sure what you say is true,

239
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,599
if we go deeper than just facts.

240
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,334
In a criminal proceeding,

241
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,703
facts are the thing.

242
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:16,342
I'm gonna stop talking
until my guy is in the room.

243
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:18,611
Yeah. I'd do the same in your seat.

244
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,609
But facts are merely a place to start.

245
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,146
No, we're past them, you and I.

246
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,683
After all, I once, quite recently,

247
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:01,620
gave you the chance to
affirm that facts alone...

248
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,888
like who actually had the slide,

249
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:07,292
like actual proof against
Axelrod being manufactured...

250
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,227
don't matter

251
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,463
when true guilt is on the line.

252
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,872
And now I'm giving you another chance,

253
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:24,943
to remember who you are,

254
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:28,178
to examine your own complicity,

255
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:32,817
your willingness to
take another's freedom.

256
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:37,955
Axelrod did the thing.

257
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,358
You aided in it.

258
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,960
You used your skills
and abilities to help him

259
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,695
at one point,
and then against him at another,

260
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,297
when that suited you.

261
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,368
And you jumped at the chance
to torpedo his life to save your own.

262
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:55,438
What does that say about you?

263
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:59,476
What does that say about
your own need to atone?

264
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,813
I'll atone on my own time.

265
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,215
Now, why on earth
would you atone for anything

266
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:08,518
when you're an innocent man.

267
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:10,587
I'll take a moment with my client.

268
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,133
_

269
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:39,681
You lost there, pal?

270
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,684
You've become quite the bluenoser,
haven't you.

271
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
Well, I'm guessing
you're not here looking for

272
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,722
the nearest Timmie Ho-Ho's.

273
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:51,359
The team's coming up short.

274
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,296
They can't hack into
Wendy's wireless carrier.

275
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:57,032
They say the cyber defense is
too tough for the time frame.

276
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,667
Well, they're who I would use...

277
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:02,270
and they do know that when
you can't hack a system,

278
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:03,571
you've got to hack a person.

279
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:06,507
Should I tell them to do that?

280
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:10,778
They're so young and spry,
it's possible they'll leave

281
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:13,948
a lot of broken pieces on
the floor when they're done.

282
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,951
Well, then I'm gonna
need you to suit up.

283
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,659
What happened?

284
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:27,461
He came to me.

285
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,515
Called me in actually.

286
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:35,002
Karl. Come in.

287
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:37,338
<i>What was he looking for?</i>

288
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:39,840
Thanks for, uh, crossing the river.

289
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,309
Ah, West Highland single malt.

290
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:45,078
Fourteen years old.

291
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:48,648
When old colleagues...
friends... get together,

292
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:50,550
why not?

293
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:56,022
So, how are you finding Southern?

294
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,859
It's a spinning top.
And it spins just my speed.

295
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:03,329
Glad to hear it.

296
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,832
Is Chuck a facet of your day to day?

297
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:11,537
We've been known to rub
elbows around the bubbler.

298
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:16,500
Pure velvet.

299
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:19,041
You know what?

300
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,499
Take the bottle with you
when we're done.

301
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,749
Warm up your temporary quarters.

302
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,917
Beware of US Attorneys bearing gifts.

303
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,124
What do you want, Oliver?

304
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,500
I'll... I'll put it plainly.

305
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,633
I'm worried Connerty is
going to cough this thing up.

306
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,168
And it's going to splatter on me.

307
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,570
I'm wondering if Chuck
might be working angles

308
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,572
on his own, to help?

309
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,642
Or only to help himself...

310
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,745
Then you should ask him.

311
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,881
I'm asking you, Karl.

312
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,418
Because you're the
one I got the job for.

313
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,453
You're the one I had the deal with...

314
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,789
that at the right moment
you would be there for me,

315
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,159
telling me what was
going on from the inside.

316
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,094
This is that moment.

317
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,965
Well...

318
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,801
Are you backing Chuck
Rhoades instead of me?

319
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,871
Whoa, what a thing to say.

320
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,575
Look, Chuck Rhoades had to
know this deal between us

321
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,477
was a possibility when
he took me on board.

322
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,680
So maybe that's why he's being cagey.

323
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,585
Or maybe there's nothing going on.

324
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,121
Either way, I'll keep you posted.

325
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,959
Thanks for the hooch.

326
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,201
There are too few old-line
professionals in the field

327
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:57,707
these days who recognize
nuanced shifts in loyalty.

328
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:01,911
When I meet one,
it is an honor to imbibe with them.

329
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,917
<i>Ok, let's say there are indeed
other bad actors involved.</i>

330
00:18:08,952 --> 00:18:10,668
In fact, I intend to prove there are.

331
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:13,989
Accomplices, medical experts,
bag men... these people

332
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:17,126
don't exonerate Axelrod,
as opposing counsel suggests,

333
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:20,129
but they further show
how Axelrod did what he did.

334
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,264
And they show
that this wasn't just a case

335
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,866
of a rogue billionaire
acting out of spite,

336
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:28,503
but one who was very much
like a bull in a ring,

337
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:32,540
using or enriching an
equally dangerous figure,

338
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,542
the wife of one who sits high atop

339
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,745
the federal power structure
in the government,

340
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,880
and a major investor in the company.

341
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,915
And I intend to explode
the whole thing...

342
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,518
Just a minute! This isn't the Politburo,

343
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,854
you can't just slander your neighbors
to get ahead in the bread line...

344
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,923
Whoa! I invited you to my
home for a nice dinner,

345
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:53,093
you people are trying to turn it into
the<i> Animal House</i> toga party.

346
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:56,130
Chambers. Now.

347
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,901
There are limits to what I will tolerate
in all areas of my life.

348
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,637
For instance, I'm fine
with slightly undercooked pasta.

349
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:06,740
But overcook it,
and we are no longer eating together.

350
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,909
I see it exactly the same way.

351
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,911
I also don't like brown nosing,
Mr. Bach.

352
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,180
Mr. Connerty, it seemed
as though you were about

353
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:16,316
to detonate a bomb in my courtroom
without regard for casualties.

354
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,850
Instead, do it in here.

355
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:19,164
If you'd have given me a little leeway,

356
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,758
you'd have heard that my
case isn't overcooked at all.

357
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,757
It's Al dente.

358
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:25,992
To the tooth...

359
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:28,061
My last name's DeGiulio,
I know the phrase.

360
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:31,630
Throw what you got against the fridge,
let's see if it sticks.

361
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,266
- You're thinking of flax.
- Hemp protein is out now...

362
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:36,335
Mafee. What do you have there?

363
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,338
These are açai bowls.
They taste like dessert

364
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:41,574
- but they're filled...
- I asked Mafee.

365
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:45,078
Oh. Right.

366
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,613
I'll finish at my desk.

367
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,684
Supposed to be healthy.

368
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,085
I gotta start watching it now,

369
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,087
I'm not a 20 year old laxer anymore...

370
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:58,324
Lacrosse... right.

371
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,226
I had football in my head somehow.

372
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,994
No. Lax. Want some?

373
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,231
Uh, maybe later. Good for you though.

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,101
Taking the next step in your growth.

375
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,103
Making a commitment to a healthy future.

376
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,604
Even if it's the hard thing.

377
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,482
Absolutely.

378
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:16,708
I'd like to think that I can
count on that commitment.

379
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,210
You can. You totally can.

380
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:21,646
Even if it's hard.
Even if it costs you something.

381
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:25,983
- Yeah?
- Yeah, well, you know,

382
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,219
real commitment isn't just açai bowls.

383
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,054
It's a lot murkier.

384
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:36,193
Would you get into the murk, the muck?

385
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:39,096
For the firm? For me?

386
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,297
For your co-workers.

387
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,366
Would you back them, all the way?

388
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:48,806
I'm sorry, are we talking a hypothetical
or something specific?

389
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:50,875
I mean, you know
I'd kill myself for the job.

390
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,777
That I'll do anything that's expected.

391
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:53,943
Mm.

392
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,747
But if you need me to do something...

393
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:03,052
beyond the scope of trading
or whatever, well...

394
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:04,788
Don't sweat it, Mafee.

395
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:08,158
We're all good.

396
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,660
Enjoy your wholesome and healthy snack.

397
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:28,711
A while back... you told me
I no longer had a feel

398
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,813
for all the personalities in here.

399
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:33,182
I'm sure when you first
started the place you knew

400
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:35,050
- everyone's spouse's name.
- Yeah.

401
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,453
And what sports the guys
played in high school.

402
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:40,222
There's no way you can anymore.
The place is too big.

403
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,958
And you're long past really caring.
If you ever did.

404
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,359
That's true.

405
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:46,761
- But you...
- Yes.

406
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:48,430
I "care."

407
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,199
I can see that.

408
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,167
Especially for some of them.

409
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:54,002
Like Mafee.

410
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,938
You and he seem to have a special bond.

411
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:59,007
He brought me in, and supported
my vision before even you did.

412
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:01,476
Well, he recognized it.
I kind of took it from there.

413
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,177
You did.

414
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:05,313
But. Mafee?

415
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,482
I need to understand what motivates him,

416
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,951
beyond the money and the trappings.

417
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:12,787
The idea that he's serving
something greater than himself

418
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:14,354
is what drives him. But...

419
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,959
he has an old fashioned sense
of honor, chivalry almost...

420
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:19,861
not in any paternalistic
sense of the word.

421
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,996
He took the fall with his
frat for a hazing incident

422
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,430
even though he wasn't part of it.

423
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,366
Anyway, he'd skirt the line
if he couldn't see

424
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,935
the harm in it, especially if
it benefited the organization

425
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,104
as a whole, but he'd never
do something truly against

426
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:31,438
his sense of wrong and right.

427
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,206
Something that would cause him dishonor.

428
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:35,208
I see.

429
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:38,245
Do you think he'd consider lying
dishonorable by its nature?

430
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,080
It would depend on the situation.

431
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,749
He might lie to protect a friend.

432
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:43,517
Or someone he loved. But that's it.

433
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:46,019
Uh-huh.

434
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,154
Is there something I can help with?

435
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,090
Something I can do...

436
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,260
No.

437
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:54,861
Nothing right now.

438
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:34,900
What the fuck?!

439
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:37,436
Shhh...

440
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,003
No need to upset her.

441
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,475
What is this? What do you want?

442
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:46,210
I want to know the price of a keystroke.

443
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:50,882
You're blackmailing me, over her?

444
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,017
You think my wife gives a shit?

445
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:55,253
Got a different kind
of a relationship, man...

446
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:57,088
Ah.

447
00:23:57,123 --> 00:24:00,925
Well, what makes you think
<i>I</i> give a shit?

448
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,927
I'm not here because of that.

449
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:08,066
I'm here because of
the sixteen celebrities

450
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:13,871
and politicians whose OneSky accounts
you sold access to.

451
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,372
That's a federal offense

452
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:18,075
and you will go to prison for it.

453
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,212
Or...

454
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:41,999
This is like a country song
where the guy drowns his sorrows

455
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,567
in whiskey only you're
using powdered chocolate.

456
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,004
Growing up in Aurora,

457
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,406
for pocket money I used
to shovel driveways.

458
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:53,075
Money was good.
Best part was the hot chocolate.

459
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:55,378
Sometimes, it's still
the only thing that works.

460
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:58,114
I thought you were watching it,
eating clean.

461
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:00,517
I was. Trying.

462
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,885
What drove you to it this time?

463
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,021
Just a feeling.

464
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,990
I guess I was thinking about
how much this job has given me.

465
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,126
Like how I don't have to
worry about pocket money.

466
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,361
Well, you have given to the job also.

467
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:14,997
Yeah. And I'm proud of that.

468
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:17,533
Couple times a year I go
home and see the guys.

469
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,502
This one's got a weed shop,
this one's still doing driveways

470
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:22,538
during the winter...
with a plow truck now,

471
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:25,541
but a shitty one.

472
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:28,276
This one needs a loan.
Shit, they all do.

473
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,311
Which you give them?

474
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:33,048
I do. Because I can.

475
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,983
Sometimes the guys make
jokes about how I earned it.

476
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,985
That at least weed is legal out there.

477
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,921
That what I do is even worse.

478
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,990
But I've always laughed
along because I know

479
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:44,459
I'm not one of the bad ones.

480
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,295
That they're not gonna
hear about me on the news.

481
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,598
That my reputation is good. You know?

482
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,501
Yes. I do.

483
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,575
The Feds interviewed me last week.

484
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,543
So, in the matter of the Ice Juice short

485
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,545
that you booked,
we will need you to stip

486
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:07,347
to Wendy Rhoades calling in the order.

487
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,416
This is the part where you talk.

488
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:11,085
My client prefers not to answer.

489
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,619
I bet he does.

490
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,122
We will subpoena
you to testify in court.

491
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,091
My client will not lie under oath.

492
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:18,325
I'm not a liar.

493
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,693
There you have it.

494
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,463
<i>My lawyer said I shouldn't
talk to anyone about it...</i>

495
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,464
but I just don't know
if I should dive on

496
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,234
a live grenade for this place or not.

497
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:29,502
Would you?

498
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:34,540
It would depend on the
reason and the circumstances.

499
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:37,210
Without knowing the specifics,
and I'm not asking you

500
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,246
to tell me, I cannot give you
a complete answer.

501
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,349
But I can say this: The kid you were,

502
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,084
the one who went out with a shovel

503
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,320
on freezing days while
everyone else slept in,

504
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,621
that kid earned his way here.

505
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:52,492
And will earn his way in this business
whether Axe Cap exists or not.

506
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,293
You really think so?

507
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,562
The individual sacrificing
themself for the whole

508
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:59,632
can be the most
beautiful thing there is.

509
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,636
But not if it's done under
duress or for the wrong reasons.

510
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,204
<i>I don't understand
why you didn't just</i>

511
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,740
put a number in front of Mafee.

512
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:10,109
I felt like trying to
buy him wouldn't work.

513
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:12,410
Make him feel dirty somehow.

514
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:16,114
- And that's a bad thing?
- To him. Yeah. I think.

515
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,715
Then we threaten to fire his ass.

516
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,351
I'd be careful there, Wags.

517
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:22,254
You would. You're a lawyer.
But I'm a ruffian.

518
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,556
I say we let him know:
it's not just Axe Capital,

519
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:26,391
but it's every shop on the Street.

520
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:27,792
You'll be dead man walking.

521
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:30,061
Might actually harden his stance.

522
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,631
Well, we gotta solve this somehow...

523
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:40,470
He papered the trade.

524
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:43,073
The Feds will be questioning him.
If they haven't already.

525
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,708
And once he goes on the record,

526
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:47,611
we're gonna be wrapped up
in a straitjacket on this thing.

527
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:56,319
His unwillingness to lie...

528
00:27:56,354 --> 00:28:00,423
his sense of honor...
his great, big, sweet heart.

529
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,860
All these things that
seem like impediments.

530
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:07,597
We can use them. <i>I</i> can use them.

531
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:08,531
How?

532
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:09,599
He likes me.

533
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,100
We all like you.

534
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,702
No. He<i> likes</i> me.

535
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,470
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

536
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,914
- That tracks.
- It could work.

537
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,406
Oldest trick in the book.

538
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,210
Go to it.

539
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,767
How do you know it's okay?

540
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:49,571
You could be asking about
one of six things. Specify.

541
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,917
All of it. How do you know you
have the right to give advice,

542
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:54,408
to get into the motherboard
and move around the processors.

543
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,811
Wouldn't that render it non-functional?

544
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,913
It's a visual
representation of the idea.

545
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,550
I could say I've trained for it.

546
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:06,387
But you're not asking about my skill.

547
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:08,389
No. I'm asking about your authority.

548
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:09,857
How you give yourself permission?

549
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:11,692
Are you asking about me or you?

550
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:15,262
We all do it. With our assumptions
and our own biases

551
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:18,432
and egos competing with
our desire to do good.

552
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:22,169
But to be frank, I'm asking about you.

553
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,674
As in all things,

554
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,609
I balance the issues in question,

555
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,845
remember my oath, proceed from there.

556
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,547
The doctor's oath. Do no harm.

557
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,283
Three words. And yet.

558
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,785
Almost impossible to put into practice.

559
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:41,254
I need to know what brought this on.

560
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,223
Mafee.

561
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:45,858
Axe was asking about him.
There are meetings going on.

562
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,493
I could see he was in extremis.

563
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,529
Why?

564
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,697
Don't you know?

565
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,432
Why would I?

566
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,867
I assumed he'd talk to you.
Which made me feel good.

567
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,436
It did?

568
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:57,637
Yes.

569
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:58,971
Because I knew, or felt I knew,

570
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,208
that you would only give
him the wisest counsel.

571
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,965
That which would be
in his best interests,

572
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:04,701
both professionally and personally.

573
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,545
As you always do for me...

574
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,315
Yes. Yes, of course.

575
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,515
But he hasn't come to me.

576
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,484
I wonder why that is?

577
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:17,489
I'm sure he has his reasons.

578
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,525
But should he come to me,
that is exactly what I'll do.

579
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,495
Good. That's what I expect you to do.

580
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,397
The right thing.

581
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,938
<i>I got trading records.</i>

582
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:36,440
They'll prove Wendy Rhoades
is a co-conspirator.

583
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:39,810
She was on the Bad News Bears,
playing right alongside her husband.

584
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,980
Bad News Bears are the good guys.

585
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,349
Bad guys were the Yankees.
The rich kids.

586
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,818
I was going for the team image.

587
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,366
Point is: She was in on the
securities fraud scheme.

588
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,690
And she did it with her
husband's help and guidance,

589
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,892
or at least his assent.
Now, their actions

590
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,761
further highlight Axelrod's.

591
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:58,763
Bullshit. There is no way
that you can prove...

592
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:00,646
I have data placing her
in Chuck Rhoades's office,

593
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,801
after he'd heard about
the impending Ice Juice

594
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:05,903
disaster but before she
traded on the stock.

595
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:07,537
What kind of data?

596
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:10,774
Data... I'm in the process
of substantiating.

597
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,610
And I have records proving
she made the call ordering

598
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,812
an allocation while she was standing

599
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,449
in the office of the US Attorney
for the Southern District.

600
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:22,249
That puts both of them in it.
This is wrong, it is criminal,

601
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:25,988
it is relevant to this case,
and I can prove every bit of it...

602
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:40,003
Hi, Mafee.

603
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:43,339
Hey.

604
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:46,642
Nice place.

605
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:48,945
I had a roommate.
But then I started doing well,

606
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,813
so now he's gone...

607
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:52,127
Right.

608
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,685
Do you want a drink or
a snack or something?

609
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:58,974
I'll have what you're having.

610
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:05,093
Let's sit down.

611
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:17,839
Oh, god, here it comes.

612
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:20,475
I'm getting fired, aren't I?

613
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,110
Why do you think that?

614
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:25,813
I knew it when you texted
about coming over.

615
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,648
They think I'm not playing ball,

616
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,550
and they sent you over here to pop me,

617
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:32,854
so there wasn't a scene in the office...

618
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:34,856
That's not why I'm here.

619
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:36,557
Wait, what?

620
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:38,459
I'm not here to fire you.

621
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:40,561
So what's the visit about?

622
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:45,466
You. Me.

623
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,501
The two of us.

624
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:48,402
- Us?
- The truth of us.

625
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,971
Which truth?

626
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:54,508
Well, there can only be
one truth. Right?

627
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:57,044
Absolutely.

628
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:03,717
You've never known me
to try to bend facts,

629
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:07,821
warp them to my needs in
order to benefit, to profit.

630
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,789
No, you're... you're a straight shooter.

631
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:11,791
Which is why it's so ironic

632
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:14,027
they'll be coming after
<i>me</i> for this trade.

633
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,796
You know I was acting on what<i> you</i> said.

634
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:19,065
'Axe never gets a position
of this size wrong.'

635
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,066
You said that.

636
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:22,035
- I did?
- You did.

637
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,404
You may not remember it,
but I do. Clearly.

638
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:26,906
Because it was my only direct trade.

639
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,941
I'd gone to see my husband
when I decided.

640
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:31,511
So it's ironic,
but they're gonna paint it to look like

641
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:35,047
I was engaging in some kind
of conspiracy, cheating...

642
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,160
No fucking way!
That's... that's not how it happened.

643
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,450
<i>We</i> know that.

644
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:44,557
But it doesn't matter.

645
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:48,027
All you can say is that I called you.

646
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,895
Because that's the truth.

647
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:53,198
Your truth.

648
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:58,703
I'll tell them my truth.

649
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,672
It'll be what it'll be...

650
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,976
That's terrible.

651
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:07,645
I could...

652
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:10,514
I don't know...

653
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,817
How bad could it get for you?

654
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,527
No one else at Axe Capital
would ask how it would be for me.

655
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:30,934
That's what makes you
so special, Dudley.

656
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,970
I know you prefer your last name,

657
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,072
but can I call you that?

658
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,177
Now I have to go.

659
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,851
You never answered me.

660
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,185
How bad?

661
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,991
Really, really bad.

662
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,967
<i>What Wendy Rhoades did,
by shorting Ice Juice,</i>

663
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,222
<i>not only
destabilized a failing company</i>

664
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,134
but benefited herself,
and her husband, Chuck Rhoades, too.

665
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,768
Which makes him guilty twice over.

666
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,139
Care to speak to Ms. Rhoades's
part in this, Mr. Bach?

667
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,207
This is all far fetched,

668
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:14,276
it sounds like science fiction to me.

669
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,145
You can really prove this?

670
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,092
My team has pulled the
digital phone records that

671
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,082
will do so. We will have
hard copies and originals

672
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,685
by the time we get to trial.
As well as calling

673
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,755
the executing trader as a witness.

674
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,593
Alright. That's persuasive.
Certainly worthy of a trial.

675
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,897
Let's go back to the big room
and button this motion up.

676
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:39,000
This is why I love being a judge...

677
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,003
You never know the direction
the day is going to turn.

678
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,072
Can you say that from the bench?

679
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:47,842
Why not? So many people complain
about their lot in life,

680
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:50,211
why not celebrate it
every once in a while.

681
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,147
See, the thing is,

682
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:55,784
I was sure this case was
headed for dismissal.

683
00:35:56,402 --> 00:36:00,655
You're not supposed to admit
that you have a feeling, but I did.

684
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:05,759
Now, though, I have an opinion,
which is an entirely different thing.

685
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:10,198
Judges are most definitely supposed
to have opinions. And mine is:

686
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,067
we're going to try this case,
in open court.

687
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:16,937
Let's set a date for trial...

688
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:26,947
Mafee made the call to Wendy.

689
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:28,682
He initiated.

690
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,184
I have something to say.

691
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,319
- I need you to hear it now.
- Alright.

692
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:34,988
<i>Why would he say that?
Why would he do it?</i>

693
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,690
<i>He said that he has feelings for her,</i>

694
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:38,203
<i>and he saw a way to make money for her,</i>

695
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:40,727
- so he did it...
- That's bullshit...

696
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:42,662
Maybe, but I just got the hard copies

697
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:45,232
from the cell phone company
backing up his statement...

698
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:52,739
I am looking at the week of...

699
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:55,108
Judge. Judge DeGiulio.

700
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,877
When a man is
about to give you exactly what

701
00:36:57,912 --> 00:36:59,979
you want, you don't interrupt
his train of thought.

702
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,115
Didn't they teach you that
when you were a line pros?

703
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,851
I have to, Your Honor. Based
on new information I just received,

704
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:07,386
I need to confer with my superiors.
I have to ask

705
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:09,988
for a recess before you
set a date for trial.

706
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:12,391
Well, make it a short one,

707
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:13,825
I already gave you a week.

708
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,628
I want this settled by end of day.

709
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,906
I had to scramble the
jet up here for this.

710
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,340
No need for niceties.

711
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:31,976
Now let's run through it,

712
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:35,112
see how the hell we got here,
who walks and who doesn't...

713
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,320
Yeah. Connerty, the headline is:

714
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:46,090
you're going to have to fold
your hand against Axelrod.

715
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,259
That much is clear. Your case
just fell apart like a cheap bed

716
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:52,128
in a La Grange whorehouse.

717
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:53,897
Fuck... Excuse me.

718
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:56,966
Understandable utterance,
given the circumstances...

719
00:37:57,002 --> 00:38:00,870
Now, Chuck, I don't know how
your wife got into the middle

720
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,707
of all this. But it's a damn
good thing your office isn't

721
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:06,409
prosecuting... otherwise
we'd be tossed for conflict,

722
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:08,278
gross misconduct. You name it.

723
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:11,447
I agree.
She did get in it... innocently,

724
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:14,851
accidentally... but now she's out of it.

725
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:16,886
Yeah. So it appears.

726
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,290
All right. Any way
we can take some scalps?

727
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:22,891
The correct answer to
that query better be

728
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,027
a resounding 'sir, yes, fucking sir.'

729
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:27,797
What about this lovestruck trader,
Mafee?

730
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,998
He's clearly perjured himself.
And is guilty...

731
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:32,267
That's civil, young 'un.
SEC's problem now.

732
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:33,936
They'll hit him with a big fine.

733
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:35,137
As of this moment,

734
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:38,773
we are no longer publicly
tangling with Axelrod anymore.

735
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,809
So Axelrod and his firm get to walk?

736
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:41,944
We can re-file...

737
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,213
No. Let it die, God damn it.

738
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:46,949
SEC again,
they'll slap 'em with a big fine.

739
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:49,251
They'll take it.
That way, when they run us down

740
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,820
for losing the case,
we can at least trumpet that.

741
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:54,956
We do have a guilty party, General.

742
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:59,093
The doctor behind creating or
at least administrating the toxin.

743
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,830
Maybe not the initiator,
but a bad actor all the same.

744
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:03,064
I would like to prosecute.

745
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,233
This doctor may be a little grimy,

746
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,336
but he's no substitute for the
real defendants in this case.

747
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,805
Well, somebody's gotta fry...

748
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:16,844
I'll grant you the latitude, Chuck,
to pursue a case against this doctor.

749
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,446
Now, Mr. Connerty,
as the Axelrod matter is done,

750
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,249
you are free to go back to the barn.

751
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:23,117
Go back to Southern?

752
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,818
Yep. That's the one.

753
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,820
Be good to have you back, Bryan.

754
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:28,822
And great to be back, Chuck.

755
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:30,824
As you've got some
cleaning up to do in court,

756
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,294
you are excused.

757
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,831
I suggest you lead
with a sincere apology

758
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,100
to the good judge for puking in his lap.

759
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:56,283
You nail this sawbones,
Chuck, quick and quiet.

760
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:58,018
You know I will, General.

761
00:39:58,053 --> 00:40:00,520
I'll certainly help any way I can.

762
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,121
Will you now?

763
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:03,890
Well, isn't that just fine...

764
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:07,894
Head on back to the office, get started.

765
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:11,564
Not you, Mr. Dake...

766
00:40:24,312 --> 00:40:28,013
Your Honor. It pains me to say this:

767
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:31,417
Since this morning,
I've learned I had misinformation.

768
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,252
I can no longer prove that

769
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:35,320
which I told you in conference.

770
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:38,557
The facts seem to state
that the trade was

771
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,492
initiated by another party.

772
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:43,361
What<i> can</i> you prove at trial?

773
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:46,465
Nothing on Mr. Axelrod at this time.

774
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,935
The Eastern District...
we're dismissing the indictment.

775
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,342
Quiet! Quiet, quiet, quiet!

776
00:40:57,377 --> 00:41:00,611
Quiet!
See, this is why life on the bench

777
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,481
is so gratifying,
as I was alluding to earlier.

778
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:06,951
Whipsawed this way and that.
Like a tetherball.

779
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,986
This will continue to
go round and round.

780
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:10,988
Even as we withdraw, we will,

781
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,857
<i>I</i> will, continue to investigate.

782
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:14,592
Because this sabotage <i>did</i> happen.

783
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:16,226
The stock<i> was</i> manipulated.

784
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:20,230
And we won't stop until the right man
is brought to justice for it.

785
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, we'll need to
leave that out of the record...

786
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,035
But I look forward to
watching from the bleachers,

787
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,603
because we are done here.

788
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,993
You know, at certain times,
I find myself coming back to

789
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:52,261
<i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</i>

790
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:53,997
I prefer to read.

791
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:56,032
Oh. Not a film fan? That's too bad...

792
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:59,668
As almost everyone else I know did,
I watched it over and over.

793
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:02,271
They used to run it on the<i> 4:30 Movie.</i>

794
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:07,009
There they were at the end,
in Bolivia, wounded,

795
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:10,246
pinned down, but sure
they could shoot their way out

796
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:12,981
of a bad situation as they always had...

797
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:17,318
The only problem was,
they had incomplete information.

798
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,188
They were unaware that the
whole of the Bolivian army

799
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:22,157
had massed outside.

800
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:25,694
But it was that incomplete information

801
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:30,565
that allowed them to run out,
guns blazing,

802
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,601
into what?

803
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:36,438
Their noble deaths...

804
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,706
But you're a medical man.

805
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:43,611
You, more than most,
know that this is a lie.

806
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:49,050
You know the only nobility
is in living another day.

807
00:42:49,085 --> 00:42:55,957
And yet here you are,
holed up, the guns all pointing at you,

808
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:59,093
and with incomplete information.

809
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:03,597
What is that supposed to mean?

810
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:05,466
Yes, you can share what you have now

811
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,302
or force us to file for discovery.

812
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:14,074
I don't... I don't understand...

813
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,211
We've recently came into possession
of your trading records.

814
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,080
Outlining your handsome
eleven million dollar profit

815
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:21,748
on the Ice Juice sabotage.

816
00:43:26,154 --> 00:43:28,088
What the fuck...?

817
00:43:28,123 --> 00:43:29,422
<i>What do you need?</i>

818
00:43:29,457 --> 00:43:31,157
An investor account established,

819
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,760
showing a big short
position in Ice Juice.

820
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:35,661
But dated back before it happened.

821
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,298
Shit. Sounds fun.
What's the name on this account?

822
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:41,634
Ari Gilbert, MD.

823
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,771
Give me a moment.

824
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,740
Not a good idea...

825
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,509
Go...

826
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,721
I see you've stacked it all against me,

827
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:06,258
for some reason,
even though I'm not responsible.

828
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,532
I'm a cancer doctor.

829
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,434
I learned a long time ago
all sorts of folks go down.

830
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,170
All sorts live.

831
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:21,606
It never has anything to do
with who deserves which.

832
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:24,442
Do you allow yourself to judge them?

833
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,377
No.

834
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:29,147
Do you find yourself rooting for some.

835
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:31,549
And caring, a little less,
about certain others.

836
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,617
Yeah. That's only natural.

837
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:37,254
But my treatment of
them does not change.

838
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,791
Except in one case.

839
00:44:44,497 --> 00:44:46,430
This kind man.

840
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:48,399
Donnie Caan.

841
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:51,435
And whether you convinced
yourself that the payoff

842
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,770
you took and devoted
to research in order

843
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,540
to save others was
worth letting him die,

844
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:59,309
you know that <i>this</i> is the moment

845
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:02,245
you deserve to face.

846
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,315
And this is the place you deserve to<i> be.</i>

847
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:10,721
<i>That's</i> what this is<i> all</i> about...
not some slide,

848
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:15,358
not some role you played,
not some money... but<i> justice.</i>

849
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:22,599
You're right.
I did it. I-I let Donnie die.

850
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:25,702
He was a terminal case.
I withheld treatment.

851
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:27,337
To fund my research.

852
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:40,349
I believe you.

853
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:44,253
And I find myself rooting for you.

854
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:47,322
But we both know you belong in jail.

855
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:49,190
Five years.

856
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,626
No trial. Just a plea.

857
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:53,228
I wouldn't even need to
claw back that money,

858
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:57,532
which<i> is</i> in your name and,
I assure you, quite real.

859
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:04,605
I can get your lawyer back
in here and make it official.

860
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:10,511
Mm-hmm.

861
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,721
I-I-I asked you how you

862
00:46:20,757 --> 00:46:24,258
would plant the slide on Axe.

863
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:26,427
But how<i> did</i> you plant it on me?

864
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:48,949
No, Doc.

865
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:52,352
The guilt must be doing
things to your memory.

866
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:56,323
You had it the whole time...

867
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,802
Since you all managed not
to shoot anybody on my raid,

868
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:09,839
I'm buying.

869
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:12,504
And my credit card can
take a lot of punishment,

870
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,573
so get your drink on.
Old Fashioned for me.

871
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:16,475
And whatever these animals are having.

872
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,810
- All right!
- All right!

873
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:19,611
Planning to drink it away?

874
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,480
- 'Cause it doesn't work.
- What's that?

875
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:24,217
Your bleeding conscience
over taking down Dr. Gilbert.

876
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:26,752
Don't worry about my conscience,
it's all stitched up.

877
00:47:26,787 --> 00:47:28,454
- You cool here, Kate?
- Yes. I am.

878
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:31,289
Unless you're going to swing
on me like some Irish punk?

879
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:34,592
Not gonna do that. Over there.

880
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:40,698
You're embarrassing yourself,
in front of agents that I work

881
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,834
with, and who you work with,
and will again.

882
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:44,535
I'm not the one should be embarrassed.

883
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:45,870
I guess Lugo was just a warm up.

884
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,538
It's like eating those potato chips.

885
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,017
Once you get going prosecuting people

886
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,875
who don't deserve it,
it gets hard to stop.

887
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,743
There's no linkage
between those two cases.

888
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:55,880
Just one thing: Lugo is innocent.
And you know Gilbert is too.

889
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,759
Oh, he's far from innocent.
<i>You</i> should know that.

890
00:47:57,783 --> 00:47:59,862
And you need to stop worrying
about shit like that and more

891
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:01,919
about how to make your own cases stick.

892
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:07,891
I used to admire your
political fluidity.

893
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,494
I thought it was sophistication.

894
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:15,331
Now I realize you're
just completely bankrupt.

895
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:21,638
And I used to admire your
dogged sense of what's right.

896
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:24,473
Now I see it's just plodding ignorance.

897
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:31,781
- There she is.
- Kate!

898
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:36,419
Bottoms the fuck up.

899
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:37,820
- Cheers!
- All right!

900
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:40,923
- Damn. You did it.
- Cheers.

901
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:43,859
So here's where we're at.

902
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:46,962
We can wrap up the civil
charges against Axe Capital

903
00:48:46,997 --> 00:48:49,498
with a no-admit-no-deny
settlement and agree

904
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:52,367
to a penalty of 390 million.

905
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:55,670
Or I can go back and
try to chip them down...

906
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:57,072
Nope. Done deal.

907
00:48:57,107 --> 00:48:59,607
Thought so...
And they're whacking Mafee with

908
00:48:59,643 --> 00:49:02,744
a Tier 3 penalty...
for fraud, reckless disregard

909
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:04,512
of regulatory requirement.

910
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:06,781
The fine is 181,000.

911
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:19,861
First check for 390 large to the SEC.

912
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:25,767
Other one for 181K to Mafee.

913
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,469
For 'expenses.'

914
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:30,571
You got it.

915
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:32,840
Technically you gotta
pay the fine yourself.

916
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,108
Thanks, Axe.

917
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:36,477
Don't thank me yet.
You got the other thing?

918
00:49:36,512 --> 00:49:37,945
Thanks, Helena.

919
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,118
Mafee, this is for you.

920
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,887
For stepping up.

921
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:52,359
For being the kind of rock
that great companies are built upon.

922
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:54,127
One million straight in crypto.

923
00:49:54,162 --> 00:49:56,363
In cold storage.

924
00:49:56,398 --> 00:49:58,599
Pagando blackjack!

925
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,003
Thank you, Mafee.

926
00:50:03,038 --> 00:50:05,872
Of course. Thanks again, Axe.

927
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:14,547
You'd think a stick
would make him smile.

928
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:16,883
Give me a stick,
I'll dance like a Cossack.

929
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,761
He fired you.

930
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:31,764
It's a setback, Oliver. Not a defeat.

931
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:34,500
For you it's a total victory.

932
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,967
Annihilation of the enemy.

933
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:39,038
And all in the vicinity, including me.

934
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:41,173
That's an unfair frame of the events.

935
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,076
I was fodder.
Don't try to tell me different.

936
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:46,878
I knew it, too, along the way.

937
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:51,516
But that's the thing:
once you're inside the cannon,

938
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,552
there's only one way out.

939
00:50:56,924 --> 00:51:00,559
Oliver. You took some clean cuts.

940
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,694
It could have all broken right.

941
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:06,031
And it will next time.

942
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,799
You'll be back.

943
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:24,848
Hey, Mafee.

944
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:26,905
Hey.

945
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,054
I wanted to thank you.

946
00:51:30,765 --> 00:51:32,556
For what you did.

947
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,692
For who you are...

948
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:36,193
Which is: my hero.

949
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,531
And I want you to know

950
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:45,202
that this is strictly platonic...

951
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:13,662
Open it.

952
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,633
You know the joke, right?

953
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:21,504
If you find yourself on a golf course
in the middle of a lightning storm,

954
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:25,608
grab hold of a one iron,
and it'll keep you safe,

955
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,977
because not even God can hit a one iron.

956
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:33,682
Now, this is the one
that Hogan used on 18

957
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:37,519
at the Open in 1950 to get
himself into the playoff.

958
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:43,591
Sixteen months after the car accident
that most said would end his career.

959
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:48,062
The Miracle at Merion.

960
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:51,166
Hogan won that event.

961
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,268
Put the accident behind him.

962
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,770
That he did.

963
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,673
As we have, Dad.

964
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:03,644
Those perjury charges
against you will not be filed.

965
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,617
This club is a memento
to recognize the impossible.

966
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:15,956
And you? Are you out of danger, too.

967
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,792
That I am.

968
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:39,979
Hogan did win again.

969
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:42,348
And his swing looked the same.

970
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:48,988
But... no doubt something changed.

971
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:53,926
He had to feel beat up, older,

972
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:56,128
like the wins cost much more.

973
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:59,031
That how you feel?

974
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:02,101
I feel as old as you.

975
00:54:02,136 --> 00:54:05,671
Yeah. I can see it in your eyes.

976
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:15,680
After a win like this,
I like to grab the wife,

977
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:17,349
roll out to Mohegan Sun,

978
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:19,651
start with a couples' massage

979
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:21,954
then party like it's 1999.

980
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:24,957
Orrin, I would say that's TMI...

981
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:27,259
if I didn't love it so damn much.

982
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:30,228
What are you going to do to celebrate?

983
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:33,197
Oh. Something quiet.

984
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:34,899
You?

985
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:36,200
Same.

986
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:54,252
I really wanted to put on
a show for you tonight.

987
00:54:58,824 --> 00:55:00,056
It felt like we should...

988
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:08,799
...but I just don't have it in me.

989
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:16,406
Well...

990
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,442
You know what, Wend.

991
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:25,215
I don't either.

992
00:56:13,497 --> 00:56:15,263
Enjoy, my dauphin, you earned it...

993
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:55,987
I've been thinking about this moment
since the second I gave up trading.

994
00:57:56,054 --> 00:57:58,422
All new positions will
be run through me.

995
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:01,394
The sitting United States
Attorney cannot be coveting

996
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:04,796
- higher public office.
- That's why you need to resign.

997
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:07,075
If you were in power?
You've got to reverse the power dynamic.

998
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:11,346
I need someone who can
act on the information.

999
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:14,755
I would never trade on
privileged and on public information.

1000
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,367
I'm here to ask you to honour
your promise to me.

1001
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,776
Ah.

1002
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:26,524

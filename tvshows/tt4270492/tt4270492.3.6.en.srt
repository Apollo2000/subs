1
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,297
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,099
They're in this.
I can't look away from it anymore.

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:12,968
The Ice Juice short,
how do I get a piece of that?

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,170
- I can make it happen.
- As much as I can get.

5
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:17,306
Will your father hold
up under questioning?

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,308
He's not taking my
counsel at the moment.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,642
Do you want access?

8
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,677
Yes, I believe I do.

9
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,815
Just trace amounts on my signal.

10
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,650
<i>We have you pissing in the soup.</i>

11
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,752
And people's lives were
placed in jeopardy.

12
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,687
I was told they weren't in any danger...

13
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,689
The man who instructed you.
Describe him.

14
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,360
Fifties. Bald. Glasses...

15
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:41,695
After 18 hours,
the toxin would evaporate.

16
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,931
Do you want us to check his lab?

17
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,066
And his home.

18
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,200
I told you: I disposed of the slide.

19
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:48,302
How?

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,769
You have to trust me.

21
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,637
If you don't want to get on the stand,

22
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,940
then there needs to
be physical evidence.

23
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:56,176
<i>An item that could speak for you.</i>

24
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:57,777
<i>Finally got my read.</i>

25
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,913
<i>He's made a deal with
the government, and I'm fucked.</i>

26
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:40,083
We wear them for two reasons.

27
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,086
To keep the aromas from escaping,

28
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,391
and to hide this
shameful and depraved act

29
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,559
from god.

30
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,928
Well, if there were a god,
I think he'd know.

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,975
Fifty thousand.

32
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,045
The other 50 and the
visas for your family

33
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:10,346
you will get on completion.

34
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,846
- Thank you.
- If all goes well,

35
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,482
we'll have them out of Congo
and in the States by summer.

36
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,224
And your Axelrod will
be where I once was.

37
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,685
Mm.

38
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:18,819
You have the item?

39
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,525
In here.

40
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:28,862
Now, the slide has an 18 hour
half-life at room temperature,

41
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,198
so make sure you plant it
in Axe's medicine cabinet

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,766
or someplace away from sunlight.

43
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,269
Infiltration of Axelrod's penthouse

44
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:38,172
involves the highest
degree of difficulty.

45
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:41,308
However, he will be
at Art Basel in three weeks...

46
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,909
The luxe life rolls on unabated...

47
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,679
Mechanical work is
scheduled while he's away.

48
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,148
I will, uh, execute then.

49
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,761
Look, I don't want you
to get in trouble.

50
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:04,629
I won't.

51
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:05,797
Do you even know who I...

52
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:09,134
Why don't you get on the little earpiece
and talk to the people in there?

53
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:10,569
I am Head of Compliance.

54
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,137
Authorized personnel only.

55
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,905
They'll authorize me.

56
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,174
You're not on the list.

57
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,710
But those two are?

58
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,212
Jury consultants.

59
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,215
You give a guy a little
bit of authority.

60
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:25,782
Mason, Taylor.

61
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,251
Nope.

62
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:34,024
They're clearly jealous of
my standing in the company.

63
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,593
Pricks.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,333
Status on the slide?

65
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:46,603
The slide is not in evidence at Eastern.

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,099
Officially.

67
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:49,550
Somehow that doesn't give me comfort.

68
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,974
Even if we could compromise
an assistant at Eastern

69
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:53,842
or remotely access the FBI case file...

70
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,444
They'd hide it under a code name.

71
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:59,348
Our motion to dismiss
is a much more direct solution.

72
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,950
If Eastern has the slide,
the motion forces them

73
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,353
to reveal the evidence to
prove they have a case.

74
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:05,621
And if they don't?

75
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,422
Bryan Connerty has very little

76
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,924
on which to mount his prosecution.

77
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,629
- You need me?
- Do you need me?

78
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,165
If you come in,
you got to retain Bach's services.

79
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,566
Attorney-client privilege.

80
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:25,206
I don't need ya <i>that</i> bad.

81
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,012
Ooh.

82
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,249
Thank you.

83
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,385
Nice weeds.

84
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,920
So, this guy or...

85
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,789
girl or... whatever

86
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,323
couldn't spring for roses?

87
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,392
I'd have gotten you a k.d. Lang album

88
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,827
and tickets to UFC, cover all the bases.

89
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,696
They're delphiniums.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,235
The petals are clustered
according to the Fibonacci Sequence.

91
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,969
Also called the Golden Ratio.

92
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,972
It's a series of numbers
in which each number is

93
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,808
the sum of the two preceding numbers.

94
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,544
It's frequently echoed
in art and in nature.

95
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:09,113
That's a good gift too, then.

96
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:13,641
So, who's the lucky... person?

97
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:14,885
Hmm.

98
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,122
From "Oscar."

99
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:23,594
Recent trip to Silicon Valley.

100
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,095
Langstraat?

101
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,764
A big Billie.

102
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,065
Nice.

103
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,396
That long distance shit works for you?

104
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,682
If we were in the same place,
but each drawn to work

105
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,671
with 90 percent of our time,
it would be awkward,

106
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:38,040
or make it seem like our
feelings didn't matter.

107
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,208
This is better.

108
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,156
Yo, quants.

109
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,826
You have back-test results for me?

110
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,169
This is based on the
exact specs you gave me.

111
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:07,904
Not exactly, no. The specs I
gave you were not a wish list.

112
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:11,104
They included a threshold for returns,
which this simulation fails to meet.

113
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,340
Can you give us next steps, then?

114
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,153
Vary position size when the system

115
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,645
underperforms the market,
re-test and report back.

116
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,677
You know, every time I eat pig's ears,

117
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,959
I'm reminded of how alert
and alive they once were.

118
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,927
Makes me feel a little bad.

119
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,662
Favorite thing on the menu.

120
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,864
Of course,
you can have them slice it for you

121
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,299
if it offends your sensibilities.

122
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,969
No. I feel a little bad
about a lot of things I do.

123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,504
Doesn't stop me.

124
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,839
That's the way.

125
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,841
Mmm!

126
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,810
Zinfandel goes nicely, too.

127
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,177
Mm.

128
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,085
We need to begin time-lining your run.

129
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,486
Scheduling events.
Introducing you to some people.

130
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,788
Uh, we couldn't,
not while I'm still in office.

131
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,825
Not as an official candidate, of course.

132
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,927
But we'll have some dinners.

133
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,029
Casual.

134
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:13,163
But not at all casual.

135
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,398
For the money folk,
it's a lot like watching

136
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,534
morning workouts at Churchill Downs.

137
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,169
They get a feel for you.

138
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,772
They, uh, assess your stride.

139
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,807
Then they decide how
much they're gonna wager.

140
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,343
Mm. While I work up a good sweat.

141
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:28,811
I look forward to it.

142
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:34,583
I need to know you're squared away.

143
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,919
I'm as locked down as a
Firstie at West Point, sir.

144
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,990
The Axelrod situation will
resolve itself very soon,

145
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:42,991
and favorably.

146
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,860
Then I will be unencumbered.

147
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,930
How's your marriage?

148
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,366
Well, a man who makes
proclamations on that

149
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:52,933
tempts fate.

150
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:56,103
But solid.

151
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,538
Good.

152
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,908
Well, if you do have a good one,
the campaign'll push it to the brink.

153
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,442
- Mm.
- If you don't...

154
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,679
if there are any weaknesses...

155
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,881
it'll blow out like a bad sidewall.

156
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,182
No concern there.

157
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,617
I'll need to sit with her.

158
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,323
Grand. Do it.

159
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:20,426
Good. Well, very good, really.

160
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,196
Nice eye contact.

161
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,690
You've always been a man of purpose.

162
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,366
Which is exactly what we need.

163
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,536
But we'll also turn you
into a man of the people.

164
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,175
I look forward to meeting Wendy.

165
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,155
This is it, right,

166
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,523
the dismissal hearing?

167
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,225
Boss, I got a good feeling about this.

168
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,426
Glad you're so confident.

169
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,161
Already put the Pink Champipple on ice.

170
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,908
Any day now,
you're gonna be back to trading,

171
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:00,831
and everything'll be
like it's supposed to.

172
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,766
Hold the bubbly, Billy Buck Buck.

173
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:05,202
- No premature Cele...
- Today's about recon.

174
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:08,371
I'll look in their faces;
see if they have something to hide.

175
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:09,840
Great suit.

176
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,761
Bespoke? Are those surgeon's cuffs?

177
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,072
Not a good time, leech.

178
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:16,610
Am I gonna have to Mills Lane
every interaction between you two?

179
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,458
- 'Course not, come on.
- You're on your way to court.

180
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:21,250
I've worked with Bryan Connerty,

181
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,484
studied him.

182
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,353
I can mirror the way the guy thinks.

183
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,215
You ever want to bounce
anything off of me...

184
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:28,323
We know where to find ya. Thanks.

185
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,359
Anyway, I'm right.

186
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,094
I feel it in my 'nads.

187
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,595
Are they ever wrong?

188
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,798
Spring break senior year.

189
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,299
Seסor Frog's.

190
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,635
Other than that... hundred percent.

191
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,473
Go get 'em, Axe!

192
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:00,654
Ready?

193
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:01,788
I guess.

194
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,823
I have the case,
I just don't have the evidence.

195
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,091
Wrong answer.

196
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,893
You know the mantra over at the DEA?

197
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,994
If you ain't got video,
you ain't got shit.

198
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:11,297
Well, we ain't got video, Oliver.
We got theories.

199
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,532
If I were DeGiulio
I'd dismiss this case.

200
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:14,733
Well, I do that too;

201
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,680
try and make each person's
argument in the courtroom

202
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:18,448
ahead of time so I can
make the counter argument.

203
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:20,706
But we don't have to this time...

204
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,841
They need to deal with
the high bar to dismiss,

205
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,910
the customary deference to Prosecution.

206
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:28,279
Not to mention that dismissal
would be poor optics for DeGiulio.

207
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,315
- He<i> wants</i> to sit this case.
- Mm.

208
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,782
You know Axelrod is guilty.

209
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:34,151
Carry yourself with
confidence in the courtroom,

210
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,653
and DeGiulio will know it, too.

211
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:36,787
Confidence?

212
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,756
Not even Evel Knievel could jump the gap

213
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,458
between what I know
and what I can prove.

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,992
Then I suggest you do what
Mr. Knievel always did.

215
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,061
Rev her high. Pray for mercy.

216
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,830
Try to put her down on the ramp.

217
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,898
And hope you are one of the elect.

218
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:54,438
Mr. Bach, it's your motion.

219
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,341
- Move me.
- I will.

220
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,442
Like<i> Brian's Song.</i>

221
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,712
Because like Mr. Piccolo's sad,
short life,

222
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:05,615
Prosecution's case starts off hopeful

223
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,850
but ends in an untimely demise.

224
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:11,587
Your Honor, to date, the government
hasn't alleged sufficient evidence

225
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:14,089
that Mr. Axelrod is
guilty of any charges.

226
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,725
Yet my client has
been unfairly stripped

227
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,159
of his ability to trade...

228
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,428
while his firm, his employees,

229
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,298
and his family have
all been destabilized.

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,167
We ask that you bring
this baseless campaign

231
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,569
to its conclusion.

232
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,937
Your Honor,
this entire motion is premature.

233
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,641
The jury gets to decide
issues on material fact.

234
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:34,343
Whether or not they
believe the evidence.

235
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,176
Mr. Bach is saying there's no evidence

236
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,678
for them to decide about.

237
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,347
We are pursuing several threads.

238
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,160
So maybe it's not
this motion that's premature.

239
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,251
Maybe it's your whole prosecution.

240
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,654
Testimony that we
initially promised to have,

241
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,689
that we meant to have, should have

242
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,324
is not... available.

243
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,693
We have reason to believe
that several of our witnesses

244
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:54,827
have been tampered with.

245
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,228
Your Honor...

246
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:59,299
Mr. Bach, there's no jury to
hear your pained objections.

247
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,734
Mr. Connerty,
do you have any evidence

248
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:05,405
to back up that claim...
for why you don't have any evidence?

249
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,072
Not at this time.

250
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:11,242
Then... what<i> do</i> you have at<i> this</i> time?

251
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,244
We are pursuing information
about an operative

252
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,879
we believe is a direct link

253
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:19,217
between Mr. Axelrod and the contaminant
that sabotaged the juice company.

254
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,252
You have him in custody?

255
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,322
We are pursuing the thread to him.

256
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,144
So, in other words,
all you have is evidence

257
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,490
against someone who isn't me.

258
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:29,427
Mr. Axelrod,
do I look like I need your help?

259
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,763
Mr. Connerty, what do you know
about the operative so far?

260
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,264
Does he have a name?

261
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,767
That's... part of what
we're trying to ascertain.

262
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,236
We do have witnesses that can ID him.

263
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,005
If you find him.

264
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,342
Yes.

265
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:48,044
You a music fan, Mr. Connerty?

266
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,147
Sure. Much as the next guy.

267
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,182
Yo-Yo Ma, Clancy Brothers and such.

268
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,884
I'm thinking of the
great George Clinton.

269
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:56,018
Who most famously said,

270
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,760
"Free your mind and
your ass will follow."

271
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,988
But only slightly
less known and far more apt

272
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,658
in the case at bar is,
"You can't fake the funk."

273
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,693
As much as I
want to dance to your tune,

274
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,906
if the groove isn't fat enough,
I'm just gonna stand in place.

275
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,231
And right now, my feet aren't tapping.

276
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,767
That said, I don't think you're lying.

277
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:13,869
I'm splitting the baby.

278
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:16,003
I'm granting Mr. Connerty one more week.

279
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,745
At that time,
the prosecution will produce

280
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,841
evidence compelling enough
to sustain the case.

281
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,209
Or I will grant Mr.
Axelrod his dismissal.

282
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,199
Hello?

283
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,667
Our project has been fast-tracked.

284
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,935
It needs to be accomplished
within the week.

285
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:54,072
Well, the risks in execution
are significantly greater.

286
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,478
I'm going to need to double my price.

287
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,416
So be it.

288
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:14,366
You rattled?

289
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,029
Do I look rattled?

290
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,206
If you weren't a little rattled,

291
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,408
you'd have come right to my office

292
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:21,165
when you saw the top
floor annexed like that.

293
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,401
But you played it cool.

294
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:24,735
You're right.

295
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,970
I wouldn't use
the word "rattled," but...

296
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,339
The situation upstairs
indicates increasing odds

297
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,741
of a worst-case scenario.

298
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:33,610
And you're sitting here
trying to figure out what?

299
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,880
It's on me to be ready
to address any subsequent instability.

300
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,650
You're wondering if
Axe Capital can survive

301
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,418
Axe himself going to jail.

302
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:44,153
Yes.

303
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,523
Not as we know it.

304
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,792
It'll be about mutation.

305
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,994
The capital will still
need to be managed.

306
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:54,174
The people here are capable
and the right ones to do it.

307
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:56,732
But can it thrive, grow,

308
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:00,469
and continue to really
live if Axe goes to jail?

309
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:03,204
That'll come down to one thing.

310
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:05,474
You know what that is.

311
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,178
You.

312
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,613
But that's not news to you.

313
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:13,648
Because part of you
wants that challenge,

314
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,927
part of you is terrified of it,

315
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:17,985
and part of you hates yourself

316
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,654
for hoping he does go away,
so you get a chance to see.

317
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,490
Yes.

318
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:25,258
Even now I measure myself against him,
as though he were gone.

319
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,861
And the thought of coming up short...

320
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,029
Measurable successes are seductive.

321
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,064
Especially when we're young.

322
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,736
But when it comes to dealing
with other human beings,

323
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,896
we have to steer from instinct.

324
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,311
I don't trust instinct.

325
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:43,309
That's because you're defining it
in some woo woo spiritual way.

326
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,011
Don't.

327
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:48,881
Instead, think of your gut
as the deepest part of you,

328
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:50,949
the part that can do
internal calculations

329
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,150
on the highest plane.

330
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,586
Axe, at his best, does this.

331
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,590
You want to be on his level,
in the purest way,

332
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:02,628
the most profound, then you must, too.

333
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,062
Identify it.

334
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,031
Separate it from your fears, your hopes,

335
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,533
the other voices in your head.

336
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,503
Because if you don't cultivate instinct,
and listen to it...

337
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,038
you're fucking doomed.

338
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,047
You know what?

339
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,282
Now I am rattled.

340
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:35,024
Bobby, they don't have the slide.

341
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,894
Connerty's slow playing us.
He'll roll it out at trial.

342
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,028
Nope. If he were, this was the moment

343
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,463
he would have produced it.

344
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,032
So now, we run out the clock
and game over.

345
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:45,767
It's pretty to think so.

346
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,569
When did you become a dyspeptic?

347
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:50,438
When I started facing jail time.

348
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,507
When did you become
a fucking Pollyannic?

349
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,642
You're convinced this
evidence is out there, fine.

350
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,245
Then tell me what you want me to do,

351
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,212
because you're leaving me no options.

352
00:16:58,314 --> 00:16:59,914
You're not interested in taking a plea,

353
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:01,315
you won't leave the country...

354
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,485
What's the physical security like
at the FBI evidence lock-up?

355
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:06,921
- Come on.
- State of the art.

356
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,055
We'll look into it.

357
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,524
Get back to me when you know more.

358
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,070
We're almost home.

359
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,574
Don't let your paranoia make
you take unnecessary risks.

360
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:32,511
Not unnecessary if they
keep me out of jail.

361
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:46,558
Come with me.

362
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,008
I'm sorry, man. The deal is off.

363
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,477
Mr. Aduba... Roland...

364
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:09,212
I won't accept that; I<i> can't.</i>

365
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,997
Axelrod's residence is
wrapped in barbed wire.

366
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:14,751
There's simply no way
to penetrate it in a matter of days.

367
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:18,755
The whole fifty. A full refund.

368
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,497
You know,
I usually don't do such a thing.

369
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,291
And your family?

370
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,194
Without me, they may never
set foot on these shores.

371
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:29,332
If I'm in jail again,
then I'll be useless to them.

372
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,000
I can shield you from that.

373
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,868
I cannot perform miracles.

374
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,536
Neither can you.

375
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,909
Perhaps there's an
employee at Axe Capital

376
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,611
you can persuade to put it there.

377
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:46,114
Such as your wife.

378
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:51,286
Good luck,<i> mukuyu.</i>

379
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:10,704
I didn't know you were a runner.

380
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:13,873
Just about at my lactate threshold.

381
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,841
Really clears the mind,

382
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,077
optimizes my performance at the office.

383
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,346
Yes. Head of Compliance, is it?

384
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:23,483
That must be quite a job,
keeping those hooligans in line.

385
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,785
I'm tough with them,
and they respect me for it.

386
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,787
And I got to say, it's nice

387
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,722
working for a winner for a change.

388
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:31,923
Really.

389
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:35,927
Wasn't that long ago we were
working alongside each other

390
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,498
to nail Bobby Axelrod,
and now he's a winner?

391
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,965
You never did nail him.

392
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:42,834
Ah. Guess you got me there.

393
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,736
So, what can I do for you, Chuck?

394
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,771
It's a simple assignment,
easily accomplished.

395
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,143
Use your access to help
close out this case

396
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,045
against your momentary boss,

397
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:57,848
then rejoin the righteous.

398
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,419
You want me to be a cuckoo bird,

399
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:03,987
sneaking my eggs into
another mother's nest.

400
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:08,858
Yes, when the egg cracks open:
destruction.

401
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,594
Beautiful and total.

402
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:14,297
You would be well-rewarded.

403
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,999
Rewarded. How?

404
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:19,502
Well, when Axe Capital is
inevitably found guilty

405
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,971
of securities violations,
you have my assurance... my word...

406
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:26,442
that you, as Head of Compliance,
would be protected.

407
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:28,577
Look, see, the problem is:

408
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,246
I'm not some cuckoo bird, Chuck.

409
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,382
I'm a golden eagle.

410
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,052
So why would I do anything for you?

411
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,420
It's unfortunate I have to say it.

412
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,389
You know what I have on you.

413
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,259
You mean accusations of a
decades-old impropriety...

414
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,160
Date rape.

415
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,861
We're not in Hollywood, Chuck.

416
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,098
Nothing's gonna happen.

417
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,401
Say it loud enough,
they might even make me president.

418
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,616
Probably not your best move right now.

419
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,496
I need you to hear what
you wouldn't let me say

420
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,586
- in the courtroom.
- I heard what you said.

421
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:16,855
But you hear me: Men like Axelrod
do what they need to do.

422
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:20,126
You counter not in here,
in the courtroom. With evidence.

423
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,894
- In a week?
- In a week.

424
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,630
Goodbye, Mr. Connerty.

425
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:31,836
No!

426
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:34,606
Why the hell would you
risk coming to my chambers

427
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,674
just to turn heel and walk out?

428
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,743
What weak cheese is that?

429
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,945
You said "goodbye."

430
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:43,547
I'm a judge. I give orders all day.

431
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:44,349
You're a litigator.

432
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,417
You find a way to disobey them
without getting nailed for it.

433
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,621
Then I'm not leaving until
you give me an answer.

434
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:57,394
That sensation you're feeling,
it's known as the Dip.

435
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,170
Seth Godin coined it.

436
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:00,697
Feels like the moment before defeat.

437
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,599
It's actually the moment before success.

438
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,336
Feels more like Death Valley.

439
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,469
You care so fucking much. I love that.

440
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,762
I love that. You're meant for this shit.

441
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:11,507
Dig in, man.

442
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,909
The world has lost countless
artists and artisans

443
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:16,145
and engineers and even
politicians who quit

444
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,314
because they cared too
much to come up short

445
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,183
and yet also too much to keep going.

446
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:23,151
You push through that Dip right now,

447
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:25,387
maybe you put Axelrod
where he needs to be.

448
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,944
Why are you out of breath?

449
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,647
<i>Bike ride. I have a recumbent.</i>

450
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,148
<i>Great for the hills out here.</i>

451
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,482
Of course. More aerodynamic.

452
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:40,617
<i>Where are you?</i>

453
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,419
Meditation room.

454
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,855
<i>Oh. I'll go to mine, too!</i>

455
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:48,258
<i>Why you hiding out in there?</i>

456
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,794
I'm not hiding.
My office has been commandeered.

457
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,663
I'm working through
issues with my algorithm

458
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:54,630
and it's the only place that's quiet.

459
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:55,998
<i>You ran another back-test?</i>

460
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
My programmers didn't
correct for slippage.

461
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,569
They're software, not finance.

462
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,671
I have a vision for it that
I haven't yet been able

463
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,005
to realize in my design.

464
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:06,709
<i>A phrase uttered by the architect
of every great invention.</i>

465
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:08,851
I can keep tweaking it and
improve it incrementally,

466
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,612
or...

467
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,947
<i>Or start over.</i>

468
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:14,716
Crap. Yes.

469
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:16,051
I'd have to gut it.

470
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:18,653
<i>Feel like I just kicked
over your Lego city.</i>

471
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:23,324
What you said is true. Just frustrating.

472
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:26,194
<i>Breaking trail is a lonely calling.</i>

473
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:27,929
<i>Hang in.</i>

474
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,137
Fuck.

475
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,305
Uh-oh.

476
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:42,175
Send in Orrin Bach.

477
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,889
They're gonna like this.
You're doing a great job.

478
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,579
- I promise.
- Sorry.

479
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:50,499
I know I'm not allowed
in the clubhouse, but Axe?

480
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,035
The baton is in my hand.

481
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:55,872
Sign this standard retainer letter.

482
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,843
You know what my favorite
Olympic event is?

483
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:04,946
It's the four by 100 meter relay.

484
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:06,714
Because it's about teamwork.

485
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:08,583
It's about the<i> pass.</i>

486
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:11,519
Right now, I've got the baton.

487
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:13,321
But I'm passing it to you, Axe.

488
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:14,890
You're the anchor.

489
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,258
You're gonna bring it home.

490
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,193
You are gonna win.

491
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,594
What am I gonna win?

492
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:20,696
Your case.

493
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:21,929
Because of the baton?

494
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,097
Yes.

495
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,199
Which in this case is
not an actual baton,

496
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:28,602
but is Dr. Wendy Rhoades.

497
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:29,937
- What?
- Wendy?

498
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,572
I've been doing a little
sleuthing about the IPO;

499
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,374
you know, winners and losers.

500
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:36,743
And I discover that one particular fund

501
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:39,378
made a killing that
day shorting the stock.

502
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,447
So I look to see whose account it is,

503
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,549
and I notice there's an irregularity.

504
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,885
So I keep digging,

505
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,955
and lo and behold... it's Wendy's.

506
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:52,525
The name on the account had been
flipped with someone else's.

507
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:55,460
Now this is the first time she
has ever even made a trade,

508
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:58,063
herself, in her whole
history at Axe Cap.

509
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,532
So I get a buddy of mine who
works for the NSA to find out

510
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,100
where she was when she called in

511
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,635
- the order for the short.
- Wait.

512
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,204
You had the NSA look into Wendy?

513
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:06,905
Completely off-book.

514
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,241
But guess where it pinged?

515
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:11,843
Southern District of New York.

516
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,411
Chuck's office.

517
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,049
We got some real Whitewater shit here.

518
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:21,418
Needless to say:
with this in Bryan Connerty's hands,

519
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,321
the spotlight moves off of you

520
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:27,091
and shines all over
Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.

521
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,658
Chaos grenade.

522
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,497
If this were the
four by 100 meter relay,

523
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,567
you would be disqualified for
sniffing glue on the team bus.

524
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,304
This is the worst fucking idea
anyone's brought me in over a year.

525
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,505
Um...

526
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,975
Eh, you know, I am gonna try and forget
we just had this little moment.

527
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,978
Also, the two thousand that I
spent retaining Bach for you.

528
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,850
He's not wrong.

529
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,486
Exposing Wendy's short
could be good for us;

530
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:58,687
I've said it before.

531
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,523
Yeah, and I've said: she is off limits.

532
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:03,657
You still here?

533
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:06,861
Problem is: I already told Connerty.

534
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:10,865
I went full Le Carrי.

535
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,650
The only reason you're not flying

536
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,387
is because these windows don't open.

537
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:36,455
And we can't fire you right now
because it wouldn't look good.

538
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,091
But get the fuck out of our sight.

539
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,927
And stay there.

540
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:51,003
I have to tell her.

541
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:54,039
Fuck.

542
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,874
Godspeed.

543
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,007
Come in.

544
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:39,902
Are you okay?

545
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,341
Bobby. Out with it.

546
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,079
The Feds have your Ice Juice short.

547
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:59,287
It was Spyros. To Connerty.

548
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,322
He thought he was helping me.
I just found out.

549
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,291
Are you sure it wasn't you?

550
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:08,362
Not how it happened. I promise.

551
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:20,005
So, Spyros.

552
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,441
He gave him everything:

553
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,344
size of the position,
your trading history.

554
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,079
Even when and where
you called in the order.

555
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:29,014
I could...

556
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:31,984
Chuck has said if these events
get interpreted in this way...

557
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,486
painting me as a co-conspirator...

558
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:34,588
<i>I</i> could end up...

559
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:36,054
Yes. Jail.

560
00:28:36,156 --> 00:28:37,556
But I will not let that happen.

561
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:39,725
I'll get you whatever you need.

562
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,793
The best lawyers;
I'll pay for everything.

563
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:43,573
You have the best lawyers.
Look where you're at.

564
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,397
I thought I had this locked down.

565
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,598
Well, you didn't.

566
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,304
I know you did what you did
with the same intention:

567
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:55,606
to protect those you love.

568
00:28:56,942 --> 00:29:00,478
And I, too, failed.

569
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:08,218
What words do you need me to
say to make you feel safe?

570
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,720
Are there any?

571
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:11,954
Really?

572
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,325
No. Not really.

573
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:18,595
Right.

574
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,098
I need to go.

575
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:32,474
How do you communicate with people
in these kinds of situations?

576
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,242
Oh. Here. Take my burner.

577
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,444
Don't you need it?

578
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:36,945
No. I got plenty.

579
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:38,914
Call me anytime.

580
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,120
It's me.

581
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:47,955
I need to see you.

582
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,827
Remember back when I
asked you for those SEC files?

583
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:54,329
The transactions of all the people

584
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:56,664
who bought and sold stock
in the Ice Juice IPO?

585
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,326
You know how you never got them for me?

586
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,471
I got 'em anyway.

587
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:08,141
Tell me again how we have to leave Chuck
out of this investigation.

588
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:19,017
Forgive me, Lord.

589
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,688
You're right.

590
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,189
It's time.

591
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,931
It wasn't Axe; Axe is fighting for me.

592
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,501
Ari Spyros told him.

593
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,238
He thought he was protecting Axe.

594
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,008
Yeah. And he knew he was fucking me.

595
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,677
How are we gonna make this okay?

596
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,815
Chuck! I need you to tell me something.

597
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,685
There is one avenue that
may still be open to us.

598
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,054
Connerty?

599
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:37,726
I need to make him want to get Axelrod
more than he wants to get me.

600
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:54,608
What if I took a plea?

601
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,278
I understand you have
an attachment to Wendy,

602
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,148
but this isn't just a question
of you sacrificing yourself.

603
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,017
In every battle there are casualties.

604
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,286
You're talking about
surrendering your kingdom

605
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:09,322
to save a single loyal soldier.

606
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:10,824
She saved me.

607
00:32:10,926 --> 00:32:12,525
And she's not just a loyal soldier,

608
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:16,128
she's the company's
fucking spirit animal.

609
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,030
My people come unglued,
she puts them back together,

610
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:20,933
and better than they were before.

611
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,330
Your own personal Oscar Goldman.

612
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:24,365
If you will.

613
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:27,339
You owe her, too.

614
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,675
That spread of yours out in Sagaponack?

615
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,678
You wouldn't have that without me,

616
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,781
and I wouldn't have Axe Cap without her.

617
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:39,817
You'd have to make a statement

618
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,687
that precludes any notion
that you were baited.

619
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,524
Otherwise Connerty could still
pursue them for conspiracy.

620
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:49,794
You'd be absolving Chuck
Rhoades of any blame.

621
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:53,930
You'll get seven years. Minimum.

622
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:57,000
And you'll do over 80 percent
of it because it's Federal.

623
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,602
Lara will be a pariah.

624
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:00,670
Your sons will be scarred;

625
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,539
it'll haunt them all their lives.

626
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,240
Maybe more than it will yours.

627
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,847
I'll let you know what I decide.

628
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,588
- Jesus Christ.
- When you're hungry in an hour,

629
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,257
go get yourself some real sashimi.

630
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,825
Oh, god. Is that pineapple?

631
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:26,727
You got something to say to me,
do it through proper channels.

632
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,662
Don't hijack my lunch.

633
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:31,899
Or open your mouth and make
things even worse for yourself.

634
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:34,135
There's nothing you can offer me anymore

635
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:35,903
to keep yourself out of this.

636
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:37,704
There's a chance your wife can.

637
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,707
If she says exactly what I need her to,
in court, under oath.

638
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,209
You won't even do me the courtesy
of listening for a minute

639
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,813
- to what I have...
- Oh, I'll do you a courtesy:

640
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:48,648
I'm gonna come by your house tonight,

641
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,550
and the three of us will talk.

642
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:51,652
On the record.

643
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,987
So whatever you want to say,
save it for there.

644
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:55,588
And get Wendy ready, too.

645
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:03,329
If you'd rather do it in an
interview room at Eastern,

646
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,730
that's okay by me...
but you better bring a lawyer.

647
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,367
And I bet it isn't
gonna be Ira Schirmer.

648
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,080
Redecorating?

649
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,582
Bedroom, yeah.

650
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:26,884
You here to help me pick out the duvet?

651
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,387
No, I'm here to give you a heads-up.

652
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,123
I think I'm gonna take a plea.

653
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:34,824
You swore you'd never do that.

654
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:36,259
Well, things have changed.

655
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:38,195
Like what?

656
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:39,729
Doesn't matter.

657
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:44,201
So what does this mean?
You're going to jail?

658
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:47,770
We're gonna need to work
out a visitation plan.

659
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:49,806
Figure out what's best for the boys.

660
00:34:49,908 --> 00:34:52,574
We'd probably move.

661
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:53,876
Maybe California.

662
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:56,278
You'd move?

663
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,081
You just said we need to figure
out what's best for the boys,

664
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,749
and that's what would be best.

665
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,885
What, them never seeing me?

666
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,254
They barely see you now.

667
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:08,189
And that hurts them,
but at least they still worship you.

668
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,657
I'd be protecting that.

669
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,626
You'd be ripping my
heart out of my chest.

670
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:13,794
I'll do it without hesitating.

671
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:16,631
And no family court judge
will stop me with you in prison.

672
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,901
What do you think
it'd be like for the kids,

673
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:22,570
going to see their dad on the inside?

674
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:25,472
Do you really want them
seeing you cut down like that?

675
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:27,441
No.

676
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,276
I don't want any of this.

677
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,911
But California?

678
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:35,015
Yeah, it's better not to be surrounded
by people who know who you are.

679
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:38,919
Not to mention where you are, and why.

680
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:41,054
Be too hard on them.

681
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:50,463
Bobby, you and I...

682
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,666
we ended up here, for now,

683
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,036
but I know I didn't make a
mistake about you when we met.

684
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:59,003
About who you were.

685
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,540
Who you are.

686
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,942
And that guy would never give in,

687
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:07,679
because that guy would never believe,
even for one second,

688
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:10,315
that he couldn't find a
way to convince not one,

689
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,685
but all twelve jurors
to see things his way.

690
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:17,154
Especially if it meant
losing not only his freedom,

691
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,390
but his family.

692
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,274
When we spoke this morning,
you were in California.

693
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,642
Too much?

694
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:42,378
I've been dealing with this
with my performance coach.

695
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,981
I can be... unreserved,

696
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,783
a quality others have found off-putting.

697
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,284
I don't. Not in the least.

698
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:54,889
Twizzlers, Bit O' Honeys, Juicy Fruit.

699
00:36:54,992 --> 00:36:56,558
Standard coding provisions.

700
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,560
You came to help me with the algorithm?

701
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:00,829
To keep you company.
You don't need my help.

702
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,932
I'm grateful, but I have to wonder

703
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,934
if this is really the
best use of your time.

704
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:07,036
Or your jet.

705
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:10,938
This morning you got me thinking
about my first job in Silicon Valley.

706
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,873
The whole time I worked there,
we never knew

707
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:15,053
if the company was gonna be
alive at the end of the day.

708
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:16,077
So?

709
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:17,911
We kept our heads down and grinded.

710
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:19,580
My work was exciting.

711
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:22,016
But there were nights...
I'd be in my cube,

712
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,416
the only one around.

713
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,619
I remember feeling like
it would've been nice

714
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,921
to have someone around to
play Dragon Quest with.

715
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,059
We'll go to my place. I'll get my coat.

716
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:46,104
I know you and Dake
had some kind of deal.

717
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:48,352
Kind of had it figured from day one.

718
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:52,211
I mean, how does that guy
get appointed U.S. Attorney?

719
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:56,014
But things got really interesting

720
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:58,149
the day your best friend
was supposed to testify

721
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:02,320
against Axelrod... and instead
came in and rolled on you.

722
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,223
Whatever Ira may have said...

723
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,292
Sure, I know.

724
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:11,563
He's a disgruntled investor.

725
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,064
Hmm? That's what your dad said.

726
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,464
He's looking at a perjury charge

727
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,207
when I puncture that
bullshit affidavit...

728
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,401
but that's later.

729
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,170
Ira said you baited Axelrod,

730
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:24,608
which, I admit,
seemed a little farfetched.

731
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:29,279
And then I learned about
the role Wendy played.

732
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,617
And Ira's statement began
to seem pretty credible.

733
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,088
I know it all sounds... very bad.

734
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,890
And I might conclude the
same thing if I was you,

735
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:45,027
but you have to believe me,
I didn't<i> have</i> a role.

736
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:46,862
There was no conspiracy.

737
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:50,365
A jury's gonna have a really
hard time buying that.

738
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,467
It's a little premature to
be talking about juries.

739
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:53,979
There doesn't have to be a jury at all.

740
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:56,804
You can turn yourself in right now.

741
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,241
This can go one of two ways.

742
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:01,075
You decide to fight this,

743
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:05,012
and I charge the two of you
equally as co-conspirators.

744
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:07,781
Or, you both take a plea

745
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:10,451
and cooperate against Axe.

746
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,419
Chuck'll do time but you won't.

747
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,688
Whatever the medical board
decides to do with you

748
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,058
is their business...
but at least Kevin and Eva

749
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,327
will have someone at home with them.

750
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:25,632
What is this really about for you?

751
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:28,834
I think you used to
have a moral compass.

752
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,516
And it served you... got you
where you are, made you great.

753
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:37,310
Then it got warped, or broken.

754
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,729
But mine wasn't.

755
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:43,264
And you saw that and it killed you.

756
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:45,667
So you found a way to use it

757
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,969
and my loyalty to your advantage.

758
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:50,639
Oh, by making sure you lead
the Axelrod investigation?

759
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:51,873
By getting rid of me.

760
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,008
Shipping me to Eastern
so I wouldn't be around

761
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,677
to see you pulling Dake's strings.

762
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:58,078
I have done nothing but guide you.

763
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:03,083
Mentor you, prepare you to take
my place at that office.

764
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:05,986
I gave you yet another
career-making case,

765
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:07,421
and you fucked it up

766
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:12,392
by focusing on me and some phantom crime
you think my wife and I committed.

767
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:19,532
Next time we talk,
there should be lawyers present.

768
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,209
You know who this is?

769
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,211
He works for Axelrod.

770
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,217
That's okay.

771
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:41,439
I'll wait until you're in
the witness box, under oath.

772
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:54,832
I feel bad... for the kids.

773
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,144
We're gonna need lawyers.

774
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:09,813
Separate ones.

775
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,783
Keep even one of us out of prison.

776
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,697
If I ever do have a last supper,

777
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,899
it's gonna be hard to top this.

778
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,269
Which is why I wanted you
to have the ortolan tonight,

779
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:37,973
commander, as a reminder
of how alive you yet are.

780
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:42,977
Wylie, how do I eat it?

781
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,411
Whole, sir.

782
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:46,781
In France, ortolan
were only ever to be eaten

783
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:48,783
by royalty or in the monasteries.

784
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,285
And hunters would
bring them as absolute tribute

785
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:52,987
for being allowed to work the land.

786
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,789
The birds are trapped where grapes grow

787
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,691
so their insides have the
flavor of the terroir,

788
00:41:58,794 --> 00:42:00,260
the taste, of the land,

789
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:02,362
all the way down to
the guts and the bones.

790
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,064
Which is why we don't carve them.

791
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,465
It's against the law to eat them

792
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,733
in France now, isn't it?

793
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:08,034
Illegal the world over.

794
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:09,814
Because there are those
who don't recognize

795
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:10,904
what truly matters.

796
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,372
Because they're so delicious?

797
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:14,840
Because, in a crueler time,
they were blinded.

798
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:16,475
Their eyes would be gouged out

799
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,110
so they would think it was nighttime,

800
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:19,444
which makes them ravenous.

801
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,946
So they would gorge themselves

802
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:23,715
until they were three
times their natural size.

803
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:25,084
That we don't do anymore.

804
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:27,352
But it's still death by Armagnac,

805
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:28,754
they're drowned in it.

806
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,456
Very much how I'd like to go.

807
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:58,115
Mmm.

808
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:01,651
Mmm.

809
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,220
Mmm.

810
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:04,553
Mmm.

811
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:05,788
Mmm.

812
00:43:18,402 --> 00:43:21,269
I don't know about you,

813
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:23,371
but I just had a religious experience.

814
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:29,544
At the climax I felt the
crack of its little rib cage,

815
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:33,614
then the hot juices
rushing out down my gullet.

816
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:36,852
Sublime.

817
00:43:36,954 --> 00:43:37,954
Yes.

818
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:40,088
It was.

819
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,489
Got any more?

820
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,358
I'm still a little peckish.

821
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,693
You know what
they say about ortolan...

822
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,163
one is bliss, two is gluttony.

823
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:50,597
How about three?

824
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:51,765
Let's find out.

825
00:44:11,386 --> 00:44:13,952
How you doing?

826
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,521
A bit like one of those
little birds we just ate

827
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:18,390
right before they turn out the lights.

828
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,466
You know what this reminds me of?

829
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:31,369
The night we cracked ten billion.

830
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:35,706
You and me,
night fishing off City Island.

831
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:38,276
What a beautiful fucking night.

832
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:41,212
Stars out, stripers hitting.

833
00:44:41,314 --> 00:44:43,881
One tub full of fish,
the other tub full of bourbon.

834
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,582
Most newly minted deca-billionaires

835
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,583
would have checked out
with a few Spiegler girls

836
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,287
and enough mushrooms for a
three day binge in Chamonix.

837
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,055
How often do you get
to come home at dawn

838
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,391
with six striped bass in your trunk?

839
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,330
Jesus, what the fuck happened.

840
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,332
You fought the law.

841
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,967
The law won.

842
00:45:07,224 --> 00:45:09,858
I'm going out to face them alone.

843
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,827
You slip out the back.

844
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,261
I'll be fine.

845
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,398
Yeah, you will.

846
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,333
So will you.

847
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,168
I'm gonna miss you.

848
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:25,138
Thanks for the friendship.

849
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:14,752
Oh, did I wake you?

850
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:16,654
No.

851
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:18,689
Where'd you get that?

852
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,326
Oh, I came down looking for the
rest of Eva's birthday cake.

853
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:23,928
You told me to toss it.

854
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,565
So I walked to the corner
deli and I got this.

855
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:33,403
And how long are you gonna
sit there staring at it?

856
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:38,007
I can't quite bring myself.

857
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,978
I want it, but I don't.

858
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:46,281
I should have called Foley's office
and canceled for tomorrow.

859
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,485
Last thing I need is
to be forced to smile

860
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,487
for an hour over breakfast pastry.

861
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:53,823
Better that you didn't cancel.

862
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:57,660
We're gonna need him on our side,
whatever may come.

863
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:59,127
I thought he was on your side.

864
00:46:59,229 --> 00:47:02,697
Yeah, well, meeting you will cement it.

865
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:06,668
There isn't a person alive
who wouldn't fall under your spell.

866
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,406
Thank you, but I don't even know
what that means anymore.

867
00:47:16,245 --> 00:47:18,045
I'm so scared.

868
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,817
I will turn myself in tomorrow.

869
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,320
To spare you a lengthy sentence.

870
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:30,757
For the kids' sake as much as for you.

871
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,726
That is a magnificent gesture.

872
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:38,531
And not one I'm willing to live with.

873
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,754
Had it ever come to pass,

874
00:48:02,856 --> 00:48:05,490
I think we would have been
damn good at being governor.

875
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:38,220
Dad.

876
00:48:38,322 --> 00:48:41,357
What the hell could you possibly want?

877
00:48:54,304 --> 00:48:55,304
I'm sorry.

878
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:03,110
Okay.

879
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:06,715
Okay.

880
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:18,658
I'm not sure I'd know how to operate

881
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,862
with the finesse and delicacy
that you do, Mrs. Rhoades,

882
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,698
serving two masters,

883
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:31,071
or should I say, having the two
actually serve you.

884
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:36,274
You came up in Albany politics,

885
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,276
I can't imagine there's
an alignment of forces

886
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,511
you haven't seen before.

887
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:42,447
Well, I just think it's fascinating.

888
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:43,782
Audacious.

889
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:46,478
That's not always how it feels.

890
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:47,513
'Course not.

891
00:49:47,588 --> 00:49:49,387
No, when you're in it, it's, uh...

892
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,557
well, it's like being at
the bottom of a waterfall.

893
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,926
You can't decide whether
to dive in and swim

894
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,595
or cover your head and try
to get one decent breath

895
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,063
before you expire.

896
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,833
Much like a campaign,

897
00:50:01,935 --> 00:50:05,103
or being the First Lady of the state.

898
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:08,740
It's a shame most folks will
never get to see your act, Jack.

899
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,374
Ah, you and I
have a lot in common that way.

900
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:14,778
You know, I always found
the most satisfaction...

901
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,181
and the most success...
on the sidelines.

902
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:20,684
Reading the field, calling the plays.

903
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,653
Eventually, it, uh...

904
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:26,822
Well, it was no longer that I
simply had the ears of titans.

905
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:29,892
I learned to like
moving them around too.

906
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,967
What do you do when
there's no play to be made?

907
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,137
When no matter what you choose,
it'll end in disaster?

908
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,972
Classic double-bind.

909
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:49,077
There's a Zen koan where
the teacher holds a stick.

910
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,781
He says to his student,
"If you tell me this stick is real,

911
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,349
"I will beat you with it.

912
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:59,020
"If you tell me it is not real,
I will beat you with it.

913
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:03,090
If you say nothing,
I will beat you with it."

914
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:06,960
And so, the student reaches out,

915
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,430
grabs the stick, and breaks it.

916
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:16,937
If a situation is untenable,
Mrs. Rhoades,

917
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,271
you break that fucking stick.

918
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:27,914
There is no reason on this earth

919
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:32,151
that you should go to jail
while Axelrod doesn't.

920
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:35,420
If you have taught me anything,
you have taught me that.

921
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:38,590
I swear, Axelrod is going down with me.

922
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:40,003
Do you know how you're gonna do that?

923
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:43,361
I had procured
a piece of evidence, a slide,

924
00:51:43,463 --> 00:51:45,931
and I had planned to use
an unsavory character

925
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,066
to plant it in Axelrod's home;

926
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,301
was prepared to pay
dearly for the operative.

927
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:53,437
However I now seem to
have run out of options.

928
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:56,640
Don't tell the kids anything
until the verdict is announced.

929
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:02,479
And never let them see your shame.

930
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:08,252
Bearing, son, is all.

931
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:15,424
More bad news?

932
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:17,893
Perhaps the contrary.

933
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:20,796
I have to go.

934
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:22,831
Uh...

935
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:24,833
I've been given a last chance.

936
00:52:26,203 --> 00:52:29,204
That slide may yet find purchase.

937
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:39,281
Where are you?

938
00:52:39,383 --> 00:52:41,416
I need to see you.

939
00:52:42,237 --> 00:52:43,950
Name the place.

940
00:53:00,202 --> 00:53:01,668
Sacker.

941
00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:03,736
Have Allerd get a judge standing by

942
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,139
to execute a search warrant
by 7 a.m. tomorrow, at the latest.

943
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:09,875
Has to be Allerd, can't be you.

944
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:11,444
More details to come.

945
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,358
You know where we are, right?

946
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:32,764
And you know this is the only way.

947
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:34,332
Does he know?

948
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:37,067
Not yet.

949
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,147
Oh, I should've known
something like this was coming.

950
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:54,117
Ballsy.

951
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:56,286
Can we come in?

952
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:11,199
Huh.

953
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:14,236
You know, last time I saw you,
you were behind bars.

954
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:17,640
Tell me, does living
in a space this palatial

955
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:22,811
actually erase the memory
of that badly lit cell in Brooklyn?

956
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:25,747
Or maybe you just felt the need
to swing your dick one last time

957
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,448
in anticipation of a place far worse.

958
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,362
You managed to get your
foot caught in the rope

959
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:31,586
tossing me overboard, there, Chuck.

960
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:34,955
Now, I may pop to the surface,
but you are going under.

961
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:36,157
- Congratulations.
- Enough.

962
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:37,525
I didn't bring us all together

963
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:40,561
so I could mediate
your puerile bullshit.

964
00:54:40,664 --> 00:54:42,440
This is how we ended up
here in the first place.

965
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:45,265
Because the two of you,
at your absolute fucking worst,

966
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:48,168
went after each other
like a couple of pit bulls.

967
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,437
And now we're all three
of us royally fucked,

968
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:53,674
in a way that's so incestuous

969
00:54:53,776 --> 00:54:56,443
that if one of us goes to prison,
we all do.

970
00:54:56,545 --> 00:55:00,145
Conversely, if we want to get ourselves
out of this clusterfuck...

971
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,615
It's one for all and all for one?

972
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,916
Sit.

973
00:55:06,587 --> 00:55:08,321
Oh, she has you well-trained.

974
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:11,490
Chuck, calm down.

975
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:17,962
And I don't remember giving
you permission to speak.

976
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,664
Sit down.

977
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,639
She is effective.

978
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:30,963
Now, we are all going to sit here

979
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:33,077
and calmly discuss how
to undo this thing.

980
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:35,679
And we're not leaving
until we solve it. Yes?

981
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,755
I'll discuss it.

982
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,358
- Why I'm here.
- Good.

983
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:50,574
As much as you two
fucking hate each other,

984
00:55:50,628 --> 00:55:52,268
your only objective
right now is survival.

985
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,797
And if you are going
to save yourselves...

986
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:58,401
and me...

987
00:55:58,503 --> 00:56:00,870
you both need to surrender your weapons.

988
00:56:03,174 --> 00:56:04,974
Empty the caches, all of it.

989
00:56:05,076 --> 00:56:06,776
It all goes on the table.

990
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:08,944
Understood?

991
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:13,114
How do I know I can trust him?

992
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:14,816
How do I know I can trust him?

993
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:17,151
Trust<i> me.</i>

994
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,635
Uh, is it all right
if I go to the bathroom?

995
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:36,604
Yeah, sure.

996
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,206
It's... down there. Take a left.

997
00:58:41,623 --> 00:58:43,322
Full transparency.

998
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,926
I give you my word.

999
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,829
You want transparency?

1000
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:56,936
How fucking clear is this?

1001
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:37,382
Bobby Axelrod is
enriching the wife of one

1002
00:59:37,385 --> 00:59:39,885
who sits high atop the
federal power structure

1003
00:59:39,987 --> 00:59:42,268
in the government and I intend
to explode the whole thing.

1004
00:59:44,124 --> 00:59:46,057
I don't know how your
wife got into the middle

1005
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:47,893
of all of this,
but somebody's got to fry.

1006
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:50,276
You think she can handle framing
someone who didn't do it?

1007
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,730
I expect you to do the right thing.

1008
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,498
That is exactly what I'll do.

1009
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,166
Physical evidence is being
planted at Axelrod's.

1010
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:59,136
He'll be behind bars for
the duration of his trial.

1011
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:08,557

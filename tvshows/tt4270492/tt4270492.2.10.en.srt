1
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:10,407
<i>Previously on Billions...</i>

2
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,475
There's someone I need you to see.

3
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:13,477
George Minchak.

4
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:15,384
She vets all of my candidates.

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,219
You want her to know everything.

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,089
I'm not really sure I'm
entirely comfortable with that.

7
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,258
Red!

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,935
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:25,761
Did I not pick up the body language?

10
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,163
I didn't get permission.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,933
Klaxon. Belgian car company.

12
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,635
They're headed for a recall.
Bottom's gonna drop out.

13
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:37,216
I had a craving for
Bistro Grisby last night.

14
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,374
We used to go there all the time.

15
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:41,487
- They closed four years ago.
- Sad.

16
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:44,452
Surveillance of a federal
employee is a Class E felony,

17
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,520
so if you want me to keep it up,

18
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,182
I'm gonna need to charge
you a higher rate.

19
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,850
Then it's a good day for business.

20
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,418
<i>Try Taylor Mason.</i>

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>Anything big Axe is wading into,</i>

22
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:55,090
Taylor's there with a snorkel mask.

23
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,458
<i>Divorces are hard.</i>

24
00:00:58,347 --> 00:00:59,394
So are marriages.

25
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,197
Yeah, I've heard other people say that.

26
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,031
Wendy Rhoades is a liability,

27
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:07,335
and I will never be okay
with the two of you talking.

28
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:11,473
I personally... won't see her.

29
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:15,009
I'm sure it must be hard for
you to not have access to him,

30
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:16,978
but we think it's best for everyone.

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,447
Which is why I set the policy.

32
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,227
Fuck.

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,929
Lara?

34
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,202
Boys?

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,774
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

36
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,574
Hey.

37
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,143
It's me.

38
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,678
You call me?

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,612
You can't just...

40
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:30,915
Will you just call me, please?

41
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,256
Get in.

42
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:04,294
Maybe lying in your
marriage was tolerated,

43
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,263
looked upon with leniency,

44
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:09,266
considered some sort
of fucked up foreplay,

45
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:12,435
but in my marriage in 15 years,

46
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:17,172
I have never lied to
my wife except once,

47
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:20,476
except about what was
said between you and me.

48
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:23,413
You were the only person who
could've told her about that.

49
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,848
So please, tell me,
what did you say to my wife?

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,316
She was under the impression

51
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:29,751
that our no-session
arrangement came from you.

52
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:30,685
I corrected her.

53
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:34,456
The words. The actual words.

54
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,927
I said I set the policy,

55
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,129
and that was the only
way I could work there.

56
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:44,833
I didn't mean to come
between you and Lara.

57
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,168
You of all people,

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,704
you know precisely what
response you're eliciting.

59
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:52,407
If you do it, you mean to do it.

60
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,778
Can I get out of the car now?

61
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:07,555
I'll call if we have
any other questions.

62
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,659
Or maybe I'll just show up.

63
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,029
Just got off the phone with Pacquin.

64
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,698
He sent these from the
house security cams.

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,133
She took four 10k
bricks out of the vault,

66
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,836
and we have her here with the boys

67
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,037
walking out of the house
with light luggage.

68
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,506
Rippling out.

69
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,910
The jets are on the ground,
the choppers are in the hangar,

70
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,710
and the residences,

71
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:32,212
Hamptons, the city apartment,

72
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:35,148
Aspen, Miami, the vineyard, all empty.

73
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,416
GPS on the car?

74
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,119
I disabled them all
months ago at your request.

75
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,955
Right. Fuck.

76
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,390
All three phones are off,

77
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:46,526
and they've not used the EZ Pass
or any other credit cards yet.

78
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,467
Cancel my morning sessions, please.

79
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,435
I'm not feeling so well.

80
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:58,671
I'll try to make it in by the afternoon.

81
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,739
Thanks.

82
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,475
Did you bring your tribute?

83
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,410
I...

84
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:06,345
I didn't ask you to speak.

85
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,916
And I don't want to look
at your pathetic face either.

86
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:16,788
You... are nothing.

87
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:24,837
Down.

88
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,600
Time for me to make my preparations.

89
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,905
Don't move a muscle.

90
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:48,153
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

91
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,754
Hey, look, look, I'm not,

92
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:53,258
I'm not trying to make an excuse,
but, you know,

93
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,527
I was... I was trying to protect you,

94
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,697
and I know you weren't happy
with Wendy coming back,

95
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,966
and I was trying to respect that.

96
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,635
I'm trying to give you comfort.

97
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:07,038
Maybe I could've done it different.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,305
I... I don't know,

99
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,943
but you could've done
this a different way, too.

100
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,651
<i>So, Ms. Minchak,
how should we proceed?</i>

101
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,321
My goal is to do oppo
before they do oppo,

102
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:26,890
so if there is a potential
October surprise,

103
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:30,660
we drop it in February during
the fucking Super Bowl.

104
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,063
I like the thinking.

105
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:35,164
Like the thinking, and as I said,

106
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,934
you're welcome here for
as long as you need.

107
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:40,303
I know that Wendy has the homestead,

108
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:44,908
and the Yale Club has a few
too many prying eyes for...

109
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,476
Yes, thank you.

110
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:48,711
<i>Are you sure no coffee?</i>

111
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,079
No, thank you.

112
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,780
Pound cake.

113
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,449
Seventy percent sour cream.

114
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:56,685
This works best one on one.

115
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,787
Of course.

116
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,990
I'll just...

117
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:03,291
I'll be... I'll be right...
right inside,

118
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:06,128
in case you need anything.

119
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:17,940
So...

120
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,741
How should we do this?

121
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,843
Why are you asking me?

122
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:26,414
Keep it interesting.

123
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,750
I've done, first couple levels,

124
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,219
the dirty stuff those pop-up ads

125
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,688
promised to find on your
high-school sweetheart.

126
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,357
Those websites actually work?

127
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,125
More than they should.

128
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:39,226
I do it myself, though.

129
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:42,496
I search the TROs,
the DUls, the tax liens.

130
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:43,597
You were fine there.

131
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,299
Tomorrow starts the deep dive,

132
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,069
your receipts, browser history,

133
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,871
interviewing those who have known you

134
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:52,339
- intimately since school days.
- Jesus.

135
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,674
It's a shit show.

136
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:56,710
Today, though, you ever go to SeaWorld?

137
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:58,945
No. I've never been to
one of those places.

138
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,914
- The mistreatment of the...
- Right.

139
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,351
Whale's got to jump and flip
whether he wants to or not.

140
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,954
But then he gets his herring.

141
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,122
Quite so.

142
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,524
Today, though, you're that whale.

143
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:14,194
I'm gonna run through a list of areas.

144
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,396
You'll let me know...

145
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:18,665
if we have an issue.

146
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,906
Fire away.

147
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,275
- Aborted pregnancies?
- No.

148
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,044
Unwanted sexual
advances in the workplace?

149
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:32,912
No.

150
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:34,847
- Fiscal malfeasance?
- No.

151
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,851
- Hiring of undocumented workers?
- No. None of those.

152
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,320
- Cheating?
- No.

153
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,954
- Same-sex exploration...
- No.

154
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,356
Membership of racially-exclusive clubs?

155
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,758
No.

156
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,127
Okay. Let's get personal.

157
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,096
The separation, where are we on that?

158
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,697
In counseling.

159
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,965
Is it working?

160
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,267
It's a process.

161
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,303
Can that process be complete
by the time we announce?

162
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,372
'Cause we need to know
what we're selling,

163
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,807
- and that can't be a process.
- Noted.

164
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,843
Will she be a problem if you split?

165
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,844
No.

166
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,780
No... bad mouthing, blackmail?

167
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,809
No.

168
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,517
Such a perfect fucking couple,

169
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,319
why are you getting a divorce?

170
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,854
I didn't say we were.

171
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,555
Well, shit,

172
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,490
given her ties to Wall Street,

173
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,525
no tragedy if it goes that way.

174
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,298
Hi. What can I get you?

175
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,933
I know what you're having.

176
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,502
They'll have a double shot
almond milk latte to go.

177
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,637
Do I know you?

178
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,439
Name on that's Taylor Amber Mason.

179
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,075
And I'll have a Macchiato.

180
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,377
Name's Bryan Connerty.

181
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,146
You've been following me.

182
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,321
Taylor, you don't know me,

183
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,190
but I think we should get acquainted.

184
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,558
You talk like a cop but
dress like a lawyer.

185
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,927
- I'm a U.S. Attorney.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,128
So, why would I want

187
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,097
- further acquaintance?
- Because you work

188
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,937
at Axe Capital, and I'm the guy
who can keep your life

189
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:04,044
- from becoming a nightmare.
- I like nightmares.

190
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,879
When I wake up,
they leave me deeply valuing my reality.

191
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,471
But nice chatting.

192
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,945
My bad. You know what, my bad.

193
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:19,816
I always felt Ed Harris went
too hard at Mitch McDeere

194
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,483
in that diner when they first met.

195
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:23,686
Should've made him feel safe,
not threatened,

196
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,989
and here I went the other way,
but I do want you to feel safe.

197
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,791
Can't do that.

198
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:31,928
- How do you mean?
- Mix character and actor.

199
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,896
You either go Ed Harris and Tom Cruise

200
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,664
or Wayne Tarrance and Mitch McDeere.

201
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,166
Right. Good point.

202
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,600
Taylor.

203
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,703
Why don't we go drink
our coffees together?

204
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,838
You can tell me about
the last few months,

205
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,770
how you got here,
where you think it's going.

206
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:47,476
- I'm a good listener.
- Can't. Got to get to work.

207
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,077
That's where I'm going.

208
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,979
You must know what time I arrive by.

209
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,315
Wouldn't it look weird
if I showed up late?

210
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,515
Another time.

211
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,743
- Nope.
- Sorry, can't let it go.

212
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,345
I've been watching you pace
about five miles in here.

213
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,280
What the fuck's going on with you?

214
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,282
Lara took off this
morning with the boys.

215
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:29,750
Where are they headed?

216
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:36,523
Took off. Unannounced took off.

217
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,858
Why?

218
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,693
She caught me in a lie.

219
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,128
How do you know?

220
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,597
She left me a note. "You lied to me."

221
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:45,699
Fuck.

222
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,101
How you gonna figure out
what she's referring to?

223
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:50,937
I already know
'cause it was the only one.

224
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:55,509
You truly are a black swan.

225
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,110
Talk to the brothers and sisters?

226
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,310
- They haven't heard from her.
- You believe those hillbillies?

227
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,681
They probably have her
hidden under the floorboards.

228
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,355
Good luck.

229
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,462
Hello?

230
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:18,063
<i>Roberto, it's Larry Boyd.</i>

231
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,132
- Hey.
- I need to talk to you.

232
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,134
<i>- We're talking.
- No, I need to tell you</i>

233
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,136
<i>- something important.
- Go ahead.</i>

234
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,639
This is Mark Felt
in the parking garage. No phone.

235
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:29,408
It's kind of a bad day for me, Larry.
I'll send Wags up?

236
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,411
As much as he might brighten
these halls, it's got to be you.

237
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,845
<i>I'm at my work-release job.</i>

238
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,714
100 North Business Circle Road.
I'll be here all day.

239
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:39,017
Trust me. It'll be worth the trip.

240
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,585
<i>- I'll make it.
- Good.</i>

241
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,355
<i>And if you could bring
me a bottle of 20 year old,</i>

242
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:44,589
it would be appreciated.

243
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:51,496
What the fuck do you call this?

244
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:53,054
Analysis?

245
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,102
You're supposed to be supporting
a short play on Klaxon.

246
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,203
Right.

247
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:00,872
But your numbers don't do the job.

248
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,407
Best I could make them.

249
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,211
Okay.

250
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,180
We're meeting over there at noon, yes?

251
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,882
Yeah. And bring your wallet.

252
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:16,587
You do anything disgusting
with your daddy's money?

253
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,222
Excuse me?

254
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,690
Raucous party,

255
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,193
orgies with buttered-up fatties?

256
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,395
Rubenesque, please.

257
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,263
And, no, nothing like that.

258
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,634
Don't think you're doing
your daddy or Jack Foley

259
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:33,637
or certainly yourself any
favors by holding back.

260
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,938
I'm not.

261
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,940
You're still trying to control this.

262
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,310
You can't micromanage a campaign.

263
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:43,113
Once it gets started,
it's shooting Class five rapids.

264
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,316
You need a goddamn life jacket
no matter how fast you paddle.

265
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,450
I know.

266
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,421
Then let's try a trust fall.

267
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:54,357
- Seriously?
- No.

268
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,493
I don't care how you feel about this,

269
00:13:57,495 --> 00:14:01,664
but unless you want to end up
the subject of a cautionary documentary,

270
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,801
better start telling me the things
that you're afraid to whisper

271
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,103
that you've been keeping inside.

272
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,940
Even because you think it's your fault,

273
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:14,043
like a priest gently sodomizing you.

274
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,911
Might not be able to absolve you,

275
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:20,115
but can offer you the next best thing.

276
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:21,450
Safe harbor.

277
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,262
Bullying.

278
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,465
We call it hazing.

279
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,468
It had a different ring back then.

280
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,141
We have evolved on these
issues awfully quickly.

281
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:53,314
This one kid...

282
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,616
bit of a loner.

283
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:59,493
And, a... prig.

284
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,323
Well, just a tattle tale, really.

285
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,925
And one night,

286
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:08,062
he got the Code Red
treatment at boarding school.

287
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:09,663
Did you lead it?

288
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:14,902
Just say that I was a part of it.

289
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,503
Never got it out of my mind.

290
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,505
He kill himself?

291
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,874
No.

292
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,543
He went on to the ivy league.

293
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,052
What, do you need something, Dad?

294
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,350
I thought I heard you call for me.

295
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:32,552
I thought I heard my boy
saying he needed me.

296
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:33,853
No, Dad, we're fine.

297
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:36,022
We'll wrap for the day.

298
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,025
Looking forward to the next part.

299
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:45,131
Seems that went well.

300
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,633
Yeah.

301
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,335
Tight little body.

302
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:50,369
Dad.

303
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,837
<i>Well, she's not vetting me.</i>

304
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,706
Thank God for that.

305
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,819
Fuck.

306
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:14,325
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

307
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,460
You know what?

308
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:17,162
You leaving is one thing,

309
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:20,298
but taking my boys, what the fuck?

310
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,868
I don't get pissed
and look to punish you.

311
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,370
And, you know,
whatever you think of Wendy Rhoades,

312
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,938
she's good for Axe Cap,
and what is good for Axe Cap

313
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,824
is good for us.

314
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,381
And what's good for us is good for you.

315
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:35,213
Why don't you know that?
You used to know that.

316
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,152
How'd it go?

317
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,452
Taylor Mason took my card.

318
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,521
Cautiously optimistic,
that she's gonna...

319
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:47,758
I'm not used to this
gender pronoun thing

320
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,361
- yet... that they'll reach out.
- And what makes you think that?

321
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:53,727
Their politics run
pretty far to the left.

322
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,470
They contribute to the
Urban Justice Center.

323
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,799
- That's a good outfit.
- Active in Occupy Wall Street

324
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,880
during their college years.

325
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,250
So there's hope this person
might still have a heart.

326
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,554
I don't think their hard drive's
been reformatted yet to wipe out

327
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,890
the conscience feature.

328
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:11,715
I'll...

329
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,488
I found Antoine Casson.

330
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:25,729
Excellent. Thank you for your effort.

331
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:41,310
Guys.

332
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,318
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

333
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,687
<i>Quit fucking breaking my balls.
I'm coming.</i>

334
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:01,563
- What are you doing here?
- Just following up.

335
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,465
I told you on the phone she's not here.

336
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,245
I know what you said.

337
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:06,434
You thought I was fucking lying to you?

338
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,202
Get your ass away from my house.

339
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,971
Your house which I bought for you?

340
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,073
You don't own it any
more than you own her.

341
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:15,310
Hey, Matt. Everything all right?

342
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,711
Yeah.

343
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:20,081
Just my asshole
brother-in-law trespassing.

344
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,116
Maybe you should call the cops.

345
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,789
Sometimes women go running,

346
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,091
and their husbands learn a lesson.

347
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,093
Snap to.

348
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,628
More often, though,
same guy that chased her away

349
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,531
through abuse, neglect,

350
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,900
needs her back.

351
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,370
And if and when she comes back,
he's worse.

352
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,340
Punishes her for leaving.

353
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,709
We come around, check on the situation,

354
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,927
but now she's too afraid to run again,

355
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:56,783
so sometimes what we do is when
we get a real hard fucking type,

356
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,286
we get a carpet, roll the guy up in it,

357
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,854
and beat the fuck out of him.

358
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,125
Carpet blunts the noise
and contains the mess.

359
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,494
But the internal injuries are there.

360
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:12,699
You're a good brother.

361
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:19,472
Yeah...

362
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:37,656
Hey.

363
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:40,592
Hey. Are you busy?

364
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:43,595
No. I mean, yeah, but...

365
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:44,963
Never mind if you're busy.

366
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:46,665
No, no, no. What?

367
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:51,236
I'm gonna be in the neighborhood
and thought we'd get a coffee.

368
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:55,039
Hey, how about, a juice instead?

369
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,510
This is called In-a-Gadda-da-Greena.

370
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,512
It's got a little ginger kick.

371
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,982
And this is Hello Yellow.

372
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:07,585
And it's got, like,
nine different antioxidants.

373
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,356
- Sorry.
- Pick the one you want.

374
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,724
- I'm good with either.
- I'll go with the green.

375
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,531
I know that the tuition
is due for the kids.

376
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,266
If you could advance it for just...

377
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:25,636
Don't worry about it, Chuck.
Really. We have plenty of money.

378
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,904
<i>You mean you do.</i>

379
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:32,142
There's an imbalance.
I'm just trying to remedy that.

380
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,311
Okay.

381
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:36,413
Sure. Thanks.

382
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,151
What is it?

383
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,420
Why are you just in the neighborhood?

384
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,025
Do you ever feel alone,
a little scared sometimes?

385
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,326
I do, but you don't.

386
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:55,865
Luckily we have these antioxidants.

387
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:57,867
Those ought to do the trick.

388
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:03,005
This is more than just a
wave of loneliness, isn't it,

389
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,874
that you're not saying.

390
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,576
I mean, when it comes to
keeping in good mental health,

391
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,578
you're Jack LaLanne.

392
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,747
Everybody has their off days.

393
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:13,958
I guess I just wanted a little company.

394
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:17,220
Besides, we have therapy later.
We can hit whatever...

395
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:19,555
Sure. Okay.

396
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,290
Why waste it all in rehearsal?

397
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:27,095
<i>And this is your terrace.</i>

398
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,131
It's got 2,000 square feet,

399
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,901
Three hundred and sixty-degree views,
and as you can see,

400
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:35,671
it's fully planted and has
an automated watering system.

401
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,172
Wow.

402
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:38,940
- Pretty f'ing sweet.
- Have a look.

403
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,009
I'm gonna take this real quick.

404
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,281
This is ridiculous. You live here?

405
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,783
Twelve floors down
and two lines over, but...

406
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,852
Why don't you take this place?

407
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:52,587
Too much light.

408
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,689
Anyway, it's a bargain at $26,000.

409
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:57,191
Twenty-six thousand a month?

410
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:58,926
Place I live now costs twelve hundred.

411
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:01,929
Taylor, you're the golden child.

412
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,898
End of the year, Axe is gonna bonus you

413
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,733
one point five minimum.

414
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,434
Really?

415
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,538
Hey, can you do me a favor?

416
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,307
Axe is looking to make a
short play on Klaxon Auto.

417
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,410
Assigned the write-up to me,
which I kicked to Ben Kim.

418
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:19,279
Problem is,
Ben doesn't see it as a short.

419
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,814
The numbers don't support it.

420
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,217
I looked at it.
I don't think it is, either.

421
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,252
- So tell Axe that.
- Yeah.

422
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:28,889
I'd love to make the hero call,
stop Axe from losing money.

423
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,558
Last time I tried, he fired me.

424
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,393
So you want me to review it.

425
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,828
Would you?

426
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,030
I'm not saying I've got
fucking dyscalculia,

427
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,499
but if I'm gonna put my
ass on the chopping block,

428
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,801
I want to make sure I'm
not missing something.

429
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,271
Send the report over.
I'll take a look at it.

430
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,639
Thanks.

431
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:49,342
So? Anybody out here need a pen?

432
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:51,310
Can I get back to you?

433
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:54,480
It's hitting MLS tomorrow.
It'll be gone by lunch.

434
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:57,150
I'll get back to you tonight.

435
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,759
Thanks dude.

436
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:13,699
Yeah.

437
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,267
I have them at a go-kart track,

438
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,436
a place called Autobahn, for 90 minutes.

439
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,137
Leaving less than an hour ago.

440
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:21,639
<i>Anywhere near here
they might've headed?</i>

441
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,585
Yeah. Yeah, there was a spot there
she used to go when she was young.

442
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,511
She'd feel fortified there.

443
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:29,381
<i>- You want me to...
- No, no.</i>

444
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:30,531
I'll go.

445
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:35,753
Gents.

446
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,692
Hey, Axe. Lara said you'd be showing up.

447
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:42,460
You or someone who worked for you.

448
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,062
So she came in here?

449
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,964
Yep, her and the boys.

450
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,700
They fucking fleeced us
out of 20 bucks at darts.

451
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:50,801
Soon as we tried
to up the bet, they quit.

452
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,869
My boys. They saw the hustle coming.

453
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:54,171
Sure did.

454
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:57,908
Anyway, Lara said to give her space.

455
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,511
She was going to your place in the city,

456
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:02,879
and you could know that,
but to please respect.

457
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:04,715
She'll get in touch when she's ready.

458
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,917
And so I'm supposed to what?
Just fucking sit

459
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,352
- on my goddamn...
- You can press her.

460
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:12,255
But look, you know her better than us.

461
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:13,389
You do that and...

462
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:16,660
Yep. I'll make this look
like the Rose Parade.

463
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:22,766
Hey, it's me. I went to Terry's bar.

464
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:25,635
The memories came flooding back.

465
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:27,770
Us there at the beginning,

466
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,905
right after I got struck
by the thunderbolt

467
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:33,042
like Michael with Apollonia.

468
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:38,949
And I was thinking about
all that rail shit we used to drink,

469
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:42,322
but we were already drunk
from being with each other,

470
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:44,854
so we didn't care.

471
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:48,190
And then I flipped totally
to the other extreme.

472
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,395
To Paris. That rainy night.

473
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,698
We wouldn't get out of
bed even though the iPod

474
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,866
was playing
"With or Without You" on repeat,

475
00:24:57,868 --> 00:25:00,636
and so we ended up
listening to it all night.

476
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:04,406
And I was just thinking...

477
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:08,310
I was thinking how
deep it got between us.

478
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:12,181
And we promised that if
anything ever threatened us,

479
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:14,149
we'd remind ourselves of that night

480
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:17,418
and we'd try to find a way back to it.

481
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,389
And I'm reminding you
of that night right now.

482
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:25,927
Let's fight our way back to it.

483
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:28,730
Call me, please.

484
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,805
Thank you for finding the time,
Mr. Martinez.

485
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:40,074
What's the urgent matter?

486
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,142
My laptop was stolen by a client.

487
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:45,680
Can you tell me who?

488
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:48,082
Gave me a backstopped alias.

489
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:50,517
Came to me for three months.

490
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,753
Worked his way into my inner sanctum.

491
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,521
You think it's an attack against me?

492
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:56,824
You or one of my more prominent clients.

493
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:59,093
More prominent than I?

494
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,128
Should come as no surprise to you

495
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,096
the lifestyle attracts brilliant people.

496
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,065
Intricate temperaments.

497
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,835
Intricate tastes.

498
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:12,439
How protected is your information?

499
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:14,874
I have a deeply devoted
client from Palo Alto

500
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:17,244
who's in corporate cyber defense.

501
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:19,678
You may rest assured.

502
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,981
And if I were ever
approached personally...

503
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:25,517
I know that your relationships
are beyond transactional.

504
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,388
The idea of blackmailing someone
with something so close to their core,

505
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,491
- of punishing true expression...
- Understood.

506
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:35,061
Understood.

507
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:37,529
And thank you.

508
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,306
Pick that up.

509
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,688
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Martinez.

510
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,525
We should do it again
under other circumstances.

511
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:12,062
Once you've secured
proper permissions, of course.

512
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,265
Of course.

513
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,419
Did you find her?

514
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,255
Yes.

515
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,559
She went into the city
with the boys, but I don't...

516
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,060
know how to bring them home.

517
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,261
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,763
What do you want?

519
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,433
What I've always wanted, to help.

520
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,641
I was remembering...
when you first met her.

521
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,810
Me, too.

522
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,479
And you said you felt like
you'd known her forever.

523
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,582
Everyone else was sucking up, angling.

524
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:09,886
One date and you were
talking about marriage.

525
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,121
I was skeptical.

526
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:17,226
I thought that sort of thing
only happened in the Sicilian hills.

527
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,396
And then I met her.

528
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,331
Then it all made sense.

529
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,669
You know, she had three close friends

530
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,904
who lost their husbands on 9/11.

531
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:29,905
Firemen.

532
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:32,841
And she helped to prop them all up,

533
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,943
even after losing her own brother.

534
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,945
She helped them clean out their closets,

535
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,714
and you wouldn't think that
that was the toughest thing,

536
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:42,584
but the way they wept when they found

537
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,354
a favorite t-shirt or
an old varsity jacket

538
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,522
or a wedding suit.

539
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:50,492
And then about a week later,
something occurred to her,

540
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:53,327
and for all three of them,

541
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:57,532
she found a way to get
back into their bedrooms.

542
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,835
And she crawled under the beds

543
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:05,239
and retrieved the errant
slipper or sneaker.

544
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,611
She defended them from
those little land mines.

545
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:13,414
You don't talk about
that side of her much.

546
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:21,988
Look, I, um... I know that you feel bad.

547
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,759
But that doesn't fix anything
'cause I tried.

548
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,663
I'm limited to waiting now,

549
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,966
and you know the problem with that?

550
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:35,268
You fucking hate waiting.

551
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:00,292
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

552
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:03,095
Hey, it's me again.

553
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:05,331
You know what? Maybe I was wrong.

554
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,666
Maybe Wendy Rhoades isn't helping.

555
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:11,536
Maybe I should just blow her
the fuck out of our lives.

556
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:16,541
Whatever it takes to get you home,
get us talking again,

557
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:19,177
just say the word,

558
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,848
and I'll erase Wendy Rhoades
from our world forever.

559
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:32,323
Quick second date.

560
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,792
On the hazing,

561
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:37,595
the whole Code Red situation,

562
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:42,533
you were the victim,
not one of the aggressors.

563
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:44,602
You were Santiago, not Dawson.

564
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,407
Boy, they left me black and blue
anywhere my shirt would hide.

565
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:51,809
And you told on them?

566
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:53,276
No.

567
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:54,845
It had its desired effect.

568
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:57,347
I never breathed a word.

569
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:59,617
Until just now.

570
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:02,719
But later,

571
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:06,890
not a few days, two years later...

572
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:08,791
intramural baseball.

573
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:12,695
I was at bat,
the ringleader was catching.

574
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:16,433
And on one fast ball, I swung backwards.

575
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:19,335
Lefty.

576
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,404
Right into his face.

577
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,805
Was he wearing a mask?

578
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,574
Yeah, that's why his head stayed on,

579
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:28,745
but his jaw... shattered.

580
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,482
Now, is that gonna
come back and bite me?

581
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:36,652
If you hadn't told me,
could've ended your campaign,

582
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:40,856
but I know how to spin it
as a strong anti-bullying stance.

583
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:42,991
By the time I'm finished with you,

584
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:46,628
you'll be signing baseball bats
every time you appear in public.

585
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,031
Okay.

586
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:57,739
My biggest potential vulnerability.

587
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,077
Now it's in your hands.

588
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,547
Any chance the, operative
could've copied the hard drive on this?

589
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:10,351
No. He's a trusted.

590
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:24,199
I'll have my tech people run
a lice comb through this.

591
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,332
You'll let me know.

592
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,367
- And the owner of this?
- Also a trusted.

593
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,869
Hundred percent?

594
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,671
No such thing.

595
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:34,709
Now you're getting it. Good.

596
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:36,376
Good.

597
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:55,362
<i>I want to say something to you.</i>

598
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:56,701
I don't want you to find it insulting.

599
00:32:56,702 --> 00:32:59,265
- Okay.
- There may have been a time

600
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,480
when you understood the
psychological makeup of everyone

601
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,768
in the company,
when you knew whom to assign

602
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,688
any given task to in order to
achieve the desired result.

603
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,784
I know how my employees think.

604
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,444
You're saying I don't anymore?

605
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:12,812
You don't anymore.

606
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:14,180
Companies get bigger,

607
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:16,582
modes of governance and
delegation need to change

608
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:20,019
to keep pace, or... you get this.

609
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,392
It's not the best
short thesis on Klaxon,

610
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:28,361
but I thought Ben Kim could make it fly.

611
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:30,163
He couldn't. Mafee couldn't either.

612
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:31,519
Their numbers dictate it's a long,

613
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,033
- so that's all they could see.
- Fuck me.

614
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:36,301
Mafee's not dumb, he's not soft,

615
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:40,005
but he didn't understand or
wasn't willing to put on paper

616
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:42,374
what you needed him to put on paper.

617
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:43,809
What do you think that was?

618
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:46,178
Justification for later,

619
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,980
proof that a good case
could be made for the short.

620
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:50,415
What would you do?

621
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:53,185
It's not an auto play. Forget car sales.

622
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:55,587
Take a deep dive into
their financing department.

623
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:58,923
Look at 30- and 60-day delinquencies,
leasing, credit.

624
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:00,492
They're all stretched.

625
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:02,594
Every auto company is
pushing sales forward

626
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:03,795
with aggressive lending.

627
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:06,363
When that music stops,
there'll be no chairs left.

628
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:08,399
- But...
- But what?

629
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:12,070
But I assume there are other... factors

630
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:14,906
that are really dictating
your short play here.

631
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:18,843
Congratulations.

632
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,644
All the analysts now answer to you.

633
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:25,749
If I fill in those blanks,

634
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:28,118
- I have to put my name on it.
- Yeah.

635
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,753
Would that be a problem for you?

636
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:32,823
You know how
your employees think, right?

637
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,058
So you tell me.

638
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,099
Thanks for letting me up.

639
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,368
So, you won't do sessions with him,

640
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,803
but you'll be his messenger?

641
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,705
He doesn't know I'm here.

642
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:50,607
But he told you I was,

643
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:52,843
and he told you what's
going on between us.

644
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:55,111
I was in the middle.

645
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,679
You're always in the middle.

646
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:59,682
Do you really think that's the problem?

647
00:34:59,684 --> 00:35:02,585
I know there's something broken in him

648
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:04,354
that he thinks only you can fix.

649
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:06,155
It's not true.

650
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:08,224
Feels true.

651
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,592
And maybe if I got you
the fuck out of our way,

652
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:12,294
I'd get to fix it.

653
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,529
Or maybe it would heal all by itself.

654
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,465
Got me out of the way?

655
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,838
What kind of money would you
be making in the real world?

656
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,040
Lara.

657
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,142
Please, it is not about money for me.

658
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:29,244
- Let's make it about money.
- Don't do this.

659
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:32,347
Don't you dare be embarrassed for me.

660
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,117
What would it cost
to make you disappear?

661
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,988
Five, ten, twenty million?

662
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,257
- No.
- Why not?

663
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:44,025
Because the job means something to me.

664
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:45,626
If it ceases to, I'll go,

665
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,195
but money means too little to me

666
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:50,531
and I have too much of it
to make decisions that way.

667
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:52,500
Bobby's the same.

668
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:56,570
I know it.

669
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,239
And you love it.

670
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,841
You married a guy who does
whatever the fuck he wants

671
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:05,212
because he has no reason
not to except you.

672
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,349
He's a steamroller.

673
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:11,485
Wasn't that part of the attraction?

674
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:21,394
You scared him.

675
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:25,098
In all this time...

676
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,135
I've never seen fear in him.

677
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,402
Not till today.

678
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:36,443
It should all be simpler.

679
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,747
I don't know if it should be.
I know... it isn't.

680
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:49,055
If we make it through this...

681
00:36:49,057 --> 00:36:53,960
does it get stronger on the other side?

682
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,162
I don't know yet.

683
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,431
I hope so.

684
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:06,137
Forgive.

685
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:07,239
If you can.

686
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:43,007
Axe is asking if you
have the Klaxon research.

687
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,676
I got it right here.
Just haven't signed it yet.

688
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:49,146
So, should I tell him he's getting it?

689
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,382
I've got it right here.

690
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:52,817
Just haven't signed it yet.

691
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:55,585
Okay.

692
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:10,467
Thanks for the call.
I appreciate you coming in.

693
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:12,302
Thanks for seeing me on short notice.

694
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:13,670
Yeah.

695
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:16,706
I got you a latte.

696
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,075
And I don't know what
kind of cookies you like,

697
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:20,744
so there's a variety.

698
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:23,346
Thank you.

699
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:31,554
We've long suspected
criminal activity at Axe Capital.

700
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,721
I'm aware.

701
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,123
And part of our work

702
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,592
is to research the
personnel of the company

703
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:39,095
and to find within it
a sympathetic partner.

704
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,030
And you think I fit that description?

705
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:44,322
Yes. Because your background tells me
you're an intelligent...

706
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:48,003
a good person,

707
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:52,575
so I'm just gonna come out and ask.

708
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:55,210
Is there anything you see at Axe Capital

709
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:59,014
that offends your sense of fairness,
of right and wrong?

710
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:02,417
What are you asking about?
Fairness or right and wrong?

711
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:07,522
Most people consider
those the same thing.

712
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:11,159
A stock is like a living organism,

713
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:12,461
a sparrow, say.

714
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:14,596
And we are able to
create an emergent-based

715
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:15,998
abstraction of that sparrow,

716
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,265
which closely approximates
the sparrow itself,

717
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:20,134
accounting for migration patterns,

718
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:22,203
wind, weather, and other variables.

719
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:24,505
We can create a similar
abstraction of a stock,

720
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:27,107
combining the information
from the specific ETFs

721
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:29,376
which represent its
underlying dependencies.

722
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:31,077
And if we apply this to the stock,

723
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,379
we can predict its delta,

724
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:34,381
following the path of
its abstracted self

725
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:36,182
because nature follows abstraction.

726
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,419
I'm sorry. You lost me.
Let's start again.

727
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,054
You sure you don't want a cookie?

728
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,124
- I'm not going to eat a cookie.
- Okay.

729
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:46,626
The reason Ed Harris can
get tough with Tom Cruise

730
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:49,195
is because he knows Cruise
has seen the bodies.

731
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:51,898
- Harris has something on him.
- That's right.

732
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,833
But you're coming on with cookies.

733
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:57,136
Telling me you're not
leveraging me because you think

734
00:39:57,138 --> 00:40:00,640
it's the kinder,
more profitable approach.

735
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:03,175
There's a simpler answer, though.

736
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:04,710
You have no leverage.

737
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:07,312
You have nothing on Axe
Cap and even less on me.

738
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:08,915
Whoa, whoa, hey. Let's just...

739
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,683
No. We're done here.

740
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,689
How'd that go?

741
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,591
I'm no Ed Harris.

742
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,532
Hey, sit a minute.

743
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:28,100
Busy.

744
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,103
Well, sit anyway.

745
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:33,504
No, I got pies to make.

746
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,909
Come on, they can wait five minutes.

747
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,545
Quick catch up.

748
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:42,447
You're my business partner.

749
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:46,184
So you get the slice
and a Coke on the arm.

750
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,120
But that don't buy you
a conversation with me.

751
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,190
Anything else I can get you?

752
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:54,525
No.

753
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,257
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

754
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:29,659
You're punishing me. I get it. I get it.

755
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,028
I have never punished you.
Not once. Not once.

756
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,499
I'm making one mistake, and fine, fine.

757
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:37,233
It's not a contest.

758
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:42,238
You think I can't control this, or you?

759
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,041
That you're teaching me some,
some fucking lesson?

760
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:48,544
I teach the fucking lessons,
and you are about to get one.

761
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,380
Lar, I will lock you the fuck down

762
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:53,415
and operate you by
fucking remote control

763
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:56,519
with a flick of my
motherfucking fingers, Lar!

764
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:58,621
You don't believe me?
Try me, goddamn it.

765
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:01,157
You want to,
you want to take this vacation,

766
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,724
this, this adventure?

767
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:04,527
Have it, go for it! Get it out.

768
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:06,962
Then come the fuck home!

769
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:24,880
Larry.

770
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:26,714
Bobby.

771
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:29,450
Thanks for coming. How are you?

772
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:32,287
Frankly, I've had better days.

773
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,222
But given your circumstances,

774
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:36,924
I've got no business complaining.

775
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:38,459
How are you holding up?

776
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:42,396
Better man might turn the experience
into a spiritual journey,

777
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:43,597
and through humility,

778
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,933
find some deeper
understanding of the self.

779
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:48,836
I spend each and every day
hoping for the end of it.

780
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:50,671
Anesthetic?

781
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:52,707
Appreciated, but I was just dreaming.

782
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,141
They piss test me randomly.

783
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,510
Well, maybe take a risk.

784
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:04,251
So, what's on your mind?

785
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:06,486
Revenge.

786
00:43:06,488 --> 00:43:08,955
You really aren't feeling spiritual.

787
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:12,292
I got word from the
boys at Spartan-Ives.

788
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:15,061
Chuck Rhoades Sr.
Has taken a significant stake

789
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:17,030
in a company that's going public.

790
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:19,933
Ice Juice.

791
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,601
No shit.

792
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:24,503
And insofar as you
hate the Rhoades family

793
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:25,872
almost as much as I do...

794
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,874
That could be pleasant.

795
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:30,977
Be fun if you could find a way
to lob a turd in the punch bowl.

796
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:33,312
Yeah. Real fun.

797
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:37,049
I'll make sure to take
a sizable allocation.

798
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,651
So you'd have cover.

799
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:43,489
Yeah, take the free money up front,
throw it into reverse,

800
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,658
and I'd short every
tick on the way down.

801
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,892
Worth the trip?

802
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:49,694
Yeah.

803
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,030
Yeah, worth the trip.

804
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,864
How was the rest of your day?

806
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:29,566
- It didn't get much better.
- Sorry.

807
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:31,869
Last fucking thing I want to do is this.

808
00:44:33,472 --> 00:44:35,439
Honestly...

809
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,508
that's great to hear
I'm not the only one.

810
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,777
I thought you fucking loved this stuff.

811
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:41,412
Like it was oxygen to you.

812
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:43,280
I recognize its value.

813
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:46,750
Are you just gonna go off?

814
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:51,021
Or, do you want some company?

815
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:55,225
Just the two of us, you know,
talking without a paid referee.

816
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:57,427
I think we're capable of that.

817
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:58,962
Yeah.

818
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:02,299
Seeing you this afternoon,
I don't know, it felt...

819
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:04,067
- Comfortable.
- Yeah.

820
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,568
That.

821
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:08,671
Can I buy you dinner?

822
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,608
I'd like that. I'm starving.

823
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,845
I know exactly where we should go.

824
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,415
It's a bit far afield, but,
it'll be worth it.

825
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,483
Where is it?

826
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,521
Trust me. Come on.

827
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:33,362
Hey.

828
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,130
Hey.

829
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,665
Any progress on the home front?

830
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,902
Nothing to speak of yet.

831
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,404
I'll buy you a drink.

832
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,472
No.

833
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,674
I've got some leftover
pharmaceutical-grade...

834
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:46,675
No.

835
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,610
Handjob?

836
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:51,780
Rain check.

837
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,791
Bonus Taylor five hundred k.

838
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:05,626
- At the end of the year?
- No. Now.

839
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:08,596
Mid-semester bonus.
The real one's still coming.

840
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:10,932
Should I move their desk
closer to the bimah?

841
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:14,135
Fitting for the new head of research

842
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:17,772
who understands what the job entails
and is willing to execute it.

843
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,107
I will make that happen.

844
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,219
What is this place?

845
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:33,486
Welcome.

846
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:35,789
Do you have a reservation
with us this evening?

847
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,791
- Yes, under Rhoades.
- Of course, yes.

848
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:40,093
Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.
We've been expecting you.

849
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:41,698
Right this way.

850
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:45,966
<i>Monsieur Le Prosecutor.</i>

851
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:49,636
I swear to God I'm too
busy cooking the food

852
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:50,670
to cook the books.

853
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,040
You know,
being a criminal takes hard work.

854
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,341
You're French.

855
00:46:55,343 --> 00:46:56,682
I don't have to worry about it.

856
00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:59,913
Who is this college girl
you brought with you?

857
00:46:59,915 --> 00:47:01,481
Antoine.

858
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:02,982
Mwah, mwah.

859
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:07,219
Look at you with that face.
My God, you shame the angels.

860
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:11,023
<i>Asseyez vous. S'il vous plaît.</i>

861
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:17,563
<i>Amelie, pas de menu.
Ce n'est pas necessaire.</i>

862
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:19,465
I have a few ideas.

863
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:21,500
- Antoine...
- Don't worry.

864
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:23,335
You're going to get your Coq Au Vin.

865
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:25,103
Thank you, my friend.

866
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:26,805
<i>Je vous en prie, mes amis.</i>

867
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:31,042
How did you find him?

868
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,113
Here's to the long arm of the law.

869
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:54,899
I'm sad that's over.

870
00:47:59,238 --> 00:48:02,172
Listen, Wend.

871
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:04,809
A lot has come up I need
to talk to you about.

872
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,644
Go ahead.

873
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:09,246
There has been some movement.

874
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:12,483
The right influencers are
backing me for a run at Albany.

875
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:17,621
Your father must be
frothing at the mouth.

876
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:19,323
Jesus.

877
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:21,392
<i>Like the end of Old Yeller.</i>

878
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:22,993
I mean, I may have to shoot him.

879
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:28,098
Congratulations.

880
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:34,037
You know, it occurs to me

881
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,573
the reason you were in
the neighborhood earlier.

882
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,675
The thing we were gonna
discuss in therapy,

883
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:39,776
we haven't discussed.

884
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,616
There's this person I...

885
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:49,519
haven't liked much lately,

886
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:51,020
maybe fairly, maybe unfairly.

887
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:53,156
I don't know.

888
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:56,625
But she knew you and I were
going through tough times.

889
00:48:56,627 --> 00:49:00,996
So she was extra smug and condescending

890
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:04,767
when it came to the sanctity
of her own marriage.

891
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:08,170
And then I learned something
that I knew would hurt her.

892
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:14,777
And I just couldn't resist
punching her in the face with it.

893
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:18,080
It's a natural urge.

894
00:49:18,082 --> 00:49:19,714
But it didn't make you feel good.

895
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:20,949
No, it did.

896
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,452
For a second.
It was a fucking electric thrill.

897
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:29,623
But no, after I...
kind of hate myself for it.

898
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:33,160
Which is why you're rare and special.

899
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:36,964
I know that you hold
yourself to a higher standard

900
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:38,966
because you're a therapist,

901
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:42,168
but you're also human.

902
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,437
And you and I both know

903
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,440
it's your humanity that makes
you so good at what you do.

904
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:51,544
So maybe you just let
yourself off with a warning.

905
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,515
Thank you.

906
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,586
Hey.

907
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:00,853
Yeah?

908
00:50:00,855 --> 00:50:03,156
Antoine's right.

909
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:05,958
You shame the angels.

910
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,693
You really do.

911
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:23,542
I'll drop it at the garage
on my way back to the club.

912
00:50:23,544 --> 00:50:25,244
Thank you.

913
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:29,015
Chuck, that was lovely.

914
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:31,716
Yes, it sure was.

915
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:52,704
<i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i>

916
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:54,873
Do you know what the other rich guys do?

917
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,408
Pendleton? Krakow?

918
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,378
The fucking Russian guys
with the prostitute yacht

919
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,781
five hundred yards
behind the family yacht?

920
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,916
The fucking opportunities I've had.

921
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:10,721
<i>And I have not wavered once</i>

922
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:13,023
in 15 years!

923
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:15,459
I get no credit for that?

924
00:51:15,461 --> 00:51:17,328
For the life that I've built?

925
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,930
For the kind of man I am?

926
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:21,832
Fuck.

927
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:25,169
I could've been out every single night.

928
00:51:25,171 --> 00:51:30,107
Models, musicians,
your own so-called friends.

929
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:32,743
I could've done you like that.

930
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:35,079
Maybe I should have.

931
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:37,447
I get the same treatment from you now,

932
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:39,382
but at least then, I'd have earned it

933
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,751
by getting my fucking rocks off.

934
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:45,522
Yeah.

935
00:51:45,524 --> 00:51:48,157
<i>Front gate, sir. Missus is here.</i>

936
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:50,694
Thanks.

937
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:05,908
Hey.

938
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,845
<i>Chuck. Come home tonight.</i>

939
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,880
Is that an order?

940
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:13,682
<i>Damn right it is.</i>

941
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:25,728
I really appreciate
your coming out so late.

942
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,130
That's the kind of service
you can expect from me

943
00:52:28,132 --> 00:52:32,200
when you're ready to move up
from this and buy something.

944
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,976
Welcome home.

945
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:55,222
Hey, how are ya?

946
00:52:57,694 --> 00:52:59,960
Kiss your dad goodnight
and straight upstairs.

947
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:01,162
Be right up.

948
00:53:01,164 --> 00:53:02,163
Goodnight, Dad.

949
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:03,363
- All right.
- Night, Dad.

950
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:05,232
Okay, see you in the morning, fellas.

951
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:10,704
How was your night?

952
00:53:10,706 --> 00:53:13,107
Fine.

953
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:15,542
I tried calling.

954
00:53:15,544 --> 00:53:17,844
Phone's been off.

955
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,148
I thought long and hard
about the thunderbolt today.

956
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:27,253
Apollonia got blown up
by a fucking car bomb.

957
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,057
I'm going to put the boys to bed.

958
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:13,165
Take your fucking clothes off.

959
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:21,166

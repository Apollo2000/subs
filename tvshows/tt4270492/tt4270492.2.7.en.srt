165
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:36,048
You said you wanted to
spend the day with him.

166
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,216
Yeah, I said I wanted to spend
time with him, and I did.

167
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,310
You used him as a prop.

168
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,845
Which you swore you'd never do,

169
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,814
since that's exactly what
your father did to you.

170
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,050
[sighs]

171
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:48,552
We spent the morning at the park.

172
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,254
And a reporter happened upon us

173
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:51,621
because, at the moment,

174
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,757
I am news-worthy.

175
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,059
Finally in a good way.

176
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,161
I'm sure it's a wonderful
lesson for Kevin

177
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,362
- on what really matters.
- Indeed it was.

178
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:01,064
He got to run around a little bit,

179
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,099
and he got some exposure

180
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,835
as to how you finesse relations
with the fourth estate.

181
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:08,271
[scoffs]

182
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,941
That is exactly the kind of half-truth

183
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:13,877
that's led to our current situation.

184
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,644
As is your failure to tell me

185
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,680
you were going back to work for Axelrod.

186
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:18,621
Oh, my God.

187
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:22,585
Oh, I had to<i> Columbo</i>
that one for myself.

188
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,287
Yet it seems that I'm required

189
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,722
to disclose every detail
of how I spend my time.

190
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,215
No, you're not.
When it comes to the kids,

191
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,419
yes, complete transparency,
but otherwise,

192
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,995
you don't have to share anything,
so you know, go.

193
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:35,230
Do whatever the fuck you want,
and so will I.

194
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:38,333
Oh, there it goes. There it goes.

195
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,249
Your justification...

196
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,384
slid in there so maybe I
would realize it later.

197
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,942
But there it was.

198
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,780
You want the freedom
to see other people.

199
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,619
Yes.

200
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,122
I want freedom...

201
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,490
all around.

202
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:03,125
And I would be free, as well.

203
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,026
Consider that door open.

204
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,329
You're really saying those words?

205
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,798
Yes, I am.

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,001
For both of us.

207
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,237
Wendy.

208
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,605
What?

209
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,875
I'll see you tomorrow.

210
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:27,148
♪<i> dramatic music</i> ♪

211
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,551
♪♪♪

212
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,453
So, it's fallen upon all of you

213
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,321
to figure out how to get us un-fucked.

214
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,089
The gaming license was the guarantee

215
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,958
that Sandicot would pay off the notes.

216
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,694
Now, the license is gone,
the area is going to default,

217
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,796
and we're about to eat a half a billion,

218
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,932
including 100 mill in
fresh capital we put in.

219
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,467
Any suggestions?

220
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,305
There's no road to raising tax revenues.

221
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,207
I don't give a shit what we don't have.

222
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,376
I need to know the roads
that are open to us

223
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,778
or the ground that can
be cleared to make one.

224
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,181
Isn't there anyone we
can sell this turd to?

225
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,383
Not without taking a
nine-figure haircut.

226
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,084
Same goes for restructuring.

227
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:06,786
This thing stinks like Billy Batts

228
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:07,987
in the trunk right now.

229
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,923
Austerity.

230
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,693
You don't need to whisper
it like it's some dark spell

231
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,795
that'll come true if
you say it too loudly.

232
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,596
It kind of is, though, isn't it?

233
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,836
Yeah. Because once you say it,

234
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,338
you realize it's your only option.

235
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,573
Austerity.

236
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,974
Okay. Step it out for everyone.

237
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:34,879
Well, the note exchange requires
that the town pay you first,

238
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,148
before any of its other
financial obligations,

239
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,384
like union contracts with town workers,

240
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,186
teachers' salaries, all that.

241
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,254
Austerity just means you enforce that.

242
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,091
Yes. Go ahead, seize their assets,

243
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,926
like Singer did in Argentina.

244
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,227
What kind of assets?

245
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,629
Sandicot is not an entire
South American country.

246
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,402
Right. We wouldn't be
skimming cream off the top.

247
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:55,900
We'd be gutting them for their organs,

248
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,368
like in a Korean horror movie.

249
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,105
You'd be mostly looking at land,
buildings, and utilities.

250
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,873
Town also has an original Remington.

251
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,509
It's worth upwards of $900,000.

252
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,877
The fuck's a Remington?

253
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,913
Frederic. American artist
from the 19th century.

254
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:12,516
He specialized in
depictions of the Old West.

255
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,087
I took Art History for the automatic A.

256
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,421
Some of it stuck.

257
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:20,624
If you force them to pay you,

258
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,726
the county would have
to severely cut back

259
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,662
on its municipal workforce,
roll back labor contracts,

260
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,397
and pillage its pension funds.

261
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,733
Eventually they'd have
to shutter some schools,

262
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,468
leading to overpopulated classrooms

263
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,202
and forced free periods.

264
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:36,172
Decreased graduation rates,
increased crime.

265
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:39,709
They would be consolidation
of hospitals, fire houses.

266
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:41,944
There would also be
cuts in police manpower.

267
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:44,046
Which would bring other
kinds of problems.

268
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,515
The effects are viral.

269
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:47,350
The losses spin off to the businesses

270
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:49,218
that provide services to the town.

271
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,087
Other area businesses start to close,

272
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,656
and more jobs are lost.

273
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,925
Won't all this be a PR nightmare?

274
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,995
PR that comes with losing that
much money is a nightmare, too.

275
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,663
And we lose the money.

276
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:03,199
I don't like any of the
answers I'm hearing.

277
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,268
There has to be a way to get this done

278
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,336
without destroying the place.

279
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,305
Model it up for me.

280
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,507
All scenarios.

281
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,350
Son, I did something today

282
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,853
that is gonna absolutely floor you.

283
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,454
I thought you went golfing today.

284
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:29,390
I did. Played my 18,

285
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:33,195
and then I withdrew my membership
from the Garden City Golf Club.

286
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:36,164
Oh, that's your natural habitat.

287
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,335
Few places a man can be as comfortable.

288
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,203
But it was time.

289
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:44,238
They don't allow women.

290
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,241
And I cannot be a member of
a restricted club anymore.

291
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:48,343
Noble.

292
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,178
Anticipatory. Of the future.

293
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,847
That's baked right into the word.

294
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:56,150
Your future,
which should start right now.

295
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,052
It's unethical for me to run while...

296
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,455
The Tappan Institute
commissioned a poll.

297
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:05,392
Oh, your buddy Tate Tappan's
think tank just happened...

298
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,760
Independent.

299
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:09,163
No connection to me.

300
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,865
The results are quite...

301
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:14,067
I don't want to hear anything about it.

302
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:18,104
[sighs]

303
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:21,140
No, I've just gotten out
from under a cloud.

304
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:23,943
If word leaks out about a
poll while I'm in office,

305
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:26,646
that is gonna be a darker cloud.

306
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,714
What is this, then?

307
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,019
That's Camelot right there.

308
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,620
Don't try to spin it.

309
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:38,892
That is a picture of a
man running for office.

310
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,230
You're doing more than
just dreaming about it.

311
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,965
I'll send you those poll results.

312
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,201
I think they're gonna be encouraging.

313
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:55,574
But you're gonna have to
resolve things with Wendy.

314
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:59,111
You cannot be an effective candidate

315
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,013
if your marriage is in the crapper.

316
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,282
That's not really a thing anymore, Dad.

317
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,984
That I'd need a woman standing
behind me on the podium,

318
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:08,120
that's archaic. [scoffs]

319
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:12,257
Son, you do know why you need her
in your life, don't you?

320
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:19,063
She is a natural-born killer.

321
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:22,667
That's what she builds,
all day... killers.

322
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,771
You're a good candidate.

323
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:29,607
She'd make you unstoppable.

324
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:35,413
Don't get your hopes up.

325
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,249
Oh, you still got your shucking skills.

I am not eating any of those.

329
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:06,577
Any answers?

330
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:07,910
Getting there.

331
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:10,380
Marc was absolutely not conning you.

332
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,215
No wires or transfers.

333
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:14,217
No evidence of inbound cash

334
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,386
or altered behavior whatsoever

335
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,254
in him, the wife, or other family.

336
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,890
So he was conned right along with me.

337
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,592
The Gaming Facility Location Board

338
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:25,294
reassigned the license to
Kingsford at the last minute.

339
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:26,629
I confirmed that.

340
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:29,298
A guy named Joe Scolari
made the call to switch.

341
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,633
No one motivated him?

342
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:33,836
It's hard to pinpoint where the idea
to change even originated,

343
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,805
or who he's trying to keep happy.

344
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,907
But I do know that
these things don't move

345
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,709
unless somebody orders it to happen.

346
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,143
Okay. Stay on it.

347
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,079
I'm gonna get with Scolari,
see if I can get a read on him.

348
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:54,556
Thank you for agreeing to meet,
Senator Scolari.

349
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,825
Oh, call me Joe.

350
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:58,793
What brings you up the Thruway?

351
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:00,595
You looking for approval for another,

[laughs]

354
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,736
Well, if you've gone to so
much trouble to research me,

355
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,503
you must know why.

356
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,372
I'm here as an investor
in New York State

357
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,774
meeting with one its
finest representatives.

358
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:14,575
Of course.

359
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:17,878
I know about the note
exchange on Sandicot.

360
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,348
And I want you to know
the Location Board

361
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,817
doesn't take matters of
gaming licenses lightly.

362
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:27,255
The committee chose the location

363
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:29,123
that would bring the greatest benefit

364
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,258
to the greatest number of people.

365
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
That turned out to be Kingsford.

366
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,462
Oh, I believe
that the state-appointed board,

367
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:36,764
handpicked by the Governor,

368
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:39,199
would be nothing short of rigorous.

369
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,969
Thing is, I have it on good authority

370
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,363
that Sandicot was
gonna get that license.

371
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:48,575
So the late switch seems... odd.

372
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:52,479
Our process always
seems odd to outsiders.

373
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:55,615
That's where the whole
sausage-making thing comes from.

374
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,517
But let me reassure you,

375
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,653
there was nothing out of
the ordinary about it.

376
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,989
The committee chose the location

377
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,791
that would bring the greatest benefit

378
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,392
to the greatest number of people.

379
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,961
That turned out to be Kingsford.

380
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,796
Yeah, no, you said.

381
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:12,865
What I was looking for
is a specific reason

382
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,601
that decision was made.

383
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,435
Oh.

384
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,905
You want specifics.

385
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:22,708
Details into our process.

386
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,776
Inner workings and so forth.

387
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,312
That would be helpful.

388
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:27,679
Sure.

389
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:30,082
I can share that.

390
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,284
The committee chose the location

391
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,086
that would bring the greatest benefit

392
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,521
to the greatest number of people.

393
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,524
That turned out to be Kingsford.

394
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:44,462
Just as I'm sure you took on
the obligations of Sandicot

395
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,698
for the good of those fine people.

396
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,244
I hope this has been as much
fun for you as it has for me.

397
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,446

408
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,714
Russian hackers.

409
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,785
They can fuck with us so easily,

410
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,353
in ways we can't even comprehend.

411
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,156
A few keystrokes and they can bring

an entire airline to a standstill.

413
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,393
Thousands of people stranded.

414
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,428
So your fear is, uh, what?

415
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,832
These hackers targeting you?
The entire market?

416

00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,575
Just last night.

420
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,076
Anything happen yesterday?

421
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,844
I had to go out to Axe's house

422
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,747
in the Hamptons for a special meeting.

423
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,584
Axe bought the distressed
debt on this town upstate.

424
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,052
Now they're defaulting.
It's a shit load of money.

425
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:18,653
What do you think you should do?

426
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,058
Well, what are the options?

427
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,460
Austerity. Or lose money.

428
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,439
Do you see the connection?

429
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,073
With the hackers?

430
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,810
You're saying we're like them?

431
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,045
They're agents of chaos

432
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,913
who can destabilize all our lives

433
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:47,782
just because they feel like it.

434
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,683
Who are you to those people upstate?

435
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,418
- Chaos.
- Yes.

436
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,789
Axe Cap is the agent of chaos.

437
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,525
You know what austerity means.

438
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:01,595
You guys traverse moral
and legal gray areas

439
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,464
all the time, but you can live with it

440
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,300
because you're rarely aware
of anyone getting hurt by it.

441
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:10,003
With this town,
you know exactly who's getting hurt,

442
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,972
and where they're gonna feel their pain.

443
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,541
And how their lives are
gonna spin out of control

444
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,677
because of decisions
made in your presence,

445
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,846
at a fucking mansion in the Hamptons.

446
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,915
I don't even know that
it's wrong for him

447

448
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,720
only that I don't like
how it makes me feel.

449
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:30,223
This is all connected.

450
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,929
When a situation starts affecting you

451
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:38,765
so much you can't sleep,

452
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,001
you have to take action.

453
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,503
Fighting for those people

454
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,673

458

<i>Then that nest egg got invested.</i>

459
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:15,834
<i>But the town it was invested in
mismanaged its finances.</i>

460
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:19,738
<i>And now they don't want
to pay what they owe,</i>

461
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,106
<i>and my retirement is threatened.</i>

462
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:28,379
A spot like this will kick
off our Astroturf campaign

463
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:30,781
to make it look like the
area's getting a bailout

464
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:32,083
and not a death sentence.

465
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,484
Commercials like this one,

466
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:34,986
but specific to Sandicot,

467
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:37,188
sell the idea that our investors,

468

responsible people from all over,

they are the ones who suffer
if Sandicot is allowed to default.

471
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:48,095
Make it clear that we are the
ones willing to negotiate.

472

It's the town that's being difficult.

473
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,836
Of course.
Sandicot is being uncooperative.

474
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:53,036
We'll say all that.

475
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,938
Any questions?

Danzig.

477
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:01,144
You've been awfully quiet.

478
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:02,964
Are we really gonna do this?

479
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,484
I mean, we can make some market moves

480
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:11,654
and potentially pick up some
of the losses by next quarter.

481
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:14,057
We're making it look like
our investors are down

483

The people up there are
sure to turn to the media

484

and to cry poor,
to play the victim card.

485
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,533
It makes sense for us to point out

486
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,668
that there are other victims.

487
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,870
Exactly.

We could hold the debt,

in re-growing Sandicot,

493

Yes.

498
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:04,372
It is unfortunate...
offensive, actually...

499

and that people have to
live in near-poverty.

501
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,715
But in many ways,
a town is like a business.

502
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:17,885
And when a business
operates beyond its means,

503
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,321
when numbers don't add up,

504

Corrections are in order.

As Taleb says,
"Become antifragile, or die."

515

Once we do this,
the town will face that challenge

for a boudin noir last night,

817
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:44,489
so I went to Bistro Grisby.

818
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:46,158
We used to go there all the time.

819
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
Yeah, when we were first married.

820
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:51,463
Not in a long time.

821
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,599
Now it's gone.

822
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,568
Gone?

823
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,204
It's, uh, a nail salon now.

824
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:02,506
They closed four years ago.

825
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:03,741
Sad.

826
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,142
Mm.

827
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,216
Look...

828
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:16,087
I know that I reacted poorly

829
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,958
when I learned that you were
going back to Axe Capital.

830
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,827
I'm sorry.

831
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,230
I was being selfish.

832
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:31,534
If you are happy there,

833
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:36,339
then... that's where you should be.

834
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:42,579
I want you to be happy.

835
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,157
That's lovely, Chuck.

836
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:57,093
It really is.

837
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,532
I'll go get the kids.

838
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,911
Boss...

839
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:18,580
I received a concerning bit of news.

840
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,115
Mick Danzig just quit.

841
00:43:21,452 --> 00:43:23,118
Is that so?

842
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:25,122
[Mafee] I just never
thought I'd have an issue

843
00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:26,988
dating someone in the office.

844
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,858
And I really didn't.

845
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,126
I don't know...

846
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:34,963
it's just distracting with Everett here.

847
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:37,365
I see the way she looks at him, and...

848
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,829
We are in the middle of a session.

849
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,616
Mafee, out.

850
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:46,708
Yeah, we were just
shooting the breeze, catching up.

851
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,044
That was completely inappropriate.

852
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:51,630
How can I possibly do
my job if your guys

853
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:53,838
think you might come barging
through the door at any moment?

854
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,618
It takes me long enough to convince them
you don't have my office bugged.

855
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,221
Once you realized you couldn't
influence my thinking,

856
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:02,190
you decided to influence someone else's?

857
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:04,292
- That's my job.
- For the good of the firm,

858
00:44:04,294 --> 00:44:05,693
which I do not define

859
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:07,595
as making one of my best earners quit.

860
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:09,563
I didn't make anyone do anything.

861
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,799
I know you had a session
with Mick Danzig.

862
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:13,033
What did you say to him?

863
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:14,267
I can't discuss that.

864
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:17,037
You contract here is very clear.

865
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,239
You are here to help
my employees perform

866
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:20,741
at their peak level.

867
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:23,056
In any manner I see fit.
You don't like it, fire me.

868
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:24,682
Pay me out. I agreed to come back.

869
00:44:24,682 --> 00:44:27,647
I am back doing exactly
what I am paid to do.

870
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:29,449
You made the deal, Bobby.

871
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:31,318
You can get out of it any time.

872
00:44:35,524 --> 00:44:37,390
[door opens]

873
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:38,858
[door closes]

874
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:47,133
That was a neat trick
you pulled with the A.G.

875
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:49,902
I mean, I've never seen her
flanked before.

876
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:51,204
Impressive.

877
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:54,741
All in the service of justice.

878
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:56,843
Well, and the Southern District.

879
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:57,877
Mm.

880
00:44:57,879 --> 00:44:59,911
Now you get to have your moment...

881
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:01,381
as well you should.

882
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:07,152
The question is,
what will you do with it?

883
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:10,356
Such ambitions are far from my focus.

884
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:12,291
I see a run for office.

885
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,195
Is it possible you'll go the other way?

886
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:19,131
Cash out, go private? That's not you.

887
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,401
No. Sadly, I'm like you.
Public servant for life.

888
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:27,739
Uh, and it's in that role that I'm here.

889
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:29,074
I have come across

890
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:32,209
a wonderful young law student,
Emma Foley.

891
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,045
She's at Cardoza. Smart. Studious.

892
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:37,915
And a clerkship with you would, uh...

893
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:40,485
Oh, slice that baby up.

894
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,787
Thank you.

895
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:46,090
Oh, I love the sound it
makes when they carve it.

896
00:45:46,092 --> 00:45:47,158
There you go.

897
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,126
Uh. All right.

898
00:45:49,128 --> 00:45:50,127
[skin crackling]

899
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,695
That crackle.

900
00:45:53,766 --> 00:45:55,632
Look, if this young lady is qualified,

901
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:58,035
I'll consider her as I
would any other candidate.

902
00:45:58,037 --> 00:45:59,870
I recognize the last name.

903
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:02,807
So I have a feeling if she were
really as super as you say,

904
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,508
she'd already have a clerkship.

905
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,677
Well, we're not talking
about appointing her

906
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,745
to the Supreme Court.

907
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:10,747
This is how things are done, right?

908
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:14,117
Not for me. Not anymore.

909
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:15,985
I look at the way things get done.

910
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:19,356
The view changes when you
see things from the bench.

911
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:20,390
Uh-huh.

912
00:46:20,392 --> 00:46:23,159
Favor-trading, deal-making,

913
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:26,229
back channeling, patronage.

914
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:28,798
I'll admit, I took advantage
every now and then

915
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,811
when I was in the trenches.

916
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,569
But... I lost my taste for it.

917
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:36,372
True objectivity.

918
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:38,374
It's the ultimate luxury.

919
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:40,008
It's corrosive, Chuck.

920
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,611
I mean, I went to law school
to help fix the system,

921
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:43,779
not succumb to it.

922
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,048
Sounds like you're
feeling the holy spirit.

923
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,652
For the first time
since clerking for RBG.

924
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:53,055
Which is why I'm careful
with my own clerks.

925
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:54,990
This is<i> very</i> personal for me.

926
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:57,525
I mean, I'm finally in a
position to do some good.

927
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:58,894
Very inspiring.

928
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,497
Just don't forget, it was
the back channels and deal-making

929
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:05,500
that put you in that position.

930
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:08,603
Remind me again,
and this is the last meal we share.

931
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,073
Help yourself.

932
00:47:12,075 --> 00:47:13,608
Absolutely right.

933
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:17,746
Thank you.

934
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:22,049
I think you'll make an
excellent candidate, Chuck.

935
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,420
I actually think you're
built for the political life.

936
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:28,589
I mean, if I'm you, I'd go for it.

937
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:31,192
Mm.

938
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:36,364
[Hall]<i> It wasn't the Governor
who called the shot.</i>

939
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:37,731
<i>Sure, he controls Scolari.</i>

940
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,833
But this goes to who
controls the Governor,

941
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:41,269
and that's Jack Foley.

942
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:44,004
I know who that is...
Old steel and railroad money.

943
00:47:44,006 --> 00:47:48,008
One of the first Western businessmen
into Russia after the wall fell.

944
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,511
But more than that,
an Albany machine man.

945
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:52,579
His family goes all
the way back to Tweed.

946
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:53,647
Huh.

947
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:56,583
Foley's war chest got three
of the last four Govs elected,

948
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,118
along with half the Assembly.

949
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,921
But it seems, in this case,
he focused on the casino.

950
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:03,189
So, why would Foley want to fuck me?

951
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,426
Unclear.
Look, it's like that Marco kid said,

952
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,361
this likely wasn't a targeted strike.

953
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,897
It was collateral on a
strike against someone else.

954
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:13,599
It may actually be
random Albany bullshit.

955
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,235
But we can't be sure it wasn't.

956
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:17,069
No, we can't.

957
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,612
I'm Tier two, which means I can sign out

958
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,247
during the day to look for a job.

959
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,316
But I don't want to
talk about this place.

960
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:32,117
I want to hear about the world.

961
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,027
Well...

962
00:48:35,689 --> 00:48:39,390
I'm having problems with
that bond I bought upstate.

963
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:41,059
I saw.

964
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:43,227
Albany moved the gaming license.

965
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:44,595
You trying to get it back?

966
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:48,232
It's too late. I have to take action.

967
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:51,169
The only way that I can come out ahead,

968
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:53,071
it's pretty grisly.

969
00:48:55,675 --> 00:48:58,742
Playing Torquemada's never fun.

970
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:00,277
[indistinct shouting]

971
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:11,088
I'm still stuck on how the
whole license thing went down.

972
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,423
It was supposed to be a done deal.

973
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:17,260
But the switch...
it tracks back to Jack Foley.

974
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:19,762
What do you want to
know about Black Jack?

975
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:22,532
What drives him. What moves him.

976
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:24,267
Who he's close to.

977
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:26,436
How I can get close to him.

He's driven by maintaining influence...

naturally...

980
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:35,979
and growing his six-generation fortune
and staying invisible despite it all.

981
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:38,615
Advisor to kings and princes.

982
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:41,985
There was a time not long ago
I could have put you in a room with him.

983
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:45,787
But I'm off his speed dial now.

984
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,523
All the way off.

988
00:49:57,101 --> 00:50:00,503
Everybody's a Libertarian
until it's their town that's dying.

989
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:03,872
Then a bailout only seems right.

990
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:05,273
Before I ended up in here,

991
00:50:05,275 --> 00:50:07,776
I would've said to you,

992
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:10,012
"Let it implode. Raze the fucker.

993
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:12,581
Let something new grow in its place.

994
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,382
Prop it up and you're only delaying

995
00:50:14,384 --> 00:50:15,918
the inevitable collapse."

996
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,252
But now?

997
00:50:17,924 --> 00:50:18,819
You have to handle it right,

998
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:21,322
or you'll be facing the
same torches and pitchforks

999
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:22,623
that landed me in here.

1000
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,926
Except that what I'd
be doing isn't illegal.

1001
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:29,097
I did everything I could

1002
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,865
to make sure it didn't come to this.

1003
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:32,767
But still it went bad.

1004
00:50:35,605 --> 00:50:37,838
Just don't forget...

1005

if they hate you enough,

grounds to fuck you.

You're not gonna be able to
find out what I need to know.

1010
00:50:54,156 --> 00:50:56,656
I'm gonna have to sit down
face-to-face with Foley.

1011
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:58,725
He'll be resistant.

1012
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:01,928
So start thinking of ways
to overcome that resistance.

the way we thought they would.

Come on, I don't give a shit about that.

I hear you, Bruno.

you've known me since I was a kid,

[boys shouting]

1039
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,466
I saw Bruno down there.

1040
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:26,135
He was here about the muni bond?

1041
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:28,670
Lobbying for Sandicot.

1042
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,444
What do you think I should do?

1043
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:40,282
You finally asking me for my opinion?

1044
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:41,883
I wasn't cutting you out.

1045
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,855
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around all this.

1046
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:49,124
But now I really need
to know what you think.

1047
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,531
I can see how painful this is for you.

1048
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:00,368
It was all over your face when
you were talking to Bruno.

1049
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:06,641
It's tough.

1050
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,943
I just sank a shit ton
of money into a place

1051
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,845
that will never be able
to repay its obligations.

1052
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,617
But if we go soft,
like Bruno wants us to,

1053
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,787
we'll lose the better part
of 500 million dollars.

1054
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:26,894
Whereas if we do what it
takes to make the bond viable,

1055
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,263
we're gonna clear over $100 million.

1056
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:35,502
I can see both sides of this.

1057
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:37,905
Those people up there
are who we used to be.

1058
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,140
That's what Bruno said.

1059
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:46,846
Did anyone ever help us,
or look out for us?

1060
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:50,149
When my mother was closing the blinds

1061
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:53,085
so that bill collectors wouldn't
know that anyone was home?

1062
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:54,554
No.

1063
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:57,657
The way we were brought up,
it was always them or us.

1064
00:54:57,659 --> 00:54:59,892
And it still is.

1065
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:01,505
That's what I think.

1066
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:06,165
And like you said, Bobby...

1067
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:09,135
in the end, everyone else
is cannon fodder.

1068
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:12,939
So I say you go up there,
and you do what you got to do.

1069
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:14,941
Cut off the gangrenous parts.

1070
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,576
And then we go in with
charter schools and outrage,

1071
00:55:17,578 --> 00:55:18,944
for about $30 million.

1072
00:55:18,946 --> 00:55:20,379
We capture the tax write-off,

1073

1
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:06,970
Previously
on Billions...

2
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:08,512
If the only way
I could eat this pizza

3
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:10,387
was naked in the middle of
Times Square, I would.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,512
Problem is, you'd be sure
to undress me, too.

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,220
You doing this here?

6
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:15,679
You did it.

7
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,887
We're gonna need to work out
a visitation plan.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,970
Figure out what's best
for the boys.

9
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,970
We'd probably move.

10
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:24,303
They're not going
anywhere till college.

11
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:27,053
I'm here to ask you to honor
your promise to me:

12
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,095
that there was
no favor you'd refuse.

13
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,470
You know I'm committed
to my government post

14
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:33,470
as the Secretary
of the Treasury.

15
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:37,679
But, I do like to keep an eye
peeled for opportunities.

16
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:38,679
A proposed business?

17
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,845
Yes.
Lattice grid fins.

18
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,136
Your white whale.

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,970
It's all
you say it is, Dad.

20
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,095
Let's do something
with this.

21
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,011
There is
no available burial plot.

22
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,261
Who snaked me?

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,261
How's this:
The plot is yours.

24
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,512
If you take
immediate occupancy.

25
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,261
A very interesting set of
permits just got expedited.

26
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,720
The beneficiary?
One Charles Rhoades, Senior.

27
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,887
There it is.

28
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,387
I'm sorry to have seen
Chuck's press conference.

29
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,220
I can imagine you could use
some support right now...

30
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:08,011
So, would you like to?
Talk?

31
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:18,720
dramatic music

32
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:49,345
You know, the speakeasy
is an American tradition.

33
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:51,428
But for now, this one
is just for my friends.

34
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,679
Enjoy.

35
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,303
Thank you,
Nicholas.

36
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,428
Was all the summer
and all the fall

37
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,553
Just trying to find
my little all in all

38
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:02,428
The idea is:
When you're inside a speakeasy,

39
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:05,136
you're invisible
to the outside world.

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,595
I don't worry

41
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,762
And can be exactly who
you really are.

42
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:12,845
So you thought you'd bribe me
with vegan mango rice ice cream?

43
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,887
Yes.
Is it working?

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,887
Maybe a little.

45
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,053
But since I can be exactly
who I want to here,

46
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,762
I'm going to be direct:

47
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,136
I don't think
I should talk to you.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
I don't think
I can talk to you.

49
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:24,762
I don't think
I will talk to you.

50
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,679
I'm going to eat it
in silence.

51
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:30,387
That works.

52
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,345
I mostly just want you
to listen.

53
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm sitting
on top of the world

54
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:38,470
Many of the guys at Axe Capital
try to get me to talk to them.

55
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:41,553
To let them in. Here.

56
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:43,679
But I'm a dispassionate
trained professional.

57
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,887
So that never happens.

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,929
But it happened with you.

59
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,887
Why do you think that is?

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,970
Because of the way
you listen.

61
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,512
It doesn't present
as empathy.

62
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:57,178
But I came to understand
that underneath that

63
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,929
uninflected gaze,
that's what's there.

64
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,720
You feel deeply.

65
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:04,345
You care deeply.

66
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:06,053
You try to solve all
the problems you see.

67
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,553
It's what makes you
who you are.

68
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,345
That's probably right.

69
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,512
And that's also why
you were the only one

70
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,345
who reached out after
what Chuck made public.

71
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,595
You put your anger,
your resentment, aside

72
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:23,011
and you called me
human to human.

73
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,929
Yet you refused me.

74
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,011
I wasn't ready
to talk then.

75
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,637
To trust you.

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,178
Still don't trust you.

77
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,178
Samesies.

78
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:34,553
If you couldn't dream
no more?

79
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:37,845
But I now know if I don't
talk to someone-

80
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,178
and not a dispassionate
trained professional-

81
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,887
but someone who knows my world,
knows me,

82
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,553
and actually gives a shit...
If I don't get it out...

83
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,178
No mercy in this land?

84
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,595
...I'm gonna end up
in a bad place.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,637
Followed the river
till the river ran dry

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,970
Does that
have liquor in it?

87
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,220
It does.
Thank Christ.

88
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,595
Followed my lover

89
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,387
What would Axe say
if he knew about this?

90
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,679
This has nothing
to do with him.

91
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,637
So...what then?

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,762
Is there no mercy
in this land?

93
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,553
You don't have to
talk about you.

94
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,387
Just listen.

95
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,053
Help me figure out me.

96
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,804
And then, if you need to share
anything about you,

97
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:22,637
we find mutuality.
But I insist on nothing.

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,679
I merely ask.

99
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,095
Maybe.

100
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,220
Okay.

101
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:35,595
Go.

102
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,679
Thank you.

103
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,929
Is there no mercy
in this land?

104
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:49,804
No mercy in this land?

105
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,637
That's right!
That's right! That's right!

106
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,220
Ah!

107
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:55,887
Judge DeGiulio, a word?

108
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,929
They call this the beautiful
game for a reason.

109
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,470
It flows. What kind of man
interrupts that?

110
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,261
You don't interrupt that.
Why would you interrupt that?

111
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,679
I-I didn't know
you were watching.

112
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,512
I've got Inter Milan up a goal
here against -

113
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:06,887
Sorry to interrupt
your soccer game.

114
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,303
Hey, hey, hey.

115
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,845
Fútbol in this office,
please.

116
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:13,929
If we lose now,
you get the blame.

117
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,553
I'm here with
a sensitive request.

118
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,804
Yeah. No need to speak
what's all over your face, kid.

119
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,220
I'm applying for a wiretap.
On Charles Rhoades, Senior.

120
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,720
Junior, too, actually.

121
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,178
You're asking me
if you can spy on

122
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,261
the Attorney General
of the State of New York.

123
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:32,553
And his father.

124
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:34,470
Sure.
Eat it all.

125
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:36,720
Like Big Earl.
Whole left side of the menu.

126
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,011
Including the Pimlico
and the Maryland Fried Chicken.

127
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,220
It's not just
about my appetite.

128
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:42,929
Yeah, I'm hungry as hell for
the Chuck Rhoades special.

129
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,303
But this is legit.

130
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,303
Rhoades Senior
bribed an official.

131
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,762
Chuck is
a co-conspirator-

132
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:47,887
What do you got
in the way of evidence?

133
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,095
Uh...

134
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:51,762
FBI observed
father and son

135
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,303
on the building site
in question.

136
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,512
You got a family portrait.

137
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,011
-Judge-
-Mr. US Attorney.

138
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,095
Counselor. Bryan.
Your request is denied.

139
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,303
Now go eat something before you
become even more lightheaded.

140
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:03,178
I've got fútbol to watch.

141
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:08,178
dramatic music

142
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,637
Connerty came for
a wire on you.

143
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,220
Did you grant it?

144
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:44,553
I killed it.
As an ordinary matter of law.

145
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,053
And I'm telling you

146
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,136
as an extraordinary matter
of friendship.

147
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,470
Now, that's what
warms the cockles.

148
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:53,345
How our bond isn't merely that
of men who trade in favors but-

149
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,720
You got a good one for me?

150
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,387
And like that,
the cockles go cold.

151
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,011
I already did the thing for you.
You can owe me. Again.

152
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,595
Nope. I can pay now.

153
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,553
I've found you a juicy
health care case.

154
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:08,470
Politically charged.

155
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,637
Just the type that will be
cited by the Supreme Court

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,220
and underlined by law students
for years.

157
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,637
It's supposed to go to
another judge.

158
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,845
I'll get it to you.

159
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:20,220
Extraordinary friendship
indeed.

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,345
Hmm.

161
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:32,428
dramatic music

162
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,178
I remember the first time
you brought me into your lab.

163
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,970
Meant so much to me...

164
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:41,095
You gave me designs the next day
to remake it.

165
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:45,011
As you remade this from
whatever it was before.

166
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:50,053
dramatic music

167
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,470
My lattice fin.

168
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:59,887
Yes. I had it fabricated from
carbon fiber per your specs.

169
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,303
And we have
an open-source suite

170
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,136
for multi-physics
simulation-

171
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm going to need a bigger
wind tunnel for final tests.

172
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:07,887
Of course.
We'll get it.

173
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,303
I always knew
I'd make it back.

174
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,887
You are back.

175
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,512
And I hope
better than ever.

176
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,303
I will set the meetings.

177
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,345
With partners to take this
the next hundred miles.

178
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,261
And we need to practice
good business hygiene.

179
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,595
Phones and emails
encrypted.

180
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,220
Traveling discreetly
and indirectly.

181
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:29,887
Got it.

182
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,720
But is this paranoia,
or is your old boss really-

183
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,887
Whatever word you're about to
use, the answer is yes.

184
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,095
Yes, he is.

185
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,887
That's the lab.

186
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,679
High tech propulsion.

187
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:48,470
Mason Capital diverted
28 million to unspecified-

188
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,720
What are they
doing in there?

189
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,970
We don't know yet.
Well, find out.

190
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:54,053
That's why I'm here.

191
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,470
I don't need supervision.

192
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:57,970
Not supervising.
Just mixing in.

193
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,595
I need to see
what I'm gonna destroy.

194
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,387
Because believe you me,
Taylor wants to destroy us.

195
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,261
Yes. But you standing here
isn't gonna fix it.

196
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:08,553
Let me do what I do.

197
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:11,512
Maybe find something
more befitting.

198
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:12,762
Don't you have a date
or something?

199
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,679
Matter of fact, I do.
Yeah.

200
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,053
And quit hacking
my calendar.

201
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:32,512
Do you need
something?

202
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,387
No.
Just a new pair of pajamas.

203
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,428
The old ones I've got in
the guest room are a bit ripe.

204
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,345
Take an extra set
with you.

205
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,887
Since the marital bed is
no longer providing succor-

206
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,512
You traded that
for your new job.

207
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:52,887
You have to
live with that.

208
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,762
I'm not sure I can.

209
00:09:57,428 --> 00:10:00,303
I'd like your permission
to see someone.

210
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:02,512
A professional.

211
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,512
A dom?

212
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:10,804
dramatic music

213
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,095
I'll think about it.

214
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:42,679
Chuck!
Did you do that yourself?

215
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,136
Okay.

216
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,804
Jesus. Okay.

217
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,929
I can?

218
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,679
Yes.

219
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,804
Thank you.

220
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:59,970
I think this will help.

221
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,136
I'll find a place.

222
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,970
No.

223
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,720
Someone will follow you there.
I can't have any-

224
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:08,595
I can't have even one more
story about this.

225
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,011
If you have to do it.
If you can't hold out.

226
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,053
Do it here.

227
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:17,637
Have her dress in a way
she looks like

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,303
it's a sports massage
or personal trainer.

229
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,887
I'll take the kids out.

230
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,553
Thank you.

231
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,679
It's fine.
I mean it's not fine.

232
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:35,095
It's fine.

233
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,679
Now go to your room.

234
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:42,679
dramatic music

235
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,679
Victor, this is
your wake up call, pal.

236
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,053
I have some ideas
I want to hit you with-

237
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,637
Can I call you back?
I can't really talk right now.

238
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,679
What's more important
than me?

239
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,303
Nothing.
Just not a good time, Axe.

240
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:14,053
Call you soon.

241
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,679
Orrin.

242
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,428
Strange things are afoot
at the Circle K.

243
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:25,929
Get Spyros.

244
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,679
I want you to do a quick
but deep dive

245
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:29,512
on potential trouble
in Victor land.

246
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:37,720
mid-tempo music

247
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,387
Kappa Beta Phi.

248
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,595
They're opening
their books.

249
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,762
Oh.
You're finally getting made.

250
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:38,970
Along with
such vaunted names as

251
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,720
Bloomberg, Langone,
Paul Tudor Jones.

252
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:42,136
Well.
They're lucky to have

253
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,345
your silky tenor
and rough-hewn liver.

254
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:47,387
I know you don't care about
Wall Street's elite fraternity.

255
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,637
You are above it-
like a god.

256
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,553
But I am in it-
like a demigod.

257
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:54,804
I'm happy you're happy.

258
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,553
Your gut was right.

259
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,136
What I wouldn't give for

260
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,178
a gastrointestinal tuning fork
like yours.

261
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,637
Fucking knew it.

262
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,345
What's Victor
gotten into?

263
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,595
More like what has
he gotten himself onto...

264
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,095
and that is the radar of
my old compadres at the Commish.

265
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:12,303
SEC is looking into Victor
for insider trading-

266
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:15,303
tied to a research firm called
Mark to Market Analytics.

267
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,970
Whole host of offenses
they can fine for,

268
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,387
and the US Attorney can toss him
in a cell over.

269
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,178
They will peck
where there is blood.

270
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,178
And sooner or later...

271
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,637
I need to talk to Victor.

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,261
Sooner.

273
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,762
Kappa Beta Phi?

274
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:33,220
Count one Ari Spyros
jelly AF.

275
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,929
We struck some ore.

276
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,178
Could be base metal,
could be gold.

277
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,345
Oh?

278
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,011
We've been fine-tooth combing
official travel records

279
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:52,345
for our esteemed AG.

280
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,845
Jeffcoat went to Chile.
Official business.

281
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,762
But on the way back,
his plane made

282
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:00,637
an unplanned stop to refuel...
in the Cayman Islands.

283
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,095
Juicy spot for
financial misdeeds.

284
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:04,887
Tax evasion,
money laundering...

285
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,428
We'll get into it.
See if Jock-or his money-

286
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,845
paid a visit to any banks
while in country.

287
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,053
Do it. This fucker-
and his minion-

288
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,679
hate that
I'm in this office.

289
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:16,804
Will stop at nothing
to remove me.

290
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,053
So I need to fire first.

291
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,845
Thank you both
for picking up the cause.

292
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,261
Your blood feud
is not my cause.

293
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:27,553
Why are you here if you don't
want to get Jock?

294
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:28,929
Oh, I want to get him.

295
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,970
For all the reasons that
don't matter to you.

296
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:34,136
Understood.

297
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,553
And still appreciated.

298
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,887
My uncle used to
take me here.

299
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,261
Cabbie joint.

300
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,470
They know how to eat.
Mm.

301
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:51,261
Tell me about
Mark to Market Analytics.

302
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:53,887
Shit.

303
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,470
I didn't cooperate
with the Feds.

304
00:15:57,553 --> 00:15:58,887
Not a word.

305
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,345
I know.
That's why I'm here.

306
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,053
So tell me what
you didn't tell them.

307
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,011
I thought I was supposed to
keep the gray stuff

308
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,011
far away from you.
You failed.

309
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,553
So now I need to know.

310
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:13,220
Mark to Market's
a research company.

311
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,178
I pretexted my way
in the door

312
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:18,887
and rather than close a deal
for their services, I...

313
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,804
You swiped
their recommended buys.

314
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:23,178
I also skewed the numbers they
reported to their competitors

315
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,679
so they'd make bad trades.

316
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:26,679
Love the spirit.

317
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,178
But that's what's gonna get
the government guys

318
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:30,261
firing at you like the end of
Bonnie and Clyde.

319
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,929
Fuck me.

320
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:34,679
And if the SEC get
the US Attorney involved-

321
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:35,970
they're like these cabbies:

322
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,345
they don't just want
the cheek meat,

323
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,512
they'll take
your whole fucking head.

324
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,136
Okay.

325
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,553
What can I do?

326
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,970
Don't do business
with anyone

327
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,136
you haven't known
since grade school.

328
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,261
And get a law firm
on retainer.

329
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,387
Hey.

330
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,428
I'll make sure this doesn't
track back to you.

331
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,053
I assumed that.

332
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,345
Right up until
you said it.

333
00:16:55,428 --> 00:17:00,345
dramatic music

334
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:08,762
We connected with staff
at the Cayman airport.

335
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:09,970
Jock never left the jet.

336
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,387
And no one ever
joined him onboard.

337
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,345
But there could still be
gold in the pan.

338
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,970
Staff members recall
another Cabinet official

339
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,845
visiting
on several occasions

340
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,595
that do not show up
in the official logbook.

341
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,345
Then taking a Town Car
with tinted windows

342
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:26,220
straight to Banco Esencial.

343
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,804
It was Todd Krakow.
Treasury Secretary.

344
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,470
Wow.

345
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,011
Find out who he's doing business
with down there.

346
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,595
And see what's up.

347
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,595
This could lead some strange
and thorny places.

348
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,595
Where you thrive,
Mr. Allerd...

349
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,929
I was born in the dark.

350
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,804
But, T., you don't
need to continue

351
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
down the path
if you don't want to.

352
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,637
If we're going to find a way to
use Krakow against Jock, I want.

353
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,053
Gas up the State jet.

354
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,887
Dollar Bill,
you've been read into this

355
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,804
'cause you know Victor the best,

356
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,053
and 'cause vouchsafed him
back in here.

357
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,303
Can we count on him
to hold the line?

358
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:02,428
Absolutely. Guy's as loyal as
John McCain in the Hanoi Hilton.

359
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,929
Cut him loose.
I hate to say it,

360
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,887
but his carelessness
has trumped his loyalty.

361
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,470
I agree.

362
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,637
What we owe to this famiglia
isn't just blood,

363
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,512
it's sentenza-

364
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,178
You can't do it.

365
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,553
You're normally the driest-eyed
guy in the room.

366
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh, I couldn't give a fuck
whether Victor lives or dies.

367
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:21,762
But you actually can't.

368
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,136
I've been reviewing
the terms of

369
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,428
the agreement with
Victor's firm.

370
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,553
Rights and responsibilities
and-

371
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,261
Taylor fucked us.

372
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:29,887
Spacey-style.

373
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,679
Sneaky
and from behind.

374
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:32,970
What did they do?

375
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,762
During
their brief reign,

376
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,720
Taylor papered the deal
with Victor's satellite-

377
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,345
Taylor inserted a term,

378
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,136
deep in the definitions,

379
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,011
allowing Axe Cap
to convert its investment

380
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,679
into
a general partnership.

381
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,637
I co-own
Victor's firm.

382
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,929
Victor's actions are
legally attributable to me.

383
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:52,470
Fuckin' Trojan Horse
time bomb.

384
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,512
Taylor really knew us.
All of us.

385
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,261
How the fuck could Taylor
just do this-unilaterally?

386
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,720
There was a co-conspirator.

387
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,595
A co-signer anyway.
Mafee.

388
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:06,053
I am gonna grind his bones
to make my bread.

389
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,804
You are free
to work on that.

390
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:10,679
Meanwhile, I gotta put moonlight
between me and Victor.

391
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,136
The deal is ironclad.

392
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,720
This thing can be prosecuted.
And will be.

393
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:19,136
It's a Darrell Dunkenstein
Griffith slam dunk.

394
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,136
dramatic music

395
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,303
Okay.
Someone is gonna prosecute him,

396
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:27,303
but it doesn't have to be
the US Attorney.

397
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,387
Go ahead
and call him.

398
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,053
You want me to wrestle the case
from the SEC,

399
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,929
then, basically,
let Victor go?

400
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,345
Put a conviction on the books.
Then justice,

401
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,345
or whatever the fuck
they're calling it these days-

402
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:42,929
Oh.
Still calling it justice-

403
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:44,720
Justice will be done.

404
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:47,011
And then no one needs to keep
looking into Victor

405
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,804
or anyone
connected to him.

406
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,053
Sure. Bury the case by lightly
burying your old confederate.

407
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,428
No jail time.
Or not much.

408
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,136
Yeah, I can do that.
But why?

409
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,762
And when is this
going to end?

410
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,178
Yes. Favors are owed.

411
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,261
But I am not
your barristerial footman.

412
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:05,345
Fair. And I wouldn't ask
if I didn't need.

413
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:09,011
Ok. The State of New York
now has Victor Mateo

414
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,095
softly, gently,
in its sights.

415
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,970
The New York State jet just
took off for the Caymans-

416
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,762
with Chuck Rhoades
on board.

417
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:26,011
When your wire got denied, you
put out a travel bolo on him.

418
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,970
Least I could do.

419
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,595
You actually could
do less.

420
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,345
And you should.
Unless you want to fall into

421
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,095
the same stuff
that got Chuck kicked.

422
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,178
-Which is?
-Becoming a walking cliché

423
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,970
focused on
territorial bullshit.

424
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,679
Let him have his.
We'll take ours.

425
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:42,553
I'm the US Attorney now.
I'm taking both.

426
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,470
dramatic music

427
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:49,387
While lattice,
or grid fins, are-

428
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,845
Improve maneuverability.

429
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,887
Higher mach speeds
reduce drag and-

430
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,553
You ready?

431
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,011
For pitching
and being pitched to?

432
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,553
Call me Babe Ruth.

433
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:01,762
Let you go
and an 86-year curse ensues?

434
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,720
Something like that.

435
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,011
You're nervous.

436
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,178
No, I'm-
You are.

437
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,804
Yeah. Okay, I am.
A little.

438
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,845
This is big for me.

439
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,345
I'll talk the numbers.
You'll talk the science.

440
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:17,845
Which you know better than
anybody in the entire room.

441
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,261
You can't fail.

442
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,595
Who's first?

443
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,261
His name is
Brett Ford...

444
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:28,470
Defense contractor.

445
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,303
Sells solar flare shields
to NASA.

446
00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:33,345
And missile guidance
to the military.

447
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,679
Jeff Kolanski.

448
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,303
He runs-
Blackstrup.

449
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:39,845
50 billion dollar market cap
in aeronautics.

450
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,220
Yes.
And finally Brian Dana.

451
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,720
Sharp investor.

452
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,512
More focused on startups
than the others.

453
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,929
From what Taylor's said
of their father,

454
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,887
he won't be a fan of
the defense contractor.

455
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,345
So who are they
making a deal with?

456
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,178
'Cause we can't do dick
until we know that.

457
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:54,553
I'll be monitoring
subsequent communication.

458
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,053
Anything that
tips their lean.

459
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:59,303
Well, then it seems like
you have this in hand.

460
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,470
Enjoy your preparation
for pledge week.

461
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:08,679
I have some work
to get to.

462
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,970
One other thing:

463
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:15,428
I made Taylor and Wendy
at the same location.

464
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:17,053
Not the lab.

465
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,095
I know you'd never doubt
Ms. Rhoades's loyalty.

466
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:22,261
But in her current
emotional state...

467
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:25,053
Monitor that situation
even more closely.

468
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:34,929
You came a long way
just to talk, my friend.

469
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,387
Had you picked up the phone,

470
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,970
I could have
saved you the trip.

471
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:41,512
Simply told you that Mr. Krakow
does not hold accounts here.

472
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,512
I've found that
the drop-in is better.

473
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,679
The element of surprise?

474
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:47,261
Looks like
you surprised yourself,

475
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:50,053
showing up in
a Super 150s wool suit.

476
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,595
Oof.

477
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,512
When traveling, always dress
for your destination.

478
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:57,762
Indeed I am dressed
for my destination.

479
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,929
Oh, I'm heading back to New York
shortly.

480
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,929
Which is why I'm wearing this,
and why you ought to be.

481
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:07,303
Are you accusing me
of something?

482
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,053
Hiding the accounts

483
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:12,595
or, uh, skimming from
the accounts?

484
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,845
Both? Neither?
Who cares.

485
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,595
You should be more concerned
with the coins.

486
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,512
Coins of which currency?

487
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:20,970
Digital coins
you have been offering.

488
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:23,595
Forgive me, if I don't
understand all the, uh,

489
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,136
peculiarities
of cyber currency.

490
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,679
But without your bank
knowing it,

491
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:32,845
you've been using its reputation
to burnish these ICO scams

492
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,178
and selling them to customers
when you know damn well

493
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:36,720
the coins are worthless

494
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:39,345
if they even exist
in the first place...

495
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:42,929
You know, I guess I do
understand after all.

496
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,804
Because for all
the ICO mumbo-jumbo,

497
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:48,220
what we have here- is
an old-fashioned pig in a poke.

498
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,261
And were I to expose
that scam,

499
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,053
I imagine you would be
made an example of

500
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:53,929
by the Cayman authorities.

501
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:57,387
And I bet when they roar to
life, they are efficient.

502
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,220
And we can avoid all that

503
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:05,553
if I tell you about
Secretary Krakow's accounts?

504
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:07,845
Telling me?
You're telling everybody.

505
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,303
Oh, you're coming back
to New York

506
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:10,387
and going in front of
a grand jury.

507
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,428
Today.

508
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:15,387
Mnh. Mnh.

509
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,845
It's a shame
you're wearing that.

510
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:18,762
Brrr.

511
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:20,136
Cold in New York.

512
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,178
up-tempo jazz music

513
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,845
Fucking bad ass.

514
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,470
It truly is.

515
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:40,845
I'm a bit of a buff
about this event.

516
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,845
Did you know one year,
John Astor

517
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:45,178
and Cornelius Vanderbilt
wore the same dress

518
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,470
and it was the social scandal
of the season.

519
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:51,679
I bet I'll never get
the tap on the shoulder.

520
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:53,303
You never know.
When I was starting out,

521
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:56,011
my first big boss...
he was a former president.

522
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,637
You worked for
a Grand Swipe?

523
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,220
He was bringing me along.

524
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:00,887
Then, after the first time
I went to rehab,

525
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,887
he cut me loose.

526
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,220
My father said I blew it.

527
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,095
I'd never get in.

528
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,428
I've found I've been
carrying this around

529
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:11,595
ever since
I got the invite.

530
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,387
This is Mr. Wagner.

531
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,553
A former Grand Loaf.

532
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:18,762
I dedicate all of this
to the day he died.

533
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:22,679
He was so
damn disappointed.

534
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,470
He'll never get to see me
like this...

535
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:35,929
Spyros, Dollar Bill,

536
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:39,303
find whatever greatness lies
within you and nurture it.

537
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,679
Eventually,
it will be seen.

538
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:52,970
You already have your men,
waiting to take me, huh?

539
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,387
Not his men.
Not by a long shot.

540
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,720
I am the United States
Attorney

541
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,303
for the Southern District
of New York.

542
00:25:58,387 --> 00:26:01,303
You always say the full title
Idi Amin-style?

543
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:04,637
Whether or not I do, I am lord
of all beasts of this case.

544
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,053
I have here a material
witness order...

545
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:10,303
Signed by a judge,
executed now by the FBI.

546
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:12,345
Mr. Abington, you can
go with Agent Dancshazy.

547
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:14,261
We have a lot
to talk about.

548
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:19,220
dramatic music

549
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:23,095
You fucked with the wrong
Attorney General.

550
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:24,470
I'll see you-

551
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:26,178
Oh, say it, fucking say it,
Chuck.

552
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,470
-In court.
Goddamned right you will.

553
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,470
Great news. All three companies
accepted our term sheet.

554
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:44,261
I don't want to do
any of these deals.

555
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:47,136
Why'd you have us go through
the meetings then?

556
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,845
I went with you,
because I thought,

557
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,970
hey, this is
Taylor's area of expertise.

558
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:54,553
But I did not come to New York
to do business with strangers.

559
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:57,261
I came here to work
with my family.

560
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:59,011
So, like, you wanna pass
on everyone?

561
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,762
What would
make you happy?

562
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:05,345
You.
You financing the whole thing.

563
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:07,470
With banks,
if necessary.

564
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:09,804
But it's clear to me you don't
want to take that risk.

565
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:12,136
You don't believe in the idea
strongly enough.

566
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,095
In me enough.

567
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:17,970
The smartest thing,
the necessary thing,

568
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,095
is a strategic partnership.

569
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,637
Which brings with it a stronger
endorsement of the utility.

570
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,637
This is a sign of
how much I believe.

571
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,679
Enough not to humor you.
But to make a plan to win.

572
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:32,387
The only plan I see is the one
where you protect your own hide.

573
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,095
dramatic music

574
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:39,220
I'm gonna...

575
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:49,720
Hey, look.

576
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:52,637
From time to time I've been
asked to get right

577
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,762
with some stuff
I didn't fully agree with.

578
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,428
And I rolled with it.

579
00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:59,011
Because I wasn't the smartest
person in the room.

580
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,345
I'm always the smartest person
in the room.

581
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:05,220
Then I can't help you.
Especially if you think that

582
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:08,178
when you're in the same room
with Taylor.

583
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:13,178
soft music

584
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,804
The four freedoms,
as identified by FDR-

585
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,720
speech, worship,
from fear, from want.

586
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,679
That was part of
Roosevelt's shpiel

587
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,178
to get America
into the war.

588
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,345
Effective.

589
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,220
Appealing to not only
our desires,

590
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,887
but also to that of which
we're most afraid.

591
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,970
He knew how to rouse.

592
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:46,929
Which do you think is
the more effective tool:

593
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:49,470
appealing to someone's
aspirations or their fear?

594
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:53,095
If you want to motivate someone
to a specific action?

595
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,303
I say: be like Roosevelt
and do both.

596
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:58,053
I think that's correct.

597
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,512
Thank you.

598
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:04,512
Louis Kahn built this,
didn't he?

599
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:07,720
The original starchitect.

600
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:09,553
Before the term
was even coined.

601
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:13,053
Yes. He called this:
a space of inspired use.

602
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,095
But he never saw it
come to be.

603
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:17,136
The financing didn't come
through during his lifetime.

604
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,053
Or even right after.
Despite his genius.

605
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:22,762
It was his son, wasn't it?
Who brought him back.

606
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,512
Made that documentary
about him.

607
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:27,512
Yes. It wasn't until the film,
years after his father's death,

608
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:29,303
that the world remembered
how special he was.

609
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:31,345
I see.

610
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:34,512
The kid-the whole movie is him
trying to understand his father,

611
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:36,220
what made him great,
what made him distant.

612
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,178
It's a search to get to the soul
of a great designer

613
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,178
and innovator,
who happened to be a flawed man.

614
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:43,428
I'm guessing,
for someone like you,

615
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:46,178
someone who's always looking for
the new approach,

616
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:49,970
the thought of Kahn
walking around with plans

617
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:52,387
for something this striking
and important,

618
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,387
but never saw it built...

619
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,095
And it took the child
from whom he was estranged

620
00:29:58,178 --> 00:29:59,637
to make the world remember.

621
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
And I thought:
I want to see it.

622
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:03,679
And I bet Wendy would like it,
too.

623
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,720
Here's what I bet.

624
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,720
I bet all Louis Kahn wanted
was to connect with his son.

625
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:11,053
But that his work
kept calling to him,

626
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:13,387
pushing him, driving him.

627
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,053
And at a certain point,
the gap was just too great.

628
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:20,762
But in the end,
the son found him.

629
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,845
And showed Kahn's greatness
to the rest of the world.

630
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,553
I have to imagine that
even through the sadness,

631
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:32,345
the time, the mortality,

632
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:35,595
there's a connection now,
between them.

633
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,804
That's very hopeful.

634
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,553
I want you to be right.

635
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:46,303
dramatic music

636
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,053
Helena,
I need you to track down

637
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:57,762
some old session notes from
storage in the Westport office.

638
00:30:57,845 --> 00:31:00,845
All my files for Taylor Mason.

639
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:11,387
-Hey.
-Hey.

640
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,261
Where have you been?
You haven't been very reachable.

641
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:15,261
Three alarm fire.
It's all hosed down.

642
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:17,053
All good.

643
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:19,387
I sent Chef Ryan out.

644
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,887
Figured it might be fun
if we cooked our own dinner.

645
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,387
Rolling gnocchi together?
Like in Godfather 3.

646
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,845
That didn't turn out
so well.

647
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,095
I refuse to believe
that such a thing

648
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,637
as Godfather 3
even exists.

649
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,637
Salute.

650
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,470
So, think about
what you want to make,

651
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:35,261
and we'll open a couple bottles
while we're prepping,

652
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:36,804
it'll be fun-

653
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,679
That sounds like a great start
to a night.

654
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,887
So, why do I
have a hunch

655
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,220
that the part after dinner's
gonna be even better?

656
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:45,512
Because you know
your customer.

657
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,261
You know what
a C.A.C.O. is?

658
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:01,845
The military thing.

659
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,512
It's Casualty Assistance
Calls Officer-

660
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,428
The ones who notify next of kin
when a soldier-

661
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,929
So who died?

662
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,720
More of a what.

663
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,512
The thing I said I could do
for you with Victor.

664
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,637
You lose another cushy
government job already-

665
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,178
Far from. No.

666
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:19,136
I am so deep in it,
in fact,

667
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,553
that my old enemies are
drawing down on me as we speak.

668
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:24,136
So, much as I'd like to
do you your courtesy,

669
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,345
any move I make with Victor
will invite scrutiny

670
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,679
from the very people
you want to avoid.

671
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,762
Rather than bury the case,
it will mark it with an X.

672
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:35,261
Huh,
so I'm collateral damage.

673
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:38,220
Normally I'm the one
casually leaving the wreckage.

674
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,261
I imagine
this feels worse.

675
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:42,929
Both suck.

676
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,637
Well. I appreciate you
delivering the news

677
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,595
promptly and in person.

678
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,804
I'm thinking
we do some steaks.

679
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:02,804
I make
a mean smashed potatoes.

680
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:05,303
Not mashed.
I smash those fuckers.

681
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:06,637
You know what,
I think you're right.

682
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,970
Let's go out.
What?

683
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,553
Ahh, we don't need to cook.
Quick dinner.

684
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:13,220
What happened?

685
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:16,095
You went to the elevator okay
and you came back all fucked up.

686
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,929
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

687
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,428
What? Did the fire
flare back up on you?

688
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:23,637
Details. Go. C'mon.

689
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,428
I said I don't want to
talk about it. Fuck.

690
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,720
Come on.

691
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:31,136
Why don't we just have a drink
or something?

692
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
This is
one of those moments

693
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,345
that people get to
when they scuba dive.

694
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:39,387
It's 'maximum
recreational depth.'

695
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,553
You wondering if there's enough
oxygen to go deeper?

696
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:46,136
No, you're wondering if
you want to go deeper with me.

697
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,762
We've been deep.

698
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:50,011
Sure.
But that doesn't count.

699
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,136
You were married
for a long time.

700
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,345
For you, talking business-

701
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:55,804
or whatever issue
you're having-

702
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:59,970
with a woman
is more intense,

703
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,845
it's more personal
than sex.

704
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,929
And you are not
ready for that.

705
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,929
That doesn't seem right.

706
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,804
No.
It's not right.

707
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,136
But it is true.

708
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:16,679
I'll give you
your space.

709
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,970
Hey.

710
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:27,929
You ok?

711
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,553
The question is:
are you?

712
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,011
With this?

713
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:33,261
If I said "no"
would it change anything?

714
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:35,970
Just do
what you have to do.

715
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:38,762
You offered this.
You suggested-

716
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,679
Kevin! Eva!

717
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:41,929
I allowed it, yes.

718
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,387
And now,
I am facilitating it.

719
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,845
By taking the kids out.

720
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,595
But it is not fair
to ask me to like it.

721
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,845
I'm taking the kids out
for the night,

722
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,178
so you can have your...
personal training session.

723
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,679
Thank you.

724
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:55,845
Okay, guys.

725
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,053
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

726
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,887
Bye, Dad.

727
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,095
Don't let Grandpa
ruin your fun.

728
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,345
Words to live by.

729
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,387
dramatic music

730
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,720
mid-tempo music

731
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,053
Mm.

732
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,178
So do I call you Mistress Cassie
or Goddess or-

733
00:35:58,261 --> 00:35:59,887
Unh!

734
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:15,303
dramatic music

735
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,387
Figured
I'd find you here.

736
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,845
Dad. You are living out
your pathology again.

737
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:29,178
If you mean
not wanting another thing

738
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:30,762
ripped out from
under me, yeah.

739
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:33,178
I think I've been pretty clear
about that.

740
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:35,804
That's not
the way it happened.

741
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,553
We both know it,
so it's time to admit it.

742
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:40,637
What?

743
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,387
"Worked on a project
using company resources.

744
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,804
Did not share it with company
executives in a proper manner."

745
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,929
How did you get ahold of
my personnel file?

746
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,804
dramatic music

747
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:54,428
What matters is:
I know.

748
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,178
My supervisor wasn't capable
of understanding it.

749
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,595
He would have fucked it up.
I was taking it to the CEO-

750
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,637
But instead you tried to walk it
across the street?

751
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,136
I wanted it to find
a proper home

752
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,345
where it would see
the light of day

753
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:09,178
and get the chance
that it deserved.

754
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,762
And now you're spying on me...
and taking their side.

755
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:14,428
I'm not.
I'm on your side.

756
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:17,428
I always have been.

757
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:20,553
What if I told you that
your company had you in line

758
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,553
to be CTO
before you did what you did?

759
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,011
Are you kidding me?
Don't bullshit about that-

760
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:29,553
Would I bullshit
about that?

761
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,553
We are here now.

762
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,845
We can't hide secrets
and live on false memories.

763
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,261
Not anymore.

764
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:41,261
Hey, kid, what do you say
we keep it clean

765
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,011
and go it alone
for another round?

766
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,261
With you funding
the next steps.

767
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:47,470
An additional fourteen million,
by my calculations,

768
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:49,845
which you'll see back
fivefold.

769
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:52,261
Your calculations are
inaccurate. And low.

770
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:53,887
And that return
is unrealistic.

771
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,428
We need
a strategic partnership.

772
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:59,053
There are areas,
myriad areas,

773
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:01,637
where your wisdom,
your smarts surpass mine.

774
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,679
That's what I tried to explain
to Mafee.

775
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:07,679
But this isn't one of them.
Is it?

776
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:11,095
No.

777
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:14,303
So?

778
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:17,595
We go your way.

779
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:25,095
It is hard becoming a new
version of yourself.

780
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,053
You finally
understand me.

781
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:49,261
Sorry,
I know an ounce of this

782
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:51,512
probably costs more than caviar
but, uh-

783
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,095
Jesus, Chuck.

784
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,720
It got a little
out of hand.

785
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,804
It'll be okay.

786
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,845
It barely hurts-

787
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,512
I'm not worried
about that.

788
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:04,345
People are gonna think
I did this to you.

789
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:07,970
I'll tell 'em I took up
jiu-jitsu again.

790
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:11,553
To plausibly account for these
bruises. And future ones.

791
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:15,303
Wait, you plan on
continuing with this?

792
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,470
Wendy. What I did tonight...
I can't live without.

793
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:25,845
And I won't.

794
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:41,970
dramatic music

795
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,095
You never invited me
for coffee.

796
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:49,970
Even when we were dating.

797
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:54,178
These days we rarely talk,
so...

798
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,220
I made a mistake
forcing the lockup.

799
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:59,929
So you're releasing
the money?

800
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,804
No, that stays
where it is.

801
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:03,970
But you and the kids
can go to California.

802
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:06,095
You getting re-married?

803
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:07,762
New kid on the way?

804
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:08,845
Gonna off yourself?

805
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:10,929
0-fer-3.

806
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:12,261
Talk to me.

807
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:14,178
We don't do that
anymore.

808
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:15,762
We can't.

809
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,220
You're merely getting
what you asked for.

810
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:18,553
On your timeline.

811
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:19,762
Your way.

812
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:21,303
Suited to your needs.

813
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:22,553
Well, my money,
you know?

814
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,261
Yeah.
I really do.

815
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:27,220
That was wrong
and stupid to say.

816
00:40:27,303 --> 00:40:30,178
I'm sorry.
-But it was true.

817
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,637
I don't know
what you valued in me.

818
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,720
If it was the street smarts
or my neighborhood roots-

819
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,845
Loyalty.

820
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:40,261
And at some point,
you feel like I violated that.

821
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,970
Shortly after I did.

822
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,178
I was about to say that.

823
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:47,595
I know.
I spared us both.

824
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:52,804
Sometimes I wonder:
what if you didn't get so rich?

825
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,887
What if we lived
a simpler life-

826
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,095
Nah. There was never going to be
a different version.

827
00:40:58,178 --> 00:41:00,178
That's not how I'm made.

828
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,303
soft music

829
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:04,929
You're right.

830
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,220
It's nothing to be sad about,
but for some reason I am.

831
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,178
Send me a rider saying
I can take the kids...

832
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,720
and a quarter of the money...

833
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,470
wherever the fuck I want.

834
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:48,470
Ooooh, your wife
laid into you good.

835
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,679
Jiu-jitsu.

836
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,011
Just getting
the blood going.

837
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,762
Well, we've got a scorcher
here today.

838
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:04,387
I know in the box score

839
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,470
this'll just go down as
a motion to enjoin,

840
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:09,136
but I'm looking at
a clash of the titans.

841
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,512
One of those old-fashioned

842
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:13,136
Sunday afternoon
franchise crossovers.

843
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,136
King Kong vs. Godzilla.

844
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,720
Or maybe Abbott and Costello
against the Mummy.

845
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,178
Mr. Rhoades,
you're away.

846
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,512
Thank you, Your Honor.

847
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:24,470
I'd like you to vacate
Mr. Connerty's

848
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:26,804
material witness claim against
the banker, Mr. Abington,

849
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:29,845
and block SDNY from putting it
in front of a grand jury.

850
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:32,595
I'm sure you've got a great
answer to this, but...why?

851
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,845
Abington is my witness.

852
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,595
I found him.
I signed him up.

853
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,720
Brought him back
to these shores.

854
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:41,011
The Feds can't just bigfoot
and take what they want.

855
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:43,178
Like you did so many times
when you were in that job?

856
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:47,762
These crimes have a nexus to
New York State-my constabulary.

857
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:51,595
The underlying financial fraud
of...Target X originated here.

858
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,345
You can say his name.
I closed the court

859
00:42:53,428 --> 00:42:54,720
and agreed
to seal the record

860
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,470
so we can talk about
what we're talking about.

861
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:58,720
But he can't.
Not really.

862
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:00,804
There are issues of
executive privilege here.

863
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:03,428
Going after Treasury Secretary
Krakow would involve

864
00:43:03,512 --> 00:43:05,679
delving into some seriously
protected federal material

865
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:07,553
that Mr. Rhoades does not
have access to.

866
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:09,428
And given everything that would
need to be redacted,

867
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,887
Mr. New York State would be
gagged and blindfolded.

868
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,553
A position he knows well-
-None o' that-

869
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:16,720
I can make the case without
any of those concerns.

870
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,345
You just want
what I have.

871
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:20,595
Is that what this is,
Mr. Connerty,

872
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,345
the green-eyed monster
of jealousy?

873
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:24,178
No. It's wanting something
done right.

874
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,679
Right for whom?

875
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:27,637
When Mr. Connerty
blows this case

876
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,637
how will we know
it's genuine incompetence

877
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,887
and that he didn't bury it
for his boss-

878
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,970
one Cabinet Secretary
covering for another.

879
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:35,970
That sounds more like
a Chuck Rhoades tactic.

880
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:38,220
Okay,
neutral corners.

881
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:40,136
You both make
decent points.

882
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,011
And it's fun as hell watching
you rock 'em and sock 'em.

883
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:45,428
But before someone's head
flies off, I'm gonna rule.

884
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:47,136
Judge,
I have more to say-

885
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,512
I'm about to
rule in your favor,

886
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,804
so maybe don't
pitch past the W.

887
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:56,011
He's got the federal records
and the witness-

888
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:59,679
I think a case in motion
should stay in motion.

889
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,387
So Mr. Rhoades's motion
is denied.

890
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,887
dramatic music

891
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,428
Yeah. Yeah, looks like
there's a new one

892
00:44:11,512 --> 00:44:14,136
darkening
right under your eye.

893
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,345
Might need Mick to cut ya
if you plan on continuing. Huh?

894
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:21,011
The modern thing is that
everyone wins.

895
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:23,178
But we win more, right-

896
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,387
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

897
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,762
I'm sorry, I tried to-

898
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:28,553
She did.

899
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:29,679
Go.

900
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:39,053
I should have looked at every
contract Taylor ever worked on.

901
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,095
Dissected every move.

902
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,595
Anticipated land mines.
But I didn't.

903
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:45,512
And now,
this guy Victor-

904
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:48,428
who used to work for me
and kind of still does-

905
00:44:48,512 --> 00:44:50,261
he could really hurt me.

906
00:44:50,345 --> 00:44:54,261
So, you gonna tell me what
changed from our last convo?

907
00:44:54,345 --> 00:44:58,053
Well, for one thing, I need to
solve this Victor problem-

908
00:44:58,136 --> 00:45:02,011
And you worked through
whatever you needed to,

909
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:04,053
to free yourself up.

910
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:06,637
Helped that it was
a prison of my own making.

911
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,345
I'd shown myself in.

912
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:10,637
I knew the way out. Clean.

913
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,679
And this isn't.

914
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:16,929
But I like messy.

915
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:19,303
'Cause it gives me
something to clean up.

916
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:23,220
I take control instead of
the mess controlling me.

917
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:29,804
You're right.

918
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:31,470
I should've been talking to you
about this

919
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:33,512
from the very beginning.

920
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:36,470
Yeah, true.

921
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:38,553
But you can tell me now...

922
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:41,970
dramatic music

923
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:46,345
You will not
sit with the SEC.

924
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:48,261
You don't need to anymore.

925
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,720
I cleaned up your mess:

926
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:52,470
I purchased
Mark to Market Analytics

927
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:53,720
for a sickening premium.

928
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:56,303
And with it,
the silence of the CEO-

929
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,720
who will not be cooperating
with the government.

930
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:01,303
But remember this,

931
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:04,303
when you look back on this
time at the end of your life,

932
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,679
it was me
who carried you.

933
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:09,261
Thank you.

934
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:10,762
Fuck you.

935
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:12,470
I now own a research firm
I never wanted.

936
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,303
And your ass.

937
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:16,595
You're going to
work off the debt.

938
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,679
If you want
more of my firm-

939
00:46:18,762 --> 00:46:20,345
You no longer
have a firm.

940
00:46:20,428 --> 00:46:22,845
Your fund has lost its utility
and is done.

941
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:26,178
You're now back at Axe Cap,
where you will work

942
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:29,553
like a fucking sharecropper
to clear your tab.

943
00:46:42,387 --> 00:46:43,553
Welcome back.

944
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:44,970
Some things have changed,
but-

945
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,887
Who's that?

946
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,595
Victor Mateo.

947
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,929
Hey, rock star.
What do you do here?

948
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,178
Earn.

949
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:02,845
I noticed a new addition
to my docket.

950
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,387
That health care case
begging for

951
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,762
some high-profile,
DeGiulio-made law.

952
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:08,679
That-
and a fondness for beer-

953
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:11,387
will light your path to
the highest court in the land.

954
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,387
Loving every step
of the climb...

955
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,387
You think Connerty knew

956
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,720
we were throwing that
Krakow case to him?

957
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:20,553
No way he knows
I want him to have it.

958
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,970
Men seldom realize when things
are rigged in their favor.

959
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:25,804
It would require them
to have a realistic

960
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,970
and limited view
of their skills.

961
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,804
To be in touch
with humility.

962
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:31,929
He doesn't present
so humble anymore.

963
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,261
Nope.
He took that viper home,

964
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:37,929
like it was a Kewpie doll
he won at the county fair.

965
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:39,887
And now, he and his boss
will go after each other

966
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,804
like Serbs and Croats.

967
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:46,178
So I get the same deal
as with the other guy?

968
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:48,428
Better. Because you'll get
federal protection.

969
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:51,178
Yeah, okay, sure.
Yeah.

970
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:55,053
So Krakow would come in,
personally, every other-

971
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:56,512
I'm in the middle
of the thing.

972
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:58,428
Your thing has to go
after this thing.

973
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:00,261
AG Jeffcoat's waiting.

974
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:01,220
In your office.

975
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:04,720
Excuse me.

976
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,428
Sorry you didn't make it up here
in time to watch me pants Chuck.

977
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:14,387
Well, as indelible an image
as that must have been,

978
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,095
you've had your fun.

979
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:18,136
Rest assured, I'm now turned to
the matter at hand.

980
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,053
Krakow.

981
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:22,929
You cannot prosecute
the Secretary of the Treasury.

982
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:24,470
That's a toxic look
for this Administration.

983
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:26,720
Drop the case.

984
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:30,637
Then Krakow goes free...
or Chuck gets him.

985
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,303
Let Chuck have at-
choke on any splatter.

986
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:37,345
You really like getting in there
behind the US Attorney's desk.

987
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:42,011
Every desk in the Department
of Justice is my desk.

988
00:48:42,095 --> 00:48:44,720
I didn't take this job
so you could run me

989
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:47,011
like your goddamn
remote control butler-

990
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:49,136
You didn't just
take this job.

991
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,929
You dirty tricked
your way into it,

992
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,345
you stepped over
a damned corpse for it-

993
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,053
You're the one
who knifed him.

994
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,345
And you said it was so this
place could run different-

995
00:48:55,428 --> 00:48:56,762
no more petty politics.

996
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:59,095
Petty?
We are talking about the parapet

997
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:01,720
around the fortress of Good
and Evil, you foolhardy child.

998
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:05,929
Cocksucker.

999
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,261
All right. You are right
at the line now, son.

1000
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,220
Chuck.

1001
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:11,929
This -
This is what he wanted.

1002
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:14,762
A hint of misconduct from
protecting a cabinet member,

1003
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:16,595
and a wedge between us.

1004
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:19,136
He knows you well enough to know
you'd come down like this-

1005
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,887
And you well enough to know that
you couldn't abide.

1006
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,303
But turns out...

1007
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:27,303
I can.

1008
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,178
dramatic music

1009
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:31,887
I will drop the case.
Immediately.

1010
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,887
We will stay in lockstep
and our focus will remain

1011
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:35,804
where it should-
on blunting Chuck Rhoades

1012
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:37,136
and knocking him
out of office.

1013
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:42,887
Maybe this desk really does
belong to you after all.

1014
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:47,929
dramatic music

1015
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,512
-Hi. Gia, Benjamin.
-Welcome to our club.

1016
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:30,220
Thank you.

1017
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:32,345
Michael Wagner.

1018
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,804
Maybe it's just
under Wags.

1019
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:38,595
I'm a neophyte.

1020
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:41,679
Not seeing it.

1021
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,553
I have the invitation
right here-

1022
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,553
Say gorgonzola.

1023
00:50:47,637 --> 00:50:50,220
Oh, you're gonna look pretty
in Page Six.

1024
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:52,595
Nussfaur.
You sent this.

1025
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:55,428
For you to endure
the humiliation, Wagner.

1026
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:59,095
Not of wearing a dress,
but of being an interloper.

1027
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:00,553
A trespasser.

1028
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:02,470
A buttinsky.

1029
00:51:02,553 --> 00:51:06,011
A social climber who has to
watch the ladder pulled up

1030
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:10,178
right in front of your grasping,
outstretched arms.

1031
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:13,053
You are making enemies
you cannot fathom

1032
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,804
by deputizing KBP

1033
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:19,053
in your little True Grit
revenge fantasy.

1034
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:23,303
You think this legal eagle would
proceed without my blessing?

1035
00:51:23,387 --> 00:51:25,595
The fucking Grand Swipe
is in on this?

1036
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:27,470
We're homies.

1037
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:31,220
Ordered the invite
myself.

1038
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:34,011
Which is the only invite
you'll ever receive.

1039
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:35,637
You're not getting in,
Wagner.

1040
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,345
Not today.

1041
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,261
Not ever.

1042
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:44,261
My vengeance will come
like I do-

1043
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:47,845
slow, thunderous,

1044
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:49,512
and in your eye.

1045
00:52:10,178 --> 00:52:11,679
And I just got confirmation.

1046
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:14,637
Brian Dana has countersigned
the revised term statement.

1047
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,970
We are official.

1048
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:18,011
-Wow.
-Hey, congratulations,

1049
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,428
-Mr. Mason.
-Congratulations.

1050
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,470
Dad, tonight's a celebration
not just

1051
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:23,136
of the quality of
your invention,

1052
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,553
but the new breadth
of your thinking.

1053
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,720
I will take that as
a genuine compliment,

1054
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:28,095
not a backhanded one.

1055
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,095
As intended.

1056
00:52:31,178 --> 00:52:33,553
Well, that's my cue.

1057
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:36,470
Good luck with the kickoff
meeting in the a.m.

1058
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,095
You know what,
I should walk out with you.

1059
00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:40,887
Get home
and start the prep on that.

1060
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:43,637
Ohh.
Exciting new chapter.

1061
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,553
Proud of you, Dad.

1062
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,595
I bring you a case
and a witness.

1063
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,303
Ooh.

1064
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:01,679
Krakow?

1065
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,053
Ah.

1066
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:06,011
Well, that must
be frustrating-

1067
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,595
working at a place where cases
come and go so strangely.

1068
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:11,345
No, funny thing-
I'm used to it.

1069
00:53:11,428 --> 00:53:13,387
Uh huh.
Yeah.

1070
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,428
Except when
I made these moves,

1071
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:19,095
you knew there was a greater
plan, a greater enemy.

1072
00:53:19,178 --> 00:53:21,804
You don't feel
that way now.

1073
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:25,220
Oh. You're worried
what's going on is small.

1074
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,387
And that it will
make you small.

1075
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,804
That banker is over
in your interview room.

1076
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,011
Enjoy him.

1077
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:34,303
You've earned it.

1078
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,303
Karl!

1079
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,261
What do I do
with this banker now?

1080
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,220
I didn't want 'im
in the first place.

1081
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,887
If I know Chuck Rhoades,

1082
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,428
he's gonna take the offcuts,

1083
00:53:46,512 --> 00:53:48,345
grind 'em up together,

1084
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:51,762
and make 'em into something
Jock can't stomach.

1085
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:57,637
Yesterday I was
out on the bluffs

1086
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,553
Over the ocean blue

1087
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:03,470
Was a girl swimming,
splashing in the water

1088
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:05,595
-She sure did look like you
-Hey.

1089
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:08,845
Oh. Hey Mafee.

1090
00:54:10,887 --> 00:54:12,261
This is a great place.

1091
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:14,053
Yeah,
it's my nightcap slot.

1092
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:15,595
You come in here?

1093
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:17,679
I'm meeting an old friend.
She picked it.

1094
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:19,136
"I've lost my mind"

1095
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,679
Okay...

1096
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:26,512
I'm dangerous

1097
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:28,178
This doesn't need to be
so uncomfortable.

1098
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,804
I'm dangerous to myself

1099
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,595
People take jobs
and they still talk.

1100
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,845
Axe wasn't my first boss,
probably won't be my last...

1101
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:40,053
How's yours?

1102
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:42,095
Lot going on,
you know-

1103
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,762
With their dad in town...

1104
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:46,261
Facebook.

1105
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,053
They're working on
something together?

1106
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,428
Sounds sweet.

1107
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:52,428
Right. Yeah.

1108
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,261
Could be big too.

1109
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:56,679
Sure, big corporate partner,
and all.

1110
00:54:56,762 --> 00:55:01,220
More of a startup vibe,
but yeah, big player.

1111
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:02,845
So darling if you're thinking
you need a project

1112
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:04,970
So what are you doing
for fun these days?

1113
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,804
Going to Mey-hee-co
next month.

1114
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,887
-Mm.
-Gonna try some surfing-

1115
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,512
-They -
-Oh. Shit.

1116
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:13,303
My friend had a problem
with the babysitter.

1117
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:16,178
Looks like I'll be going there
instead of enjoying this place.

1118
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:18,011
I'm dangerous

1119
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:19,512
Don't ever have kids.

1120
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:21,804
I'm dangerous
I...might want to.

1121
00:55:21,887 --> 00:55:23,470
I'm just kidding.

1122
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,762
They're the best.
You should have a bunch.

1123
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:27,428
And have a great night.

1124
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:31,178
I'm dangerous

1125
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:40,804
No communication from anyone
in the Taylor clan.

1126
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:42,512
They're locked down.

1127
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:44,512
Still don't know who they're
jumping into bed with-

1128
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:49,720
Ah. Looks like Cinderella
had a rough night.

1129
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:58,512
It's the startup.

1130
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:01,011
Brian Dana. 375Y.

1131
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:02,804
Yeah,
that's the one.

1132
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:05,011
I've been running
a side mission...

1133
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,595
I was hoping
that was the case.

1134
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,136
Well, now that we know 'who'
Mason is in business with,

1135
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,512
we watch them build it.

1136
00:56:12,595 --> 00:56:13,553
Then, we take it out.

1137
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,428
No.

1138
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:16,929
Not enough.
They can come back from that.

1139
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:18,595
No?

1140
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,720
Well, you know the family
topography. What then?

1141
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:23,095
Taylor needs to be
the one to crush it.

1142
00:56:23,178 --> 00:56:26,136
That will be
the most devastating blow.

1143
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,512
The weight
of that betrayal...

1144
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:31,303
they-plural,
both of them-

1145
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,595
will never come back
from that.

1146
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,553
dramatic music

1147
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:49,261
Enter.

1148
00:56:51,136 --> 00:56:52,970
Urgent or secret?

1149
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:55,345
When you approach
a judge this late,

1150
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:57,929
your cause
is one of the two.

1151
00:56:58,011 --> 00:56:59,929
I'm here to apply
for a wiretap.

1152
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:01,553
On Chuck Rhoades,
for public corruption.

1153
00:57:01,637 --> 00:57:03,387
You know, you shouldn't
go shopping for judges

1154
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:05,470
like in-season
stone fruit.

1155
00:57:05,553 --> 00:57:09,220
Your request was already
turned down by Judge DeGiulio.

1156
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:11,387
The relationship between
the good judge and Mr. Rhoades

1157
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,804
is all the more reason
why the wire is needed.

1158
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,178
You know I hold Chuck
in low regard.

1159
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:36,261
You also know that
you couldn't appeal to that.

1160
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:39,428
At least,
not that alone.

1161
00:57:39,512 --> 00:57:42,428
Well played.

1162
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:43,595
Fred Eaglesmith's
"Dangerous"

1163
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,762
You have your wire.

1164
00:57:56,845 --> 00:57:59,011
Thought I saw you
at an unmarked crossing

1165
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:01,095
Picking flowers
at the edge of a lane

1166
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:04,303
There was dust
on my windshield

1167
00:58:04,387 --> 00:58:05,929
I was looking in the mirror

1168
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:09,512
I almost got hit by a train

1169
00:58:09,595 --> 00:58:10,595
Later on at a four-way stop

1170
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:12,595
Hey.

1171
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,345
We- please, Wend,
can we just talk.

1172
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,512
I know that we can
find our way back to-

1173
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:17,470
I was thinking you were right
and we had nothing left

1174
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:23,178
Somebody blew their horn

1175
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:32,929
I'm dangerous

1176
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:37,720
To myself

1177
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:40,553
Yesterday I was out
on the bluffs

1178
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:43,178
Over the ocean blue

1179
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:46,637
Was a girl swimming,
splashing in the water

1180
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,178
She sure did look like you

1181
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:53,303
'Fore I knew it,
I was over the edge

1182
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:54,887
Somebody threw me a line

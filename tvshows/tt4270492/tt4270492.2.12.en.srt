1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,082
Previously on "Billions"...

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,833
Ice Juice.
I can take it over.

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:13,999
I just need the cash.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,082
You know,
my money's in a blind trust.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,083
That trust
was set aside for you.

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,999
Well, if this is
what it takes...

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,416
uh, to help you and Ira...

8
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,124
Chuck Rhoades Sr.
Has taken a significant stake

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,207
in a company
that's going public.

10
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,332
No shit.

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,082
Be fun if you could find a way

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,791
to lob a turd in the punch bowl.

13
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,707
You know
those poison-tip arrows

14
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,833
that go through one guy
and kill another?

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,874
Golden frog poison.

16
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,541
This might be like that.

17
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,457
It'll make for
a bumpy couple of days.

18
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,207
But no permanent damage, Doc?

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,708
I'm still not sure
I'd recommend it.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,707
People are getting sick
on Ice Juice.

21
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,667
Anybody betting it won't turn?

22
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,332
Axe doesn't get positions
this size wrong.

23
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,791
Get out of the stock, Chuck.
They're gonna crush you.

24
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,207
Wow, I'm glad to see
you view me as so defenseless.

25
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,499
But you don't understand
what's going on.

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,290
No, I think that I understand
plenty about your lack of faith.

27
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,791
Chuck, it's... it's
Armageddon. I'm gonna throw up.

28
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,416
Today, I kicked ass at work.

29
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,707
Whose ass did you kick?

30
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,542
Rhoades.

31
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,749
Big time.

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,374
I am so close to getting Axe.

33
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,125
You will get him...

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,290
Larry.

35
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,457
Are you supposed to be
across state lines?

36
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,082
There's no "supposed to"
for me anymore.

37
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,332
This is the first day
of the rest of my life.

38
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,333
I'm free and clear.

39
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:17,124
You, however...

40
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,624
well, consider this
me returning the courtesy.

41
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,542
You're getting arrested today,
Roberto.

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,290
I don't suppose
you'd like to share

43
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,666
any further details.

44
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,916
I'm not in the mood
to trifle with details.

45
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,165
I have my life to live
now that I'm a free man.

46
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,165
But in the spirit of friendship,

47
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,500
be glad to hold your watch.

48
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,417
Who was at the door?

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,583
Bobby?

50
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,374
Lawrence Boyd.

51
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:01,959
How?

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,916
Must've made a deal.

53
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,750
Some kind of trade for me.

54
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,416
They're coming for you?

55
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,749
He says they want to put me
where he was.

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,582
When?

57
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,500
Today.

58
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,374
I got to find out
if this is bullshit

59
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,666
or if it's real.

60
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,749
If it is real,

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,082
I have to make
some moves before we...

62
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,874
I know.
We talked about this.

63
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,083
We prepared for this.

64
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,082
But I'm not running with you.

65
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,375
And neither are the kids.

66
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,625
It's not fair to them.

67
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,208
So, you do what you got to do,
but we're staying.

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,249
Who said anything about running?

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,249
I'm not going anywhere.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,500
We stay and we fucking fight.

71
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,624
For a career bureaucrat,

72
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,958
you have a David Blaine-like
flair for the dramatic.

73
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,624
Because I chose a locale

74
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,707
where we were
unlikely to be seen?

75
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,624
That's not showmanship.
It's tradecraft.

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,124
Sure.

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,999
Are we gonna have to go through
the whole blind-drop routine

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,290
every time we meet?

79
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,542
We would, if we were
to continue meeting.

80
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,249
Oh, this isn't just
a grand entrance into the job.

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,833
You're doing a whole thing.

82
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,166
I know the kind of person
you are, Rhoades.

83
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,666
You want to put your hands
into the Axelrod case

84
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,874
and run your fingers
all through it.

85
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,707
You expect favors in return
for giving it to me.

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:06:00,040
But I cannot have you involved.

87
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,999
That's a bit like
telling the cow

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,457
not to involve itself
in the steak dinner.

89
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,165
Without it, no steak.

90
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,999
I am quite capable
of convicting Axelrod

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,624
with the tools at my disposal.

92
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,040
I no longer need you.

93
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,833
I have not made this sacrifice

94
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,207
to come up empty.

95
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,166
If you won't let me
get waist deep

96
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,749
in the Big Muddy with you,

97
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,208
then I'm gonna want something
for my trouble.

98
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,542
Go.

99
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,375
The Ice Juice IPO

100
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:32,082
never tracks back to my family,

101
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,624
to my father's investment
in any way.

102
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,374
Seal it off.

103
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,375
I can't just hide discovery.

104
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,457
Oh, I'm not asking you
to hide discovery.

105
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,207
I'm asking you
not to discover it

106
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,374
in the first place.

107
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,999
Some people would
call that a cover up.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,083
Well, Unimaginative types,
with no pizzazz.

109
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,082
I'm taking Axelrod
at the closing bell.

110
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,624
He'll be sure to be at his desk.

111
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,707
You can read about the rest
in the news.

112
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,332
I won't do what you've asked.

113
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,749
And this is the end
of the matter for you.

114
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,165
From here on,
it's just my team and me.

115
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,916
You're a hard man, Dake.

116
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,416
But a word of caution.

117
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,457
You and your team go chasing Axe

118
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,541
up into those hills without me,

119
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,041
don't forget one thing.

120
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,207
What's that?

121
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,542
A good supply of body bags.

122
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,082
We're sorry.

123
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,874
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

124
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,959
or is no longer in...

125
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:48,958
Hello.

126
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,249
Oh, good. I caught you.

127
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,290
Yeah.
I've been meaning to call.

128
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,458
Oh?

129
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,916
Look, I'll just say it.

130
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,958
I'm not happy I was right
about that stock.

131
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm past it. I'm prime.

132
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,749
Have no further concern for me
on that front.

133
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,791
Well, I'm glad
we have therapy tonight,

134
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,582
because I feel like
you're avoiding

135
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,290
- really talking about it.
- No.

136
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,457
I have come to the decision

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,624
that we are done
with marital counseling.

138
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,291
I am.

139
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,499
I didn't realize...

140
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,124
By day's end,
all will become clear to you.

141
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,499
And I will be glad
to discuss it ad infinitum,

142
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,708
just the two of us.

143
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,999
You know, the reason people, we,

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,499
go to therapy together,

145
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,499
is that having
an impartial witness,

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,499
- a counselor...
- I know.

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,040
And I also know
that life without you

148
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,666
is a misery.

149
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,416
And all the whinging
and the whining that we both,

150
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,165
at least I, do in therapy

151
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,966
seems to be having
the opposite effect for me.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,165
I see.

153
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,207
I will be coming home
tonight after work.

154
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,666
And, once all
is out in the open,

155
00:08:55,667 --> 00:09:00,040
I sincerely hope
that you will come home, too.

156
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,249
Well, I guess I have to accept
that you may not.

157
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,370
But I will be there waiting.

158
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,874
I got your text.

159
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,707
If there's an arrest imminent,
I have received no notice.

160
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,290
Does Hall have any insight?

161
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,541
Hall's a ghost.

162
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,125
There is no more Hall.

163
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,291
Jesus.

164
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,332
That means this is for real.

165
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,082
Find out what you can.

166
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,040
See if there's a way out.

167
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,249
I'm on it.

168
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,040
If an arrest is unavoidable,

169
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,541
negotiate the terms
of my surrender

170
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:43,290
for the end of the day,
no cameras, immediate bail.

171
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,999
We get this part over with,
then we start digging in.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,082
All right.

173
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,624
Listen, until I reach them...

174
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,542
I'll stay underground
and keep moving.

175
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,792
Uh...

176
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,582
Can I get you a...

177
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,416
You can't go to bed
with Jenna Jameson

178
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,082
and expect to wake up
with Snow White.

179
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,416
Which means?

180
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,500
Know who you're fucking.

181
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,624
I feel caught a bit off guard.

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,333
That's how I feel.

183
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:11,916
So you can't feel that way.

184
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:12,958
I just heard

185
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,541
that you're behind a move
against Axelrod,

186
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,582
that it's another office
prosecuting,

187
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,499
but your DNA's all over it.

188
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,999
Axelrod is about to be arrested.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,165
I did put it in motion,

190
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,582
but it can't track back to me.

191
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,707
Then why am I hearing
what I'm hearing?

192
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,749
How are you hearing
what you're hearing?

193
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,124
I used to peg Freddy Reyes
in the AG's office.

194
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,958
Well, only once in the office.

195
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,916
Point is,
the word's leaking out of D.C.

196
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,165
That doesn't work for me.

197
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,582
My reputation's
all tied up with yours right now

198
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,624
and you jackpotted me.

199
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,290
- I jackpotted you?
- You jackpotted me.

200
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,999
Our entire agreement
was based on

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,958
you telling me everything
as soon as I needed to know it,

202
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,624
which is immediately, always.

203
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,290
Okay.
Perhaps some coffee, tea?

204
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,291
Don't charm me.

205
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,666
Foley knew
I might take down Axe.

206
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,457
I needed to in order to be ready

207
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,624
to take the next step.

208
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,416
There is no "might"
with Jack Foley.

209
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,541
Rogue moves don't fly.

210
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,458
If he believes

211
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,124
that you are holding back
from him or me,

212
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,916
he'll consider himself released
from his commitment to you.

213
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,165
Then convince him
I'm holding nothing back.

214
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,416
Convince me first.

215
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,040
I am in process
of extracting an assurance

216
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,874
from the United States Attorney
for the Eastern District,

217
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,416
that my role
and my family's role

218
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,332
shall never surface.

219
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,208
You've got that?

220
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,208
In process.

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,499
And, should that fail

222
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,290
and my father's name
become public,

223
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,958
my father will absolutely affirm

224
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,541
that he accessed my trust
without my knowledge.

225
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,166
He will take the hit.

226
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,875
You'll need that in writing.

227
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,333
Simple as asking him.

228
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,874
Don't you worry, George.

229
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,332
We'll all be
cheesing and grinning in Albany

230
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,874
soon enough.

231
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,083
No Ice Juice nonsense
is gonna change that.

232
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,708
I signed off on you.
Are you making me wrong?

233
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,332
No, sir.

234
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,792
I'll try and sell it to Foley.

235
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,875
Rico!

236
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,874
Is there any law enforcement
here?

237
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,333
No.

238
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,791
You let me know if any show up.

239
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,250
You got it, boss.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Morning. Coffee?

241
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
Burn bin.

242
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,580
Take that out and torch it.

243
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,541
Is this shit really happening?

244
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,124
I believe it is.

245
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Fuck.

246
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,290
Get the shredders here, stat.

247
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,125
We'll do the paper files here.

248
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,541
We'll take care of
the hard drives

249
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,749
with plasma torches
in the loading bay.

250
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,124
Let's talk next steps.

251
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,582
All outside money
will be heading for the exits

252
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,332
within 24 hours of an arrest.

253
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,624
You should name a CIO
to manage the rest.

254
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,999
Don't know who you want,

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,624
but you should pick him
right away.

256
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,374
I'm the Chief Investment
Officer.

257
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,040
That's why it's called
Axe Capital.

258
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,082
Jefé, with what you are facing,

259
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,124
how are you gonna stay
on top of all this?

260
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,457
What we do, or fail to do,
in the seconds after your arrest

261
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,667
could save us or cost us
hundreds of millions of dollars.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,249
Fuck.

263
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,582
You're right about that part.

264
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,583
Taylor.

265
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,500
Good morning.

266
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,791
A few questions.

267
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,082
One,
your 30-day market outlook?

268
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,082
Two, how will the market respond
to the next Fed meeting?

269
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:18,040
Three, if we needed to liquidate
all our positions quickly,

270
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,374
in order to get into cash

271
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,666
to offer redemptions
without taking losses,

272
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,582
how would we do it?

273
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,666
Build me a model.

274
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,917
Okay.
I'll get right on all that.

275
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,124
What the hell am I gonna say
to my boys?

276
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,249
Tell them the truth.

277
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,374
The government's
a bunch of fucking liars.

278
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,208
And the boys have permission

279
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,499
to punch the teeth out of anyone

280
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,792
who talks shit about you.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,208
I've been here too long.

282
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,500
This is how
we communicate today.

283
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,792
Wait for my call.

284
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,040
Pop quiz.

285
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,249
Lawrence Boyd is currently
"A," mopping floors;

286
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,374
"B," cleaning toilets;
"C," scrubbing potatoes; or...

287
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,374
I'm guessing "D,"
none of the above.

288
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,707
There's that
Princeton test-taking.

289
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,582
Did he off himself?

290
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,999
That is dark.

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,249
Uh, no.

292
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,707
I just heard from a contact
at the Bureau of Prisons.

293
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,959
He's been released.

294
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,370
What the fuck is that about?

295
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,457
I thought I made it pretty clear

296
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,416
I never wanted
to talk to you again.

297
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,082
This isn't a social call.

298
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,207
I'm reaching out as counsel
for Robert Axelrod.

299
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,416
That shouldn't feel good
in your mouth.

300
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,624
Bryan, how fast are you
moving on the arrest?

301
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,374
Do you have a warrant?

302
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,624
Orrin, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

303
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,625
You got questions?

304
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,750
We got questions.

305
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,457
We need to see Chuck.

306
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,958
He's out.

307
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,124
I'll call him.

308
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,959
He's not reachable
at the moment.

309
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,874
Ice Juice
never made anyone sick.

310
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,457
They were faking?

311
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,249
No, they were actually ill,

312
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,999
just not from your product.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,040
Uh, in,
in the next little while,

314
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,874
that will be revealed
for what it was...

315
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,290
sabotage.

316
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,457
A deliberate, criminal act
to injure the company.

317
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,624
An act by...

318
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,499
Axelrod.
Yes.

319
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,457
An attack on us.

320
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,707
On you.

321
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,874
Yes.

322
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,792
So Ira can sue Axelrod

323
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,874
for his money back.

324
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm guessing I can't.

325
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,792
No.

326
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,207
Why is that?

327
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,541
Because that would
reveal Chuck's involvement,

328
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,500
testimony and all that,

329
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:08,457
and Chuck did not
set all this in motion

330
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,165
to have that happen.

331
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,291
Did you, son?

332
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:21,166
No, Dad. I did not.

333
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,207
You baited him?

334
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,916
You used my company,
my career, my future...

335
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,124
My money.

336
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,499
And my own. Yeah.

337
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,666
Moves like that...

338
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,249
Where do you get
the fucking nerve?!

339
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,916
I can't believe you let me
fucking apologize to you!

340
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,624
And no one got sick from it!

341
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,165
You'll get it back.

342
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,332
After the criminal case,

343
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,833
recovering in civil court
will be...

344
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,082
After he's convicted.

345
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,833
After another
four to seven years

346
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:52,750
of dragging him
through court, maybe.

347
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,707
Until then?

348
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,207
When I am governor...

349
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,040
When you're governor?

350
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,833
What the fuck happened to you?

351
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,165
When this gets out...

352
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,290
It won't.

353
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,667
And you will make sure
that it does not.

354
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,249
You will protect me and my role.

355
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,499
It is to your benefit
to have me as governor.

356
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,624
You should act
out of rationality,

357
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,792
not emotion.

358
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,625
Why? You didn't.

359
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,165
This is an affidavit saying that

360
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:39,791
you acted on your own
in accessing my trust.

361
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,291
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,667
Dad, I need you to sign this.

363
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,040
You know, this is what
you always wanted,

364
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,791
me, your son, your scion,

365
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,999
in that office...

366
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,208
in that chair.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,791
Close the door.

368
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,208
I don't want anyone
to see me in here.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,666
Is this about you or Axe?

370
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,916
Both. All of us.

371
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:40,165
And I don't want them
to figure it out ahead of time.

372
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,333
Have a seat.

373
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,332
Put words together,
in a sentence,

374
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,000
that might give me a sense
of what the actual fuck.

375
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,125
So you don't know?

376
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,791
Look, I need you,
but I don't know

377
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,916
how much I can trust you
on this one thing,

378
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,499
so I am not sure how to proceed.

379
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,291
Talk to me or don't, Wags.

380
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,833
Axe is gonna be arrested.

381
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,834
By Chuck?

382
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,959
We don't know.

383
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,499
I tried to get him to delegate,
name a CIO,

384
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:18,875
but I failed.

385
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,457
Well, if you raised it,
it'll work on him.

386
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,457
He'll come to the right decision
himself.

387
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,707
I think he'll need
a push from you.

388
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
Mm-hmm.

389
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,542
And then...

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,207
as far as I'm concerned,

391
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,207
I have to really
step up to lead and...

392
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,833
You're ready to do
whatever you need to.

393
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,374
It doesn't feel like that to me.

394
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,833
Describe it.

395
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:47,040
Erratic heartbeat,
prickly sweat down my spine,

396
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,290
sack high and tight.

397
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,166
- Panic.
- Yep.

398
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,082
It means
you're not fooling yourself

399
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,416
into thinking it'll be easy.

400
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,124
It means your adrenaline
is firing, and your synapses.

401
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,207
Means you're ready to meet

402
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,166
whatever anyone
throws at you today.

403
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,040
And if I need a reminder,
or backup?

404
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,416
I'm right here.

405
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:07,083
For keeps?

406
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:11,582
I'm right here.

407
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,458
Today.

408
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,958
What the fuck is this, Louis?

409
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,040
It's the bill
for the new solvent.

410
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,874
Yeah. I can see that.
I mean, why the hell is it

411
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,541
40 percent more than the PERC?
PERC is bad stuff, boss.

412
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,124
It's bad for the staff,
bad for the environment.

413
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,374
The new stuff is organic.

414
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,916
No, the new stuff's
too expensive.

415
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,499
So, now that we got the vats
the Orgo shit came in,

416
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,959
we go back to the PERC
and we put it in the Orgo.

417
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,000
Give me a minute, Louis.

418
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,458
They're coming for you,
aren't they?

419
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,417
All right.
So, what's gonna happen?

420
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:29,833
How's the firm gonna handle it?

421
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,749
Who are you
handing the reins over to?

422
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,999
Just... just so you know,

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,374
I'd keep a firm grasp of them,
as long as it took,

424
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,165
and I'd give them
right back to you

425
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,999
the minute you were out.
Nothing's happening yet.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,499
Plans are being contemplated.

427
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,165
And if and when I need you,
I know where to find you.

428
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,999
Still can't believe you put
your money into this place.

429
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,541
Ah, diversification.
Positive cash flow.

430
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,249
But, you know, I'm 24/7
ready to deal with Axe Cap.

431
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,541
Yeah, that's not why I came.

432
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,666
You've been through this.

433
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,207
I need to know what the fuck
is gonna happen to me

434
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,124
when I get arrested.

435
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,666
Minute by minute.

436
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,416
I could tell you
it's no big deal,

437
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,833
but I'm not
in the lying-to-you game.

438
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,207
Look, at least
you got some warning.

439
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,332
It's not gonna be a shock.

440
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,374
Uh-huh.

441
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,624
And now what?

442
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,707
You got to eat something
before you go in,

443
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,124
because they'll starve you.

444
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,457
And if they do feed you,
it's gonna be garbage.

445
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,124
But more important than that,
find time to take a shit,

446
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,207
because you don't want
that business pending

447
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,208
when you're in there.

448
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,833
What?
I'm giving you the real.

449
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:33,040
So, there's always
at least one guard

450
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,374
who wants to get paid.

451
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,666
Find that fucker and pay him.

452
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,708
Mrs. Axelrod.

453
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,874
I'm trying to decide

454
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,624
how best to protect
my interests...

455
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,625
Ah.

456
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,249
I'm afraid I can't help.

457
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm engaged by your husband.

458
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,958
That brings with it,
uh, confidentiality, yes,

459
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,541
but also loyalty.

460
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,332
And there are strict rules
governing conflict

461
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,542
that I cannot break, so...

462
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,417
Then let's make this
an unofficial consultation.

463
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:19,582
Are there things I can do today
to protect myself?

464
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,249
Would I be wise to consider
extreme measures,

465
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,958
separation, divorce?

466
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:29,207
I'm going to have to ask you
to pick up the money

467
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,417
and put it back in your bag.

468
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,749
I will not talk with you
about any of this.

469
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,666
I cannot state,
officially or unofficially,

470
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:45,207
where your interests diverge,
or if they diverge.

471
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,416
On a human note,

472
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,290
I understand the swirl

473
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,811
that must be
going on inside your head.

474
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,333
But you have to find
counsel for it elsewhere.

475
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,165
Will you at least,
on a human note,

476
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,624
tell me this.

477
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,999
If I do stay,
the money that's mine...

478
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,624
They'll freeze everything
at first.

479
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,666
So, you'll have to
get through that.

480
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,416
But since
there's no pre-nup,

481
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,833
half of everything is yours.

482
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,749
And when the government
can't prove

483
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,874
it was all ill gotten,

484
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:25,500
which we won't let them...

485
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:28,041
What's mine stays mine.

486
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,667
Hey, morning, fellas.

487
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,082
How would you guys like
to take these

488
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,083
and use them a little?

489
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,250
Okay.

490
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,416
Just look at them,
working away...

491
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,958
They have no idea they're about
to be utterly roasted

492
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,290
by a flame thrower.
As soon as he's in custody,

493
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,124
before the news streams out,
we should sit them all down.

494
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,082
Group meeting.
Let them vent their fears.

495
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,499
The people that are
too affected, we send home.

496
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,082
Let them take a leave
if they want.

497
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,457
The rest of us will focus on
saving Axe Capital.

498
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:07,707
Yeah.

499
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,916
That's very sweet
and supportive.

500
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,541
But no.

501
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,375
I don't need you
to be the team doctor

502
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,666
who stops people from playing

503
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,707
and puts them
in the concussion protocol.

504
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,374
I need you to be the team doctor

505
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,541
with smelling salts,
cortisone shots, steroids,

506
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,707
and fucking Lasix
for their lungs,

507
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,916
who tapes them back together
and shoves them back in.

508
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,041
Okay.

509
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,582
Look at you.

510
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,125
Leading.

511
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,750
I'm glad we're foxhole buddies.

512
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,499
Hey.

513
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,999
Where I come from,
at a certain point,

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,582
a guy just fucking punches
another guy in the mouth.

515
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,791
Well, you'll have the chance

516
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,582
to do just that, Bryan,
before long.

517
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,958
But I don't think you will.

518
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,916
Then you had better
start explaining...

519
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,667
Not now. I have Sacker
waiting in my office.

520
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,500
What do you have for me?

521
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,583
This isn't easy.

522
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,624
Oh?

523
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,083
I'm taking a job
at Sullivan & Cromwell.

524
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,624
I'm not ready to lose you.

525
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,666
Honestly, Chuck,
you should've made that

526
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,999
a little more clear to me,

527
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,958
by letting me
crack some fucking heads

528
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,959
when I was about to.

529
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,499
I came here for two reasons.

530
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,165
To be close to
the best prosecutor

531
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,249
this office has ever known,

532
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,374
learn from him,

533
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:46,332
and to actually put the bad guys
in the goddamned hoosegow.

534
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,249
Well, now, there, right there.

535
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,833
You wouldn't even know that word

536
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,708
if you hadn't
studied at my knee.

537
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:53,875
Things changed,
so now I have, too.

538
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,624
The job I've been offered

539
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,165
will allow me to handle
big criminal defense cases,

540
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,124
as I see fit.

541
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,582
The best moves
I've made in my life

542
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,165
have required the most
discipline, patience, and trust,

543
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,999
so I ask you, hold for a day.

544
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,958
See how some things
shake out around here.

545
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:17,333
Perhaps I can make you
an even more compelling offer.

546
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,165
Wait.

547
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,499
And then,
if you still decide to go,

548
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,000
well, it'll be with my blessing.

549
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,082
I expected to sit down with you,

550
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,791
but I figured it would be
after we arrested your client.

551
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:39,207
Or at least after I announced
my intention to.

552
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,707
Then. Now.

553
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,541
We're here.

554
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:46,374
And my client is interested in

555
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,624
reviving the immunity deal

556
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,833
that we discussed a while back.

557
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,541
The same deal you passed on?

558
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,999
That's the one.

559
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,666
That deal is no longer alive.

560
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,624
It's a corpse in a pine box

561
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,791
covered with dirt.

562
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,082
And, as you somehow know,

563
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:11,374
I will be arresting
and charging your client today.

564
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,916
Then, let me organize
his surrender.

565
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,707
Let's keep it civil.

566
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,916
No press.
Bail pre-arranged.

567
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,416
He gets
to say goodbye to the wife,

568
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,916
then we come in.

569
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,040
No perp walk.

570
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:29,833
You're in a U.S. Attorney's
Office, Mr. Bach,

571
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,666
not some souk buying a rug.

572
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:36,040
I don't negotiate.

573
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,624
I will take him

574
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,500
at the time and in the manner

575
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,416
of my choosing.

576
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,583
Then good luck
fucking finding me!

577
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,041
Mr. Bach, mother of God.

578
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,500
I'll be referring your conduct
to the Bar Association.

579
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,958
Well, then...

580
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:04,250
I guess I just shit myself
with fear.

581
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,582
I know how to do what he wants.

582
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,457
I'll call you back.

583
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,290
Excellent.
Break it down for me.

584
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,791
I'd rather walk him through it
in person.

585
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,500
That way, it won't be diluted
or misstated in any way.

586
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,916
No, you're right. Fine.

587
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,624
Axe will reach out
to meet with you

588
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,874
if and when he's ready.

589
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,583
Do you have a way to reach him?

590
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,792
What if I did?

591
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:28,834
You have to give it to me.
Now.

592
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,125
Just hit redial.

593
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,165
Are we meeting here
because your boat's

594
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,332
picking you up and heading
for international waters

595
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,416
when we're done?

596
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,249
How did you know
I was being arrested?

597
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,916
Setting aside
the decoy questions

598
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,666
about the Fed and the market,

599
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,833
what you were asking about was

600
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,833
how to protect the portfolio
in the worst case scenario,

601
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,582
before word leaks on the Street.

602
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,500
When that happens,

603
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:05,457
everyone will look at
our most recent 13F

604
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,707
and start shooting
against our illiquid names.

605
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,707
And the only way to beat them
to it is to have sold first.

606
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,040
So, what do you have for me?

607
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,999
I take over
the Program Trading Desk

608
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,207
and export our holdings.

609
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,582
I load up the whole program

610
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,874
and then import them
into the trading system.

611
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,707
I'll create a phantom algo
for our biggest illiquid names

612
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,874
to protect against
the high-frequency guys.

613
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,416
And I'll use
six different brokers

614
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,707
with six different baskets,
a billion each,

615
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,040
currency, tech, big pharma,
et cetera.

616
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:32,082
And then, on your signal,
I hit the button.

617
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,041
We take maybe
a five percent hit,

618
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:36,040
but that's why
they call it a fire sale.

619
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,541
And if the arrest happens,

620
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:41,124
you are going to ask me to be
the Chief Investment Officer.

621
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,125
I'll do it.

622
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,374
Well, I'm still not sure
that I'll need to.

623
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,958
That's because you know that

624
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,707
even if you focus on Axe Capital
half the time,

625
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,457
you would do a better job
than I would.

626
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,874
And that's true.

627
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,040
But, what's best for Axe Cap,
long term,

628
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,374
is for you to focus
every bit of energy you have

629
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,749
on getting out of the situation
you are in.

630
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,666
You have to know that I've
got the business in control,

631
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,250
so you can avoid a conviction,
prison, all that.

632
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,791
I have too much
to learn from you

633
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,667
to lose you now.

634
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Go get your program in place
and wait for my word.

635
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:25,249
Just so you know,

636
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,207
my boat's draft is too deep
for this dipshit marina.

637
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,458
And I'm not sailing away
from anything.

638
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,124
Thanks for coming.

639
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,457
You're smoking again?
What the fuck?

640
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,707
Forget that shit.

641
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,124
First, I need your phone.

642
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,290
Yeah?
Yeah.

643
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,583
Okay.

644
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,124
And I'm gonna provide
the equity piece.

645
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,582
To grow the business.

646
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,749
Great.

647
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,190
We're also gonna
put it in your name.

648
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,582
Were you followed?

649
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,165
I took precautions.

650
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,499
This place was like
a sanctuary for me

651
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
when I was a kid.

652
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,207
The game is different now.

653
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,290
Rules have changed, you know?

654
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,416
Back when I'd come in here,

655
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,249
the only way your opponent
could get ball in hand

656
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,624
was if you hit the ball
off the table.

657
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,249
Not anymore.

658
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,499
Any scratch at all,

659
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,124
you can pick it up,

660
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,707
place the cue ball
wherever he wants.

661
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:05,999
Ball in hand.

662
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,040
You give a good pool player
that kind of advantage,

663
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,582
your game's as good as over.

664
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,375
Bobby, plenty of game left.

665
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,750
Is there?

666
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,707
Here.

667
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:25,792
Good.

668
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,165
I'll get you out faster
with this to surrender.

669
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,958
Well, you've had
plenty of clients

670
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,666
right where I am.

671
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,124
What do they tell their kids?

672
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:38,541
I got no fucking clue
what to say to my boys.

673
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,082
No one ever does.

674
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,083
At least, not in advance.

675
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:45,541
But, uh, you're a good father.

676
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,417
When the instant arrives,
you will.

677
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,958
Remind them that

678
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:56,165
they know who you really are,

679
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,417
no matter what anyone says.

680
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:15,291
This is the trio.

681
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:18,707
The triumvirate.
The troika.

682
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,374
It's all on us.

683
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,165
You're running investments.

684
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,416
If it comes to that, I will be.

685
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:27,416
You feel you're ready
for that level of scrutiny?

686
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,624
Do you think I am?

687
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,333
I do.

688
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,040
What?
I-I was just...

689
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,041
I need approval
on a commission report.

690
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:39,749
I don't even
look at those things.

691
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,708
I sign them in a big stack
on my desk.

692
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,499
I repeat, what?

693
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,874
I...

694
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,249
You guys have been kind of
closed off all day,

695
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,165
and everyone's starting
to wonder,

696
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,165
and I was sort of elected...

697
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,624
I elected myself to find out...

698
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,082
Okay, Mafee.

699
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,083
Let's take a walk.

700
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,207
Seems to me that you will be
in for plenty of scrutiny, too,

701
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,040
with a prosecution
in the offing,

702
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,457
if you're sticking around.

703
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,417
Wags assumes you are.

704
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:09,707
I'd set the odds at 7-to-3,
you're not.

705
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,290
Hmm.

706
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,040
I'm the only one around here

707
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,999
who doesn't really
do the numbers.

708
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,332
My skill is taking people

709
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:21,625
and making them
more of who they are.

710
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,749
This place has some
serious fucking problems.

711
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,833
But whatever Axe Capital
actually is right now,

712
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,792
I know what it's supposed to be
at its best.

713
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,374
You're gonna help it get there.

714
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,125
With or without me.

715
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,916
I didn't show it to my lawyer.

716
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,165
I didn't make any changes.

717
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:48,124
I really appreciate
your doing this, Dad.

718
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,165
You don't appreciate it.

719
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:54,249
You expect it.
You take it for granted.

720
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,791
You hardly notice it,
truth be told,

721
00:36:56,792 --> 00:37:01,333
but in its absence, you will,
like God's fucking grace.

722
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,040
The whole point, too,
of God's grace,

723
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,499
as I understand it,

724
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,707
is that it asks
nothing in return,

725
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,040
but love and devotion.

726
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,416
Both of which,
I have never held back from you.

727
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,541
No.

728
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,874
Both of which
you have received from me,

729
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,958
as you are right now,
without condition.

730
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:25,040
This is unconditional love?

731
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:29,040
If you don't see that,

732
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:32,125
I really have failed.

733
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,750
Dad...

734
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:38,750
Just so you know...

735
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,416
I'll always be your father,

736
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,249
you'll always be my son.

737
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,582
You will stand up at my funeral

738
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,249
and say meaningful things
about me.

739
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,165
But until then...

740
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,875
I am done with you.

741
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,082
You will get over this in time.

742
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,083
One more thing.

743
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,583
This is for you.

744
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,375
Open it here.
I want to watch you do it.

745
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,458
I had my man
follow them to a hotel.

746
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,249
Look at them.

747
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,792
With that morning-after glow.

748
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,124
This is what your wife
is out doing

749
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,875
while you're
working on the marriage.

750
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:43,542
Now you got
what you really want.

751
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:47,458
You're on your own.

752
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,165
Look, guys,
you probably have some questions

753
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,917
about why I'm here.

754
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,958
I'm going to be arrested today.

755
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,834
- What?
- Shh. Shh.

756
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,707
For now,
here's all you need to know.

757
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,833
The government is gonna say
that I did something wrong.

758
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:30,667
But the government is a bunch
of fucking liars, guys.

759
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,792
Listen.

760
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,457
Look, that's not true.

761
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:43,458
Sometimes they lie.

762
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:46,207
Sometimes they tell the truth,

763
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,874
just like everyone...

764
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,875
like me.

765
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,666
Most folks,

766
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,207
they find this out
about their dad much later,

767
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,708
but everyone finds it out.

768
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:05,124
I'm a flawed man.

769
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:08,332
And I'm not perfect.

770
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,332
I'm not always right.

771
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,917
I don't always win.

772
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,332
I fucked up.

773
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,874
I did do something wrong.

774
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,457
If that makes me a bad person,

775
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,374
well, you'll have to decide that
for yourselves,

776
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,624
not just once,
but many times more

777
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,667
as you grow older
and you learn more.

778
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,959
But know this.

779
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,625
I'm still your dad.

780
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,999
And I am gonna fight.

781
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,165
I'm gonna try
really hard to win this,

782
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,791
but I might not.

783
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,333
But we don't give up.

784
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,792
We won't give up either, Dad.

785
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,708
Come here.

786
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:06,207
Be good boys
like I know you can be.

787
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,708
Listen to your mother.

788
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:14,667
We love you, Dad.

789
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,500
Okay. Come on.

790
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,291
See you next time.
Okay.

791
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:05,959
Hey.

792
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,874
It's happening. For sure.

793
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,124
Fuck. Jesus, Bobby.

794
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,541
It's the cousin's phone.
Great job getting up on it.

795
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,457
If it happens before
I can get to you,

796
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,375
hold the kids tight.

797
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:18,582
Keep them out of school
tomorrow.

798
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,416
I doubt
I'll have to spend the night,

799
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,749
but just in case.

800
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,791
But you're coming home first,
right?

801
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,541
Yeah. Yeah.
That's why I'm calling.

802
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:29,875
I'm gonna be there soon
to give you a hug.

803
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,624
Okay.
I'll be waiting for you.

804
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,666
Okay.
We know where he's headed.

805
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,834
Which means we know
where we are headed.

806
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,666
That's Axelrod's car.

807
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:44,500
We're interdicting.
Preparing to take Axelrod.

808
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,792
Go! Go! Go! Go.

809
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,208
He's in the car.

810
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,541
Out of the car!

811
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,874
Hi.
I'm just dropping it off.

812
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,417
- Hold him.
- Turn around!

813
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:04,333
Hands on the car!

814
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,291
Who the fuck is this guy?

815
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,499
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Robert Axelrod.

816
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,707
He's not here.
We'll see about that.

817
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:19,083
We also have a warrant
to search the premises.

818
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,583
Step aside, ma'am.

819
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,083
Don't bother being careful.

820
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,500
Fuck.

821
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,582
Wouldn't want to ask
for the fucking code.

822
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,583
Step back, ma'am.

823
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,624
Sentimental value.

824
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,624
Axelrod's not on the premises.

825
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:01,290
What do you mean
"not on premises"?

826
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,290
We had an intercepted call.

827
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,582
Son of a bitch.

828
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,332
He knew.

829
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,958
Send in the standby teams.

830
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:09,624
Hit the office, the apartment,

831
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:12,083
the Hamptons house, everywhere.

832
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,375
Everybody stand back, please.

833
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:30,333
We have a warrant.

834
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,916
Ah, if it isn't

835
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:39,582
my infelicitous counterpart
from Eastern.

836
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,332
What's happened to your case?

837
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,958
Axelrod's cars and phones
are coming up blank.

838
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:47,165
His credit cards are pinging
all over the Tri-State area.

839
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,999
Hmm.
He's eluding me.

840
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,040
And I'm going to
look like an asshole

841
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,457
on my very first operation.

842
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,749
So, you're saying
you want my help.

843
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,165
Of course you'll have it.

844
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,834
We are on the same team.

845
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:06,666
I anticipated
your transactional nature

846
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,499
would lead to you
making your ask again.

847
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,207
And, um, I've decided to do it.

848
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,499
No one will know
that your father invested.

849
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,249
Nothing will track back.

850
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,874
Good. I accept.

851
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:25,290
But that was
this morning's price.

852
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,582
Different kind of urgency

853
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,040
as the closing bell approaches.

854
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,916
Say what the more is,

855
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,707
and I'll see if I can afford it.

856
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,348
To help you with
some personnel decisions.

857
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,958
One personnel decision.

858
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:39,666
And, of course,

859
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,541
full transparency
from here on out,

860
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:43,624
just so I can head off

861
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,542
any potential problems
like these

862
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:47,041
before they really bite us.

863
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:50,875
Fine. Agreed.

864
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,791
How do I find Axelrod?

865
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,958
Get a cell site order
for the wife's phone.

866
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:58,332
I thought I told you,
I already...

867
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,959
Not his wife. Mine.

868
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,417
Bryan, come take
a field trip with me.

869
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,499
What you surmised is true.

870
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,082
One way or another,

871
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,916
Axe will be in custody
by day's end.

872
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:21,791
But we're not taking him.
Mnh-mnh.

873
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,666
Who is?
Eastern.

874
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,416
Dake?
Dake gets our trial?

875
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,666
You had to have known
we couldn't prosecute it.

876
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:29,249
The conflict is too deep.

877
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,332
You said you had a workaround.

878
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,583
Yes, I do.

879
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,208
It was bullshit.

880
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,375
He's not coming home.

881
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,708
Go play. He's not coming.

882
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,541
Well, there she is.

883
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,250
You know your man.

884
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:15,290
At this point, I do.

885
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,958
It's really happening.
It appears to be.

886
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:20,124
There were times I...

887
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,082
I never thought
I'd see this moment.

888
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:25,791
And this is as much as
you should probably see.

889
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:26,667
You should leave

890
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:28,791
so you can't be called
as a witness,

891
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:30,249
because I've arranged

892
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,500
that you'll lead the prosecution
at Eastern.

893
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,666
That was the workaround?

894
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,999
Are you fucking serious?

895
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,959
I am.

896
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,666
And Dake agreed?

897
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:45,082
More submitted than agreed.

898
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:47,542
But I actually think
you'll work well together.

899
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:53,458
In that case, uh,
I'll see you, boss.

900
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,416
Oh, and why don't
you tell Sacker

901
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,833
I'm gonna make her
Chief of Crim,

902
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:03,041
if she feels like staying.

903
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,542
I wasn't sure you'd come.

904
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:33,291
I wasn't going to.

905
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,541
But when I saw
where you wanted to meet,

906
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:37,792
I couldn't not.

907
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:44,082
What if I said I was sorry

908
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,541
for what I did
to make you leave,

909
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:49,332
for how I got you to come back,

910
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,542
for how I treated you
when Lara was gone?

911
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:56,542
Are you saying you're sorry
for all those things?

912
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,542
Yes.

913
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:07,041
Then I forgive you.

914
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:18,332
What if I told you...

915
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,541
that pretty much
every decision I've made

916
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,457
since we've worked
down here together

917
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,583
has been the wrong one?

918
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:33,125
Would you help me
find my way back?

919
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:39,040
Yes.

920
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,291
I'd like that very much.

921
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,228
That is exactly
what we'll do together.

922
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,207
Robert Axelrod.
You're under arrest.

923
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,458
Let's go, Bud.
Let go.

924
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
It happened?

925
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,583
Pull the trigger.

926
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,541
He made you CIO.

927
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,542
He did.

928
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,290
That's a good fucking call.

929
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,875
Let me know how I can help.

930
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,958
These are our investors
you should contact.

931
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:19,874
Tell them they'll have
their capital back

932
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:20,834
by end of day tomorrow.

933
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:23,290
Tell them we're going to
shoot the lights out

934
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,624
with Axe's personal money,

935
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,541
and we'll be calling for
a pitch meeting

936
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,874
as soon as Axe is clear
of all this bullshit.

937
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:30,624
Because that's what it is.
Bullshit.

938
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:31,875
Say all that.

939
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:34,792
On it.

940
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,417
Keep facing the wall.

941
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,291
You can turn around.

942
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,666
I always figured the worst part
about being locked up

943
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:52,999
would be the company.

944
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,582
You've just proven me right.

945
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:57,040
Oh, I bet the worst
is yet to come.

946
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,958
You made a mistake coming here.

947
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:02,165
Really?
Yeah.

948
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,332
Once Boyd showed up at my door,

949
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,457
I knew you were in this,

950
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,541
that you'd used him
to hook me in.

951
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,040
Yeah.
He went off book there.

952
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,332
And you just
affirmed the whole thing,

953
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,999
that you entrapped me.

954
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,791
I trapped you.

955
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,291
Oh, there's an important
legal difference.

956
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,249
Well, I won't be in here
for long.

957
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,541
No. A macher like you?

958
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:27,582
You'll make bail.

959
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,999
But it won't feel like freedom
for a long time,

960
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,624
maybe ever again.

961
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,791
I might have underestimated
a part of your character.

962
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:37,750
Really?
Yeah.

963
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:40,707
I didn't realize
just how desperate you were

964
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:41,958
to feel like a man.

965
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:44,082
You sacrificed over,

966
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:48,707
what, 27 million dollars,

967
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:52,040
every penny you had,
just to catch me?

968
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:54,416
And almost broke your father
and your best friend

969
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:56,374
in the process.

970
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,707
I may be ruthless
when it comes to dealmaking,

971
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:01,624
but you're as trigger happy
as Machine Gun Kelly,

972
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,165
spraying everyone in sight.

973
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,707
Well, that may be.

974
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,124
But, I'll tell you,

975
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,374
when I think about
all that money I lost,

976
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,374
just to see you in this place,

977
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:15,374
all I can say is...
worth it!

978
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:18,207
I hope so.

979
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,124
Because the moment
I walk out that door,

980
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:22,624
I am never coming back,

981
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,749
even if I have to spend
a hundred...

982
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:28,165
fuck it, a thousand times
what you did, to make sure.

983
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,082
Tell yourself that.

984
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,124
Maybe that'll help you
on all those sleepless nights

985
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:35,374
you have staring you
in the face.

986
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:37,582
Nah, it won't matter.

987
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,833
No amount of money
is gonna erase the video

988
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:43,290
of all those lackeys
you poisoned,

989
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:45,416
or wipe out the trading records

990
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:49,249
of your tampering
with the stock,

991
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,499
manipulating the market.

992
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,082
You let your hatred of me

993
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,792
put everything you hold dear
in jeopardy.

994
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,417
I'm gonna find it.

995
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,165
Whatever it is.

996
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:12,916
Whatever thread you left behind,

997
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:15,124
however small...

998
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:18,958
the one that threatens
everything you are.

999
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:21,290
We both know it's out there.

1000
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,999
You know exactly what it is.

1001
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,999
You were talking about
sleepless nights.

1002
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,582
It's what you'll wake up

1003
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:32,624
thinking about
in the dark, shaking,

1004
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,207
because I'm gonna find it.

1005
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,457
You know I will.

1006
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,165
And I am gonna pull on it,
and I'm gonna pull on it

1007
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,999
until your whole fucking world
unravels.

1008
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,833
And when I am done,
you won't be governor.

1009
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:47,999
You won't be
the U.S. Attorney.

1010
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,124
You might not even be
an attorney at all.

1011
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:54,416
Yeah, I might go down
behind all of this,

1012
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,416
but one thing is for sure,

1013
00:55:57,417 --> 00:56:01,500
you are gonna be
right there next to me.

1014
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:07,625
Wow.

1015
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,667
Like I said before, Bob...

1016
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,458
worth it.

1017
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:41,667
Are you kidding?

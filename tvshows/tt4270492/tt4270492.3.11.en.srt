1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,333
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,208
He's a rich man.

3
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,476
There always have been rumors
as to the way he earned it.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,917
You are willing to testify

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,458
Jock Jeffcoat profited
along with his brother?

6
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:16,417
I know he does.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
We're doing a massive cap raise.

8
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,208
Welcome to the new quant headquarters.

9
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,750
He fired you.

10
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,542
I was fodder.
Don't try to tell me different.

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,083
So, is it prison or start talking?

12
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,208
Let's do this.

13
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,709
Who the hell gave you
permission to talk to my son.

14
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,192
Good thing is there's no paperwork.

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,250
Off the books.
The Chuck Rhoades Special.

16
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,542
Your best friend sold you
down the river for nothing.

17
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,029
I'm willing to pay you
30 million to tell the truth.

18
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:41,709
But I sure as hell will testify
about what Chuck Rhoades did.

19
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,542
You sold out my relationship.

20
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,583
No, no. You did.

21
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,166
That's why you told
me he was at your dinner.

22
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:32,354
I can't believe you brought me here.

23
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:35,190
Thank you.

24
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,460
I was surprised to learn
the viral videos so afflicted you.

25
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:40,495
Oh. They don't... usually...

26
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:42,130
but I mean...

27
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,999
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Oh!</i>

28
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,034
You know we could just
order the tomahawk

29
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,636
and have him do his whole
thing here at the table.

30
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:51,472
Uh, no.

31
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:53,975
I'm all right looking at the eclipse
through the cereal box.

32
00:01:56,512 --> 00:02:00,582
Ah, well, well, well.

33
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:01,748
How'd it go?

34
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,517
Bought you a present,

35
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,386
had it sent straight to the office.

36
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:08,555
Well, I hope that's not
all you've brought me.

37
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,124
Texas is a bizarro world.

38
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:13,594
Jock Jeffcoat's a pariah at Zabar's

39
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,063
but he's the second coming
on the 29th parallel.

40
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:19,899
So you weren't able to
substantiate what we know...

41
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,834
the brother, the cable company.

42
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,604
We have embarked on a
one-way mission here.

43
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:28,240
We either get to the other side
and line dance on Jock's grave

44
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:31,477
or he will most assuredly be
doing the Tush Push on ours.

45
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:34,313
Anybody who knew anything
wasn't willing to go on the record,

46
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,935
and anyone willing to go on the record

47
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,849
didn't know anything. I'm sorry, Chuck.

48
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,252
You know what's printed
above the Rhoades family crest:

49
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,687
"Never say sorry.

50
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,756
"Make the other fella sorry first."

51
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,658
Can you do that?

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,994
Will you do that?

53
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:50,328
I will.

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,063
Reach out to people
you feel dirty talking to,

55
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,365
employ tactics you wouldn't
confess even to a priest,

56
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,903
and find a way to crack someone
inside the cable company.

57
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,006
Because we cannot build a case

58
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:04,742
on the word of a confessed
liar like Cutler.

59
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:05,909
Yeah. On it.

60
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,177
Yep.

61
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,346

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,787

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:18,889
Be right back.

Well. Look at you,

71
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:38,790
fat and happy,
taking down the Cadillac of steaks.

72
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:43,828
Well, you must have made
a nasty nickel selling me out.

73
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,864
Fucking right I did.

74
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,799
Why didn't you come to me?

75
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,200
You could have come to me.

76
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:51,602
Ah.

77
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,872
You're married.

78
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,776
To Taiga.

79
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,177
Of course to Taiga.

80
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,780
Who was the best man?

81
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,448
There wasn't one.

82
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,050
- Come on.
- Shapiro.

83
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,686
Oh. Shit... Really?

84
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,556
I'm sorry you could only to do it
at 50 percent of my weddings.

85
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,202
Wouldn't have made you Cal Ripken,
but it would have been nice

86
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,760
to keep the streak going.

87
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:19,762
I whopped you a good one.

88
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:23,231
And you whopped me a good one.

89
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,700
I don't believe in even,

90
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,937
but, uh, maybe,

91
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,039
we're even.

92
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,440
Maybe we are.

93
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,276
So... where is your bride?

94
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,077
Uh, Taiga's out of town.
Visiting family.

95
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,780
Hmm. So you're a bachelor
for the evening.

96
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:40,114
- Boys' night out.
- Not quite.

97
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,315
This is work.

98
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,985
That guy's on the board of...
Doesn't matter.

99
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,020
Just... I'm trying to impress him,
build my book.

100
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:47,288
Making it monsoon?

101
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,068
Just trying to keep my head
above the flood waters.

102
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,825
Taiga's expensive.

103
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,193
She decided to start a Yoga empire.

104
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,494
SoulCycle, but...

105
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:56,964
Mm. For yoga. Mm.

106
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,199
And of course you supported her.

107
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,401
It's who you are.

108
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,736
But how deep are you in?

109
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,571
Deep... and descending.

110
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:07,207
Location problems, design problems,

111
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:10,076
all kinds of... hypoallergenic?

112
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,412
Stuff that makes my eyes glaze over.

113
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,715
- Sorry to hear that.
- It'll all be fine.

114
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,294
As soon as we get the
first location open

115
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,952
and have some money coming in
instead of just going out...

116
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,386
Right.

117
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,023
Of course.

118
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,025
Of course. Uh, well.

119
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,193
My best to Mrs. Schirmer.

120
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,131
And... it's good to see you, Ira.

121
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,983
Where are the others?

122
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,685
They left... a while ago.

123
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,286
They didn't contact you?

124
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,388
To say?

125
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,922
Uh...

126
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,589
They quit. What happened?

127
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,158
Well, they're hacks and lame.

128
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,161
Did they quit because you
<i>called</i> them hacks and lame?

129
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:06,629
You backslid into being a dick.

130
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:08,631
Fine. Yes. Big time.

131
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,373
You know what?
Those other two were sweet,

132
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,001
but you're more talented. I need you.

133
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,402
Damn right you do.

134
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,271
'Cause I'm the Yngwie
Malmsteen of coding,

135
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:16,733
total control of the instrument...

136
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:19,007
Sad. Look, I need you
to model something for me.

137
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,269
If we give the algo an extra
20 billion to play with...

138
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,712
can it reliably generate returns
in excess of eight percent?

139
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,613
If so, how soon? How reliably?

140
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,093
And can any other funds do the same?

141
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:29,051
Wait, this isn't some T test.

142
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:31,219
This is something
you'd pitch an investor.

143
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:34,021
Problem is:
Bridgewater would have 50 PhDs

144
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:35,123
writing software on this.

145
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,468
Molly Hatchet had three guitarists.

146
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,958
Rising Force had one.

147
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,027
Are you going to tell me
you can't play this solo?

148
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,228
Of course not.

149
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,630
I'm sure we'll go faster
without the dead weight...

150
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,399
- Whoops...
- You're working alone now,

151
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,401
act however you want.

152
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,723
Take me to the fucking Regency.

153
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,268
Thanks. Excuse me one second.

154
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,036
- Hey, Axe. How are you, man?
- Hey.

155
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,448
I don't think we knew you were coming.

156
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:28,117
Just give us a second,
and we're gonna have your table.

157
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:29,874
- Nah. No need, JT.
- Okay. Enjoy.

158
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,442
Thanks.

159
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,048
- Hey, Axe.
- Hey, Lizzie.

160
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:42,119
Ah, fuck, Axe. Can't you skip a year?

161
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:45,222
I could. But what fucking fun
would that be?

162
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:46,189
I'm Martin Carlisle.

163
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,891
Who you are is a witness

164
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:51,561
to this year's edition
of Fuck Ups Fucking Up.

165
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:55,899
Today, at Axe Cap, it's comp day.

166
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,735
And so, as always,
I'm reminded of the best day of my life.

167
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:01,237
The day that this man,

168
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,538
Bill McGann of McGann Commodities,

169
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:05,808
told me I didn't have
enough Blarney in me.

170
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,277
What he meant was:
I didn't kiss enough ass.

171
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,147
I meant you didn't have a soul.

172
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,149
And so, by means of instruction,

173
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,884
he wasn't gonna bonus me right.

174
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,384
He shorted me by 50,000.

175
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,529
Hey, I can leave you two to...

176
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:20,321
Stay. I'm leaving.

177
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,857
So, here I am, as I am every year,

178
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,292
to thank you.

179
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:25,394
And to buy you breakfast.

180
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:28,029
Just think.

181
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,131
If I'd stayed,

182
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,299
you maybe could have owned this hotel.

183
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,368
Least I can do is get your check.

184
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,238
Right before I engage
in the very same rumble

185
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,209
that left you knifed and
bleeding in the schoolyard.

186
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,444
You're about the same
age I was back then.

187
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,346
You've had a good run, kid.

188
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,849
But you can't stay clear of
the switchblades forever.

189
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:53,219
You're not a Greaser anymore, Axe,

190
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:55,221
you're a Soc now...

191
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,830
Do you want to lean down or bulk up?

192
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:06,465
Because either way, suck my dick.

193
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,767
Is this how one runs a service business?

194
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,547
Whatever I'm doing,
it seems to be working.

195
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:13,338
Because I invested in one.

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,173
And now I got five.

197
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,375
Ah. Some guys just stumble into money.

198
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,444
Like Leonard Cohen
into the Chelsea Hotel.

199
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,446
Mm. You're looking good, sweetheart.

200
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:22,714
Thanks.

201
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:27,151
Do you have any idea what it takes
to make the pivot I did?

202
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:30,520
<i>This</i> is my lifeblood now.

203
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:34,558
I built it to where there are guys
who would help me take it public...

204
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,060
if I wasn't a fucking felon.

205
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:38,229
In your estimation, that's my fault?

206
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:39,563
You went after Axe.

207
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,998
On the way you went
after Dollar Bill Stearn.

208
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,067
You didn't get any of them...
except for me.

209
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,535
Because I surrendered.

210
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,704
Thank you. That was convenient.

211
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:53,509
And it shows a remarkable sense
of personal responsibility.

212
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,778
Oh, I'd be glad to speak of that
to judges and clerks

213
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,614
and probation officers to get
your record sanded clean.

214
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,020
And in return you want...

215
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,789
I do want.

216
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,791
Help me investigate a money trail.

217
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,839
Don't you have all your boys
with windbreakers to do that for you?

218
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,129
This is of a more personal nature.

219
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,932
Very few are as expert as you

220
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,335
at disguising and veiling
and hiding money.

221
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:24,171
I'm a man of many talents.

222
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:26,740
And it's in your field,

223
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,142
fitness.

224
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:42,923
Let me call you back.

225
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,059
Shit.

226
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:04,843
This is chilling.

227
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,045
Does he always do this at comp?

228
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:10,048
To a degree. This is special.

229
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,295
What's the mood down there?

230
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,097
They've got that lean and hungry look.

231
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,432
Like to leave 'em that way.

232
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,100
Let the hunger set in.

233
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:33,270
Starvation, in small doses,
triggers an increase in energy,

234
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:34,972
clarity, aggression...

235
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:36,340
Right up until it kills you.

236
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,640
You gotta feed 'em something.

237
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,476
Why? I make the decisions,

238
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,077
do all the heavy-lifting,

239
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,778
actually earn the money.

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,313
Mortimer Duke said it best:

241
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,282
No getting around the old minimum wage.

242
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:47,761
Actually, that was said
<i>to</i> Mortimer Duke,

243
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:50,119
but that's a helluva pull.

244
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,954
The thing is: most years,

245
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,290
I'm paying with other people's money.

246
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:55,392
Now it's my own money.

247
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:58,460
That reminds me of a prayer
I said every night as a kid:

248
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,161
"And now I lay me down to sleep,

249
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,596
"I pray the Lord my soul to keep,

250
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:02,998
"and if I die before I wake,

251
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,067
"I pray that all my
toys should break."...

252
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,703
So my fucking brother and
sister can't play with 'em.

253
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:11,373
Why don't you just delay comp decisions
until after the raise?

254
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,008
Outside money will be back on board,

255
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,319
you'll feel better
about the whole thing.

256
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,277
Three things in life you can't postpone
without dire consequences:

257
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,945
calling a doctor when gutshot,

258
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,780
finding a toilet when
traveling in India,

259
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,948
and paying your people.

260
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,950
The last two being
more or less the same.

261
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,086
Listen. Don't think
the raise isn't the thing;

262
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:27,654
it's the only thing.

263
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,689
Without that money,
I'm not bonusing people,

264
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,857
I'm putting them out on an ice floe.

265
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,293
Okay. Then I just want
to make sure you're aware

266
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,340
of a promise I made to everyone
while you were gone:

267
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,930
No one makes less than last year.

268
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,298
That's why they stayed.

269
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,934
I am aware that that was<i> your</i> promise.

270
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,302
Anyone you think deserves more?

271
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,505
- No.
- Not even Ben Kim?

272
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,273
Kid's practically your gimp.

273
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,774
I think he's ready to move to PM.

274
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,510
I could see that.

275
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,256
Then let the promotion
be his bonus this year.

276
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,480
Too much too fast could overwhelm him.

277
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,516
Has it overwhelmed you?

278
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,088
Looks like you're up.

279
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,189
Let's move over to the desk.

280
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,191
- You talk to Lara?
- Mnh-mnh.

281
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,293
Be bold. Check in with me later.

282
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:11,795
First time in the ring without
training in Catskill with Cus.

283
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,864
You ready?

284
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,133
Yeah. I got my Kevin Rooney.

285
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,435
I'll be fine.

286
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,447
Fifteen million dollars.

287
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,260
You aren't going to start
with a performance review or...

288
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,617
Helluva year. Fifteen.

289
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,187
- I was thinking 50.
- How'd you get there?

290
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,588
Axe Cap made 929 million this year.

291
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,823
When you account for expenses,
nets to almost 700.

292
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,836
Seeing as how I ran the place
for most of that time,

293
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,095
less than one-tenth of the
profits seems more than fair.

294
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,797
Might be.
But then again, I was the client.

295
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,999
So you're kind of comparing
apples to my money.

296
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:52,279
I did more than just run your money.

297
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:53,635
I kept us alive.

298
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:55,204
I killed it at the Idea Dinner.

299
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,216
I convinced the Street that night,
and every day since,

300
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,173
that there was always
someone at the helm.

301
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,715
I got us through a natural disaster.

302
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,388
I all but closed Kansas
City before Ben Kim

303
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:04,278
went Thunder From Down Under on them.

304
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,092
And let's not forget that
I was key in making up

305
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:07,915
the shortfall from Grigor's redemption,

306
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,084
at great personal cost.

307
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:11,519
Still sore about Oscar?

308
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,788
Yet here I am, still ready
to help lock down the raise.

309
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,390
About that. No, you're not.

310
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,193
I don't actually
need you in the pitches.

311
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,173
For one thing, you bombed
your first raise meeting,

312
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,764
with Grigor's lieutenant,
bombed it on purpose.

313
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,478
And for another:
the investors need to know

314
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,435
that you're here at Axe Cap,

315
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:31,103
that someone's "always at the helm."

316
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,240
Besides... the raise is my thing.

317
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,619
I'm thinking that the final number

318
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,144
will be something just shy of
half of what you're looking for.

319
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,823
- I don't agree.
- This isn't heavy petting

320
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,913
on the Oberlin campus:
we don't both have to agree.

321
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,282
I say what it is. You take it.

322
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,484
Yes, that is so.
But still. I don't accept.

323
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,152
I never made that much at your age.

324
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,694
I've accomplished more than you had.

325
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,188
But you don't have your own shop.

326
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,158
If you were ready for that,
we wouldn't be having this conversation,

327
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,460
I'd be looking at a
Taylor-shaped hole in the wall.

328
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,164
Twenty is as much as anybody's
ever gotten out of me.

329
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,565
Learn to be rich on that.

330
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,034
And I was beginning to think
you were done teaching me.

331
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,969
Let's finish this later.

332
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,302
I'd like half a million.

333
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,704
You just got here.
Your signing bonus is your comp.

334
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,217
I didn't say I deserved half a million.

335
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,652
But you rarely get
what you don't ask for.

336
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,108
So I'm fucking asking.

337
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,531
Otherwise, why are we doing this?

338
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,111
We've never talked one-on-one.

339
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,534
I wanted to get a hit off of you.

340
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,181
I hit like the Purple People Eaters.

341
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,394
So be careful what you wish for.

342
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,116
Oh. This is gonna be fun.

343
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,951
I believe I've proved my value.

344
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,831
Don't need to justify a
thing to you at this point.

345
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,355
Oooh, working stiff.

346
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,324
Just like your personal totem,
The Undertaker.

347
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,704
Do you have people feeding you this shit
about us ahead of time?

348
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,994
Thing is, for the last couple of weeks,

349
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,863
I haven't really felt your presence.

350
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:11,998
You saying I've been coasting.

351
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,061
I'm saying there's no
garbage time at Axe Capital.

352
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,369
Every minute of every quarter matters.

353
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,504
No scrubs get playing time.

354
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,006
And even if you are my
MVP at the All-Star break,

355
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,409
if you stop performing,
you will be replaced.

356
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,010
Pay me what you're gonna pay me.

357
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,873
Save the pep talks for someone
who needs 'em.

358
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:29,248
I think I like that version of you.

359
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,550
But I could hate it another time.

360
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:34,219
Ok. What you did with
the Wendy thing aside,

361
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:36,187
and it's hard to put it aside,

362
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,923
I'm paying you 1.3, a personal record.

363
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,191
On top of your other bonus

364
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,127
that's more than a
two-ball for this year.

365
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,928
But that is not a repeatable trick.

366
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,530
When we're here 12 months from now,

367
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:48,232
if you're not still
bodyslamming like... uh...

368
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,600
King Kong Bundy...

369
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,403
Did you pretend not to remember that
to make me feel good?

370
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:54,772
Goodbye Mafee.

371
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:58,075
I think... I should not
throw out the first number,

372
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,444
because I have a tendency
to undervalue myself.

373
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:01,979
I'd like to make you a PM.

374
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,546
Portfolio Manager?

375
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,547
I would have gone Prime Minister,

376
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,150
but there you go, undervaluing.

377
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,319
- And the money...?
- Meet the new salary,

378
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,154
same as the old salary.

379
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:13,156
I'm a PM.

380
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,630
<i>I've asked my special counsel,
Bryan Connerty, to sit in.</i>

381
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:23,165
We meet again, young man.

382
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,066
The Axelrod case.

383
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,502
Yeah.

384
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,371
That thing was like
cleaning out intestines

385
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:33,175
before you eat 'em,
a giant fucking waste of time.

386
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:36,578
But I'm here to speak of
something more concerning.

387
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,113
It has come to my attention
that there are men

388
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:42,517
and probably women,
within the Federal B-I,

389
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,919
perhaps even within this very office,

390
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,921
who are undermining our sacred purpose.

391
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,301
- Which is...
- I don't know if it's

392
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,390
some Deep State bullshit,

393
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,693
or just some vigilantes
who think they know better,

394
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:54,628
leaking to the press, and causing
Lord knows what other ruckus.

395
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,896
I will keep a lookout
for what the Lord knows.

396
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:00,166
The Lord knows all, madam.
Took care of that for you.

397
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,336
As for the rest,
I want a hard-target search

398
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:05,839
of every e-mail, text message,
and online footprint

399
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:09,209
so we know who's trustworthy
and who needs to be purged.

400
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:11,344
I'm just not sure
it's strictly legal for us

401
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:12,678
to undertake this ourselves,

402
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,480
or if it's too gray of an area.

403
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,593
Maybe it would be best
to have a court order first...

404
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,351
We can do it.

405
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:20,213
And if you want to stay
out of the deep gray,

406
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,222
Director Lynch,
I can lead the review myself.

407
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,826
You know, chart a...
a whiter shade of pale.

408
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,860
Impressive.

409
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:32,063
All too often I am told of
obstacles and regulations

410
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:36,033
when what I really wanna hear
is<i> "sí, Se puede"</i>

411
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:42,006
Ira, uh, this is Pete Decker.

412
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,175
He's in the health and
conditioning industry.

413
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:45,942
Is this a bailout?

414
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,210
More like an intervention.

415
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:49,847
Tell him what you told me, Pete.

416
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:52,883
"The bitch is a booster.
The bitch is a born thief."

417
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:56,920
You talking about my wife?
You looked into her?

418
00:18:57,022 --> 00:19:00,557
She needed looking into,
so I looked. Go on.

419
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,260
Her business is...
well, there is no business.

420
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:06,262
Everything you gave her was transferred

421
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,931
into the account of her
supposed business partner,

422
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,966
Anthony Radaelli.

423
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,102
I assume they, you know...

424
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,273
Thank you.

425
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,841
Do right by me, Chuck.

426
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:20,542
My middle name.

427
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:26,047
I know this is hard to hear.

428
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,484
The commercial property
she told you she plunked down on,

429
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,687
that doesn't exist either.

430
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,457
But there's an apartment,

431
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,759
a very expensive apartment,

432
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:43,363
they're about to close on.

433
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,933
I'm sorry.

434
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:49,336
Yeah...

435
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,238
You knew.

436
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,907
Yeah. Some. The rest I suspected.

437
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:56,208
Oh, boy. To carry that around...

438
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,877
Fucking kills me.

439
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,147
But, uh, you know, Chuck,

440
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,360
I know you're only trying to help,
but please stay out of it.

441
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:06,185
It's, um...

442
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,353
There's no prenup.

443
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,855
And New York's a no-fault state.

444
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,056
And I'd be halved financially.

445
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:14,125
There's no prenup?

446
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:17,128
Oh, Ira, you're a fucking lawyer.

447
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,341
For once I didn't want to be.

448
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,599
I wanted to be a romantic.

449
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,401
- Mm.
- I still do.

450
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:24,903
I gave up on a marriage once.

451
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,939
I've regretted it every day since.

452
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,441
I'm not giving up this time.

453
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:32,109
It'll blow over.

454
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:35,680
She's young. It's a last hurrah.

455
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,862
You know, she'll get whatever
it is out of her system

456
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,151
and then... then she'll come home.

457
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,232
I really have to watch what I tell you.

458
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,067
It's like you're
listening to every word.

459
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,437
Especially when you start talking
about hiding out in bathtubs.

460
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,506
And places that remind you
of what that felt like.

461
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:41,675
I wasn't hiding.
It's just that when I was younger

462
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,321
the bathtub was the
only place I could go

463
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,778
to be alone and think.

464
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,491
I'd press myself against
the sides so hard

465
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,281
eventually my legs would go numb.

466
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:50,250
Then I'd start thinking
I didn't have legs,

467
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,685
and I'd wish for fins.

468
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:54,386
Because then not fitting in
would make more sense.

469
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:55,521
I get it.

470
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:58,223
I almost feel like a mermaid here.

471
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,398
Comp didn't go the way you wanted.

472
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,101
He said I was off the raise team.

473
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,603
Is he punishing me for doing
exactly what he asked of me?

474
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,872
Axe doesn't punish people.
Unless they've wronged him.

475
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:16,407
Or Lara. Or his kids.

476
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,043
Or me.

477
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,745
Or the New York Football Giants.

478
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,180
I won't stagnate.

479
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:24,683
Not for Axe. Not for anybody.

480
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:27,051
You know Axe has never
changed a comp decision.

481
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:29,252
So I've heard.
And I might be able to live

482
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:30,821
with the number he can live with.

483
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,624
But what I need is forward momentum,

484
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:36,093
above all things, even money.

485
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,798
Yes. You do.

486
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,266
I'll talk to him.

487
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:45,101
Give me a day.

488
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,817
<i>Kvankam.</i>

489
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,052
Although.

490
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:05,754
<i>Pensis.</i>

491
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:07,022
Thought.

492
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,389
Comp.

493
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:11,192
<i>Kompenso.</i>

494
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:13,394
So you're not here to
help me with my Esperanto.

495
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:16,231
I haven't had my comp
meeting scheduled yet.

496
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,099
Must be an oversight.

497
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,533
Must be.

498
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,007
Axe, you remember Ari Spyros.

499
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,875
Works down in Compliance.

500
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,543
Uh. Rings a bell.

501
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:32,980
But like children of the 1800s,
seen and not heard.

502
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,248
And not even seen, you know?

503
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,215
Spyros was concerned
that his comp meeting

504
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,617
wasn't on the books.

505
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,986
I am sure it's an oversight.

506
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,554
Was it an oversight?

507
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:44,124
Compliance does not get
performance-related comp.

508
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,559
- Oh.
- Sure. Usually.

509
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:49,896
But Compliance doesn't usually
turn around a shop overnight.

510
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:51,964
But before I got here
this place was dirtier

511
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,667
than the porta potty outside
a third-rate donkey show.

512
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,102
Arrests, fines,

513
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:00,272
investigations up the wazoo.

514
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:03,475
And since the Greek Freak
has been on the scene...

515
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:04,977
You cannot call yourself that.

516
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,046
There is no bonus for Compliance.

517
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:09,213
What about the other stuff?

518
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,050
Extracurricular stuff...

519
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:16,187
I'm talking about the stuff
in Bill's other garage.

520
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,355
Doesn't Ari get to wet his beak?

521
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,492
Ohh. I forgot about that...

522
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:23,995
That reminds me of where you were

523
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,064
right before you decided to
share that little brainstorm.

524
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,066
Fired. Halfway out the door.

525
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,101
Three quarters. Literally.

526
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,602
Dead to me.

527
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,839
No, your comp is getting your job back.

528
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,509
Getting to hiss and tinker
with your little espresso erector set

529
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,079
rather than pick through the Dumpster
for your mangled steam wand.

530
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,413
- I see...
- If we were to do

531
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,449
a little accounting of how
much you meant to Axe Cap,

532
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,196
we would first have to
look at what you cost me

533
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,120
by turning Wendy in.

534
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:54,123
The consequences of your
"chaos grenade."

535
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,228
Yeah. To say nothing of the nightmare
that you plunged her into,

536
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,996
and the unthinkable acts
I had to perform

537
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,998
in order to set things right.

538
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,934
I mean dollars and cents alone.

539
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:10,271
The fines, the bonuses,
the jet fuel to Nova Scotia,

540
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:15,176
you owe me 1.195 million dollars.

541
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:16,111
You know what?

542
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,045
I don't think I need a comp meeting.

543
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:20,347
My... My base is very generous,

544
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:24,284
and I think we should
just leave it right there.

545
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:29,322
That was the full Signor Roberto.

546
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:32,025
"The rent stays like before."

547
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,061
Yeah. That's the first comp meeting
I've actually enjoyed.

548
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,697
You know, I'm tempted to fire
the whole fucking lot of them.

549
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,733
Except maybe like two.

550
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,447
But someone has got to roll the coins up
into those little sleeves.

551
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,037
Yeah. Practically all they do.

552
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,039
Nah, you can't fire 'em, estro.

553
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:49,142
Right before the raise,
it'll look like panic.

554
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:51,287
Like there's not enough grain to
get everyone through the winter.

555
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,311
I know.

556
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:54,045
So I'm not doing it...

557
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,547
But, you know, when I'm sitting
across the table from them

558
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,130
and I see their hungry little mouths,

559
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:00,118
they're people, sure, my people,

560
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,020
and I love 'em most of the year.

561
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:07,325
But today, all I can see is
their snapping fucking mouths,

562
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:09,493
and instead of wanting to feed 'em,

563
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,035
I just want to punch their teeth in.

564
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:29,378
The rest of them are scared
to come in when I'm in here.

565
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,148
I clocked you going in
about 20 minutes ago,

566
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,795
I figured this was as
close to a Beta state

567
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,051
as I'll ever find you in.

568
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:38,587
Mm. What then?

569
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,056
You've got personnel problems.

570
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,568
That's what they'd
all like you to think.

571
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:42,669
None of 'em are going anywhere.

572
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,161
I'm talking about
one person in particular.

573
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,804
Taylor is about to get paid
the same as James Harden.

574
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,944
- You think they can't get by on that?
- It's not about money.

575
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:52,145
They keep demanding more of it.

576
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,980
Because you're not giving
them what's more important

577
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,604
than money. So money is all that's left.

578
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,739
Well, I'm about to adopt
the official policy

579
00:26:57,842 --> 00:27:00,674
of the United States and refuse
to negotiate with terrorists.

580
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:02,616
You know that's bullshit, right?
Our government

581
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:04,578
negotiates with terrorists all the time.

582
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,513
Pays them with pallets full of hundreds.

583
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:08,850
But when they're captured,
what breaks them,

584
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:11,018
in places like Gitmo,
isn't overt torture,

585
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,020
it's a sense of disenfranchisement

586
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,655
and purposelessness.

587
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,022
That's what I'm sowing?

588
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,427
Here's the thing:
with someone like Taylor,

589
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:26,799
what they need is forward momentum,
above all things, even money.

590
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:29,102
My recommendation:
Take them to the raise.

591
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,506
I could say yes.

592
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,675
Why don't I want to say yes though?

593
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,511
Because it's yet another
fucking accommodation.

594
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,947
I got this rich so I
could stop making them.

595
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:45,985
Gates plays dollar poker.

596
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,420
Buffett eats a drive
in hamburger every day.

597
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:51,055
There's no amount of money that
frees you from being a person,

598
00:27:51,157 --> 00:27:52,390
from interacting with others.

599
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,525
Those guys know that. You know that.

600
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:56,427
It used to be an investment pitch

601
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:59,063
entailed them begging you
to take their money.

602
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:02,133
Now you've got to peddle your
wares along with everyone else.

603
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,269
Like a fucking door to door
Electrolux salesman.

604
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:06,237
Giving up trading, taking on Grigor,

605
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,571
now paying your people
out of your own pocket.

606
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:12,075
It must feel like death
by a thousand cuts.

607
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,344
Yeah. I'm at 999. And I'm sticking.

608
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:18,615
You chose this person for a reason
beyond their mathematical ability.

609
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:22,953
Taking on Taylor as a real partner
isn't gonna kill you.

610
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:25,955
It may be the very thing
that makes you stronger.

611
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:40,869
The head of
TexasSouthCable likes to hire

612
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,204
undocumented workers and
pay them under the table.

613
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,440
Drivers, nannies, landscapers.

614
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:49,044
But this guy still spends weekends
with Jock and his brother, Zeb.

615
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:51,012
Even if we manage to spook him,

616
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:53,214
how can we make sure
he doesn't run to Jock,

617
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:56,351
who then treats us to our own
personal My Lai Massacre.

618
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,252
The bloodshed <i>and</i> the cover-up.

619
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,020
That would be obstruction of justice.

620
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:01,822
Yes. Yes, it would.

621
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:03,890
But that would not deter
Jock in the slightest.

622
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,960
He recognizes no legal
or moral authority,

623
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,962
no justice but his own. Keep looking

624
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:10,030
for someone lower down:
someone with the goods

625
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,099
but without Jock in their speed dial.

626
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,241
We can't let him get word
and stop our investigation

627
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,035
before it starts.

628
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,145
What are we drinking?

629
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,481
That is a complicated question here.

630
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,152
Bring me the closest thing you have
to a Casamigos on the rocks.

631
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:35,954
Make that two.
And don't judge us for it.

632
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,456
Hmm.

633
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,395
So, you were right,
my kid does need help.

634
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:45,330
He doesn't talk much, but when he does,

635
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:47,165
I don't love the way it sounds.

636
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:52,203
I could give you the names
of a couple of good people if you want.

637
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:56,340
But right now it's time
to help your husband.

638
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,175
Ex, I mean.

639
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:00,411
Not easy to get used to.

640
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:02,246
No.

641
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,081
With what?

642
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:05,449
Here you go.

643
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:07,617
You know what time of year it is.

644
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,522
Right, comp...

645
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:15,725
You were his secret weapon.

646
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,093
He gave me that much credit?

647
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,340
I know you went through
everybody with him.

648
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:21,097
Told him when he was being too soft...

649
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,632
When he was being an asshole.

650
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,599
He needs that.

651
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:28,070
Without it, without... you,

652
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:30,272
I think he's gonna
make some big mistakes.

653
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,607
Then he's gonna make some big mistakes.

654
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,910
He doesn't want to hear
that stuff from me anymore.

655
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:37,646
I'm sorry. I'm not asking you
as his wife or his ex,

656
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:42,183
I'm asking you as the largest
single investor in Axe Capital.

657
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,452
You're gonna want to do
it for your own sake.

658
00:30:56,766 --> 00:31:00,133
Hey... You're not supposed
to get the kids back until tomorrow.

659
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,235
They're sleeping.

660
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:02,602
Good.

661
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:04,737
Then fucking talk to me.

662
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,074
What are you thinking about comp?

663
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:09,242
C'mon. My money's at stake, too.

664
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,078
Yeah. I'm taking care of your money.

665
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,712
I'm taking care of everything.

666
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,180
You taking care of Taylor, too?

667
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,550
Wow. Wendy. Good move,

668
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,017
well, she's earning her money.

669
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,786
And so is Taylor.

670
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,221
Aren't they?

671
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:32,564
Are you ever coming to bed?

672
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:35,833
I could try to sleep,
but I know I won't.

673
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,135
I didn't want to keep you up.

674
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:39,304
I seem to have done that anyway.

675
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:42,673
Mm.

676
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,908
Jock?

677
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,311
Yeah. It's that. Sure.

678
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:49,413
But more than that, it's still Ira.

679
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,948
I could be bounded in a nutshell

680
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,085
and count myself a
king of infinite space,

681
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:57,187
were it not that I have bad dreams.

682
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,424
You've reached Shakespearean
levels of insomnia.

683
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:02,192
It's disorder in the house.

684
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:07,029
Ira is the brother I chose.

685
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:08,431
And this rift between us,

686
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:11,267
however he fought back, I caused it.

687
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,869
I used him as an instrument,
not thinking,

688
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:17,072
not caring what I was taking from him.

689
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:19,275
And I know, deep down,
if I were back there,

690
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:22,444
I would do it again.

691
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:26,080
Every bit of this
makes me feel like a...

692
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,783
- Shit heel.
- Indeed.

693
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,488
But now that Ira's in jeopardy,

694
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,824
I have a chance to put things right.

695
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:40,060
To rescue him. To be a hero.

696
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:42,896
If I pull it off, and make him well,

697
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,598
does the reason really matter?

698
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:51,605
Why can't you give
Taylor what they want?

699
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,073
Because it's too much.

700
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,908
And what they want can't be given.

701
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,076
It needs to be taken.

702
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:58,744
And what would you do
if they tried to take it?

703
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,746
Cut 'em down like I was Connor MacLeod.

704
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:04,984
What does it say that you always have
to quote the damn<i> Highlander?</i>

705
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:07,654
That I spent some time
watching cable TV alone

706
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:09,989
in high school.
And that I have pristine taste

707
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,592
in movies, even back then.

708
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:14,726
Or, that you see every single challenge

709
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:18,197
as a life or death contest
to see who's gonna lose their head.

710
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,399
Well, kind of is from where I stand.

711
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,068
You really think I should
give Taylor what they want?

712
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,504
I think you should convince
Taylor that you're partners.

713
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,673
I'm kind of surprised that
you're taking their side.

714
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:30,341
You and I are on the exact same side.

715
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,109
They are on the other.

716
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,212
But I want them happy and earning.

717
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,780
Well, yeah. Me too.

718
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,917
You sure?

719
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,152
'Cause you know how to keep somebody,

720
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,954
and how to drive them the fuck away...

721
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,123
I know some people bail...

722
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:48,291
We're talking about Taylor.

723
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,827
- If you want Taylor gone...
- I don't want them gone.

724
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,929
So then give them more
than what you want,

725
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,265
even if it's less than what they want.

726
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,700
Quickly.

727
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,204
You're right.

728
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,940
You're always right about this stuff.

729
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,808
I'm right about a ton of stuff.

730
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,377
Not just this.

731
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:14,015
Thanks for coming over.

732
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,310
Stay.

733
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:45,279
C'mon, Bobby.

734
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:49,048
We're not gonna get sloppy, are we?

735
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,452
No, I guess not.

736
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:02,060
I'll pick up the kids tomorrow.

737
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:03,962
Like the lawyers agreed.

738
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,767
Let's settle this.

739
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:45,502
You're a valued part of this place.

740
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:47,415
You've been effective in every meeting

741
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,539
you weren't deliberately
trying to sabotage.

742
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,874
Thank you. And about the 50 million.

743
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,976
You can have half that.

744
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:58,247
I've never come up that far,
never paid that much.

745
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,916
Now, okay, I know
it's not exactly what you want.

746
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,752
But I've been giving it some thought,

747
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,986
and I realize that what
you really need is...

748
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:08,923
forward momentum,
above all things, even money...

749
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:11,693
So I'm putting you on the raise team.

750
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,095
Fuckin' A. Onward and upward.

751
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:16,431
There's gonna be 30 Bil on the table,

752
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,533
get ready to help me
haul it outta there.

753
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,769
Oh, I am ready.

754
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:27,074
Well, you may be the one person here

755
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:31,144
who actually earns her bonus
every single day on the job.

756
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:32,380
You saw Lara.

757
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,515
Because you did.

758
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:36,149
Thanks for that.

759
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:38,518
And for all of it.

760
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,087
Your Ice Juice profits,
listed under someone else's account,

761
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:44,090
they've been put back under your name.

762
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:45,725
And I doubled it.

763
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:48,194
So you can take your comp
meeting off the books,

764
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,929
you just had it.

765
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,976
He's in the library,
waiting and stewing.

766
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:06,779
- Good.
- You didn't open it.

767
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:10,248
- Yeah. I meant to, then I got...
- Oh, no, you gotta open it.

768
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:23,093
Oh, you are so right.

769
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:26,997
I won't wear it 'til we've got him.
Bad luck.

770
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,766
But once we do, yes,

771
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:34,070
it's gonna be like Chris LeDoux
came back to life in here.

772
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:37,140
Can't wait to see it.

773
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,775
Let's go.

774
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,050
Anthony Radaelli.

775
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:50,085
It's not quite what I pictured,

776
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,888
but I guess she has a type.

777
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,022
Who does?

778
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:55,925
Uh, Taiga, of course.

779
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,393
Oh. So that's what this is about?

780
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,996
Mm. She is a key figure in this story.

781
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:02,697
In your story.

782
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:05,399
But not for long.
No, because you are gonna

783
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:07,168
give her back all of her money,

784
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,670
really her husband's money.

785
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,672
And then fuck off whence you came.

786
00:38:10,774 --> 00:38:12,239
Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

787
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:14,809
Taiga and I, we're a good fit.

788
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:17,311
I know. You were seeing her before Ira.

789
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:19,480
Before her last boyfriend, too.

790
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:21,982
You just keep popping up
in her life, suddenly

791
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,184
when things are going well for her.

792
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:28,121
You're like that James Woods
character in<i> Casino.</i>

793
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,357
Come to think of it,
maybe just like James Woods.

794
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,093
Anyway, perhaps you think
you're soul mates,

795
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:34,862
maybe it's a scam. Either way,

796
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,829
you're gonna forget she ever existed.

797
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,198
Or I will summon the
full power of my office

798
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,068
to erase any and all
meaning from your life.

799
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,505
Mm. You wouldn't use your job like that.

800
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,977
Hmm.

801
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:59,017
Uh, do you know
the expression Federal Case?

802
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,920
As in, "Hey, bub,
don't make a federal case out of it"?

803
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:03,955
- I guess. Yeah.
- Yeah. Reason people say it is:

804
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:05,690
because a federal case

805
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:08,226
is the worst fucking thing there is.

806
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:11,228
State crimes, city violations,

807
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,631
those can be defended,
mitigated, fought.

808
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:16,166
Yeah. And even if you do get convicted,

809
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:19,469
you probably only serve
a fraction of the time given,

810
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,138
then you get off for good behavior,

811
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,740
you get parole,

812
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,241
maybe you never even have to go

813
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:26,343
'cause the jails are too crowded.

814
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,945
So you stay at home with
a bracelet on your ankle,

815
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,080
and you spend your day
trying to convince

816
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:33,149
the pizza delivery girl
to give you a blowjob.

817
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,520
But, you see, there are no blowjobs

818
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,556
in a federal case.

819
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:44,126
Mm. Our conviction rate is 97 percent.

820
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,127
And there is no parole, either.

821
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:47,996
So you do the full time.

822
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,565
And that time is almost always

823
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,068
exactly what the prosecutor,
what I, recommend.

824
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,137
So I say to you, Anthony:

825
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,107
Don't make this a federal case.

826
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:03,210
Ah, Jesus.

827
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:05,179
Oh, and whatever I do to you,

828
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:08,315
I can do to anyone you gave
any of that money to,

829
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,917
like your family.

830
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:12,186
I really should take
a closer look at them.

831
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,821
You're a real sonofabitch.

832
00:40:13,923 --> 00:40:15,656
Oh. A lot of people hate me.

833
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,157
Tell him why they hate me, Karl.

834
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:18,725
You're a real sonofabitch.

835
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:23,362
I am. Especially when you've fucked
with someone I care about.

836
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:28,468
Go away.

837
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,246
That was fun.

838
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,816
Just like how Janet Reno
and I used to run it.

839
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,651
You think he'll really disappear?

840
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:48,353
Like a fart in the wind
on the Ponderosa.

841
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:51,090
Close the door.

842
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:57,762
How goes your data scrape?

843
00:40:57,864 --> 00:41:00,197
I met with IT,
explained the sensitivity.

844
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,266
I've established a series of searches

845
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:04,502
I can discreetly run
on agents' messages.

846
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,671
If anything pings,
I can widen out the search.

847
00:41:06,773 --> 00:41:09,240
I'm sure the AG will eat
that up with a camping spoon.

848
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,508
Maybe even put a letter in your file.

849
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,076
Isn't that why you made your move?

850
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:15,512
To help rebuild your rep.

851
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:17,480
Maybe I did it to shield you.

852
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,349
So it wouldn't be your ass on the line.

853
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,051
Uh-huh. Either way,

854
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:23,654
don't be too zealous in
finding wrongdoing here.

855
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,789
Jock's perch is many miles away.

856
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:27,389
But the people in this building,

857
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,725
you gotta live with them every day.

858
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:37,199
My boy, my boy, my prodigal boy.

859
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:42,571
What more can I do for you?

860
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,573
I'd like to use your apartment.

861
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,709
I know that Mom is in Palm Beach

862
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,779
and I need some privacy.

863
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:54,149
You also had to know I'd ask why, so...

864
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,217
out with it.

865
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,220
I need a private place to meet
with a young woman.

866
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:05,392
I appreciate that you're smart enough
not to take this to a hotel,

867
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,127
it's too public.

868
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:11,331
Even with things being the way
they've been between us,

869
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,133
I'm proud you know

870
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:15,969
- you can always come to me.
- It's not really like that,

871
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,204
- Dad.
- I've always said:

872
00:42:17,306 --> 00:42:20,306
monogamy is a form of socialism.

873
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:22,541
It's testosterone redistribution

874
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:25,745
so a few bucks don't keep
all the does to themselves.

875
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,147
I'm doing this for Ira.

876
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,482
I'm taking care of something

877
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:33,753
that he can't take care of himself.

878
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,023
So it's not concupiscence,
it's<i> menschkeit.</i>

879
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,257
I'm even prouder.

880
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:42,060
When is she due?

881
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:43,461
Hour or so.

882
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:44,696
I could stay,

883
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:46,098
in an advisory capacity...

884
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,265
No. No.

885
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:50,902
Thank you, Dad, no, um,
I just need the space.

886
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:52,636
Mm-hmm.

887
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,777
Taiga, I don't know you very well.

888
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,378
I didn't try to get to know you,

889
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,982
and that's on me. Perhaps I thought Ira
would move on to someone more...

890
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,618
Substantial?

891
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,053
Closer to his age bracket.

892
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,857
So I'm at a bit of a loss
whether to appeal

893
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:18,862
to your decency,
your vanity, your avarice...

894
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:22,565
or just to your fear center.

895
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,033
Please.

896
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:26,168
Anthony returned the money,

897
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,370
even got back the deposit
on that apartment.

898
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,205
And now he's gone.

899
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,507
- You chased him off.
- I did.

900
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,910
And I can't say that you were wrong.

901
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,246
I'm embarrassed and ashamed and, yes,

902
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,748
I am afraid of whatever
you're gonna do next.

903
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,950
So congratulations.

904
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,618
Your fucked up tactics fucked me up.

905
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,593
This is a postnuptial agreement.

906
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:58,132
It entitles you to 50,000 dollars
for every year you stay in the marriage.

907
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:00,466
Which means, all told,
you'll be walking away

908
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:02,602
with 50,000 dollars.

909
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:06,072
You don't need to read it.

910
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,574
I may play dirty,
but I don't deal dirty.

911
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,576
Just sign it, take it to Ira,

912
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,013
and then tell him that you're leaving,

913
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:17,116
but that you wanted
to do it with integrity.

914
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:36,935
I liked him.

915
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:41,172
And I really did try to love him.

916
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:44,108
Try harder.

917
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:46,077
- Dad...
- You give a marriage seven years

918
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,078
before you even entertain

919
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,779
- the notion of a divorce.
- Dad.

920
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:51,548
From the day the Dorsey Brothers
showed that Presley boy

921
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,983
swiveling his hips,

922
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:56,053
there's been a slow but steady
erosion of the family.

923
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:58,255
Well, here is how you keep one going:

924
00:44:58,357 --> 00:45:00,590
You find a group of
friends better than you,

925
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:04,527
find one worse,
bitch about them to each other,

926
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:06,596
and then when you're all bitched out,

927
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:08,530
run ten miles a day.

928
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:11,633
Take your birth control
pills and flush them;

929
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:15,204
and make that kid your project together.

930
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:18,341
And if Ira doesn't know how to fuck you,

931
00:45:18,442 --> 00:45:19,575
you teach him.

932
00:45:19,677 --> 00:45:21,143
Okay. Yeah.

933
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:23,379
I'm not done. One more thing:

934
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:25,981
give yourself the lime test.
You stick your finger

935
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,749
in lime juice and put it up inside.

936
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,551
And if it stings,
get yourself cleaned out.

937
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:34,722
Do not bring the clap
home to your husband;

938
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:36,258
it's uncivil.

939
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:49,937
That's what you meant by "advisor"?

940
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,140
Ira doesn't want or need
another divorce.

941
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:55,109
He needs a wife who's broken in.

942
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,212
And since he can't break her,
I'll do it for him.

943
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:04,850
This is what's gonna make him happy.

944
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:08,922
And that's what you want, right, son?

945
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:15,761
I've missed you, Dad.

946
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:25,437
Normally we go over your
legal bill on the phone.

947
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:28,140
To avoid... you know.

948
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:30,508
After today, I don't think
I'm gonna be writing

949
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,744
any fat checks for a while.

950
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:34,312
Plus, this year's tab,

951
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:36,247
you outdid yourself. Record-setting.

952
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:38,249
I knocked 30 percent
off the hours before

953
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:39,483
I even sent it to you.

954
00:46:39,585 --> 00:46:40,751
Sure. Of course you did,

955
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:42,686
because you inflated
'em in the first place.

956
00:46:42,788 --> 00:46:44,388
Ten million fucking dollars...

957
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,990
You're gonna haggle with me,

958
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:47,858
after the victory I delivered?

959
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:49,060
<i>You</i> delivered it?

960
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:51,061
I seem to remember you encouraging me

961
00:46:51,163 --> 00:46:52,996
to tuck tail and take a plea.

962
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,332
Leaving<i> me</i> to figure out
how to work miracles.

963
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:57,033
How much do you want to fucking pay?

964
00:46:57,135 --> 00:46:58,835
Not a penny over nine million.

965
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:00,971
You're doing this over
a million dollars...

966
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:02,405
- Mm.
- A number that doesn't mean

967
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:04,975
jack shit to you,
but would mean the world

968
00:47:05,077 --> 00:47:07,176
to my firm and the dozen associates

969
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:10,245
who worked all-nighters
on your fucking case.

970
00:47:10,348 --> 00:47:12,081
And yet you push and push.

971
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:13,815
Most people pick their spots.

972
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,985
- Well, I pick every spot.
- Of course.

973
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,587
You can't just engage,
you've got to compete,

974
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:20,956
you can't merely compete,
you've got to win,

975
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:25,026
and a win isn't a win
unless it's a kill.

976
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:27,295
You want the fucking
nine million or not?

977
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:30,198
Fine. Send it.

978
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,000
See ya soon.

979
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:36,037
There.

980
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:38,373
Ah. Look at that porterhouse.

981
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:39,540
Dynamic duo.

982
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:40,541
Filet for me.

983
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,109
Strip for this guy.

984
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,247
Lovely. Thank you.

985
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,724
Mmm.

986
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:01,427
Mmm.

987
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,032
Salt?

988
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,134
Doesn't need it.

989
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,004
Three days seeing you in a row, Ira.
I like this new streak.

990
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:14,640
And I'm in better spirits
than when we last spoke.

991
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:16,074
Mm-hmm?

992
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:17,909
Taiga came home.

993
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:19,011
Did she?

994
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,079
With the money.

995
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,779
And a postnup.

996
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:24,315
Well, you were right. It all blew over.

997
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,817
She just needed to get
it out of her system.

998
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,386
Thank you.

999
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:35,592
It's funny,

1000
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:37,627
the thing I was most afraid of,

1001
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:39,607
the thing that haunted me
in the middle of the night,

1002
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:43,300
was Taiga finding some other guy.

1003
00:48:43,402 --> 00:48:45,635
Thought it would absolutely end me.

1004
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:48,572
But the strange gift
in all this<i> mishegas,</i>

1005
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:51,974
what it taught me.

1006
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:55,578
Sometimes the worst thing
happening isn't so bad.

1007
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,650
I'm not saying I would have willed this
on purpose, but... do I sound crazy?

1008
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,120
No. On the contrary.

1009
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:06,921
Very wise, my friend.

1010
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:08,723
Very wise.

1011
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:20,235
<i>Sacker, get us a meeting with the state
Attorney General, Alvin Epstein.</i>

1012
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:28,342
What's the total?

1013
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,211
Same as last year.

1014
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:43,423
To the raise.

1015
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:49,129
Ahh.

1016
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:52,165
Next year, when you've got
30 billion under management,

1017
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:53,699
you're gonna look back fondly

1018
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:57,302
on how little you paid today.

1019
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:02,040
Actually I still have
one comp meeting left.

1020
00:50:02,143 --> 00:50:04,042
Is it mine? I bet it's mine.

1021
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:07,100
It is. I know it's been
a strange year for you,

1022
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:09,423
serving different masters,
almost losing me...

1023
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:10,647
Don't take me back there.

1024
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:13,552
But through it all, you have been
the bulwark that Axe Cap needs.

1025
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:17,522
And so for this,
I have a special present.

1026
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:18,624
That's more like it.

1027
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,258
Reach behind the couch.

1028
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,515
Whoa.

1029
00:50:30,503 --> 00:50:32,569
Oh, it brings me back to childhood.

1030
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:36,239
All the high-end nudity
of a cadged<i> Playboy,</i>

1031
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:37,874
but with sophistication,

1032
00:50:37,976 --> 00:50:41,878
and that certain
<i>je Ne sais quoi</i> of the French.

1033
00:50:44,383 --> 00:50:48,284
Oh, and your bonus is the age you were
when you first discovered that magazine.

1034
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:51,420
Pains me to take from
your personal vault...

1035
00:50:51,522 --> 00:50:53,822
but nine million feels good.

1036
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,360
Where did you find these?

1037
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:03,299
I can't believe you kept
all of Dad's crap.

1038
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:05,833
Yeah, well, at first
I thought he was coming back.

1039
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:07,669
And then I was afraid he'd come back.

1040
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,804
Then when I realized
he wasn't... I thought

1041
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:11,406
it'd be petty to toss everything.

1042
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:13,541
So I didn't want to give him that power.

1043
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:16,244
Yeah? So you asserted yourself...

1044
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:19,980
by spending 34 years storing
and toting all his stuff.

1045
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:24,084
Your father was your first great enemy.

1046
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:27,321
Yeah, well, if you abandon your kid,
that's what you get.

1047
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,389
Found it.

1048
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:38,699
You know, you hated him
<i>long</i> before that.

1049
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,967
The way you used to take
the fight to each other.

1050
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:44,103
I used to like the way
you were such a fighter.

1051
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,055
I'll admit that I didn't
love when you tried

1052
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,370
to take the fight to me, though.

1053
00:51:48,577 --> 00:51:49,975
That was a fucking mistake.

1054
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:52,177
I maybe should have told you

1055
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:54,813
not to talk like that
when you were a kid.

1056
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:56,314
I think I still would have.

1057
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:58,816
Sure. But you also would
have had a little voice

1058
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:03,054
in the back of your head
telling you not to.

1059
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,056
Do you have that voice?

1060
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:06,725
At all?

1061
00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:25,008
<i>So, come on. Where?</i>

1062
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,910
Just came across them.

1063
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,248
Hmm.

1064
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:46,542
Oliver. Solid whiskers.

1065
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:49,177
Gets me into the professorial mindset.

1066
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,712
Mm.

1067
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:53,347
You enjoying the teaching?

1068
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,550
When you know the
practice is that different

1069
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:57,719
from the letter and the spirit...

1070
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,387
You feel like you're lying to them.

1071
00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:00,956
Telling the truth is worse.

1072
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:02,958
We don't need lawyers pre-jaded.

1073
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,125
Hmm.

1074
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:05,227
At least the, uh...

1075
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:09,096
the wife is happy to have me home.

1076
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:10,497
Yeah.

1077
00:53:14,036 --> 00:53:16,003
So...

1078
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:17,671
What I couldn't say on the phone...

1079
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:21,741
there is an FBI agent I know
who did an opp for Chuck.

1080
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:24,176
Off the books.

1081
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:25,578
The agent told you about it?

1082
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,947
Mnh-mnh. Found another way in.

1083
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:29,348
Hmm.

1084
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,183
I don't know where this ends,

1085
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:32,518
but I have a start.

1086
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:35,421
You're trying to convince me
to help you go after Chuck.

1087
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:39,491
No. I'm giving you a
chance to convince<i> me.</i>

1088
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:42,293
Why'd you let yourself get led astray?

1089
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:44,195
Why'd you protect Chuck?

1090
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:45,731
Why did you?

1091
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,467
I believed in him.

1092
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:52,170
I didn't believe in myself.

1093
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:56,140
But I believe he must be stopped.

1094
00:54:04,684 --> 00:54:06,416
You said you had the cloak

1095
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:10,220
and wanted me to provide the dagger.

1096
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:13,790
No idea what that means,
but it got me here.

1097
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:18,061
I want you to launch an investigation
into Jock Jeffcoat's brother

1098
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:20,063
and TexasSouthCable.

1099
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,297
Based on what?

1100
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,399
Based on this.

1101
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:27,837
This is Ashley Cutler.

1102
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:34,176
This is unusable. Weak witness.

1103
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:36,511
Yeah.

1104
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:39,247
So no actual deployable evidence.

1105
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,116
None to speak of. No.

1106
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:48,122
We know that our witness, Mr. Cutler,
isn't strong enough to win Case A,

1107
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:51,025
but we're not trying to win Case A.

1108
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:54,495
No. We're gonna get Jock
on trying to stop it.

1109
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,564
- Ah.
- So, in the end,

1110
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:59,533
the case you'll be bringing is:
obstruction of justice.

1111
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:02,998
Against the Attorney General
of the United States.

1112
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,033
Right now you're just

1113
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:06,406
the Attorney General
of New York state, Mr. Epstein.

1114
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:08,887
But to be the man
you gotta beat the man.

1115
00:55:08,922 --> 00:55:11,277
After you topple someone
of Jock's stature...

1116
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:13,346
you'll be the motherfucking man.

1117
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:20,520
Nothing makes me feel so alive
as putting my head in a tiger's mouth.

1118
00:55:20,622 --> 00:55:24,389
Right up until the moment
the tiger snaps his jaws shut.

1119
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:28,160
But we will be there with
chairs and whips at the ready.

1120
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:29,760
You sure he'll come?

1121
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:32,932
The three of us, we'll cause him to.

1122
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:35,400
I was sweating over the
worst possible thing

1123
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,669
that could happen, which was
Jock finding out what I've been up to

1124
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:39,938
and stopping it.

1125
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,341
And then I realized...

1126
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:46,310
what if the worst thing did happen?

1127
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:48,012
What if we made it so?

1128
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,414
Rather than worry
about Jock obstructing,

1129
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:52,516
we're gonna invite it.

1130
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,418
- Bait it.
- Your part is simple.

1131
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,685
Proceed as usual.

1132
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:58,021
Try to keep everything a secret.

1133
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:01,125
- The great impossibility.
- Right.

1134
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:04,427
And once Jock knows you're coming
for his brother, he will realize

1135
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,363
that eventually it
will come back to him.

1136
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:08,232
And before he can let that happen...

1137
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,413
He'll try to get to Cutler,

1138
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,235
to shut him up and shut it all down.

1139
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:14,370
And that's what we'll get him on.

1140
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,292
It's ready.

1141
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,062
It's fucking ready.
Don't tell me it's not ready.

1142
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,165
It's ready.

1143
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,299
It's like a Trident missile
in launch mode.

1144
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,933
You sell Axe on deploying this,

1145
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,434
he becomes state of the art.

1146
00:56:47,536 --> 00:56:48,889
He takes human decision making,

1147
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,524
that fallibility, out of the game.

1148
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,340
And he starts moving in micro-seconds.

1149
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:57,845
We go live in a week. Good work.

1150
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:25,838
It looks like you're ready
to get into business.

1151
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,841
I need a meeting with your boss,
Grigor Andolov.

1152
00:57:56,786 --> 00:57:58,229
You have a problem.

1153
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:01,631
I will make your problem disappear.

1154
00:58:02,377 --> 00:58:05,269
Jesus Christ. What do you want?

1155
00:58:05,336 --> 00:58:07,938
- I've got him.
- What do you think you know?

1156
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,708
If the endgame is coming
I say bring it on.

1157
00:58:11,776 --> 00:58:16,212
If I were to engage on your behalf
I'd expect something in return.

1158
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:18,014
Would you, now?

1159
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,083
- What is your objective?
- Total destruction.

1160
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:31,237

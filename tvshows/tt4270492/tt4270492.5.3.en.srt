<i>Previously on</i> billions...

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,183
To our new ag.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,585
Oh.
Long may he rule.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,627
Until recently, I had always had
a north star.

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,109
It's too late.

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,671
That's how divorced people talk.

7
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:14,992
It is.

8
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:17,234
You really are serious
about making a change.

9
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,036
I am committed to this course.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,279
To purge the world of villainy.

11
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:24,442
And myself of...

12
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,124
I guess villainy, too.

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,166
Told ya:
Done giving you info.

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,048
There will come a time

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,971
when you will be forced
to line up against axe

16
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,532
for your very survival.

17
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:36,255
When it does,
you will need me.

18
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,298
I'll trade ya a whole pie,

19
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:39,979
plus solve
your rhoades problems,

20
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,583
for an introduction to a certain
guy who works for your outfit.

21
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:46,867
They call me "hard Bob,"
and you know why?

22
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,188
I have an idea.

23
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,830
'Cause I brook no bullshit.

24
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:52,273
Last I checked,
we still had some sovereignty.

25
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:54,195
This is where
you want to make a stand?

26
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:55,677
You stole my shaman.

27
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,719
When I compete,
hell, I'm there to win.

28
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:59,601
Game's not over, buddy boy.

29
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,325
But if mase cap is no longer an
operation, what do I do here?

30
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:05,287
That's your answer
to the fireside chat:

31
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,609
You want to become a bank.

32
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,850
I want to become a bank.

33
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,051
In order to Rob it?

34
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,209
In order that I don't have to.

<i>Yeah, I know.
Too much.</i>

00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,672
- Yeah.
- We're crypto millionaires!

55
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:49,681
Oh, shit.

56
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:52,641
Gordie axelrod done fucked up.

00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,712
Damn.

58
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:56,355
Those photos the dealer sent
don't capture the...

59
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,956
Power?

60
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, you have to stand
in front of a painting.

61
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,521
Feel what it does to you.

62
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:05,084
I'm sure feeling something.

63
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:06,486
What is it?

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,689
<i>Oh. Guy's wrestling
with the big themes.</i>

65
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:12,652
Sex, drugs,
and cocoa puffs?

66
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:14,811
Close...

67
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,781
This.

68
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:23,024
This is the one.

69
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,391
Dealer said his last show
was a while ago.

70
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,753
Dealer said
it was almost a bust...

71
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,516
Guy refused to dance
for collectors.

72
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,319
Wags:
But it sold through.

73
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,563
- The work...
- Yeah, the work.

74
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:44,808
Good job getting me in here
while it's still virgin snow.

75
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:47,411
Let's grab these up
before the show starts.

76
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:53,737
- What the fuck?
- Red dots?

77
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,139
<i>That means sold.
That means...</i>

78
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,861
There was a pre-pre-viewing?

79
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,103
<i>Im-fucking-possible.
It happened.</i>

80
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,705
We got snaked.

81
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,428
I will find the dealer
and ship him back to that armory

82
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,231
broken down like a disassembled
m-16 in a fucking crate...

83
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,594
<i>Forget the dealer.
We'll get him later.</i>

84
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,556
Right now we go to the source.

85
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,571
You know what this guy
looks like?

86
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,854
<i>No.
Very low-pro on the web.</i>

87
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,375
Well. We'll spot him...

88
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,099
Look.

89
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:41,630
And now we have.

90
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,562
Hey, Tanner,

91
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,564
- Bobby axelrod...
- How you doing?

92
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,927
Tanner, axe, here,
is a major collector.

93
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,125
<i>Great eye for what's next.
Worth knowing.</i>

94
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,694
I wish I had something
to sell you. But...

95
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:08,579
<i>Prince. You bought
the implosion series.</i>

96
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,702
<i>Oh. I love knowing
that you dig 'em, too.</i>

97
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,185
<i>Yeah. I got here early,
and they spoke to me.</i>

98
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,948
<i>Damn, man.
Not my intention to scoop you.</i>

99
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:19,431
<i>Hey, if it couldn't be me.
Salut.</i>

100
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,313
Just kill me now.

101
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,075
Disturbing work, huh?

102
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,158
It really gets into
the weighty questions.

103
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,840
<i>Mm. You know,
what caught my eye</i>

104
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,282
is the humility in the face
of inevitable decay.

105
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,964
Something you missed,
no doubt.

106
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,527
Ahh, well, I'll have
plenty of time to find it

107
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,249
when it's hanging
in my beach house.

108
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,252
Well, you'll beat me
to the punch next time.

109
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,655
How much second-rate dogshit
did you have to buy

110
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,977
- to get him in early?
- Nah, buying someone off,

111
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,100
- that's your move.
- What'd you use, charm?

112
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,861
Charm? Charm's thin.

113
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:49,424
Shit, you're charming,
but you ain't got a painting.

114
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:52,468
No, I happen to be warm
and inviting.

115
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,829
And draw people to me.

116
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,751
In this case,
I lucked into catching

117
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,753
a morning set
with his dealer in Zuma.

118
00:06:57,777 --> 00:07:00,717
<i>Yesterday.
Hardly had to ask.</i>

119
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,238
Serendipity do da.

120
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:03,720
<i>So. Where do you go
from here?</i>

121
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:05,842
Home. Back to Hudson.

122
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,724
<i>Oh?
You done with implosion?</i>

123
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:08,966
Are you?

124
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,609
I'm, uh, talking
with the artist.

125
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,255
'Cause I'd love to buy
if you have more.

126
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,577
I-I don't have a fucking clue
if I ever will.

127
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,460
I've always been obsessed
with what happens to things

128
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,183
when they come to their end.

129
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:26,905
<i>Yeah.
I don't paint for money.</i>

130
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,267
<i>Never have.
Or demand.</i>

131
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,110
So I don't know.

132
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,633
Well when you do,
think of me.

133
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,435
Okay.

134
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,877
Tanner,
it's your moment,

135
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,401
let's go down
and let 'em see our paintings.

136
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,168
I failed you, habibi.

137
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:49,370
I don't feel like
bucking you up right now.

138
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:51,853
- Just do the next thing.
- Which is?

139
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,855
"I don't paint for money"

140
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,177
means nobody
has paid me enough yet.

141
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,380
So: If you can't buy the art...

142
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,741
Buy the artist.

143
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,674
What happens
when you give me a job?

144
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,839
Like Hector elizondo
in the flamingo kid:

145
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,641
You cut a joint, it stays.

146
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,803
I have no idea what
any of those words mean.

147
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,846
<i>But yes.
I get the damn job done.</i>

148
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,127
See, he's a plumber...

149
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,809
And, uh, he works
with his hands.

150
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,652
A pipe joint is, um...

151
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,814
Anyway, in this case?

152
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,416
Once the governor
took our budget

153
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,538
and those criminal cases away,
you said, uh...

154
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,300
<i>Yes.
Find me some civil cases.</i>

155
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,862
- With big settlements.
- Mm.

156
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,465
Since we get to keep 'em
and spend it as we see fit.

157
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,107
Well, I did it.

158
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,989
We'll have about 5 million
coming in.

159
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,513
Praise be.

160
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,875
<i>Yep.
Just like elizondo in kid.</i>

161
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,357
I'll take that as a compliment.

162
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,959
Oh, that's how it was intended.

163
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,802
If I'd wanted to insult you,
I'd have called you big sid.

164
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,163
Good job.

165
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,206
Keep it coming.

166
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,412
What do you think?

167
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,294
Think he'll go for it?

168
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,096
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,179
But I don't see the world
the way he does.

170
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,900
It does get good light though...

171
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:13,062
Mm.

172
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,350
You wanted to talk banks?

173
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:24,634
- Mm.
- Let's talk banks.

174
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:28,519
Axe... you're not getting a bank.

175
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:31,081
That is, sadly,
the long and short of it.

176
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:34,005
Which I could've told you
in five minutes at your office,

177
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,606
where we were supposed to meet...

178
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,089
Yeah, change of plans.

179
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,332
<i>What is this place?
Special project.</i>

180
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:41,733
Don't worry about it.

181
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:43,335
So, how'm I getting a bank.

182
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,137
Told you, you won't.

183
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,379
Fdic approval
is never happening.

184
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,982
<i>We know it's hard. That's why
we have hard Bob here.</i>

185
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,744
To crack it open.

186
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:54,747
You didn't come to New York City
just to give us apologies...

187
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,830
No, I came for the armory show.

188
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:57,831
And him?

189
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,993
I like art parties.

190
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,876
Which we will be
getting back to post-haste...

191
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,359
After I make you understand

192
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:08,038
why a federal bank will not
be in your future.

193
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:15,250
Hello?

194
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:19,170
<i>Understood...
I'll be there this afternoon.</i>

195
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,976
We need to get on a plane.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,858
Gordie stepped in some shit
at school.

197
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:26,102
- Have a good trip...
- Uh uh. Hang tight.

198
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,784
You two are both coming with.

199
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,425
And by the time we land,

200
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,988
I want to know how I am
getting a fucking bank.

201
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,601
No fucking way
that works.

202
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,004
No fucking way
you understand it.

203
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,086
We educate
them so they can run the world.

204
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,968
One day.

205
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,170
But we can't
let them run the school.

206
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,892
Chancellor Adams:
That's our job.

207
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,374
To make
the tough decisions

208
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:57,056
until they're ready to.

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,499
<i>Is that hand-holding?
Is that condescension?</i>

210
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:04,143
<i>No. Here at lawrenceburg,
we call it guidance.</i>

211
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,266
He's right about that.

212
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,028
The students
at that university...

213
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,230
If he lets them win,
decide where to invest...

214
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,832
He's lost all control.

215
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:13,273
That's what he's saying.

216
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,635
But not what he believes.

217
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:16,637
<i>This is nlp.
Natural language processing.</i>

218
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:19,560
Analyzing subtext
through artificial intelligence.

219
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,563
- It does work.
- And pretty fucking cool.

220
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:23,565
The computer is digging past
the words he's saying,

221
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,247
beneath the speech itself...

222
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:27,089
- Still seems like bullshit.
- Stay with us.

223
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,651
By analyzing speech patterns,
vocal frequencies,

224
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,133
tone, sentence structure,

225
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,175
it tells us that this man
wants to divest

226
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,017
his university's
billion dollar fund

227
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,259
from fossil fuels.

228
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:38,261
And not just because
of student protests.

229
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,503
- Because he thinks it's right.
- That's a theory, right?

230
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,625
A probability?

231
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,227
Look at him: Trying.

232
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,670
Yes, it is a probabilistic
conclusion.

233
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:48,032
But we've analyzed
his statements

234
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,673
and noticed a change
about five years ago...

235
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:52,156
The first time any major
university divested.

236
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,679
If he wants in on the party,
why's he holding back?

237
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,361
You know
it's not so easy

238
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,283
to unroll from these positions

239
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:00,325
without significant losses.

240
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,288
- Can we?
- Hell yeah, we can!

241
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,652
I mean, this will be
the first live test.

242
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:10,056
<i>But yeah...
I'm pretty fucking sure.</i>

243
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:14,581
Have Lauren set the pitch.

244
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:19,186
I know some of
his board of trustees.

245
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,707
This won't be easy.

246
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:22,349
Big wins never are.

247
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,712
Then go get that endowment.

248
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,234
And don't fail, because after
langstraat pulled...

249
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,157
<i>Yes. Another loss
will be demoralizing.</i>

250
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,478
And crippling.

251
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,721
To succeed
we're going to need you to be

252
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,402
something
you haven't been lately.

253
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,524
Friendly?

254
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:36,565
Effective.

255
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,816
How do you appeal
to someone whose values,

256
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,619
whose entire system of beliefs,
is opposed to yours?

257
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,861
- Are you talking about me?
- Not this time. No.

258
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,825
Although you should have asked
me before approaching Lauren.

259
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,587
Do you want
to talk about it now?

260
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,469
<i>No. No,
a potential investor.</i>

261
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,391
Chancellor of lawrenceburg.

262
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,353
Do you want
to give me more information

263
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,995
or leave it super theoretical?

264
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,957
I would like to give you,
at all times,

265
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:07,559
as little information
as possible.

266
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,202
But: We have found a way
to get underneath his words.

267
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,885
He knows he should divest
his school from fossil fuels.

268
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:15,487
He hates that the pressure to do
so is coming from students.

269
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,129
And if he does it
in the wrong way,

270
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:18,571
he believes he will be fired.

271
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:20,213
So he cares too much
about things

272
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:21,734
he shouldn't care about at all?

273
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,296
Part of him
wants to fight the kids

274
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,778
for the sake of
fighting the kids.

275
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,139
But that isn't rational.

276
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,101
That's the problem
with the real world,

277
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,463
real people.

278
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,904
We're not computers

279
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,987
with the software
directing the hardware.

280
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,388
We're not rational actors.

281
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,748
- Some of us are.
- Some of us think we are.

282
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,876
Are you familiar
with Jonathan haidt?

283
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,558
The social psychologist.

284
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:46,397
- Do you believe in god?
- Um, no.

285
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,087
A simple transaction.

286
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,251
Ten bucks,
for your eternal soul.

287
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:59,055
Oh, and you need
to sign it over on paper.

288
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,060
Do you take the deal?

289
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,029
And that pause tells you.

290
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,592
Everything you need
to know about people.

291
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:16,634
The moment when convictions
run headlong

292
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,597
into layers of
psychological baggage

293
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,358
that evolution and
social convention

294
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,080
have wrapped them in.

295
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,723
You don't believe in
the religious concept of a soul,

296
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,526
yet you still hesitate
at selling yours.

297
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,088
There's still that gap

298
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,290
between rational thought
and rational action.

299
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,413
Between software and hardware

300
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,495
how do we bridge that gap?

301
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,939
Make the man fear inaction.

302
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,902
And the regret he'll have
if he makes the wrong move.

303
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,664
And now we're back to Lauren.

304
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:45,866
Stop moving people around
as you think best,

305
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,148
even if you're right.

306
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,871
You should have
approached me first.

307
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:51,633
We should talk more.

308
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,221
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks, Sabrina.

309
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,379
Enjoy.

310
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,669
<i>I don't want to offend.
May I speak freely?</i>

311
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:25,990
Please do.

312
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,953
Even you can't bribe, beg,

313
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,915
and bully your way into a bank.

314
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,918
Your past legal troubles
make you too fragrant

315
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,481
to clear the federal
background dive.

316
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:38,164
The sec will drop its scat
all over your application.

317
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,606
<i>I, too, don't want to offend.
May I speak freely?</i>

318
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,729
<i>Mode I prefer.
I brook no bullshit.</i>

319
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,210
You can go fuck yourself.

320
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,892
Our legal issues
were extinguished.

321
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,694
Bringing them up now
is like watching porn

322
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,176
after you've already gotten off.

323
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,457
Well, may I speak freely?

324
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,179
Your legal issues were the tip

325
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,821
of the fucking toxic iceberg...

326
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:55,142
May I speak freely?

327
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,624
You can both speak
fucking freely.

328
00:15:56,648 --> 00:16:00,068
<i>I thought you were omnipotent.
Or pretty fucking close anyway.</i>

329
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,351
Now you're telling the fdic
won't give me approval?

330
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,715
Even Jesus kept the miracles
in the realm of the conceivable.

331
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,917
The fdic makes
the casino licensing board

332
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,040
look as soft as cottonelle.

333
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:14,003
The fucking bankers almost
bankrupted the country...

334
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:16,085
And they got even richer
when they did it.

335
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,408
But they got
their licenses first.

336
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:20,891
They were smart enough
not to stick their shmekels

337
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:22,933
into the tushies
of the average American

338
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:25,856
until they actually had
a goddamn bank charter.

339
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,739
As in all things,
sequence matters.

340
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,982
- You got too dirty too soon.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,383
So gimme a plan.

342
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,265
Take your chance
with a state charter.

343
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:37,309
<i>Different regulators, lesser.
Perhaps more open to the...</i>

344
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,311
Bribing, the begging,
the bullying.

345
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,753
We'd still be a bank.

346
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:44,837
If you make it through
the flaming hoops.

347
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:47,360
You'll need to show
a high level of liquidity.

348
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,122
You'll need an airtight board.

349
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:52,565
You'll need a,
a unassailable ceo.

350
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,208
And you'll have to rehab
your image with state pols

351
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,890
who will be unapologetic

352
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:59,253
and totally blind
to their own corruption.

353
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:02,496
Why don't you come work for me,
hard Bob?

354
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,979
<i>You know the territory.
I like the way you roll.</i>

355
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,821
Lease him out to me.

356
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,304
He's his own man,
he can do what he wants.

357
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,989
Thanks for the offer,
I find it touching...

358
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:17,593
But I love working for the g
alongside special k here.

359
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,954
I'll stick where I am.

360
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,240
Hey lar...

361
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,086
I know...

362
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,451
Yeah. I'm on my way now.

363
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,533
They're not throwing him
out of anywhere,

364
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,015
you can count on that...

365
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,580
Dad...

366
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,022
What the fuck, gord?

367
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,623
Bitcoin mining in your dorm?

368
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,746
- Multi-mining.
- What the fuck is a 'multi?'

369
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,668
mining a selection
of cryptocurrencies

370
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,150
with the highest market prices

371
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:52,871
and trading them back
for bitcoin.

372
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,594
It's the smart way to do
the stupid thing he was doing.

373
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,637
<i>But it was gonna work.
And it should have worked.</i>

374
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,479
If the wiring in the dorm
wasn't so shit...

375
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,000
You're blaming that?

376
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,044
<i>Well. That's why we bypassed
the internal fusing.</i>

377
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:06,887
Give us a call
when you quit college.

378
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,410
We'll have a job for you.

379
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,011
Now, gord,
where'd you come up

380
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,693
with a fucking scheme like this?

381
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,138
Your son was responsible

382
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,981
for the cascading failure
of the local grid.

383
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,983
Knocked out the town.

384
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,223
All in service of
some digital mammon...

385
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,478
I don't think gordie
should be here for this.

386
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm going to speak more plainly

387
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:38,922
than you're used to,
Mr. Axelrod.

388
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:40,243
My son can handle it.

389
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,085
I'm not sure
you understand, sir.

390
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,367
I'm going to talk...

391
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,930
I get it.

392
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,653
Like senator geary in two.

393
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:52,176
And, as il padrino
did in that picture,

394
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,381
let me make you an offer.

395
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,864
A generous donation
to the school.

396
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,588
Plus the costs of fixing up
whatever it is gordie broke.

397
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:06,712
Because that,
that's what this is to you.

398
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:08,234
Something you fix

399
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,717
by dangling trinkets
in front of my face.

400
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:18,085
Your son dishonors himself,

401
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,927
dishonors this school,

402
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,530
and you see it as part of
a financial transaction.

403
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:24,812
<i>Dishonors?
I think you're soaking up</i>

404
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:27,015
a little bit too much
of the atmosphere here.

405
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,659
It was...

406
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,782
Let's call it an independent
lab project gone bad.

407
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,304
Knocked out a few lights.

408
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:37,947
But you gotta admit,
showed initiative.

409
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,430
Our business leaders today,
they started young,

410
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,553
goes doubly for our startups...

411
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:46,836
<i>It showed, Mr. Axelrod,
a complete lack of respect</i>

412
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,158
for the codes and morals

413
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:50,440
that we've been instilling
in our young men,

414
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:53,123
and more recently women,
for generations.

415
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:55,766
And more than that,

416
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,009
more than that,
it's a true lack of character.

417
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:02,774
Though I am sorry...

418
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:04,456
Because as much
as I want to believe

419
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,097
that each student that
enters Skinner prep

420
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,700
comes in here a blank slate...

421
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,023
Oh, sir,
I don't know if your son

422
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:13,546
ever really had that chance.

423
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,828
Hmm.

424
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:18,831
You really did want
to insult me today.

425
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:23,116
<i>No. I want to wake you up
to the dangers your son is in.</i>

426
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,679
To the dangers
you helped put him in.

427
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,562
The world outside
this campus may be in crisis...

428
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:31,966
Driven there largely
by men like you,

429
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,808
Modern-day
robber barons

430
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,611
who only care about acquiring
more, more, more, more...

431
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:41,216
But here, this place, sir,

432
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,459
this oasis,
is the antidote.

433
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,902
I can't tell how many zeros
you're looking for.

434
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,948
At this school, we don't hold
the sins of the father

435
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,510
against the son.

436
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,232
But we do judge
the sins of the son

437
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,634
on their own merits.

438
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:58,995
And right now,
I have to tell you,

439
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,158
I'm leaning heavily
toward expulsion.

440
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:04,277
<i>Yeah. Lean too far,
you might could fall.</i>

441
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:09,122
I'm no band leader.

442
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,327
Last guy who said that
lost his prized equine.

443
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,414
It might seem like
a tough lesson.

444
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:18,577
But no matter how hard you try...

445
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:22,016
I will not allow you to put
a price on gordie's soul.

446
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,747
Good day.

447
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,803
Am I punished?

448
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:44,267
I don't know
what I'm doing with you.

449
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,329
First, let's get you
clear of it.

450
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,452
Tell me we got something good
on this prig?

451
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,894
<i>Bad news. The headmaster,
kessel, is clean.</i>

452
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,257
This is a man with
no discernible vices.

453
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,820
No arrests,
no legal battles,

454
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:59,942
<i>no financial problems.
Not even a dui.</i>

455
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:03,106
I mean who doesn't have
a single dui on their record...

456
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,989
I digress.

457
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,791
Fuck this place...

458
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:09,993
- Wait, I like it here...
- Thacker prep.

459
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,715
<i>Beech Abbey school.
Eaglestone.</i>

460
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,277
All fine,
fine institutions...

461
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,039
Those are rehabs
and reform schools.

462
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,921
And all brief resting places
for me in my youth.

463
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:18,763
I was going to offer
to make a call.

464
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:21,045
Gordie's not tumbling down
the fucking ladder,

465
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,727
he's staying here.

466
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,370
<i>Look. If we can't squeeze
the headmaster,</i>

467
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,893
then we squeeze what
he loves most: The school.

468
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,816
And we squeeze him where
it's most tender: The donors.

469
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,974
I'll call hall.

470
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:38,625
<i>Dad, I'm really sorry.
Hey. Hey.</i>

471
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,147
Of course I defend you
in front of the headmaster...

472
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,069
Never speak against the family...

473
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:46,153
But between us,
you really fucked up.

474
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:49,156
The risk/reward ratio is off.

475
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,519
And there are better ways
to impress a girl...

476
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,601
Than putting
your whole future at stake.

477
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,643
<i>Look. I'm not mad
that you ran a scheme,</i>

478
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,046
I'm mad you didn't game it out.

479
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,088
Second law of thermodynamics,
gordie...

480
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,411
Total entropy of a system...

481
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:05,454
<i>No.
The price of your actions.</i>

482
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:07,897
Now we have to ruin
a headmaster.

483
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:11,216
- A good man.
- What a show of parentage.

484
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,344
I have so much to learn
from you both,

485
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:16,706
about communication
between a father and a son.

486
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:26,677
Hall,
we have a job for you,

487
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,119
breaking down a prep school

488
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:30,642
like a butcher
quartering a spring lamb.

489
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,325
I'll get to that in a minute.

490
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,007
But first,
I have a job for you.

491
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:40,092
I've had an epiphany,
watching axe with...

492
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,535
Anyway, it is time

493
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,099
that I became
a real pater familias.

494
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,942
I am reaching out
to all of my children.

495
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,944
I have tabs on the little ones,

496
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:54,348
<i>but I need you to...
Locate my older sons.</i>

497
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:57,031
Look, the truth is:

498
00:23:57,055 --> 00:24:00,034
They cut me off.

499
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:02,797
But I need to see
what they're up to...

500
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,919
What they've become.

501
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,168
We were thrilled to hear
that you might be interested

502
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,491
in teaching here
at the law school this semester.

503
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:18,214
And I was doubly thrilled
that you could make the time

504
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,176
to talk with me about it,
Dean Walker.

505
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,698
A sitting ag?

506
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:23,940
Students will be cutting
each other off at the knees

507
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,422
to get into your office hours.

508
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,624
Appreciate the compliment,

509
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,947
though looking back
at my days here,

510
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,109
most of the scrambling
was drunken

511
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,752
and involved fried glazed
doughnuts at the doodle.

512
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:37,034
Education should be robust.

513
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,516
For me it was.

514
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,199
<i>Oh. The world...
And my place in it...</i>

515
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:44,763
Was never so clear
as when I was at school here.

516
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:48,287
Sleepless,
buried under an avalanche

517
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:50,169
of books and case studies...

518
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:52,892
The point of it all
never burned so brightly.

519
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:57,016
<i>Oh. I was in hell, yes,
but it all made sense.</i>

520
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,818
I feel the same
about law school.

521
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,260
Mm.

522
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:02,022
Ah. That's right...

523
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:04,745
You know, I-I keep rolling it
around in the ol' noggin.

524
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,469
When I was here,
I had a sense of purpose,

525
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:11,672
you know, a surety that the law,
and my intention

526
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:13,875
of doing good and right
as a prosecutor,

527
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:15,476
was a kind of shield.

528
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,799
And you learned the very tools

529
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:19,841
that allowed you
to ascend to the job...

530
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,163
For sure.

531
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,967
<i>Oh. To fight the evil
in this world.</i>

532
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,569
And if I can be a part of giving

533
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,210
the next generation
the weapons...

534
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:30,293
How lucky
they'll be to have you.

535
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,814
Oh.

536
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,377
We are thrilled that you'll be
a visiting professor.

537
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:37,256
The rhoades name is woven
into our tradition here...

538
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:45,029
And as a member

539
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:47,832
of our facultas legis,

540
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,515
perhaps you could help us
with a small matter.

541
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,637
It seems your father agreed

542
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:56,081
to an annual donation

543
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:57,643
of a hundred thousand dollars...

544
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,606
- Uh-huh.
- And he's a bit in arrears.

545
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,730
How many years has he missed?

546
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:07,093
Well, all of them.

547
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:09,936
All of them.

548
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,298
Mm-hmm.

549
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:14,661
If you could help,
that'd be great.

550
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:19,427
Either way, we look
forward to you joining us.

551
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:27,235
I'm here from
governor sweeney's office

552
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,837
to pick up the check.

553
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:30,278
Which check is that?

554
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,241
The one for $5 million.

555
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:34,443
The funds from your
office's recent seizure?

556
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,125
You should have called

557
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:38,207
and saved the wear and tear
on your florsheims then

558
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:39,769
because the way I understand it,

559
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:42,011
those funds are ours
to deploy as we see fit.

560
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,733
No.

561
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,297
They're at the governor's
discretion and direction.

562
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:50,220
And he's directed me
to come and get them.

563
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,703
He feels that
the Manhattan da's office

564
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,867
can put them to better use.

565
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:58,826
Have a check cut by end of day.

566
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:04,636
Enjoy your self-satisfied smile
while it lasts.

567
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,257
I never said I wanted to divest.

568
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,219
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't know

569
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,740
it was the right thing to do.

570
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:29,664
And that I'm the person
who knows how to do it.

571
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:31,506
How can a man in my position

572
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,028
give in to the whims
of the current student...

573
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,031
<i>Yes.
You have drawn battle lines.</i>

574
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,792
And so you think of it
as giving in.

575
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,394
I'm not the only one.

576
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,837
The chairman of my board of
trustees has a strong take...

577
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,238
What's his take going to be

578
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,121
if other institutions
do this first?

579
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:46,682
<i>Well.
As long as we're not last,</i>

580
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,404
I think he'll be
just fine with it.

581
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:50,166
You are too smart
to think that way.

582
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,848
And know your history too well.

583
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,730
Wait and see results
in missing out.

584
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:56,093
Can you guarantee me
that we'll make real money

585
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,414
in the process?

586
00:27:57,438 --> 00:27:59,416
You will be out of
your petroleum positions.

587
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,779
You will be seen as responsive
to legitimate concerns.

588
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:03,461
And you will be
on the cutting edge

589
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,702
of financial thinking.

590
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,665
If that's not a win,
tell me what is.

591
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:11,830
And the entitled asshole class
known as the student body

592
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:15,714
will think they won
and bullied me into it.

593
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:17,796
How often does someone
give you the chance

594
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,118
to do the smart thing,

595
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:21,000
even when ego
and lifelong wiring

596
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:23,563
are trying to pull you
in a different direction?

597
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:24,964
I understand, firsthand,

598
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:27,487
what it is to choke down
the bile of compromise

599
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,169
for the sake
of the greater good.

600
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:31,852
Yes, it feels gross
and you shudder and shake.

601
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,334
But you wake up the next day
with a mind at ease.

602
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,337
Because you have protected
the long term.

603
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,579
Instead of indulging
in the momentary feeling

604
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,981
of being strong.

605
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,675
I'll take it to the trustees.

606
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:57,760
<i>Yeah.
I'll call you soon.</i>

607
00:28:57,784 --> 00:28:59,762
Whatever.

608
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:02,325
<i>Okay, so.
I found out a donor</i>

609
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:06,049
who gave 800k to the athletic
department each year.

610
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:08,692
He's friends
with friends of ours.

611
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,294
So I reached out.

612
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,777
Only it ain't 800k he gives.

613
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,935
It's a mil.

614
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,504
There's 200k a year
going somewhere else.

615
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,067
What'd you learn?

616
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:23,628
Uh. No. That was... Um...

617
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:26,792
You ever try talking
to a 14-year-old girl

618
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,434
on facetime?

619
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,556
Goddamn, I hope
that was one of your kids.

620
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,318
My youngest.

621
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:35,201
It was rough.

622
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:37,243
But instead of dwelling on that,

623
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,686
and what it means for
who I am and have been,

624
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,129
as a man, husband and father,

625
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,972
I'm gonna get on figuring out
what headmaster kessel did

626
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,814
with that missing 200k.

627
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,586
This is such an honor.

628
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,227
Creative people have always been

629
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:00,829
so mystifying and special to me.

630
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:02,831
Perhaps because my mother
always told me

631
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,353
to keep away from them.

632
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,596
Yeah, my mother used
to say things.

633
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,237
And working for axe...

634
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,400
The speed at which
his mind operates,

635
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,322
the vastness of
what it can hold,

636
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,885
the way he recognizes
and rewards talent...

637
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,767
It can bring out
the best in you.

638
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,570
Things you didn't even know
you were capable of.

639
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:22,613
Plus, the money!

640
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:25,376
Thanks for showing me in.

641
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:33,185
Hey, if you want to cry
or something, man,

642
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,546
go right ahead.

643
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,506
I got no judgments,
nothing but love.

644
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,536
Hey, axe.

645
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,738
<i>Hey, look, man.
I can't do this.</i>

646
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,340
It's not how I work.

647
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,622
No, no, yeah, yeah,
I understand.

648
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:09,545
I expected this call.

649
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:13,269
Hang in, we'll break some bread
and we'll get into it.

650
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,593
Yeah, alright. Alright.

651
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,810
<i>♪ It's alright ♪</i>

652
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,612
Axe, when are you coming down?

653
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,414
I'm making a great gelato.

654
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,056
<i>Soon.
But in the meantime, listen,</i>

655
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,258
I'm sending someone in
to pick up a few pies.

656
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,780
I'm out of town.

657
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,542
But I've got
an important dinner.

658
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:45,104
You know I don't do
that kind of thing.

659
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,345
This pizza doesn't travel.

660
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:47,666
It's not supposed to be
reheated.

661
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,588
<i>It's pizza.
It's designed to travel.</i>

662
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:51,030
Not this pizza.

663
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:52,832
It goes from the oven
to your mouth.

664
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:55,515
<i>Listen. I won't hold you
responsible for the taste.</i>

665
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,319
Only for you, axe.

666
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:03,123
<i>♪ She got a motor ♪</i>

667
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:07,568
<i>♪ oh, baby, come on
and ride with me ♪</i>

668
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,007
<i>♪ she got a motor ♪</i>

669
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:14,376
Chancellor.

670
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,218
Are we ready to discuss acating.

671
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,819
Your accounts over?

672
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,421
We are not.

673
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:21,063
This is admiral bill karras,

674
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:22,945
chairman of
the board of trustees.

675
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:25,268
You may have hypnotized
the chancellor, here.

676
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,870
But I have stood up
to much harsher methods

677
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:29,552
of interrogation.

678
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:31,274
I see.

679
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:32,836
See this:

680
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,359
We are not going to let
any candy-ass students.

681
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:38,562
Tell us how and when
to invest our endowment.

682
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:41,525
Thank you for your
interest in our university.

683
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,303
<i>Admiral karras.
You know him?</i>

684
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,585
Wild bill?

685
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,989
Not that many four-star
flag officers walking around.

686
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:05,472
I was never
under his direct command.

687
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:08,275
Met him at a fleet briefing
on the Saudi peninsula.

688
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:11,198
His men had a song about him

689
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,322
and how he could power a carrier
with his temper.

690
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,124
- Why?
- He's holding up our endowment.

691
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:19,283
How can you arm me
to take a run at him?

692
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:23,131
By telling you to stay here
and let me do it.

693
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:24,693
You think I'm a candy ass?

694
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:26,975
He thinks almost everyone
serving in the Navy

695
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:28,377
is a candy ass.

696
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,778
And he definitely thinks that

697
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:31,901
of absolutely everyone
who didn't serve.

698
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:34,824
Then I'm going
to let you take it.

699
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,767
My boy, my girl...

700
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:58,365
<i>Ah.
The hearth is complete.</i>

701
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,134
Can't picture you
doing that with me.

702
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,735
Your lips never touched formula.

703
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,217
You were at your mother's teat

704
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,099
until you started
reading chaucer.

705
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,344
But you get with the times,
or you grow old.

706
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:14,587
You want to hold your sister?

707
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:18,151
<i>Uh, no.
It's not a social call.</i>

708
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,274
Uh, I just came
from old ya-lay u.

709
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:22,836
I'm doing a bit of teaching
this semester.

710
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,920
<i>Back to the teat, eh?
It'll do me good.</i>

711
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:28,162
And you would do me
and the school well

712
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:30,765
to follow through on
your financial commitment.

713
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,968
I'm done paying
for your schooling.

714
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:35,851
<i>Hey. You agreed
to the donations, not me.</i>

715
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,614
Son, these things are all
politics and politicking.

716
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:40,616
When it comes
to academic philanthropy,

717
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,658
it's a case of fox and hound.

718
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,140
And I'm the fox.

719
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,022
<i>It's not a game.
You made a pledge.</i>

720
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:48,785
I have new priorities now.

721
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,387
You certainly do.

722
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:53,630
And Yale doesn't need
your money...

723
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:57,474
Their endowment's
30 billion already.

724
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,557
You're on board with this?

725
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,078
Has Yale offended you?

726
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,201
Something in how
they've historically dealt

727
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,442
with indigenous peoples?

728
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,407
No, I'm offended

729
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:11,930
by the idea of paying
for a family legacy

730
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:15,009
when the family doesn't
really act like a family.

731
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,420
Ah.

732
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:27,547
Uh-huh.

733
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,833
The warm embrace of the brood
is indeed important.

734
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:36,998
As strange and circuitously
linked as that brood may be.

735
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:43,645
Perhaps I've been dilatory
in my familial duties.

736
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:45,527
My children have not had
the pleasure

737
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:49,812
of truly welcoming
the newest members of our clan.

738
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:52,370
It's high time
I correct that oversight.

739
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,859
We'd like that very much.

740
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:59,062
I take it you'll have
no trouble navigating

741
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,545
the soon-to-be-former
Mrs. Wendy rhoades?

742
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,186
Oh.

743
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,028
No one's more family-first.

744
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,477
We're gonna walk into his office

745
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:14,359
and we're gonna let
the headmaster know

746
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,321
what we know about him,
and then you...

747
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:21,006
will be sleeping back in
your dorm room tonight, gord...

748
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:29,055
Oh.
<i>Glad I caught you.</i>

749
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,858
Just had a one-on-one with
Skinner's athletic director.

750
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:34,300
Amiable man,
after a fashion.

751
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,303
He confirmed kessel
took the money?

752
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,584
Yes... and no.

753
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:39,706
Pinched it but didn't pocket it.

754
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,388
Redirected it.

755
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,110
He's actually
working for the good.

756
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,313
Like Robin of fucking Locksley?

757
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,074
Much like that.

758
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:50,158
<i>Um. Kessel sidetracked
the excess money from wrestling</i>

759
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,801
to fund a scholarship program
for Syrian refugees

760
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:55,003
that the school
had refused to fund.

761
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:57,126
Three of those refugees
and their families

762
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,284
are on campus this year.

763
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,409
I'll stand by.

764
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:11,381
So the headmaster,
sanctimonious though he sure is,

765
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,944
turns out is
a good man after all.

766
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:17,468
So, do we still
have to destroy him?

767
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,666
What do you think?

768
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,798
Such a father.

769
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:28,240
Hey.

770
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:31,083
Still haven't caught up
with your eldest?

771
00:37:31,107 --> 00:37:34,406
<i>My Georgie?
No, I haven't.</i>

772
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,689
Last I heard, he ran
a legal cannabis business

773
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,810
in Colorado...

774
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,612
But it crossed state lines.

775
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,575
Now, much like the answer,
he's blowing in the wind.

776
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:49,183
Don't beat yourself up
on this, wags.

777
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,985
Fathering ain't easy.

778
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,095
Hey.

779
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,580
I have what I need
to take this headmaster out.

780
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,703
Do I fix this for him?

781
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:04,705
How do I not
fuck my kid up more?

782
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,267
That's the question

783
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:10,432
every decent parent
asks every day.

784
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:13,795
Let's say you take
the laissez-faire approach,

785
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,799
let the market
have its way with gordie.

786
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:18,961
He learns
there are consequences.

787
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:21,564
Gets suspended,
probably expelled.

788
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,286
Ends up at
a lower-tier prep school

789
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,368
or New York military academy.

790
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:27,090
Goes to Colby
instead of Harvard.

791
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,092
<i>There's...
There's no shame in that...</i>

792
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,495
I mean, unless for the kid

793
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,337
who's going mini-winklevoss
at 14...

794
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:35,019
It's what he set his sights on.

795
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,700
Then it's crushing.

796
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,823
And maybe he blames you
for the consequence.

797
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:40,585
And that chip
on his shoulder.

798
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:43,828
Turns into a drinking
problem by the time he's 28.

799
00:39:43,852 --> 00:39:46,431
Or he blames himself,

800
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,194
Accepts the consequences,

801
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:53,158
Self-worth gets
dinged up pretty good...

802
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:57,363
And winds up with a drinking
problem by the time he's 28.

803
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,248
And then there's you...

804
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:07,054
<i>Can you stay the course...
With whatever you decide?</i>

805
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:10,057
Because if you dive in after him
only sometimes,

806
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:13,501
he won't know how or when
to swim, or breathe, or trust.

807
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:16,104
It's got to be tough love
all the way...

808
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,626
Which could work out great,

809
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,428
he could turn out great...

810
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,432
Or the interventionist
approach for evermore.

811
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:25,874
So the question is,

812
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:28,557
do I have the stomach
to let him dangle?

813
00:40:39,794 --> 00:40:42,693
If I had a hat,
it would be in hand...

814
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:45,936
<i>Why?
What do you want to discuss?</i>

815
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,981
I wish we didn't have
to do this here.

816
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:52,423
I wish you were
a completely different man.

817
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,070
The financial restraining order

818
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:00,032
blocking you from getting
your apartment

819
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:02,995
<i>was... a bit of
an overreach.</i>

820
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,957
But I was merely reacting to...

821
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:07,600
I know: My releasing
the statement.

822
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:08,921
Which I wouldn't have done

823
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:11,044
if you hadn't dragged
your goddamned feet.

824
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,369
<i>I was having a hard time...
Accepting our status.</i>

825
00:41:15,393 --> 00:41:16,850
But now I have.

826
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,733
So perhaps a pullback
on the order is in line.

827
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:23,017
Oh, Christ.

828
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,540
You need something.

829
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:28,583
You're not apologizing,
we're horse trading.

830
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,385
Out with it.

831
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:33,629
That's hardly the way
I would characterize this.

832
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:36,712
Fine.

833
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,674
The kids should know.

834
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:42,118
That family is still
important at a time like this.

835
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:44,080
All family.

836
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:47,003
Even new family.

837
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,166
I want to formally introduce
Kevin and Eva

838
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,887
to Roxanne and Willow.

839
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,052
Come on.

840
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:57,294
You got to be kidding me.

841
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,537
Was this your
whacked-out father's idea?

842
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,858
Wendy.

843
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:04,462
He is a changed individual.

844
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:06,344
You don't even believe that.

845
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:09,067
You'd be surprised
at my current suite of beliefs.

846
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:12,231
One of them being that there's
value in the sanctity of family.

847
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:13,472
Mm. Sometimes.

848
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:15,314
I'll lower my guns.

849
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:18,237
Have the atro lifted.

850
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:23,243
You want to buy
an apartment... done.

851
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:25,005
What would be expected?

852
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:31,212
Just that the kids get
to know their new relatives...

853
00:42:31,236 --> 00:42:34,575
Oh, and, uh,

854
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,618
that you be there too.

855
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:00,924
<i>Where are we at?
I've been texting.</i>

856
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,487
Oh. It's off.

857
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,289
<i>My phone.
I-I turned it.</i>

858
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:08,092
Are you... Drunk?

859
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:10,695
<i>- I was...
- I can smell it.</i>

860
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,497
What do retired admirals drink?

861
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:14,499
Anything they want,
and a lot of it.

862
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:16,501
Did you get into divestment?

863
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:18,063
Yeah. It's done.

864
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:19,785
<i>It is?
He agreed?</i>

865
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,146
<i>He did...
but how?</i>

866
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,509
Because
this candy ass's specialty

867
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,907
is making admirals
crumble like rock candy.

868
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:30,517
But an idea occurred
on the way over.

869
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,479
Everything that
they're giving up.

870
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:33,960
We can take the same position

871
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:36,323
that we are unrolling
the endowment from...

872
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,125
Get the oil companies
to make a deal

873
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,047
to stave off the publicity
bloodletting.

874
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:42,209
That will come
from the divestment.

875
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,133
And we can do it without
implicating the university.

876
00:43:45,157 --> 00:43:47,896
We just have to run the trade
through the main house.

877
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,859
It goes against the spirit
of the entire thing.

878
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:52,981
By the rules of engagement
in our business

879
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,103
it's the right move.

880
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:55,784
<i>It's a no.
It's not who we are.</i>

881
00:43:55,808 --> 00:43:57,943
Or who I want to be.

882
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:14,845
You know
that line from Hamilton...

883
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,247
You know I know 'em all...

884
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:18,089
"he takes and he takes
and he takes."

885
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,410
It's about Alexander.

886
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:22,454
But it might as well be
about our governor.

887
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:24,055
Oh no.

888
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,258
<i>- The money?
- Yeah.</i>

889
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:28,180
Best practices for years
have been

890
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:30,382
that the ag gets to use
settlement money.

891
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:33,065
But the governor is claiming
the funds I've gathered.

892
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:36,028
So I'm to what, uh,

893
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:39,833
propose a duel at dawn
across the river in Jersey?

894
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,875
<i>Can you?
Would that I could.</i>

895
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:43,597
Is there a workaround?

896
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:47,521
I drilled down.

897
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:51,565
Before the funds land with us,
and so can be taken from us,

898
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,887
we can designate them.

899
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:54,329
But I want 'em!

900
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:57,452
We can designate them
to a public good.

901
00:44:57,476 --> 00:45:00,856
Like a law school clinic,
earmarked to do certain work,

902
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,816
run by a certain person.

903
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:10,306
Yale law.

904
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,627
I get to go home again.

905
00:45:11,651 --> 00:45:13,069
And make it work for us.

906
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:15,512
You do.

907
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:19,156
Nice job, sacker.

908
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,839
When I cut a joint,
ya know?

909
00:45:21,863 --> 00:45:23,921
Ohh. I do.

910
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:37,416
<i>Sir?
Excuse me!</i>

911
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,219
We know you've been siphoning
from athletic donations

912
00:45:40,243 --> 00:45:42,541
to give scholarships
to Syrian refugees.

913
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:44,704
Your board's
not gonna like that...

914
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:47,347
<i>Yeah. And I'm certain
the authorities won't either.</i>

915
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,549
<i>Is this your plan?
To blackmail me?</i>

916
00:45:49,573 --> 00:45:52,552
<i>Blackmail? Nah.
The word is expose.</i>

917
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:54,154
Expose what?

918
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,276
I'm helping smart kids
and their families...

919
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,678
People with next to nothing...

920
00:45:57,702 --> 00:45:59,280
Make it in this world.

921
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:01,602
And I think you'll find
a school community here

922
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,004
that supports that.

923
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,527
Mm. Sounds noble,
<i>but will they, really?</i>

924
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:08,049
You clearly underestimate

925
00:46:08,073 --> 00:46:10,011
the empathy
of the Skinner family.

926
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:14,256
These are your so-called
"scholarship recipients..."

927
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,828
But what it really looks like
is cheap labor.

928
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,150
<i>Yeah. They...
They have no accommodations</i>

929
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:29,793
when they get here,
so I take them in.

930
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:33,477
<i>They... help around the house.
That's it.</i>

931
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:37,442
Unpaid illegal immigrants
living in your house.

932
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:39,484
That's not a very good look,
headmaster.

933
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,966
<i>Well. I don't care
what it looks like.</i>

934
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,488
I'm helping these people.

935
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,210
<i>Well. It looks like
'these people'</i>

936
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,732
are working for you.

937
00:46:46,756 --> 00:46:48,293
And they aren't getting
paid for it, are they?

938
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:49,575
Don't they call that
white slavery?

939
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,738
I think they just call it
slavery...

940
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:55,581
This isn't right.

941
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,184
Are you really
going to destroy me...

942
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,307
Tarnish this
historic institution

943
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,549
that's helped thousands
of young men and women

944
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:03,830
and those poor refugees...

945
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,672
To keep your son
from being expelled?

946
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:07,514
Bet your ass I am.

947
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:08,836
In fact I have.

948
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,478
Isn't that what I just did,
wags?

949
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:11,439
Yeah. I saw you do it.

950
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,361
<i>Like three seconds ago.</i>
Hmm.

951
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:15,083
<i>So. You are going to clear
my son, gordie,</i>

952
00:47:15,107 --> 00:47:16,604
of any wrongdoing.

953
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,487
<i>But that's not it.
Oh. We're not finished.</i>

954
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:20,208
Not by a long shot.

955
00:47:20,232 --> 00:47:22,811
<i>'Cause you embarrassed him...
Dragged him in here,</i>

956
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:24,213
held him out
in front of the school

957
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:25,534
like a common criminal.

958
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:27,536
You dinged his reputation.

959
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:33,499
So now you are going to give me
the chance to fix that, too.

962
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,238
Your headmaster was kind enough
to cede me the mic

963
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:48,840
for this morning's lesson,

964
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:50,762
and I'm here to give you
a little bit

965
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:53,805
about what this school
has been holding back from you...

966
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,610
The goddamn truth about Darwin,
scarcity

967
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:01,694
and the world
you actually live in.

968
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:04,377
It's not the warm,
swaddled place

969
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:07,100
your headmaster and your parents
have told you about.

970
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:09,903
It's populated by people like me.

971
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:14,308
Who will tear you apart.

972
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:16,790
Nature didn't select me.

973
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:20,831
I selected myself
by harnessing my nature.

974
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:27,358
My son wasn't pulling a prank.

975
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:31,446
He was trying to earn.

976
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,489
And if he broke
the school's code,

977
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,571
it's because the code is wrong.

978
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:37,213
Asked him to go against the DNA

979
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:39,696
which is telling each of you
to be greedy,

980
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,377
yes, be hungry.

981
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:43,620
Subjugate and conquer.

982
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:47,945
'Cause that's who we are.

983
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,188
That's what we are.

984
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:53,911
Capitalism harnesses that

985
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:57,075
better than any other
economic model on earth.

986
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,759
Everything we have
is because of capitalism.

987
00:49:00,783 --> 00:49:04,683
'Cause someone had an incentive
to get up off his ass,

988
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,726
to out-invent, to out-earn, yes,

989
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,249
and to subjugate others.

990
00:49:10,273 --> 00:49:13,172
Less capable,
less intelligent,

991
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:16,256
Less ambitious,
less lucky...

992
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,140
To make those capitalistic
dreams come true.

993
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:23,499
And you know what I'm talking
about, headmaster kessel.

994
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:27,468
It's the dirty secret
you may not want to hear...

995
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:30,187
But you fucking love
the result.

996
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:33,835
As will you soon enough.

Your aunt.

She's so small,
how can she be my aunt?

1012
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,041
Well.

1013
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:54,003
The world can be
a funny place, sweetie.

1014
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:56,085
- It can...
- The world is

1015
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,007
whatever the hell you make it.

1016
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:02,092
Say hi. Hi.

1017
00:51:03,357 --> 00:51:05,135
She's adorable...

1018
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:11,502
You want your papa?

1019
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:19,511
Check is in the mail,
Sonny.

1020
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,032
Mm.

1021
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:24,116
Check is in the mail.

1022
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:28,881
Say hi. Hi.

1023
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,690
Sir. Thank you.

1024
00:51:36,714 --> 00:51:38,011
- My pleasure.
- Wags, great.

1025
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:40,173
<i>Thanks, gentlemen.
I'll show you downstairs.</i>

1026
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,495
Please.

1027
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:49,223
Was that...?

1028
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,586
Dell lambert
from argyra petroleum...

1029
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,947
Indeed it was.

1030
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:54,309
- And...
- Yep,

1031
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,551
cliff Slade from
charter offshore oil.

1032
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,033
We just assumed big positions

1033
00:51:58,057 --> 00:52:00,195
and gave them a nice haircut
while doing it.

1034
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,838
- Baller move.
- A kick-save and a beaut'...

1035
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,294
- You know who that is?
- Yes. I do.

1036
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:18,575
Who were they?

1037
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,937
Opportunity.

1038
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:22,019
The CEOs of
the fucking oil companies

1039
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:24,422
we just divested
lawrenceburg's endowment from.

1040
00:52:24,446 --> 00:52:26,104
Axe took on the positions?

1041
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:27,545
Mm. With a back deal

1042
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:29,427
that will pay off handsomely,
no doubt.

1043
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:31,586
Sick score...

1044
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:34,793
No one in here seems happy.

1045
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:36,951
How come no one's happy?

1046
00:52:38,581 --> 00:52:40,039
I know it was your idea.

1047
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,638
But I know you didn't
take it to him.

1048
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,046
Don't worry,
I'm not firing you...

1049
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,928
<i>Fire me? I quit.
Sara...</i>

1050
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:50,290
That should have been our score
and you know it.

1051
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:52,973
<i>But it's...
Not the right play.</i>

1052
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:55,216
Not right?

1053
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,619
We're at work,
not a fucking climate rally.

1054
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,662
You are only halfway in on this.

1055
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:02,464
And you know
where that leaves you?

1056
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:04,622
Vietnam.

1057
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:13,516
George Wagner. My son.

1058
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,758
The first and proudest issue
of my loins...

1059
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:17,120
Is on his way up.

1060
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:18,841
I hope he'll be
working here soon.

1061
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:21,360
<i>Treat him like everyone else...
But not really.</i>

1062
00:53:24,552 --> 00:53:26,806
Georgie boy!

1063
00:53:28,276 --> 00:53:29,533
Hello, dad.

1064
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,495
It's good to see you.

1065
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,020
Can't wait to tell you
the news...

1066
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,342
The good news.

1067
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:40,781
What is this?

1068
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:44,149
It's everything.

1069
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,352
<i>It's the whole world.
Beyond.</i>

1070
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,274
Dad, I've made
my personal relationship

1071
00:53:48,298 --> 00:53:49,635
with Jesus Christ.

1072
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,278
And I'm here to share him
with you.

1073
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:12,180
So...

1074
00:54:12,204 --> 00:54:13,822
I don't want the gig.

1075
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:15,584
Like I told your guy there...

1076
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:18,467
He said to wait and tell you.

1077
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:20,149
It's not about my work, man.

1078
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,311
It's about you and prince.

1079
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:24,834
I don't need to be part of
some pissing contest.

1080
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,276
There's always a fight
over something of value.

1081
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,078
Look, you think
I really don't know

1082
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:31,001
what makes your stuff so good?

1083
00:54:31,025 --> 00:54:33,523
No, I-I heard what you said.

1084
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:36,567
And you wanted it before
prince even got there, so...

1085
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:39,009
But I never painted
on commission before

1086
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:41,052
and I don't plan on
starting now.

1087
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:42,934
Maybe that works
with your stock boys.

1088
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,216
But I'm a painter.

1089
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,058
I have stock guys.

1090
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:48,620
I want Michelangelo.

1091
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:50,822
Who painted on
commission, by the way.

1092
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:52,544
<i>Yeah. I know.
The medicis.</i>

1093
00:54:52,568 --> 00:54:55,347
Do we like the sistine chapel
any less

1094
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:57,109
because they paid him
to paint it?

1095
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,911
No. And Mozart?

1096
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:02,795
Did his best work
for bags of gold.

1097
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:06,279
Mozart died penniless,
at his piano.

1098
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:11,004
<i>Okay. First he enjoyed
some nipples of Venus.</i>

1099
00:55:11,028 --> 00:55:14,444
And we're still talking
about him 250 years later.

1100
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:19,374
I'm not asking for your soul.

1101
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:21,816
Just your next eight paintings.

1102
00:55:29,248 --> 00:55:32,228
You know, the place does
get good light during the day.

1103
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:35,431
Sure does.

1104
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:38,470
<i>Come on, let's sit.
Keep talking.</i>

1105
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:44,481
Anthony said
to tell you he's sorry...

1106
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:46,684
It's not going to be like
in the restaurant...

1107
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,566
Yeah,
the purist made it clear.

1108
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:52,049
But honestly,
it looks pretty damn solid.

1109
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:53,771
Yeah. Sure does.

1110
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:56,534
<i>Thanks, chef Ryan.
You bet.</i>

1111
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:59,017
So, Anthony,
my new pizza guy,

1112
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,099
<i>he's a lot like you...
A true artist.</i>

1113
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:04,103
All the talent in the world,
but still he isn't sure.

1114
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,426
He's afraid of coming up short,
because he knows perfection.

1115
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,109
But, if you stick around,
what you'll see is:

1116
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,431
I know greatness.

1117
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:12,952
And that's what this is.

1118
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:14,834
<i>Take a bite.
Tell me I'm wrong.</i>

1119
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:23,644
Mmm.

1120
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:25,967
Mmm. Wow.

1121
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:28,369
Fuck.

1122
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:29,611
That's amazing.

1123
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:31,212
You are not wrong.

1124
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:33,535
That's what you'll learn
rolling with me.

1125
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:34,976
I'm never wrong...

1126
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,618
Almost never...

1127
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,900
Really never.

1128
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:40,743
Dig in.

1129
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,225
To all of it.

1130
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:44,987
You're with me now.

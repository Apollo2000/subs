1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,666
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,124
Rhoades' misconduct is
being investigated.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,833
I have nothing to hide. You'll
receive full cooperation.

4
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,290
With it, without it, I'll
find out what's true.

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,457
Know that.

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,124
You broke into my computer,

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,999
opened my files, and
read my session notes.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,624
You stole the
evidence you needed.

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,457
I thought I wanted to
bring you on full time,

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,124
but now that I know
I can trust you,

11
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,416
I'm certain I do.

12
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,207
I'm going to war with
Krakow and Guangdong,

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,749
and I need boots on the ground.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,082
I want to crush this fuck.

15
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,082
That glass... It's
not a barrier.

16
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,208
It's an asset. It's
what makes you good.

17
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,707
You see things differently.

18
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,083
That's an edge.

19
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:49,083
The Attorney General's called
me down to Washington.

20
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,332
She's gonna fire me.

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,208
Take out an enemy, a
big, hard-to-kill one.

22
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,249
It's tough to fire you then.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,416
I need to know how to beat him.

24
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,416
Will you help me?

25
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,040
You have to be
prepared to do things

26
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,040
that are entirely
outside the bounds

27
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,875
of conventional morality.

28
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,209
♪ Ominous music plays ♪

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,541
You know, the first time
I ever went to a game,

30
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,208
I was in your box.

31
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,041
So, you didn't grow
up with football?

32
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:35,959
Oh, I did, but it was on a
24-inch Trinitron knock-off.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,124
TV's great, but you
really miss out

34
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,541
on being part of
something very special.

35
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,416
Yeah, you do...

36
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,290
which is why I've been thinking

37
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,666
about watching a few
more games in person.

38
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,958
Bobby, I don't know where
you get your intel,

39
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,165
but it's accurate.

40
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,166
So that franchise
is on the block.

41
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,749
It's going to be announced
in the next couple of days.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,208
Well, when I become
an approved bidder,

43
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,541
I hope I can count
on your support.

44
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,124
Well, you can.

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,707
But the hoops you have
to crawl through...

46
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,833
They don't give a shit

47
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,165
how many zeros are in
your bank account.

48
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,083
I understand.

49
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,707
Just trying to
figure out where...

50
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,041
Where my seat's gonna be.

51
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,124
They're not gonna be here

52
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,166
'cause my team's not
for sale, Bobby.

53
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,167
Right.

54
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,165
And how are the
children handling it

55
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,499
on the nights you
actually switch?

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,917
- Fine.
- Not very well.

57
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,166
Kevin is still on about
that vows thing.

58
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,999
He brought that up again?

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,249
Yeah. Not directly,
but, uh, yeah.

60
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,707
Right after we split, uh,
in a moment of anger,

61
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,374
Kevin turned to me
and he said, uh,

62
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,082
"I thought 'vow'
meant 'promise.'"

63
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,208
We started him in
therapy the next week

64
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,332
and started coming here.

65
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,958
Yeah, well, anyway, he
crawled in my bed last night

66
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,582
and asked me to
make vows with him.

67
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,457
Did he have something
specific in mind?

68
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,833
It was a list.

69
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:08,582
First he asked me to vow...

70
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,208
never to leave him.

71
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,541
And then he wanted me to vow

72
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:18,166
to get you and me back together.

73
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,042
What did you say?

74
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,124
I said that Mommy and Daddy were
trying to work things out...

75
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,290
and that, while I can't
promise that they will,

76
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,707
I can promise that we will
always love him and Eva,

77
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,209
that we will always
put them first.

78
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,083
And that's my most sacred vow.

79
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,999
He's a really good dad.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,084
Tell him that.

81
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:54,166
Chuck, you're a really good dad.

82
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,040
You're a really good mom.

83
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,290
Not every couple can do that,

84
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,833
recognize each other in the
midst of anger and uncertainty.

85
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,916
That's intimacy.

86
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:09,416
Let's see if we can
keep that going.

87
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,041
- What else is on your minds?
- -Money.

88
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,624
The Yale Club is kind of steep.

89
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,207
And we had talked about sharing
a satellite apartment.

90
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,707
I'm fine at my sister's,

91
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,500
but I think it makes sense for
you to get your own place.

92
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,417
Uh-huh.

93
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,124
Really, it's hard not to notice

94
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,582
the shrink sorority
eye-lock thing.

95
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,083
Chuck, this is not a conspiracy.

96
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,041
I don't want to speak for Wendy.

97
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,124
I'll just say it
felt like you had

98
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,291
an emotional response
that you didn't share.

99
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,041
Signing a lease...

100
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,290
is a commitment.

101
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,916
Do you mean financial?
Do you mean...

102
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,582
I had hoped that this separation

103
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,249
wouldn't be permanent
enough that it would entail

104
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,666
references and credit checks

105
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,624
and outlaying security
payments, but it'll be fine.

106
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,374
You know, I guess I'll
just, uh, sell something.

107
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,417
Chuck, you've got to
accept the new reality.

108
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,165
This runs deep,

109
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,750
really fucking deep.

110
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,290
I understand.

111
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,916
And that's intimacy, too.

112
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,125
It's just harder to hear.

113
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,208
- You been on Twitter today?
- Assume I haven't.

114
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,916
Krakow tweeted,
"Looking forward"

115
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,082
to kicking major Axe
Capital ass again

116
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,999
"in Hold 'em tomorrow
night, ♫alphacup."

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,874
It's fucking trending
in New York.

118
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,207
Don't respond.

119
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,916
If he wants to pop off online

120
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,916
while using the squatty
potty, let him.

121
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,916
We'll do our talking
at the table.

122
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,999
His team has outlasted ours four
out of the last five years.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,207
He's a good fucking card player...
great, even.

124
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,332
Phil Laak calls Krakow a wizard,

125
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,082
says he can GTO-grind
a man into a nub.

126
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,958
How'd you like to
go work for him?

127
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,125
No, thank you, sir.

128
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,374
Respectfully, delicately,

129
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,249
regretfully...

130
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,958
he's better than you.

131
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,332
I see that.

132
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,290
Head-to-head, he is better.

133
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,207
So, we don't play?

134
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,000
No. We reduce his edge.

135
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,124
Is this, um...

136
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,124
Is this last night's
or this morning's?

137
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,208
What if I don't want to answer?

138
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,290
Well, maybe shower before
heading to the office.

139
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,416
I already did.

140
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, I'm thinking maybe
you hit it again.

141
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
Heard Tisch will
support your bid.

142
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,457
Seems likely.

143
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,833
I wish I could be in there
negotiating for you.

144
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,374
We handled the M&A work for
the last two team sales.

145
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,999
Well, that's what Chuck
Rhoades will do to a man...

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,249
Rob him of his life's work.

147
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,707
He's a Stalinist...

148
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,499
Convict first, then
have the trial.

149
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,374
He hasn't even indicted anyone

150
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,582
at my firm or
subpoenaed documents,

151
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,041
just allowed the leak,
the insinuations,

152
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,041
the idea to fester in the minds

153
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,041
of the public that we're dirty.

154
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:11,124
As a tactician, I admire it.

155
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,791
As the target of it...

156
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,541
Old days when the
man with the badge

157
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,999
used it for his own purposes,

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,874
instead of to benefit
the township?

159
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,082
That man ended up on the
wrong end of a noose...

160
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,416
Yeah.

161
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,124
But not before he got a fuck

162
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,999
of a lot of his own
hanging done first.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,208
Well, then, we better make sure

164
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,708
we burn the gallows down
before he gets to you.

165
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,332
- Is he prepared?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,999
He's ready to do
whatever he has to.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,916
I look forward to
meeting him, then.

168
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,999
Anything come from the
surveillance yet?

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,041
Rhoades is not exploitable
at this moment.

170
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,791
- No openings.
- Find one.

171
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:01,124
Hall, I hear his
name in my sleep

172
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,958
and underneath every
thought I have.

173
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,165
It's always running.

174
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,999
It's like the fucking
Lord's Prayer.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,250
Find one.

176
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,999
Is there some kind of a
prop bet going on here?

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,207
First one to mention
Lawrence Boyd

178
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,332
has to buy everyone
else cotton candy?

179
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,416
There's just nothing
to say, boss.

180
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,833
Really?

181
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,999
Nothing that isn't
speculative at best.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,083
It's crunch time,

183
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,166
and Connerty's pulling
a Scottie Pippen.

184
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,999
What, do you got a
migraine, Bryan?

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,582
Come on, Chuck.
That's not fair...

186
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,124
to Pippen.

187
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,999
The man had just suffered
a personal loss.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,165
I don't give a shit.
Lonnie, how about you?

189
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,916
I started a deep dive into
their inversion practices.

190
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,958
They keep so much cash
stashed overseas,

191
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,416
I figured there's got to be
some tax irregularities.

192
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,417
And were there?

193
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,624
So, there's nothing on Boyd and
company churning accounts?

194
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,707
On, uh, advising retirees
against their interests

195
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,165
or subprime mortgages
making a comeback?

196
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,707
How about hookers for
foreign clients?

197
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,416
You're telling me there is
nothing of which to speak?

198
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,333
Not as of yet.

199
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,582
I found something.

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,084
Please.

201
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,374
A couple of months ago,

202
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,874
a flight attendant on
the Spartan-Ives jet

203
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,083
made a small trade
ahead of a merger,

204
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,165
turned a $24,000 profit.

205
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,416
She overheard something.

206
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,124
No benefit was exchanged.
There's no crime.

207
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,999
I know that. You know that.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,083
We went to law school.

209
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,165
She didn't.

210
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,208
Work this.

211
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,040
- Work it with her.
- Come on.

212
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,499
How many dots do you figure

213
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,082
between a flight attendant
and Lawrence Boyd?

214
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,291
You'll let me know.

215
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,042
Or maybe you won't.

216
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,041
Is there an implication in that?

217
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,082
Yeah.

218
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,708
There is.

219
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,833
What is the Alpha Cup?

220
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,833
Wall Street charity
poker tournament.

221
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,416
The winner gets
to donate the pot

222
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,166
to the charity of their choice.

223
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,707
It's like $15 million.

224
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,749
Oh.

225
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,666
Why are you asking
about the Alpha Cup?

226
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,457
Because Axe invited me to play

227
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,874
in the firm's other
seat along with him.

228
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,124
Oh, this is fucking bullshit!

229
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,167
Turn the fuck away.

230
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,167
That's my fucking seat.

231
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,083
I'm pretty sure it's
my fucking seat.

232
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,041
I paid for it.

233
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,165
I can award it to
whomever the fuck I want.

234
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,958
Axe, I've been your wingman
for the past three years.

235
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,124
I've been close to the
final table every time.

236
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,124
Yeah, which is another
way of saying

237
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,250
you missed the final table
three years running.

238
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,124
You know one of the things that
I really like about the NFL?

239
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,666
The cheerleaders?

240
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,874
Uh, yeah, yeah, when
I was 12, yeah.

241
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,958
But I'm all grown now, so I
was gonna say the contracts.

242
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,749
No other league gives
fewer guarantees.

243
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,416
You can sign for seven
years, $120 million.

244
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,707
Yet you shit the bed,

245
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,083
they cut you in the spring,

246
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:11,958
you're back knocking
on doors again.

247
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,124
So you're cutting me loose.

248
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,249
Well, I wouldn't say
it that way, but yes.

249
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,749
For that little...

250
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,834
Hey.

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,625
For Taylor?

252
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,457
Everything I measure myself by

253
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,083
has been called into question.

254
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,124
Todd.

255
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,250
This is for you...

256
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,541
by way of an apology

257
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,750
for putting you in
an awkward position.

258
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,999
Do I really look like I need

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,791
$5,000 worth of spa treatments?

260
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,958
You look like you
wouldn't give yourself

261
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,916
the gift of peace
of mind, so I did.

262
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,582
So you're my
personal Dalai Lama?

263
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,374
I did spend part of last summer
in the company of Rinpoche.

264
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,124
You know, I could actually
introduce you, if you want.

265
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,707
Why are you here?

266
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,290
I'm playing in the Alpha
Cup tomorrow night.

267
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,666
Ah.

268
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,791
It's that time of year.

269
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:18,707
It is, and I'd like you
to come, as my coach.

270
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,666
I'll pay you very
well for your time.

271
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,166
No. We've done
this dance before.

272
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,999
You're gonna want
insight into Axe or...

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,874
There are lots of villains
at the tournament tomorrow.

274
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,707
Axe is only one.

275
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,249
Look, I want to
perform at my best.

276
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,999
And like you said, it's scary
when you feel the pressure.

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,333
I can admit that.

278
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,833
I'm reluctant.

279
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,999
I am offering you a challenge

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,124
and a chance to redefine
yourself in the industry...

281
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,374
as independent,

282
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,040
separate from Axe in every way.

283
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,916
All the top funds will
see you as a resource,

284
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,040
not as his accoutrement.

285
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,499
If you thought I were that,

286
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,707
you would never have
come through that door.

287
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,625
I know you're not,

288
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,124
because I'm me,

289
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,999
but we both know we don't
work in a rational business.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,124
You never hear "no," do you?

291
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,166
The word is said in my
vicinity on occasion,

292
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,916
but somehow it never
really lands on me.

293
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,958
It's clear to me
that if there were

294
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,999
any ethically
compromised behavior,

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,457
you weren't in the middle of it.

296
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,082
Glad as I am to be
seen, how do you know?

297
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,124
One... I have never come across

298
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,499
a more meticulous
written accounting

299
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,499
of a lawyer's conversations
and interactions than yours.

300
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,041
I... don't know how
you find the time.

301
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,290
Not much of a social life.

302
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,208
And two... you were the
only person in this office

303
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,166
who noticed and removed
a compromised employee.

304
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,207
You sat on the honor
committee at Princeton.

305
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,916
You are not in this to get
caught up in some scandal.

306
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,875
In other words, like
recognizes like.

307
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,124
But someone as...

308
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,499
keenly sensitive as you

309
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,083
must have noticed
the vibrations,

310
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,290
if not the actual sonic
boom, of impropriety.

311
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,207
I have not.

312
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,249
If any of that was
happening, I wasn't privy.

313
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,290
Uh-huh.

314
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you, Ms. Sacker.

315
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,249
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't play.

316
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,166
Is that the right word...
"can't"?

317
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,041
I'd prefer not to.

318
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,666
But you do know how?

319
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,249
What was your screen name?

320
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,624
Why do you assume I had one?

321
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,165
Your age, skill set,

322
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,749
the fact that everyone
here had one...

323
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,791
and that you had a lot
of nights in high school

324
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,041
when all the other
kids were either

325
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,000
stuck on their homework

326
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,040
or hanging out under
the bridge vaping.

327
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,374
ZachCody892.

328
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,290
I was 12 when I started
playing online.

329
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,457
I bet you were one of those
multi-table prodigies.

330
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,749
Sixteen at a time.

331
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,165
But then I quit poker.

332
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,083
Around the time you
went to college?

333
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,249
Black Friday?

334
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,249
I started playing live
for the first time

335
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,916
against classmates, grad
students, professors.

336
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,165
Oh, so you had to adjust
to the different speed,

337
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,041
different informational fields.

338
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,749
Yeah, I... I did fine live,

339
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,666
but then just moved
on to other things.

340
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,999
Moved on?

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,916
The whole "my dick is
bigger than yours" thing,

342
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,500
it wasn't for me.

343
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,749
You already knew...

344
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,999
about my entire player history.

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,290
That wasn't a guess.

346
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,624
Look...

347
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,332
I need to win this thing.

348
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,999
I put somebody on it
early this morning.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,999
I had a feeling,
pulled your résumé...

350
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,208
saw some game-theory
strengths...

351
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,166
looked into it a
little bit more.

352
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,249
How'd you clock that I knew?

353
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,124
The way you listened
to my answers,

354
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,290
the cant of your head.

355
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,749
You weren't receiving
new information.

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,457
Can I convince you...

357
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:12,208
to try one more time to play?

358
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,874
I'd prefer not to.

359
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,040
That kind of competition
made me sick.

360
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,874
It literally brought on
feelings of malaise.

361
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,209
Okay.

362
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,124
Okay.

363
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,041
So, Michaela, the
following facts

364
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,541
have come to light.

365
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,082
You have no history of
investing in securities,

366
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,332
but on April 8th,

367
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,083
you invested your
entire savings,

368
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:36,958
$117,000,

369
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,499
in Dassan International
Potash stock...

370
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,207
two days ahead of a merger
that caused shares to rise.

371
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,749
Now, are you some kind
of potash expert?

372
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,457
No.

373
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,207
Just a potash enthusiast?

374
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,082
What?

375
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,707
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,791
You're actually the
flight attendant

377
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,833
on the corporate jet of the
bank that financed the merger.

378
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,874
You're making it sound
like I did something...

379
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,749
She's making it sound like
I did something wrong.

380
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,208
I thought I was being
smart for a change.

381
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,791
You do know trading
on inside information

382
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,791
is a crime punishable by
fine and imprisonment?

383
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,249
We're talking about jail?

384
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,499
Um, I'm not sure I should
be sitting here alone.

385
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,542
Time to get Sacker out of there.

386
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,541
Well, if you feel that
you've done nothing wrong,

387
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,999
you should be...

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,374
I'm sorry to interrupt.

389
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,416
Uh, Ms. Sacker, you are needed in Mr.
Rhoades' office.

390
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,125
It's urgent.

391
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,167
I just wanted to...
buy an apartment.

392
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,250
Believe me, I get it.

393
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,582
Things are stacked
against us in this city.

394
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,208
Can you tell me this
will all be okay?

395
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,958
Michaela, I-I know you didn't
mean to do anything wrong.

396
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:20,124
My colleague... Ms. Sacker...

397
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,207
She's got a very brass-tacks
way of looking at this stuff.

398
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,999
She doesn't see other factors...

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,500
that good people can step wrong.

400
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,083
I think I know how to help you.

401
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:35,624
But won't she...

402
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,624
No. I'm her superior.

403
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,999
You give me your cooperation,

404
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,082
I will give you my protection.

405
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,958
And like Earl Anthony

406
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,165
bagging the 7-10 split.

407
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,999
You will?

408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,290
I will.

409
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,874
We have a real opportunity here.

410
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,207
If Boyd still feels
safe anywhere,

411
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,999
it's on his Falcon,
his flying cocoon.

412
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,999
And we need to be there when
he lets down his guard.

413
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,165
Sacker, Connerty's gonna
be the lead on this,

414
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,374
not because I don't
have confidence in you.

415
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,207
Bryan has a particular
set of skills,

416
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,208
skills acquired
over a long career,

417
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,541
skills that make him...

418
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,749
The object of a stewardess's
desperate lust.

419
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,791
Congratulations.

420
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,666
Where are you registered? I
hope you like cake servers.

421
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,209
I'll go get the SEC file.

422
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,707
Hey.

423
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, wow.

424
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,166
My God, the kids are
gonna love that.

425
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,583
Yeah.

426
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,749
Bach, good.

427
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,041
I need names, for a friend.

428
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,165
Yeah. I need a lawyer,
absolute killer,

429
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,290
the one you'd use if you
couldn't be your own.

430
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,708
I already did. Thanks.

431
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,749
Was that about Lawrence Boyd?

432
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,624
Yeah.

433
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,458
Why you going deep for him?

434
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,250
He asked.

435
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,041
A lot of people ask you

436
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,999
to use your influence and
resources every day.

437
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,124
You don't always say yes.

438
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,749
I don't like the idea
of Boyd going down.

439
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,042
It doesn't... Doesn't
sit right with me.

440
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,791
That's a good answer.

441
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,707
I believe it, but it's
not the whole answer.

442
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,624
You never give anyone
your playbook,

443
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,082
no matter how much you're
rooting for them to win.

444
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,874
It's like this...

445
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,416
Rhoades' attack on
Boyd is very public.

446
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,874
It's very loud.

447
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,833
If Rhoades wins,
he gets stronger.

448
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,708
If he loses, he's defanged.

449
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,416
Getting there.

450
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,707
And if we'd just met,

451
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,250
I would believe that that
was the whole thing.

452
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,332
The rest is strategy.

453
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,707
It's tactics.

454
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,416
If Boyd is convicted,
I'll be on the inside.

455
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,749
I'll understand what
works, what doesn't.

456
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,874
He's like a soldier.
We send him up front.

457
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,166
He's a scout.

458
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,874
He brings back intel, or
he becomes cannon fodder,

459
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,999
and that brings a
different kind of intel

460
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,833
about where we can step
and where we can't.

461
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:15,750
Lawrence Boyd isn't
exactly cannon fodder.

462
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,999
Babe...

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,874
everyone in the world,
apart from you, me,

464
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,458
and the kids is cannon fodder.

465
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,416
I'm sorry. I have to
deal with something.

466
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,416
See you upstairs in a minute?

467
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,750
Okay.

468
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,082
You're playing in the Alpha Cup.

469
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,124
It'll do you good... And me.

470
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,749
Consider it a part of those
168 hours you promised.

471
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,582
I can't promise results.

472
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,916
Competition doesn't
bring out my best.

473
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,958
Make a session with Dr. Gus.

474
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,290
Maybe he'll help you with
the competition piece.

475
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,125
Okay.

476
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,499
If Bryan lands this case,
I think Crim is his.

477
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,165
But that case could just
as easily break him.

478
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,457
Lonnie is taking the
surer, steadier route.

479
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,582
I was gonna ask which
way you were leaning,

480
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,291
but you seem almost
equally swayed.

481
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,791
Bryan has always expected it...

482
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,207
and worked for it

483
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,791
and Chuck like nothing else
in the world mattered.

484
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,916
And lately he's...

485
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,499
It feels like if this
goes the other way

486
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,999
and he gets passed over,

487
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,707
his entire purpose is
called into question.

488
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,416
Meanwhile, Lonnie
has been sent away,

489
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,833
called back, and never
let it derail him.

490
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:30,999
He's dogged.

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,041
And none of this
is being colored

492
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,041
by your personal
connection to Bryan?

493
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,416
In the past.

494
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:41,082
This is an advisory
conversation, not "Loveline."

495
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,166
Then you should think
about yourself

496
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,040
and the ways in which
you could contribute,

497
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,083
given more influence,
more control,

498
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,083
more access to decision making.

499
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,374
You're right.

500
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,082
Rhoades won't make
you head of Crim,

501
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,083
but his successor may.

502
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,582
Whoever gets it
will need a deputy.

503
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,958
That's true.

504
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,707
They say you can't ride two
horses with one behind,

505
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,332
but in today's business
world, it's a smart move,

506
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,208
as long as you're
up-front about it

507
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:08,666
so no one can accuse you

508
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,208
of being disloyal,
only intelligent.

509
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:14,041
Still pretty sharp
for an old dog.

510
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,791
Thanks, Dad.

511
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:18,374
So, you're saying that you
won most of the time,

512
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,833
but it made you sad to
beat your fellow students

513
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,666
in this... college game?

514
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,165
Yes.

515
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,041
But they're losers.

516
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,749
I have to tell you,

517
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,041
I've had 927 hours of therapy.

518
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:36,082
And that's supposed to make
me sit back on my heels?

519
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,707
Not at all.

520
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,958
It's supposed to give
you useful information

521
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,707
to make this session
more productive,

522
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,290
to save you from
using techniques

523
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,209
that I might have
already parried.

524
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,499
One... this isn't therapy.

525
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,207
Two... I've had more fucking
therapy than you have.

526
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,666
And three... Every
time you walk away

527
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,916
from doing what makes
you feel great,

528
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:02,374
even though it also
makes you feel sad...

529
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,083
something inside of you dies.

530
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,249
That's true.

531
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,209
Instead...

532
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,124
when you feel emotionally messy,

533
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,083
take yourself to where the
boundaries are clean.

534
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,791
It's effective.

535
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,458
It's why we've
developed sex workers.

536
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,457
Okay.

537
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,542
Thanks for your time.

538
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,000
You sure, Chuck?

539
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,249
Oh, I have to.

540
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,916
The Churchill World War II...
It's a hell of a set.

541
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,499
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm very happy to have it.

542
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,165
I'm sure I'll do
very well with it,

543
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,666
but I remember how long
you worked on this.

544
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,999
Well, maybe I can circle back

545
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,834
and grab them before
they're gone.

546
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,833
If somebody comes in,
I have to sell them.

547
00:25:56,834 --> 00:26:00,457
But, you know, a specialty
item like this, at this price,

548
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,249
they'll probably be sold at the
Antiquarian Fair in April,

549
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,791
so, if you do come back,

550
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:09,084
I'll give it to you at
the carrying cost, okay?

551
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:17,874
"Dear Monty, never give in,"

552
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:21,624
never give in,
never, never, never,

553
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:25,374
in nothing, great or small,

554
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,916
large or petty.

555
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,207
Never give in

556
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:33,417
except to convictions of
honor and good sense.

557
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:39,666
And never yield to force.

558
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:43,499
And never yield to the
apparently overwhelming might

559
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,084
"of the enemy."

560
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,166
From the day I passed the bar,

561
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,374
I have said those
words to myself

562
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,792
the first morning
of every trial.

563
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,166
You can still say the words.

564
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,333
Thank you, Harry.

565
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,166
This is tricky.

566
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,499
There's nowhere to hide
it in plain sight.

567
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,999
So, what do you suggest?

568
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,041
A band on the upper
thigh, I think.

569
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,333
Do it.

570
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,999
Yeah, so...

571
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,041
right leg, left leg?

572
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,499
You got a preference?

573
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,207
Um...

574
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,208
I'm sorry. This is really, uh...

575
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:02,042
Could you give me a second?

576
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,209
Actually, could you stay?

577
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,959
Yeah.

578
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,958
Sorry. I-I didn't
feel comfortable...

579
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,374
I understand.

580
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,416
Um...

581
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:24,083
do you know how to do this?

582
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:28,500
Some parts of the job
are pretty intuitive.

583
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,000
Um, I can take it from here.

584
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,375
How does it look?

585
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,125
Passable.

586
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,958
You ready to go?

587
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,959
Mm-hmm.

588
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,125

I thought, "What would Axe do?"

603
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,582
Maybe it was a little soon.

604
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,999
Well, you know, you've made

605
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,624
every one of these
pricks millions,

606
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,165
and yet they turn away.

you'll remind them.

Fuckin' A.

609
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,791
For now, I'm just taking a lap,

610
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,958
marking the hugs and
snubs in my big book,

611
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,749
then I'm heading out of town...
Jackson Hole.

612
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,040
Good. Clear your head.

613
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,707
We'll talk when you get back.

614
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,750
Hey, great to see you, buddy.

615
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,332
Always piggybacking on my moves.

616
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,874
Maybe when you embrace
someone, it's a move,

617
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,124
but when I do it,

618
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,791
it's an expression of
profound sentiment.

619
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,874
You know my performance
coach, right?

620
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,416
Glad you could pitch in.

621
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,166
He needs all the
help he can get.

622
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,624
I've won three of
those bad boys.

623
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,124
How about you? Zero, right?

624
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,041
'Cause to me it's
just a game, Todd.

625
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,541
You take everything
so seriously.

626
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,833
Mm.

627
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,166

welcome to the Alpha Cup

630
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,500
- We're about to begin.
- Time to battle.

631
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,041
Axe.

632
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,707
So, I see you went to go work

634
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,916
I work for myself.

I bet that's what his masseuse

themselves, too.

gonna be that guy.

Okay.

00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,332
and he will lead you
to the promised land.

648
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,332
Thank you.

649
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,166
So, the issue for me...

650
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:25,874
Never in threes about
any of this...

651
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,166

each other a long time.

652
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,707
This is why he's the best.

653
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,333
Okay, I'll leave you
two to get down to it.

654
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,999
All humans have stress points.

655
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,166
I'm a man who understands that.

656
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,958
And now it's my pleasure to say,

657
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,624

It's only Boyd on the flight.

Oh, my stack's a little
bigger than yours,

Yeah, let's do it.

You're not blinking.

698
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,083
Well, maybe that'll unnerve him.

699
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:51,707
Or maybe you'll blink like crazy
when you pick up a big hand.

One of these players is
going to go home rich.

The other player is
going to go home rich,

715
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,582
but pissed off.

716

Gentlemen, flip your
cards up, please.

717
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,708
Ooh, top two pair.

718
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,959
Unfortunately, I've
got these babies.

719
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,332
You went set-mining against me.

720
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,707
I knew if you'd
hit, I'd felt you

721
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,207
because you underestimate
my strength.

722
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,499
It's who you are.

723
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,624
Well-played, Todd.

You trying to jinx me now
that you got four outs left?

725

Let's see the river.

726
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,458
Yes!

727
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,541
That's what I'm talking about!

728
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,249
- Yeah!
- Ah!

729
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,209
You owe me half a stick.

730
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,542
So good.

731
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,416
We done betting?

732
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,499
The tournament's still going on.

733
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,042
How about...

734
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,999
we double the wager

735
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,707
based on my firm
outlasting yours?

736
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:40,249
Well, if it was Dollar Bill,
I'd take it in a heartbeat,

737
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,583
but he's over there with
his thumb up his ass.

738
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:48,209
Who do you have?

739
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,082
Really?

740
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,625
That?

741
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,124
And you want to double it?

742
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,833
All or nothing.

Ah.

748
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,749
I would normally volunteer
to be his bodyguard,

749
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,749
but there's only
so much of me...

750
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,291

751
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,416
It's a road bottle.

How do you get up

Forty-five minutes, and I
rebound like an undergrad.

Yeah, we did that

So, Dr. Gus told me a bit
about your conversation.

793
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,624
Therapy is supposed
to be confidential.

794
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,791
It's not therapy.

795
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:30,083
He seems to think that you don't
get something out of winning.

796
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:32,290
He wanted me to pull you
from this entire event.

797
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,833
You didn't listen.

798

Eh, he may not be
very good at his job.

799

You love winning.

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,208
I couldn't compete, so
they eliminated me,

813
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:14,582
and it filled me with
disdain, almost hate.

814
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:17,124
Hate is nature's most
perfect energy source.

815
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,749
It's endlessly renewable.

816
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,457
I don't want to lean
into that feeling.

817
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,666
You know the rider in
the bicycle movie who,

818
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,332
just when he has
victory in sight,

819
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,874
takes his hands off the bars

820
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,749
and just holds them
out like this,

821
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,874
taking in the sun, gliding,

822
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,666
letting all the other racers
whiz by him just because?

823
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,332
No, I don't. What
fucking movie is that?

824
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,083
I always want to be that biker.

825
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:43,332
Yeah, but you're not.

826
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,582
You and I don't get to glide.

827
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,624
We churn, and we don't get to
become friends with people

828
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,874
we play cards with,

829
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,457
but that's the sacrifice we make

830
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:54,499
for being able to
see what we see.

831
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,166
I know you believe that,

832
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,208
but I choose to take
a different lesson.

833
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,124
It's not a choice.

834
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,833
Now go back down to that table.

835
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,499
And if, when you see Krakow,

836
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,124
you think that maybe he
will become a friend,

837
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,916
then go ahead.

838
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:14,583
Take your hands off the bars
and let him ride on by.

839
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,124
Do you want to know a secret?

840
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,833
Your boss bet me a
million dollars

841
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,457
that you would outlast me.

842
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:38,082
So, you fuck up,

843
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,375
it's a million dollar mistake.

844
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,041
Good to know.

845
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,666
How do you think he's gonna feel

846
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,457
remembering that you
cost him a mill

847
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,083
every time he looks at you?

848
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,666
I mean, no pressure.

849
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,666
Don't let me get
under your skin.

850
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:57,041
You have no clue what
is under my skin,

851
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:59,666
and I am certain that a million
dollars in either direction,

852
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:02,874
to Mr. Axlerod or you, is
entirely insignificant.

853
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:07,249
And in the continuum, 10,000
years of human history,

854
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,874
this card game and
the Alpha Cup...

855
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,040
What does it mean?

856
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,874
By 2090, we'll all be gone,

857
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,041
every last one of us,

858
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:17,083
unless we've reached
the singularity,

859
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:20,042
and at that point,
will money matter?

860
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, I've seen "Cosmos," too.

861
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,417
♪ Low-key dramatic music plays ♪

862
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,249

863

I'm aware.

864
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,166

00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,834
Not loving the flop.

867
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,416
Seven hundred.

868

What do they have?

869
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,916
See bet. I'll call.

870
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,041
Well, we know he's
stubborn with a pair,

871
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:13,583
so either he's way ahead
or he's fucking nowhere.

872
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,874
Check.

873
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:21,707
One-point-seven million.

a stop-and-go...

876
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,624
or surrendering.

877
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,166
Call.

878
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,707
Check.

879
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,582
What do you think?

880
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:45,333
I think Taylor's ahead
and has to trust it.

881
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,165
Time.

882
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,207
Can I talk to you for a second?

883
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,708
Excuse me.

884
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:10,582
I'm not getting a
good read on it.

885
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,582
You have any... That's
not your issue.

886
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:13,958
Really?

887
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,040
It seems to me that it is

888
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,582
since that's what stands
between me and winning.

889
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:20,457
No. Your anger is what stands
between you and winning,

890
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,041
your inability to de-personalize
this competition,

891
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:24,083
and as a result...

892
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,416
My inability?

893
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,916
I didn't pay you to come
here and criticize me.

894
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,166
I just wanted...

895
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,249
You just wanted me to
knock Axe off his game.

896
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,124
And I came here anyway
knowing that because I...

897
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,499
Well, I guess some part
of me wanted that, too,

898
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,124
and I am going to work on that.

899
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,082
Consider it a job well done.

900
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,499
Now, if you'll excuse me,

901
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,166
I have to go back to the table

902
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,124
and put the sword into
Axe's little pet.

903
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,999
Hey, don't worry so
much, all right?

904
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,666
It's gonna be great. We'll
celebrate later tonight.

905
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,708
Will we?

906
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,124
Will we have something
to celebrate?

907
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,999
What?

908
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,499
I was about to tell you that,

909
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,582
in your confusion
about your opponent,

910
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,166
you've become easy to read.

911
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,457
Bullshit.

912
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,791
I've been watching that
thing the entire time.

913
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,499
That's why I came here... So
it wouldn't see me looking.

914
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,083
I know exactly what I'm doing.

915
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,041
This is no place for
the meek, cupcake.

916
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,417
All of it.

917
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,040
You don't have a king.

918
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,666
You'd have reraised preflop.

919
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,582
And you're never
moving in on a queen

920
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,124
here in case I have the king.

921
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:52,624
I think you're on a gut shot,
four-five or five-six.

922
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,374
I think you're
trying to bully me,

923
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,959
and a bully's devastated
when you stand up to him.

924
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,917
I'm sorry.

925
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,583
Call.

926
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:13,332
I have ten-high.

927
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,792
God damn it!

928
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,249
Ten-high hero call?!

929
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,209
You skinny fucking freak!

930
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,917

So, I was like, "Who
is this person"

938
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,040
who couldn't be named and
had to sneak onto the plane

"in the middle of the night?"

Corporate spouse hitchhiking
on a hop back home.

946
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,958
Right, but what isn't common

947
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:51,791
is that they hopped into the
slumber cabin together.

948
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:54,290
That's when I knew I had
to get my butt back here.

949
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,124
Got another girl to be on
standby for the return flight.

Not usable.

952
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,165
I thought the microphone
might be too far away,

953
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:14,707
so I took a little...

954
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,000
initiative.

955
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,374
You know, some of the tension...

956
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:36,833
Yeah? Will you help me?

957
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,749
I'm sure has been
building up, yeah.

958
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,167
I want to show you this
getup I have back here.

959
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,041
Does that help?

960
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,958
Usable quality.

961
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:07,707
Uh, we, uh... We can
work with this.

962
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:11,040
Michaela, you did great,
above and beyond.

963
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:14,125
So, I believe I'm off the hook?

964
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,208
You are. Come on.

965
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,124
It's over, then?

966
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,582
Your part's done,
but the case isn't.

967
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,458
You're not calling me. I get it.

968
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:40,082
I can't have anything brought
up in court that might look...

969
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:44,916
You know, I checked, and
my trade wasn't illegal,

970
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,666
but I went ahead and did
it for you, anyway.

971
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:50,250

00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,999
Hey, what?

974
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,707
I'm on with a guy from
Wimmershoff Capital Management.

975
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,332
They were there last night,
and they're all banged up.

976
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,042
You make house calls, right?

977
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,582
Starting at $500 a drip?

978
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,457
Starting at $1,000.

979
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,125
We're in business, Mo.

980
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,041
This is yours.

981
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:32,249
You won it.

982
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,208
I don't have room
for it on my desk.

983
00:52:34,209 --> 00:52:36,834
Besides, people keep coming
by to drink beer out of it.

984
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,165
Hmm.

985
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,165
Okay.

986
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:46,749
But your name is on it forever.

987
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,166
I know you don't want
me to have attachments,

988
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,290
things that get in the
way of winning...

989
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:52,374
but you do.

990
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,958
That woman on the rail...

991
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:56,083
Krakow's coach... You
kept looking at her.

992
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:58,582
I thought you were trying
to see if she was cheating,

993
00:52:58,583 --> 00:52:59,999
signaling him somehow.

994
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,083
She wasn't. I know.

995
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:03,749
Later I realized the whole thing

996
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,916
wasn't about you beating Krakow.

997
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,374
It was about breaking him

998
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,791
and having her watch
him go on tilt.

999
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:14,082
Breaking him was the
only way to beat him.

1000
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:16,084
Was it?

1001
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:26,583
Mr. McKinnon, I'm sorry
to put you through this.

1002
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,417
It's Shayleen.

1003
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,167
Turn it off.

1004
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,417
Turn it off!

1005
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,874
The moaning.

1006
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,374
Yeah. I know.

1007
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,916
I know.

1008
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,707
Would you like a drink, Mr.
McKinnon?

1009
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:10,499
No.

1010
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,290
You're strong.

1011
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,208
I'd need one.

1012
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,958
I want to make
this divorce hurt.

1013
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:21,041
I'll take the kids and
the fucking house.

1014
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,958
Hold on to that, Tom.

1015
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:26,707
Be hurt, sure.

1016
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,165
Be angry at Shayleen.

1017
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:31,999
She was weak. But
be angrier at Boyd.

1018
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,416
He's the responsible party here.

1019
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,708
Yeah. We were friends.

1020
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:41,249
Spent long weekends
at his compound.

1021
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,083
Lawrence Boyd can be
friend to no man.

1022
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:54,290
He's a venal beast
of the first order.

1023
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,416
He needs to demonstrate that
he is the alpha of the pack,

1024
00:54:57,417 --> 00:55:00,082
needs to dominate
you in his own mind

1025
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:02,999
by heaving his seed
into your bride.

1026
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,457
Jesus fuck.

1027
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,124
He didn't use a rubber?

1028
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,833
Of course you want to kill him.

1029
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:11,374
I know I would.

1030
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,416
Choke him till the
light goes out.

1031
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:16,541
Violation like that stirs
a man to savagery.

1032
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,457
You won't do it,
but you want to.

1033
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:19,833
Isn't that right?

1034
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,541
Yeah, I want to
fucking kill him.

1035
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:25,166
Yeah, but you can't. The law
dictates that you can't.

1036
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:28,041
And yet that doesn't mean
you have to let him win.

1037
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,374
Okay, so, how do I win here?

1038
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,165
Disgrace him.

1039
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:36,541
Humble him.

1040
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,124
Force him to his knees

1041
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:41,875
and fuck his metaphorical throat
until he swallows your seed.

1042
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,999
I'm in.

1043
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,083
Boyd's been rigging
Treasury bids.

1044
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:48,375
I'll get you whatever I can.

1045
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:55,000
Whatever it takes, I'm in.

1046
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:01,999
I talked to a friend of mine,
a lawyer for the League.

1047
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,332
He back-channeled and
got a yellow light.

1048
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,791
NFL thinks it would be
best for all involved

1049
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:08,999
if you didn't bid.

1050
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,040
Stated reason?

1051
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,457
Public perception,

1052
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,541
recent legal aspersion,
9/11 revelations.

1053
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:14,666
Fuck!

1054
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,249
But they appreciate
your interest.

1055
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,250
Oh, do they?

1056
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,874
You know, when they
like my number enough,

1057
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,165
they'll like me just fine.

1058
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:29,624
You know what we bid before.

1059
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,999
A hundred more than any
team has ever sold for.

1060
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,207
I'll bet a hundred over that

1061
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,082
and send it right to
the league office.

1062
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,083
Done.

1063
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:40,249
These are the books
you asked for.

1064
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,791
Oh, great. Thank you.

1065
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:44,416
These mattered to him a lot.

1066
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:46,208
Mr. "H" told me
to tell you that.

1067
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:47,416
Good.

1068
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,041
He instructed me to pay cash.

1069
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:50,874
There's no record
of who bought them.

1070
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,125
Thank you.

1071
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,416
This one's signed to Monty.

1072
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:57,707
General Montgomery?

1073
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:58,916
Yeah, that Monty.

1074
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,833
Well, you want them here?
At the house?

1075
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,167
No. Put them in storage.

1076
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,332
You know what?

1077
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,833
Find all the other signed
first editions for sale

1078
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,582
in the U.S. and in England...
Fuck it... everywhere.

1079
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,999
And buy them all, every
single last one of them.

1080
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,708
That'll be expensive.

1081
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:23,332
Well, then it's a good thing
I'm a rich fucking man.

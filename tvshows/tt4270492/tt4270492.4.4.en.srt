1
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:05,901
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:07,317
This is an object lesson.

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:09,150
People learn much better

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,234
when heightened emotions
accompany the instruction.

5
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:14,085
Epstein's vacated
New York Attorney General's seat

6
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,526
is there for me.

7
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:16,984
But the moment
I poke my head up,

8
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,192
Jack Foley will come after me.

9
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:20,794
I'd like you to meet
Douglas Mason. He's my father.

10
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:21,943
I thought you were ready.

11
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:24,401
To use your
"preferred pronouns..."

12
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,693
They're the ones used
by those who respect me.

13
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,693
Taylor knows I'm front-running
their positions.

14
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,943
Stop fucking with Taylor Mason.

15
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:36,192
"I am chomping at the bit to be
your next Attorney General"!

16
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,984
I need your assistance.
Starting with the primary.

17
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,317
You want me to help put you

18
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:41,984
in the State Attorney
General's office.

19
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,359
I do.

20
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,943
We're gonna be here
all fucking night.

21
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:13,192
If we don't get caught.

22
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:14,693
We're not gonna get caught.

23
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,418
Well, you sound pretty sure
for someone wearing

24
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,734
bright fucking yellow
like you're in Kill Bill.

25
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:23,401
I'm in camo, bro.

26
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,901
In this lot,
I'm fucking invisible.

27
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,234
Besides, we're getting
paid well enough...

28
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,567
Once, when I was a boy,

29
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:00,317
I lost a hundred bucks
I didn't have at a carny game.

30
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,801
Hard to feature that. But, uh,
before you really launch in...

31
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,609
I was very young.

32
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,460
I thought the game was
to knock down the pins.

33
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:08,567
The game though,
was to get people to pay

34
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,651
to try to knock down the pins.

35
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,734
Which, of course,
didn't go down.

36
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:17,734
And, uh, the guys playing
the game were carny workers.

37
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,835
And you were merely the...

38
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:19,943
Sucker.

39
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,943
Right. Yeah.

40
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,484
Today, your opponent thinks
an election is taking place.

41
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:28,150
But he doesn't know
how many of his voters

42
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,401
are already en route
to a free junket

43
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,901
with fresh Buffalo nickels
in their pockets.

44
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:35,109
Or that parents in his best
districts have been forced

45
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,275
to drive their kids to school

46
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,526
instead of getting down
to the voting booths

47
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,734
because the school buses
were all out of commission.

48
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:44,651
By day's end, it'll be
the lowest voter turnout

49
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:48,526
in primary history, which will
allow you to eke out a victory.

50
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,192
And then you will be
the presumptive

51
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,275
Attorney General of New York
goddamned State.

52
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,627
This is where you do some
version of the happy dance.

53
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,275
Ah.

54
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,067
And I know just the jig
I'd throw down on

55
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,234
if I thought that were so...

56
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,109
Flatfoot and buck,
like they do in the Ozarks.

57
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,234
But, uh, sadly, no matter
how few vote today,

58
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,693
I'm not gonna book a win.

59
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:20,609
The thing to remember,
Black Jack, is that the only

60
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:24,234
folks who win in a Mexican
standoff are the rest of us.

61
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,693
Because all the Mexicans die.

62
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:29,818
No. T-This situation
is different.

63
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,651
I don't see how.

64
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,651
You have your guns
trained on my boy,

65
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,693
my boy has his trained on you.

66
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,067
Anyone fires, everyone fires.

67
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,734
Death to one and all.

68
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,859
But if no one fires,

69
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,192
everyone survives.

70
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,943
And thrives.

71
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,943
Well, I may not see the
narrative just the way you do.

72
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,943
Because I may not be as worried

73
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,734
about dying in the gun fight
as you are.

74
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:00,943
As long as the boy
goes down, too.

75
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:06,818
Now is not the time to throw
away a lifetime of pragmatism.

76
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,526
Perhaps I'm doing
just the opposite

77
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,150
of throwing it away, Charles.

78
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,901
Perhaps I'm doing the most
pragmatic thing I know to do.

79
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:17,776
And that is: to make certain
this office stays pristine.

80
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,734
At whatever cost.

81
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:23,025
So have no doubt:

82
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,484
Your boy shall never be

83
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,984
the Attorney General
of this proud state...

84
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,192
Or of any of the lesser states
of our great nation.

85
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,943
Not on my watch.

86
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,693
And if that means he goes
public with some story

87
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:40,651
about metals and bridges and me,
so be it.

88
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,984
But he can't prosecute it
anymore.

89
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:47,943
And I hardly think that story
will capture the imagination

90
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,192
the same way his degenerate
sex life will.

91
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,567
By 5:00 p.m.
tomorrow afternoon

92
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,025
he declares he's
withdrawing from the primary,

93
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,359
or I go public.

94
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,275
What he has on you
is that strong?

95
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,317
If he exposes it,
my chances are flushed.

96
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,317
Could just be posturing,

97
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,776
knowing that you don't actually
want to trade blows.

98
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,627
Charles Rhoades Senior
would have sniffed that out.

99
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:14,609
No. No.

100
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,776
I may have to lay down to him,
get out of the race.

101
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:23,234
"Always outnumbered.
Always outgunned."

102
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,109
As Mosley said it best.

103
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,484
That's the state of play
for guys like us.

104
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,275
That's what we need to get us up
with the sun.

105
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,651
You can't quit.

106
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,734
All I have to do
is say the words.

107
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,609
But you won't.

108
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,484
You know...

109
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,609
and this isn't easy to say:

110
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:50,275
you were the most formidable
opponent I ever had.

111
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,818
'Cause you read me.

112
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,359
My chest was out, sure,

113
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,359
but inside it,
my heart was racing

114
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:58,002
when I knew that you were
coming for me.

115
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,901
I'll admit that cheers me.

116
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:04,859
Well, then take it in, man.
Let it fuel you. Then fight on.

117
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,275
You know I will do
everything humanly possible

118
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,234
right up until his deadline.

119
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,693
I'm a phone call away
if you need me.

120
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:22,526
Karl!

121
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,943
Find out why Foley is so willing
to engage in this brinkmanship.

122
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,377
There's something here
I'm not seeing.

123
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,109
Yup.

124
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,769
I know you rarely take the time
to look after yourself.

125
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:53,359
A latte, the way you like it,
and a ginger scone.

126
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,776
Animal-free, gluten-free.
Of course.

127
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,099
Are you heading back home soon?

128
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,526
I planned to, but...

129
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,275
Materials on what...
a proposed business?

130
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,901
Yes.
Lattice grid fins, you know?

131
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,651
Your white whale.

132
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:14,734
A mathematically based
enhancement.

133
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:18,109
Ups efficiency
to unheard of levels.

134
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,734
Perhaps you can take a look.

135
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,442
Or I could take you
through it...

136
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,609
I don't want to be in a position
to say "no" to you.

137
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,234
Hey, who says
you're going to, huh?

138
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,150
Wait'll you see the tech...

139
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:30,317
And I thought the extended visit
was about our relationship.

140
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:33,984
It was.
It is about us.

141
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:38,109
I could use a hand... a financial
hand... with my endeavor, is all.

142
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:40,984
But it's pretty special.

143
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,651
It really is this time.

144
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,943
Please, look at it.
When you can.

145
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,025
- You alright?
- Yes.

146
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:12,609
This thing is fun to drive.

147
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,234
Want to take it
for a lap or two?

148
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,567
I have to head to the airport.

149
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:18,025
So, you're leaving
out of Houston.

150
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,984
Yep. Are you sure you
don't want to join me?

151
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,651
You sound like
you want to join me.

152
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:26,067
We can run a friction test
up there.

153
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,776
Ah. In the name
of science.

154
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:30,067
Absolutely.

155
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,943
I've been wanting to do the
zero-gravity flight for years.

156
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,818
I have the whole aircraft
to myself. I paid 165K.

157
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,859
I would've paid
whatever they asked.

158
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:40,293
Thanks. But I'm gonna have to
leave the vomit comet to you...

159
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:41,609
Wimp.

160
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,025
That might work another time.

161
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:45,234
But I really can't.

162
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,484
I got to deliver a sickening
ride of my own today...

163
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,275
To the CEO
of Noon to Night stores...

164
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,526
I mean, how do you not
turn a fucking profit

165
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:56,526
with two thousand locations
selling soda and cigs?

166
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,669
You're sitting
with Evan Robards?

167
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:58,859
Nah. Chris Sacca first.

168
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,734
He's throwing his shares
behind me.

169
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:02,984
Then I "big stake" Robards
before he takes the stage

170
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,776
at the shareholder meeting.

171
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,359
He hits the bricks.
I leave with two board seats.

172
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,067
Have fun storming the castle.

173
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,484
Oh, I will.

174
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,192
Send me a pic
from the stratosphere.

175
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,067
So?

176
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,025
Nice ride. How much?

177
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,275
$132,000.

178
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,359
I'll take two.

179
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,609
What color do you want?

180
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,442
It's leaking, Axe.
It's leaking and it's gonna

181
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,210
blow and there's nothing
anyone can do about it...

182
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,693
Who the fuck is this?

183
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,359
Carter Calloway,
from Baton Rouge...

184
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:19,109
Okay. Slow down, breathe,
and tell me what's going on.

185
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:22,609
An LNG terminal at the port
has a perforation.

186
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,275
It wasn't detected
until it was too late

187
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,693
and when those vapors build up...

188
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,275
- Boom.
- Ka-boom.

189
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,150
The tank's gonna explode.

190
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,001
Then the shrapnel from that
will set off other tanks...

191
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,609
Are you sure about this?

192
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,317
It's science.
It's inevitable.

193
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,901
Gonna go up like a bullfrog
with an M-80 in its ass.

194
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,359
Who else knows about this?

195
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,943
No one. Yet.
But everyone's gonna.

196
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,001
I want your business, that's why
I called you. You said if...

197
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,752
Yeah. I know what I said.
We'll do business later.

198
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,693
First I need to know
which company.

199
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,359
I gave you all I got.
Whatever companies are involved

200
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,484
are gonna try to keep it quiet
as long as possible.

201
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,818
- But at some point...
- Fireball.

202
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,609
Yep. You've got
3, 4 hours at the most

203
00:10:58,693 --> 00:10:59,859
before the whole world knows.

204
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:02,359
Okay. Keep me posted
with whatever you hear.

205
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,359
We need to get out
of natural gas.

206
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:09,984
Which position?

207
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,526
All of 'em.

208
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,859
Natural gas's
going to take a dump.

209
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:17,359
Pipelines, shipping... all
its corollaries... everything

210
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:20,192
tied to it's gonna go along
for the downward spiral.

211
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:24,401
So get set, get everyone ready,
and get it done at the open.

212
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,693
Make all trades
through the dark pools

213
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,609
so it masks what we're doing.

214
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,317
That way, we'll preserve
our head start.

215
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,150
Which will not be a long one.

216
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:38,776
There's the opening bell.

217
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:47,859
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey. What's going on?

218
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:49,343
- Motherfucker!
- Computer's down...

219
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,943
Fuck. Where's IT!?

220
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,401
The Bloombergs are fine,

221
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:54,401
it's Axe Cap's network
that's been disabled.

222
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:56,377
- So our whole system is offline?
- I'm already on it.

223
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:57,818
I ran a reboot...

224
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,984
What the...?
Won't reboot...

225
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,192
We've, uh, we're being hacked.
Brute force attack.

226
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,442
Someone's gained remote access
to our servers...

227
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,109
The entire reason
for your existence

228
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,776
is to make sure that is not
the fucking case.

229
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,377
I thought since
the EternalBlue exploit,

230
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,984
we took protective
measures and backup.

231
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,901
This situation is
supposed to be impossible.

232
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,401
Sure. And a hummingbird

233
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,818
shouldn't be able to fly
sideways. But it does.

234
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,275
The more reliable rule
of the world is:

235
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:31,025
The aggressor always moves
forward the science first.

236
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:34,984
But we do have backup.
So go get it working. Now.

237
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:39,859
Foley is terminal.

238
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,609
Started in the liver.

239
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,484
The guy is so tough
he didn't see a doc

240
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,067
until it was everywhere.

241
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,234
Even when it's your enemies,
you hate to hear that.

242
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:49,567
How long?

243
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,901
Few weeks.

244
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,275
Which is why he's going
full suicide vest.

245
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:57,317
Goddamn, he's committed.

246
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,693
I hope I face my own end

247
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,168
with the same "fuck you"
to the world.

248
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,984
It's my fondest wish for you.

249
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,776
Some folks inside Justice are
saying he's been back channeling

250
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,943
negotiating immunity
for his heirs.

251
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:11,025
Gimme what you got
on Mr. Rhoades.

252
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,442
I always knew he was a pervert.

253
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,943
A profane man to his end.

254
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,502
Once that's out of the way,
he knows that even if I drop

255
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,651
what I have on him,
it won't splash onto his family.

256
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,776
They'll keep the wealth.
Oh, heavens.

257
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,275
The great man's final move.

258
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:47,734
There may really be no stopping
Foley at this point.

259
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,609
Blood in the water at Axe Cap.

260
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,651
Cook says they're under
some kind of cyberattack.

261
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,317
Ok.

262
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:05,669
Maybe there's a move here
for us.

263
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:06,943
I'm the one who sued for peace.

264
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,693
Yes. Do you believe
that offer was accepted?

265
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:11,526
- I don't.
- Might there be something

266
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:14,109
we could do to take advantage
of the situation there?

267
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,943
Something that wouldn't be
construed as warring,

268
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,776
merely opportunistic?

269
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,275
Yes. Have Mafee
call around.

270
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,319
See what Axe Cap was slinging
when the attack hit.

271
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,943
- Phone's down...
- Mine too.

272
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,234
- Fuck.
- Um, not to pile on,

273
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,960
but in the spirit of aggregating
all the information

274
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,818
- we currently have...
- Ben!

275
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,984
The direct links to the trading
desks are down too.

276
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,984
Motherfuck!

277
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:46,109
Okay, "here" is dead.
So we trade like we're not here.

278
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:47,984
Use EMSX on your mobile devices.

279
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,943
Do not sign onto the network,
use cellular.

280
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:52,109
I have my laptop.

281
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,442
Great. Same deal.

282
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,401
Stay off our network.

283
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,693
I've got a hotspot.

284
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,275
I'm up.

285
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,859
Attaway. Now we ride you
like Justify.

286
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,609
Okay. Sell fifty thousand shares
Con-Pipe, at the market.

287
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,776
Sell 100 thousand Southern Gulf
Petro at the market.

288
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,818
Go through the dark pool
algo... we can't have

289
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,776
anyone see what
we're offloading.

290
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,609
You're literally
breathing down my neck.

291
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:17,442
I can literally feel
h-hot breath...

292
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,234
Say "literally" again

293
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,359
and I will light you on fire
like a dragon of yore.

294
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,776
First trade is confirmed...

295
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,109
Second one is through.

296
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,401
Nice. Okay.
Now let's...

297
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:31,401
It froze.
I'll force quit and reboot...

298
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:32,943
Go to mobile apps...

299
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,693
My shit's locked up.

300
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,901
I'm jammed up like
I ate a pint of rice.

301
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,744
Yeah, this is a concerted
attack, so anything

302
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,877
that's mobile that's been on the
network the past couple of days

303
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,234
has probably been malwared.

304
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,192
Fix it!

305
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,526
This is Grigor.

306
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:04,901
He's the only one with the
financial and tactical resources

307
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:07,150
to take us totally off the grid.

308
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,359
Guess he wasn't so sanguine
as Taylor was

309
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,482
with us front-running 'em.

310
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,484
Guess not.

311
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,776
How should we go after him?

312
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,859
We can't. Not yet.

313
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:17,669
First, we're gonna hold
the fucking line here

314
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,109
and pare our losses.

315
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:21,859
Protect our book.
Use resources of our own.

316
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:24,025
What are those, exactly?

317
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,526
At the moment,
that's you and me, pal.

318
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,901
Like Huey Lewis crooned...

319
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:40,943
We're going back in time.

320
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,859
Who's ready to do
some smilin' and dialin'?!

321
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,818
Heads up.

322
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,234
Pump up your Reebok Blacktops,

323
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,693
we've gotta do this
old school...

324
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:53,651
Fuck, I don't even have

325
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,126
any trading desk
phone numbers anymore.

326
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,651
Which of you tenderfoots

327
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,418
has the numbers for
the prime trading desks?

328
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,442
We all pretty much use
Bloomberg chat these days.

329
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,192
Okay.

330
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,984
Get the CEO of every prime
on the phone...

331
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,693
They're the only ones
we got numbers on.

332
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,526
I want them to walk down to
their fucking trading floors

333
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,943
and set up open lines with us.

334
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,609
Okay, everybody, here.

335
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:15,025
Use there burners,
call friends on the outside.

336
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,192
Have 'em get on social media
and get direct dials

337
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:22,234
from anyone who can make
a market on one of our names.

338
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,210
Do you think you're still gonna
get to your Chris Sacca

339
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:27,693
meeting on the
Noon to Night shares?

340
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,943
Hi. Where are you?

341
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,567
On my way to the airport.

342
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:41,317
Okay, look.

343
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:45,359
I hate to do this,
but I need a big fucking favor.

344
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,442
One that would have you
missing the vomit comet.

345
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,192
But if you do it for me,

346
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,627
I promise you that
I will re-book it.

347
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,150
And I'll even go with you.

348
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,734
What the fuck is that?

349
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:06,192
That, my young lass,
is a Filofax.

350
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,818
The vaunted little black book.

351
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:10,442
It contains the names of
some world class ladies...

352
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:12,818
Who are grandmothers now,
if not fucking dead...

353
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:16,567
And also the number,
written in un-hackable ink,

354
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,251
of an old broker friend
on the Toronto Exchange,

355
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,359
who can move some shares
nice and quiet for us...

356
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,734
Chris.

357
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,067
Hey, Rebecca.
I was just getting out of here.

358
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,067
I'm late. Well, Axe is.
I'm here in his stead.

359
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,609
Seriously?
I didn't send Mark Cuban.

360
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,442
Uh, no, you didn't.
But I'm here.

361
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,251
And I'm gonna work with you
on getting the CEO out.

362
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:41,067
Come here.

363
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,776
Those shares?
I dumped 'em.

364
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,275
So I can't back Axe.

365
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,025
That's not what you told him
you would do.

366
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,025
Look, either way, it's moot.

367
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,859
I no longer have a horse
in this race.

368
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:54,109
Honey, baby, sweetie...

369
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,359
It's your dear old Uncle Wags.

370
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:58,202
Haven't seen you
since that tray of kamikazes

371
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,984
we stared down after Sohn...

372
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,317
Jared! Yeah.

373
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:06,693
It's actually Bobby Axelrod.

374
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,067
Sure. You can call me "Axe"
if it makes you feel good.

375
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,693
I figured why be so impersonal
as to let a few keystrokes

376
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,943
run our life, why not
reach out and touch?

377
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,067
Don't be scared,
no need to be frightened.

378
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,818
No.
I'm giving you a call

379
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,251
because I heard good things
about you, Jared.

380
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,651
And I come bearing gifts.

381
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,651
Three hundred thousand
Drill Southern to go...

382
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:25,651
I know it's tough,

383
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:29,734
that is why I'm calling
the young master.

384
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,126
He's putting me up on a hundred,
to work two hundred behind it.

385
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,818
At the market...

386
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:35,275
I'm sitting on
half a mil Bay Pipeline

387
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,359
and I want to exit quick
and silent as Le Samourai...

388
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,234
It's an old French movie.
Nevermind...

389
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,502
And the next time I get a good
call, you're getting it too.

390
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:49,901
Go out and buy yourself
a longer boat come bonus time.

391
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:52,651
Forty-nine low. Stop me
out at forty-eight and a half.

392
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,901
Yeah, you and me at the Open.

393
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,651
My box on Arthur Ashe.

394
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,693
Mr. Simmons, sir.

395
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,651
Yeah, I'm calling you "Mister"
'cause this one might hurt.

396
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,025
How much can you take?
One fifty?

397
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,526
Put on your fucking hard hat
and I'll get your commish

398
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:11,192
at five cents a share
instead of three...

399
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,818
Two hundred and fifty's
a lot better.

400
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,275
Sure, sure.
You and me at the Open.

401
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,234
My box on Arthur Ashe.
You got it.

402
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:23,025
I too, come from the old school.

403
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,150
The old math school that is.

404
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:27,901
Allow me

405
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:31,901
to be our office Cartesian.

406
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,442
Got it from a guy at a gas desk.

407
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,192
Large block of natural gas
dumped through a dark pool,

408
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,984
but he knew who was behind it.

409
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,359
Lots of big prints like that
going up around town.

410
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:44,776
Feels like Axe Cap
trading out of the sector.

411
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,359
You know what?
Let's sell our positions...

412
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,734
Satisfy the buyers out there.
Depress the price.

413
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:51,859
Maybe kill it.

414
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:54,234
Love it, boss-people.

415
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:02,734
Why you stiff-arming me, Pete?

416
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:05,526
I know my guys have taken errors
from you when you've needed it.

417
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

418
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,109
I need you to clean me up
on Gulfport LNG,

419
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,901
what do you mean
you're not a buyer?

420
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:16,234
If you tell me you can't bid me,
this is the last time we speak.

421
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,818
How'd you just fucking
satisfy your need?

422
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,877
I'm running into would-be buyers
who already bought.

423
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:23,275
Yeah. Me too. Fuck.
Keep jamming.

424
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,234
I'll believe that you're
satisfied when I hear you moan

425
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,442
and shake like an old
washing machine...

426
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,734
And you will tell me
who finished you off.

427
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:33,484
We are sitting down
over a porterhouse

428
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:36,192
and discussing every
fucking detail of this.

429
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,317
You, me, at the Open.

430
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:44,401
Uh-huh. Oh, my box
on Arthur Ashe.

431
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,067
Good.

432
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,609
Someone's flooding the market
with our names.

433
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:52,359
- Taylor?
- Probably.

434
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,001
The Street is seeing that
our prints are going up,

435
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,567
and they're talking.

436
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,818
Taylor knows we're having
a panic yard sale.

437
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,901
And they're piling on.

438
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,192
Yeah, well, wouldn't we?

439
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,442
Why's everyone
sitting here dumbstruck

440
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:06,192
like they're at fricking
Cirque du Soleil?

441
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:09,651
I'd like to help. But I've never
made a voice trade in my life.

442
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,526
Uh. None of us have.
We don't know how.

443
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,567
What about a big trade?
A sensitive one?

444
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:15,943
Those have to happen by phone.

445
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,442
Mafee did them.

446
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,901
Oh. When this is over, we are
having a fucking seminar.

447
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:23,275
Believe that.

448
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,818
Ever think you'd miss Mafee
this much?

449
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,442
I miss him like the case
of crabs I had freshman year.

450
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:30,651
Delightful.

451
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,567
Hey. Listen... we've
got to undercut Taylor.

452
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,234
Sweeten the deals
and up the pressure.

453
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,567
Find some fucking squirrels

454
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,401
who've been dying
to get in our pants.

455
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,043
We're already shoving it down
people's throats out there,

456
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,401
what do we do now?

457
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:44,567
Shove harder.

458
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,109
- How's it going?
- Breezy. You?

459
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,526
- Sacca's out.
- Out?

460
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,818
Apologies and all that.
So fucking forget him for now.

461
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,901
My sleeves are rolled up.
My chin's tucked.

462
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:00,401
Fists raised.
I'm ready to scrap.

463
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:02,609
I knew I liked you for a reason.

464
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,442
You're gonna kill a CEO.

465
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:05,943
Oh, you're damn right I am.

466
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:10,025
There it is,

467
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:13,275
Elysian Fields.

468
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,192
It's grandiose.

469
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:18,693
The name should invite dreams.

470
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:21,317
This development is my legacy.

471
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,067
Hell, it's your legacy too.

472
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,943
Generational wealth, Sonny,

473
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,776
beyond you,
beyond your kids even.

474
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:30,776
As long as certain expedited
approvals come through.

475
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:36,693
And I'm counting on you
for that.

476
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,609
One: today is primary day.

477
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:41,877
The last place I should be is
where I can't speak to voters.

478
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,943
Two: I can't speak
to voters anyway

479
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,901
because I have to quit the race.

480
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:48,901
Three: Even if I didn't have to
quit, this would be a disaster.

481
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:52,067
It's the worst possible moment
for me to lubricate a situation

482
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,275
for you and create
a possible scandal.

483
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,401
It hasn't always been convenient

484
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:58,693
for me to haul you out
by the ass

485
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:01,442
from whatever bear trap
you got into either, Sonny.

486
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:04,359
Well, as I said,

487
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,282
I couldn't be much help
even if I were willing.

488
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,901
Foley can't be moved.

489
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:10,776
- Everyone can be...
- He's got a cancer, Dad.

490
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,275
Moving through him
like a race car

491
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,025
on the Bonneville Salt Flats...

492
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:16,609
Fast and full steam ahead.

493
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:19,067
Ah, Jesus.

494
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:24,484
That buckles a man
at the knees. Even me.

495
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,776
And it buckles you, too.
On all counts.

496
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,401
Yeah.

497
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:31,609
So you can stay here

498
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:33,401
and keep looking
for your future out there.

499
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,984
I've got to go and face mine,

500
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,418
which starts at five o'clock
today, whether I like it or not.

501
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,109
What if you defy him anyway?

502
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:46,317
Let him say what he says.
Deny it.

503
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,192
Tough it the fuck out.

504
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:56,359
Even if I could weather the
public shaming, I'd lose anyway.

505
00:24:56,442 --> 00:24:58,567
How do I ask Wendy
to face that crap?

506
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:03,359
Well, if she's angry about it,

507
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,234
let her give you
a good smack later.

508
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,109
A win for everyone involved.

509
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:13,025
Well, I'm glad to see you've got
your legs under you again, Dad.

510
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:20,401
Dead soldier. Reload.

511
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:23,734
Gimme a "45."
Thank you, peach.

512
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:27,567
Listen, do this for me
and you'll have a fucking angel

513
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,859
on your shoulder
your whole career.

514
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:33,317
I'm a good friend
but a bad fucking enemy.

515
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,734
Solid choice, Kevin.

516
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:39,651
I need a freshie.
Book one-thirty TransCon Petro.

517
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:41,293
I took a little bit of a hit
at twenty-eight.

518
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:42,818
Wags, we don't have much time,

519
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,669
- news is breaking.
- People are hearing shit...

520
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,253
Port's in lockdown,
evacuation underway.

521
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,984
Eighty thousand shares offloaded
through my Canuck on the TSX.

522
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,651
Ice, ice, baby.

523
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,401
It's wrong.

524
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:00,734
Where's it wrong?

525
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,609
All of it.

526
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,234
All of it's wrong.
The whole thing.

527
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,859
Foley is going to come forth.
With what he knows about me.

528
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:34,275
About us.

529
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:39,401
The only way to stop him
is for me to bow out.

530
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,901
That's his demand.

531
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,150
Then I'm sorry that it's over.

532
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,651
Does it have to be?

533
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,359
I think so.

534
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:04,109
Well, what if I fight?

535
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:06,693
What if I take the humiliation.

536
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,317
Lean into it.
Proceed despite it.

537
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:13,484
Then you will lose and
we will be a laughing stock.

538
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,442
- Are you sure?
- Are you fucking insane?

539
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:18,651
Tell me why I am.

540
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,067
I'm sure of a few things,
first, the Overton Window...

541
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,109
That which is an acceptable part
of the public discourse.

542
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,526
This behavior... our behavior
is so far outside that window

543
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,526
it might as well be
on fucking Mars.

544
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,526
Yeah, but the window
is shifting.

545
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:38,049
And isn't it
our responsibility to...

546
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,526
You want it to have shifted.

547
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,442
Maybe it has.
But not that much.

548
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:47,526
And don't forget: part of you
wants the humiliation.

549
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,818
Needs it. But I don't.

550
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:53,526
I can't live with it.
I...

551
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,734
I won't live with it.

552
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:58,943
We cannot take the chance
that Foley is serious.

553
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,359
Oh, he's serious.

554
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:04,401
Then that's it, Chuck.

555
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,734
And that you can live with?

556
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:10,484
Me just capitulating?
In silence.

557
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,109
I can.
And so can you.

558
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,192
You have to.

559
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,234
Walk away.

560
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,734
I just want to scream, Wend.

561
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:26,192
At the situation or at me?

562
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,859
- Yes.
- I know.

563
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:31,442
And if you need to do that
to move on, then do it.

564
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,859
But then, sure as fuck,
move on...

565
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:38,776
Okay.

566
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:41,901
Alright. Okay. Okay.

567
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:47,025
It'll be okay.

568
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:50,526
We'll find the next
adventure together.

569
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:57,442
Be watching at 5 p.m. to
see me bend the hell over.

570
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:02,234
Hey, I've seen it before.

571
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,401
- I'm sorry...
- Evan, can I get a moment...

572
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:26,901
Rebecca.

573
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:28,460
You know, it's a shame
that branding thing

574
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:29,964
didn't work out
between our companies.

575
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:32,734
It's a bad time for me
right now though.

576
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,401
I'm about to do the soft shoe
for a room full

577
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,693
of fucking morons...

578
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,734
I mean my valued shareholders.

579
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,859
Well, I'm here on
behalf of a certain shareholder.

580
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:44,734
And believe me,
he's no fucking moron.

581
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:46,734
In fact, he holds eleven percent

582
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,210
of your company's
outstanding shares.

583
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,067
Eleven percent...
Bobby Axelrod?

584
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,526
Mm-hmm.

585
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,275
Fuck. Alright.
Just give us a minute...

586
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,484
Come on.
Let's go.

587
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:01,275
What does he want to tell me?

588
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,067
It's over.

589
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,859
Over?

590
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:08,109
Your time as CEO
of Noon to Night.

591
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:12,275
Yeah, I don't think so.

592
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,984
I believe I can rally my board

593
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,109
to give me another
few quarters...

594
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,085
No such thing as a "few more
quarters" in this world.

595
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,567
Not your board anymore either.

596
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,484
I'm here to make you
think again.

597
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,442
Uh, stock price is weak
despite buybacks.

598
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,150
Per store revenue's
in the shitter.

599
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:28,025
Brand awareness and support
are at all-time lows.

600
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,869
Did you sleep with
a junior VP out of Seattle

601
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:33,317
at the company retreat?

602
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,901
Hell if I know, but people
are about to start asking...

603
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,442
He wants to take it
to the press?

604
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:42,067
I'll go to war with Axelrod
any fucking time.

605
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,734
Guy's the Al Capone of
Wall Street for Christ's sake...

606
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,150
Mnh. You won't be
going with him.

607
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,317
You'll be going to war with me.

608
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:53,317
He'll sign his shares over and
I will use all my credibility,

609
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:57,442
all my connections, all those
women who buy all my products

610
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:59,901
to turn their fucking backs

611
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,317
on your company.

612
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,150
On you.

613
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:07,567
So what you need to be
asking yourself is:

614
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:11,317
what do you want in your go-bag?

615
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:15,359
I don't care
if you have to jam it

616
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,126
into your grandmother's
goddamned IRA account.

617
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,984
I. Need. You.

618
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:22,734
To. Take. It...

619
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:24,109
Take it.

620
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:27,150
Fucking take it!
Right fucking now!

621
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:30,442
Or suffer my wrath forever!

622
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:33,359
Fine.
Booked.

623
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,567
But Wags, listen,
you know I hate you now.

624
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,901
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

625
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,234
That's fucking that.

626
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:49,901
Every single institution on
or attendant to the Street

627
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:53,651
is gonna be dumping like a dray
horse on an all taco diet.

628
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:56,651
Yep. But it's gonna be
too late for them...

629
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:02,192
AAAAAAaaaand, it's over!

630
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:06,150
We got out of about 90 percent
of that toxic trash.

631
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,192
Yeah!

632
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,359
Whoo!

633
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:14,275
Whiskey!

634
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,442
If you don't want to live
in the "about" of it all,

635
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:20,025
I have specificados.

636
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,275
I'll live in
the "about of it all."

637
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,192
I think I'm responsible

638
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,442
for saving us about
seventy million today!

639
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:32,943
We took a 48 million dollar
hit today,

640
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:36,901
instead of eating
the 512 million dollar exposure

641
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:39,818
we were facing at the open.

642
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:43,150
All hail our lords and saviors,

643
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:47,859
Robert of Axelrod
and Michael of Wagner!

644
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,067
Huh?

645
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,859
Mafee has the scuttlebutt.

646
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,067
We bled 'em.
Your idea did.

647
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,651
We cost them plenty
by selling when we did

648
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,484
and you saved us
a massive loss in that sector

649
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:18,150
or at the very least a several
months-long forced hold

650
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:20,234
by selling before
that terminal went up.

651
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:23,442
Okay.
Virtual group high five.

652
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:30,901
Strange confluence of events,
Axe Cap's computers going down

653
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:33,234
right on the cusp
of a sector-killing

654
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:36,275
industrial accident,
allowing us an opening.

655
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,317
I agree, it was.

656
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:39,794
And that's how
I am going to continue

657
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:40,901
to think of it, you know?

658
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:42,526
Act of God, as they say.

659
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,150
What's the Russian word for God?

660
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,693
Good question.

661
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,234
Hey.

662
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:52,192
Glad I had someone's
guidance this morning.

663
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:55,359
Hey, I did my job.
You did yours.

664
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,192
That's the way it oughta go.

665
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:26,359
Russian made circuitry.

666
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:28,359
It was plugged into the network.

667
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,984
It has wifi and cellular data
cards, to give it remote access.

668
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,776
And it was powered
off the main outlet,

669
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:36,275
allowing them to just
wait for the right moment.

670
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,609
Someone who came for a meeting
wasn't who they said they were.

671
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:44,109
Put a protocol in place
so that can't happen again.

672
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:45,526
I will.

673
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,609
We're back up!

674
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,275
We know, you simple fool!

675
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:53,818
Go run a security audit.

676
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:56,150
Clear out the whole Admin file
and rebuild it.

677
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:58,192
And call CyberBuoy to
make sure it's done right.

678
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:02,275
I'll go supervise.

679
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,025
It is going to be six months

680
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:11,150
before we can rebook
our anti-gravity flight...

681
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,543
Gonna be six months before
anybody in the business

682
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,776
talks to us.

683
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,067
But

684
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,830
I feel like I'm fucking
floating right now.

685
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,901
How did you do it?

686
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,442
I showed him the hieroglyphics
on the cave wall and he folded.

687
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:24,359
For a 13 million dollar
exit payment.

688
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,442
Pennies on the fucking dollar!

689
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,585
But you're gonna have to force
the board to make good on that.

690
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,526
Uh, shouldn't be hard, since
I got you three board seats...

691
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:32,609
One of which I'm taking.

692
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:35,025
Wow. I owe you.

693
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:36,709
Oh. You do.
And payback's gonna be steep.

694
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,234
Gimme some of that.

695
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:44,526
You two are animals,
drinking it warm.

696
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,275
- I need some ice.
- Oh. I can...

697
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:47,359
I'll get it.

698
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:59,818
Grigor didn't beat us this time.

699
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,192
He almost did.

700
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,859
But not quite.

701
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,651
He won't stop trying.

702
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:09,401
No, he won't.

703
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:13,651
Until all his chances
are taken away.

704
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:21,234
Fraunces. Fitting.

705
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,984
Washington bid farewell
to his troops here.

706
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,124
Even though I never
got my troops again...

707
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,401
Just the farewell.

708
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:31,401
I don't see any
other way either.

709
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:33,401
Yeah.

710
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,275
I go out there. Give up.
Everyone moves on.

711
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,651
Yeah. I wrote it all
down for you.

712
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:50,484
Let's see here.

713
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,526
And so for reasons
having more to do with

714
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,651
familial commitments

715
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,651
than a lack of desire
to do the job,

716
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:00,067
I hereby...

717
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,067
Yup.
That's about it.

718
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,359
- Okay.
- Okay.

719
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:09,609
Gimme a few alone.

720
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,893
Uh, yeah. I'll get out there,
tell 'em a couple minutes.

721
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,818
Nope. Not gonna read that one.

722
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:25,359
"A lie," the wise man,

723
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,693
Winston Churchill,
purportedly said,

724
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:29,734
"gets halfway around the world

725
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:32,025
before the truth has a chance
to get its pants on."

726
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:39,234
But, uh, I have a feeling
that this truth

727
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,984
will find its way quick enough.

728
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:44,275
And it's high time
for truth, too.

729
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,234
For openness. For unburdening.

730
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:51,192
I am not here, as most
politicians might be,

731
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:52,818
to ask you to trust me.

732
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:58,192
No. Instead, I am asking
if I may trust you,

733
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:02,984
with my deepest fear,

734
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:05,401
which is that you might know me,

735
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:08,693
who I really am.

736
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,609
The job of the prosecutor
is to expose that

737
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:14,567
which is hidden away,
the evil, the dirty,

738
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,401
the crooked and the untruthful.

739
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:19,025
To shine light and reveal

740
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,067
what's under all that darkness.

741
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,567
And I have come to realize
that in order to do it right,

742
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:28,693
I must first shine that light
on my own dark parts.

743
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:32,818
Which is why I have asked you
all here today.

744
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:40,818
Alright. Y...
You know what?

745
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:43,067
I'm just going to say it. Uh...

746
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:47,859
I... In my private life...

747
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:52,651
In the confines
of my happy marriage...

748
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,401
with my consenting wife...

749
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,651
practice sadomasochism...

750
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:08,067
Uh, yeah.

751
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:14,234
Bondage, dominance,
uh, all the rest.

752
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,901
Masks. Binds. Ropes. Fire.

753
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:29,025
Wow. Uh...

754
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,567
Even just saying it like that
I can feel my shoulders loosen

755
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,025
for the first time in decades.

756
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:34,984
I am a masochist.

757
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:37,901
In order to achieve
sexual gratification,

758
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:41,317
I need to be tied up,
punched, pinched, whipped,

759
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:43,651
kicked or otherwise tortured.

760
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,734
By my loving wife...

761
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:59,526
And here's the bigger truth.

762
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:01,776
All of us need something, right?

763
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,067
You know, I don't know
what you do in your bedroom,

764
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,943
with your loved one,
but I do know this:

765
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:10,025
you're probably
a little embarrassed about it.

766
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,189
You probably don't want
the rest of us looking at you

767
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:16,818
while you do it... unless that's
your thing and if so, great.

768
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:18,526
But wouldn't we be better off

769
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,776
if we didn't let shame win.

770
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:22,442
If we didn't feel sheepish,

771
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:25,567
didn't feel like we had to hide
what moves us?

772
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,984
Chuck, are you still gonna run?

773
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,567
Chuck, how...

774
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:38,277
There are those who believe
that I have just ended

775
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:41,734
my legal and political careers.

776
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:45,651
They don't think you can handle
what I just told you.

777
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:48,943
In fact, uh,
political opponents of mine

778
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:50,567
were plotting to use it
against me.

779
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:51,984
I said "bring it."

780
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:58,943
And that's why I told you
I was here to trust you.

781
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,359
Because I know
that you can handle it.

782
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,234
That you may laugh a little.

783
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,192
But that at the end of the day,
you'll get it,

784
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,442
because you want the truth.

785
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:15,401
At worst, uh,
maybe it won't stop you

786
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:16,835
from getting to the polls
to support me.

787
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:21,109
At best,

788
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:25,192
maybe on the way you tell
someone who you really are.

789
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:28,526
Maybe they like it.

790
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,984
And maybe you feel
just a little more comfortable

791
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,651
in your own skin.

792
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:40,109
As I finally do in mine.

793
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,275
Thank you.

794
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,234
Thank you.

795
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,734
You're welcome.

796
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,442
This cork is symbolic
of the exit polls

797
00:43:43,526 --> 00:43:46,359
popping huge for Chuck Rhoades,

798
00:43:46,442 --> 00:43:50,150
your next Attorney General
of the State of New York...

799
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:51,859
The future of justice
in this state.

800
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,067
Here's to all or nothing
gambits... the only way to live.

801
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,609
Hear, hear.

802
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:04,442
Cheers.

803
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,359
I'm gonna need the room.

804
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:17,109
Uh.
Sure, of course.

805
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:19,210
Why don't we, uh, fall back
into the outer office...

806
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:21,359
That's not gonna be far enough.

807
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:38,984
You're a real politician now,
aren't you?

808
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,818
That's right.

809
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:44,192
But the distinction you failed
to make is:

810
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:46,567
winning politician.

811
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,567
- At all costs?
- Yes.

812
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,734
Victory at all costs,
victory in spite of all terror,

813
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:55,150
victory however long and hard
the road may be;

814
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,401
for without victory,
there is no survival.

815
00:44:57,484 --> 00:45:00,025
More Churchill?

816
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,359
You blow up my fucking life
and more Churchill.

817
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,943
You can shove him up your ass.

818
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,651
And believe me, he'll fit.

819
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:09,818
What would you have
had me do, Wend, lose?

820
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:12,401
Yes, Chuck. Lose.

821
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:14,669
For once in your fucking life,
you could have taken the L

822
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:17,526
instead of humiliating me
utterly and absolutely.

823
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,359
Are you sure about that?

824
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:22,776
That I'm humiliated?
I'm pretty goddamned sure.

825
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:25,109
How am I supposed to
face my colleagues,

826
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:27,025
my friends, strangers?

827
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:28,150
Our children?

828
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:31,984
Okay.
Eva is too young to know.

829
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:35,192
And as for Kevin...
At a certain age it becomes time

830
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:39,150
to see your parents as real
people, not perfect beings...

831
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:40,835
I'm getting them out of town.
I'm sending them to my parents.

832
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:43,234
God knows how long
will be long enough...

833
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:45,168
Well, as for the rest of them,
maybe wait a second.

834
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:46,693
And see how you poll.

835
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,609
Because they loved
what I had to say out there.

836
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:52,693
The frank talk.

837
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:54,109
The numbers make that clear,

838
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,025
and I can only imagine
that you...

839
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:58,067
Going along for the sake
of your husband...

840
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,609
Are gonna be viewed
as hero of the people.

841
00:46:00,693 --> 00:46:02,275
I don't care.

842
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:06,567
Poll numbers?
You motherfucker.

843
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:08,609
We discussed this beforehand.

844
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:10,693
I made my position
crystal clear,

845
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:12,835
and you agreed and then you
went off and did it anyway.

846
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:15,484
I freed us
from the yoke of secrecy,

847
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,567
from Jack fucking Foley.

848
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,776
And I did not just "go off"

849
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,484
so don't just try
to draw this up

850
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:24,984
like I'm some impulsive,
disorganized amateur.

851
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,609
What?
So you planned it?

852
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:28,943
You discussed it with someone?

853
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:31,401
With your... your campaign
people... Ira?

854
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:42,943
No. Of course.

855
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:44,734
You ran it by your daddy,
didn't you?

856
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:50,442
What, did you have him mark up
that ridiculous speech?

857
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:54,317
No. He didn't know
exactly what I'd do.

858
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:58,901
He just... seeded the idea that
maybe I should get my back up.

859
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,734
Because he's a seasoned
political operative.

860
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,359
A power player...

861
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:05,317
Holy shit, is this marriage
getting crowded.

862
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:08,734
How many dicks is a woman
expected to have in her face?

863
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:13,025
Wendy, I am gonna be
Attorney General.

864
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:15,229
So let's just talk this out
like two rational human...

865
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,651
No. I am done
hearing you talk.

866
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:32,150
It's all you say it is, Dad.

867
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:35,317
Let's do something with this.

868
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:37,359
You're gonna help me
raise capital?

869
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:40,025
I am. I'm going to put things
in motion right away.

870
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:42,401
Because it's a strong idea,
well executed.

871
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:46,275
And also because I want to.
For you.

872
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,317
I'm gonna be in business
with my... child.

873
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:03,401
Congratulations.

874
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:06,734
You blew the doors off
with that speech.

875
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:11,567
I did not expect you
to come across with that.

876
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:13,526
Neither did Wendy, to be honest.

877
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:15,943
Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah.

878
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:17,705
I will have to deal with that.
For certain.

879
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,150
I already am.

880
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:23,275
Well. She's gonna
beat your ass for it.

881
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:28,192
That is the first
and last of those.

882
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,859
I doubt that.

883
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:32,693
Hell, if that's the price
you gotta pay

884
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,442
to move the conversation
along...

885
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:36,818
Exactly so.

886
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:40,818
What, uh... What other price
might I be paying?

887
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:56,275
I saw...

888
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,234
I'm sorry to have seen
Chuck's press conference.

889
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:02,484
I can't believe...

890
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,067
Look, I know what it's like

891
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,317
to face public scrutiny
over who you are.

892
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,859
How it must be even worse when
it's been foisted upon you.

893
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:10,943
But you can still claim it.

894
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:14,442
Whatever's transpired
between us,

895
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:16,734
I can imagine you could use
some support right now...

896
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:20,275
So, would you like to?
Talk?

897
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:35,067
Fine. Great.

898
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,484
Thank you.

899
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:44,275
Thank you.

900
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,150
And... And it's only

901
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:49,150
because you threw your support
behind me,

902
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:52,693
because of your FAITH in me,
that I stand before you now

903
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,275
as the Attorney General

904
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,567
of the finest state
in the Union... New York!

905
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:07,484
Just beautiful.

906
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,752
- Thank you so much.
- The Governor for you.

907
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,234
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

908
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:17,025
Thank you.

909
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,275
Congratulations, Chuck.

910
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,943
Can't wait to work together.

911
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:28,067
Congratulations to you,
Mr. Governor-elect.

912
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,901
I'm eager to get started, sir.

913
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:31,317
You have fun tonight.

914
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,442
- Is it done?
- It is.

915
00:50:57,526 --> 00:51:00,484
Outgoing AG approved it
as a courtesy to you.

916
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:04,734
I made sure of it
before we scooped him up.

917
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,234
Mr. Andolov.

918
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:14,734
My first act as Attorney General
of New York State,

919
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,567
even before I'm sworn in,

920
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:19,484
was to freeze your funds
in the United States.

921
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:22,859
My second act is:

922
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:25,109
Inviting you to leave
our sunny shores.

923
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:31,526
Mr. former US Attorney
and now Attorney General,

924
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:32,943
congratulations!

925
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,526
There are so many ways
we could have met.

926
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:41,192
It is unfortunate
you chose this one.

927
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:48,317
Like the musician says
of the piece he plays:

928
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:49,859
it chose me.

929
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:51,275
Did it?

930
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,442
Or are you doing favors
for friends on high?

931
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:58,234
Because you must know
that I am higher

932
00:51:58,317 --> 00:52:01,150
than any other friend
you could imagine.

933
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:03,484
And my friends are higher still.

934
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,067
That notwithstanding,
your business interests

935
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,609
have been connected
with blacklisted governments

936
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:13,609
and the paperwork is prepared
to have you declared

937
00:52:13,693 --> 00:52:15,609
an unregistered foreign agent

938
00:52:15,693 --> 00:52:20,442
with intent against ours.

939
00:52:20,526 --> 00:52:23,776
There's only one choice
that will preclude that:

940
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:26,609
you firing up
your private samolet

941
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:29,025
and flying home...

942
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:32,859
Or wherever else it is
you call home.

943
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:43,818
I know much about you.

944
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:45,484
Both from your own words

945
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:50,442
and from other...
information I've gathered.

946
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:53,984
So I know that despite
your predilections,

947
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:56,859
you are a practical man.

948
00:52:56,943 --> 00:52:59,818
Why don't we combine
those facets

949
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:02,150
and start our own friendship?

950
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:06,401
Take time off
before assuming office.

951
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:09,067
We will travel to places

952
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,818
that have certain establishments

953
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:14,401
you would not believe.

954
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,859
We would come back refreshed

955
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:22,984
and with a whole new outlook

956
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:26,317
on how we could work together.

957
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:33,234
Yeah,

958
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:35,025
sounds tempting.

959
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:40,984
You and me,
traveling the continents,

960
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,818
the real world Lestat and Louis.

961
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:48,317
Alas, uh...

962
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:50,484
Ce n'est pas notre destin.

963
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:52,526
No?

964
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:55,484
No.

965
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,651
Depressing.

966
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:01,943
Mm.

967
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:05,526
A bit. Yes.

968
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,818
Now,

969
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:11,609
I'd give you twenty-four hours
to blow town,

970
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:16,651
but you're too tricky, so I'm
only gonna make it twelve,

971
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:20,526
before I file the papers
and you'll be removed by force.

972
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,901
Americans pretend to lead,

973
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:31,776
but they are still provincial
in so many ways.

974
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,984
It is truly sad.

975
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:35,567
Mm.

976
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,442
I, of course,
picked up the scent

977
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:18,067
of the Axelrod behind this.

978
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,192
As I did your recent attack
on my systems.

979
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:25,984
But you shouldn't
consider this as an attack.

980
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:29,567
Rhoades gave you a warning.

981
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:32,275
He's letting you leave.

982
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:34,609
That's a favor to me.

983
00:55:34,693 --> 00:55:37,109
And a favor to you.
I hope you understand that.

984
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:39,192
What I don't understand

985
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:42,818
fits on a fucking Bazooka comic.

986
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:46,025
Then here's one more thing
for you to get your mind around.

987
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:50,401
I can be scared.
But I cannot be scared off.

988
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:52,025
Sure.

989
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,943
More, uh, Chuck Wepner
than Michael Spinks.

990
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:59,734
But they both lost in the end.

991
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:03,192
Because they were underprepared
and overmatched. I'm neither.

992
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,192
That is what
Mr. Spinks thought

993
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:08,442
right up to 91st second
of round one.

994
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:11,150
Probably did.

995
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,734
But he couldn't do what I can.

996
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:16,567
And what is that?
Move like Jagger?

997
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:20,901
Give away the kind of parting
gift that I'm about to:

998
00:56:20,984 --> 00:56:24,693
the few billion that you have
at Taylor Mason Capital

999
00:56:24,776 --> 00:56:28,234
will be unfrozen
and released back to you...

1000
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:31,025
Once you land back home.

1001
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:32,943
That's something.

1002
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:36,401
But it is actually my money

1003
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:39,359
you're giving back to me.

1004
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:42,025
I'm not sure how much
gratitude that buys.

1005
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:43,275
Do you want it or not?

1006
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,776
Yeah, sure.
Will I get it?

1007
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:48,818
You will. The moment you land.
As I said.

1008
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:50,442
Good.

1009
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,567
Grigor.

1010
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:57,109
Listen, here's the thing:

1011
00:56:57,192 --> 00:56:59,484
after the cash
hits your account,

1012
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:03,693
you may start feeling that you
didn't get your satisfaction,

1013
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:07,609
that you have some further score
you want to settle with me.

1014
00:57:07,693 --> 00:57:09,693
You're gonna want
to tamp down that feeling.

1015
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,984
Sure. It's true

1016
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:14,901
I didn't have you do
my killing for me.

1017
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:16,984
But don't let that trick you
into thinking

1018
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:20,317
that I don't have
the will or the ability

1019
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:22,693
to do it under
different circumstances.

1020
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,693
Like when I'm threatened...

1021
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,401
You send someone after me here,

1022
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:31,025
they're gonna find that
I'm a very insulated, protected

1023
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:33,484
and powerful man
in these fucking parts.

1024
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:37,609
And there is nothing that I
won't do to defend what's mine.

1025
00:57:37,693 --> 00:57:42,067
You know, I don't think I will.

1026
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:45,442
I rather like the idea

1027
00:57:45,526 --> 00:57:49,526
of you stalking around,
stirring shit up.

1028
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:52,109
But here. In America.

1029
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:56,567
On the other hand,
if you come to Russia

1030
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:01,275
or any of her territories,
then, Axe,

1031
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,067
all bets are off.

1032
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,275
You know, I don't think I will.

1033
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,984
Good.

1034
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,651
Good.

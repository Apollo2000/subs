1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,124
Previously on "Billions"...

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,415
Bobby fucking Axelrod.
Man of the people.

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,165
We're gonna put him in a cell.
The gloves are off.

4
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,165
We do whatever it takes.

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,832
Your value to the firm
is absolute.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,290
I've been working there
since before we were married

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,040
and long before
you were in office.

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,374
I take care of my people.

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,415
When Mick Danzig
gets tackled on his lawn

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,832
with a machine gun,
I make the problem go away.

11
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,290
You don't get to where I am

12
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,124
without tolerating
a lot of risk.

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,332
We. Where we are.

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,207
I made some decisions.

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,540
You shuttered it,
the restaurant and the farm.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,791
Let's go! Everybody out!

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,083
You married a criminal.

18
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,249
Walk away from the shame.
Divorce his ass.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,957
You want me to pressure
my husband to back off.

20
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,874
- You know I can't do that.
- Why not?

21
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:56,040
From here on in, I tell you
your position in this,

22
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,124
if you have one at all.

23
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,207
Your boss got that bogus
information on Axe and the cops

24
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,124
by accessing
his wife's private notes.

25
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,374
You betrayed my trust.

26
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,124
You sit there and you try
to claim moral high ground.

27
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,332
Oh, oh, oh, oh. I claim it?

28
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,082
While you go on working
at a criminal organization,

29
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,415
and you can't even fucking
admit it to yourself.

30
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,582
I tell you about my issues
with Danzig,

31
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,249
and then there's a
fucking investigation underway!

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,374
I didn't sell you out.

33
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,540
- Polygraph me, motherfucker.

34
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,957
- When I get back,

35
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,124
be gone.

36
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,458
Case is terminated.

37
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,541
Come work for Bach's firm
on my account.

38
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,124
I didn't hear "no."

39
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,957
I am so sorry
to have doubted you.

40
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,124
Your bonus.

41
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,290
I was planning to
give you two million.

42
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,665
It just went up to five.

43
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,999
I quit, Bobby.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,665
I can't be in denial about

45
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,666
what this place is,
what you are, any longer.

46
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,915
You know the only
enemy more dangerous

47
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,708
than a man
with unlimited resources...

48
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,165
is one with nothing to lose.

49
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,124
And that is what
you are looking at

50
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,083
right here.

51
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,457
Sorry about the hour.

52
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,625
You never have to
say that to me.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,082
In many ways,
this place made me.

54
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,875
Sit.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,999
There's nowhere that
the stark difference

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,415
between winners and losers
is more clear.

57
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,207
Ah.

58
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,165
I have called you here tonight
to tell you

59
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,125
how we are going to win.

60
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,416
Excuse me.

61
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,082
Pardon me.
We got to get to work, babe.

62
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,790
Don't "babe" me here.

63
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,665
No one's opening the doors
till Axe says to open the doors.

64
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,040
Three fucking weeks working out
of my living rooms,

65
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,624
I'm creaming to get in there.

66
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,207
First one in the lot
this morning.

67
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,040
You showed up early to take
a look around, didn't you?

68
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,874
See what really caused this.
Unless you believe that whole

69
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,999
"fire extinguisher malfunction
flood" bullshit.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,957
- You won't stop with this.
- Come on.

71
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,332
- That was no heart attack.
- Who had a heart attack?

72
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,207
- Clemenza. Only he didn't.
- The Rosato brothers killed him,

73
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,082
and he's saying
this is like that.

74
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,790
It is questionable. Fire systems
have automatic cutoffs.

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,999
We weren't even allowed in
to get our stuff.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,624
I know what you know.

77
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,040
I heard Axe went kind of nuts.

78
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,165
- Who the fuck asked you?
- If Axe says it was

79
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,708
a system malfunction,
that's what it was.

80
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,624
Go time, yeah?

81
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,665
We need Wags.

82
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,207
Do we?

83
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,665
We don't let the animals back in

84
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,249
until their keeper is here, too.

85
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,791
On it.

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,457
You must defend your lapels.

87
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,332
Put your elbow inside the knee
and work the elbow escape.

88
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,374
Yeah, I'll do
all that next time.

89
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,082
When you can master
moves like this,

90
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,040
you can generate offense
out of defense,

91
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,958
even off your back.

92
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,208
Showtime, folks.

93
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,333
He's waiting on you.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,707
- Donna!

95
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,165
Please take this out of here.
Give it to some...

96
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,040
Sorry, sir.
I was trying to stop him.

97
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,707
I'm Oliver Dake, Office of
Professional Responsibility.

98
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,040
OPR. And not just here
for a regular review

99
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,999
or you would have
set up an appointment.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Correct.
We are quite comfortable

101
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,249
not giving advance warning
in cases like this.

102
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,665
Mm-hmm.
And what sort of...

103
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,165
An investigation into
your recent conduct.

104
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,082
- Well, that sounds serious.
- Oh, it is.

105
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,165
I bet you'd like
the use of an office.

106
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,374
I would.

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
Follow me.

108
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,041
Oh!
Look at that.

109
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,874
So you were warned.

110
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,415
Don't for a moment think
it gives you an advantage.

111
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,915
Who even thinks on those terms?

112
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,624
I have nothing to hide.
You'll receive full cooperation.

113
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,040
With it, without it,
I'll find out what's true.

114
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,582
Know that.

115
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,375
I'll count on it.

116
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,582
Yeah, it's Dake.

117
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,207
Where are we at
on the Rhoades work-up?

118
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,208
You know what?

119
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,458
Let's add tax returns
to the data that...

120
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,665
- It's time, Wags.
- Almost.

121
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,166
I don't want this to turn into
The Who in Cincinnati.

122
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,582
Lead them in.

123
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,124
Now you fuckers know
how much you miss this place

124
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625
when you can't have it.

125
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,249
No electronics,
personal or otherwise,

126
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,999
beyond a phone will come or go.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,207
All employees will be issued
magnetic ID bracelets

128
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:07,040
that will be necessary for entry
and exit through the turnstiles.

129
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,832
People ask me
what money can't buy.

130
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,582
In public, I say
some sort of bullshit like,

131
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:17,499
"Love and its many splendored
so forth."

132
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,082
The real answer...

133
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,832
- Not much.

134
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,790
And the best thing is
it gives me access

135
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,624
to the world's
most fascinating people.

136
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,457
Like our next speaker,

137
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,665
the finest performance coach
there is.

138
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,999
I'd advise you to give her
your full attention.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,915
But I don't have to.

140
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,999
She'll get it.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,165
It's what she does.

142
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
Dr. Wendy Rhoades.

143
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,124
Performance.

144
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,290
That's a loaded word.

145
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,290
Scary.
Lot of pressure.

146
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,624
- Not for me.

147
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,499
Oh.

148
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,957
You can perform?

149
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,665
Fucking right I can.

150
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,457
Come back to my office
and try me.

151
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,666
- Never had any complaints.
- Nice.

152
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,082
You know, they say
a trained professional

153
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,874
can always tell
when someone's lying.

154
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,457
That's an exaggeration.
We don't always know.

155
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,374
But right now, I do.

156
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,208
You're lying.

157
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,540
Covering.

158
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,999
We all get complaints, right?

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,750
Struggle for you is you remember
the complaints, don't you?

160
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,415
They lodge deep.

161
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,207
They haunt you.

162
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,041
Because you want to believe
you're perfect.

163
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,833
But you know you're not.

164
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,457
That's why two billion dollars'
worth of these babies

165
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,500
are sold every year.

166
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:17,165
Because they bring reassurance
that when the time comes,

167
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,707
you can step up.

168
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,499
Some of you take them.

169
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,082
A little blue steel
is nothing to be ashamed of.

170
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,707
But if I threw this bottle
into the audience right now,

171
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,457
no one would grab it.

172
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,374
The thought that someone
might know you need help

173
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,207
is worse than not getting
the help you need.

174
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,624
Still, when the time comes,

175
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,999
when you need to
pull the trigger

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,624
on the buy or sell order,

177
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,249
you better be hard as a rock
and ready to go,

178
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,375
because that is the tour
you've signed on for.

179
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,040
Millions of years ago,

180
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,624
a meteor hit the Earth
and brought on an ice age.

181
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,832
And even the mightiest T. rexes

182
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,249
were reduced
to fucking skeletons.

183
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,374
A meteor is screaming

184
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,665
toward this room right now

185
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,165
and all the rooms like it.

186
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,124
The entire hedge-fund industry

187
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,499
is under siege.

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,665
We deserve it.

189
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,999
We've acted as if
it would go on forever.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,582
Even as shitty returns,

191
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,832
the outflow of
institutional money,

192
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:31,665
and the rise of quant funds have
lighted the way to our demise,

193
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:36,457
we have willfully
refused to change.

194
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,124
In the great expanse of time,

195
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,165
we are already dead.

196
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,832
I know it even if you don't.

197
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:48,874
But in this microsecond that
we are still breathing air,

198
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,374
I'm gonna fight the inevitable.

199
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,082
If you have a card
in front of you,

200
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,291
pick it up,
hold it in front of your face.

201
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,457
If this room represents all
the hedge funds in business,

202
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,915
the uncovered faces

203
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,124
are the only ones left
in 18 months' time.

204
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,040
I made it.

205
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,415
Is that right, Mafee?

206
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,124
You made it?

207
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,207
Because this was
a random fucking exercise,

208
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,125
and I don't see any evidence
at all that you're gonna!

209
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,000
Put your fucking cards down.

210
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,957
Trust almost killed Axe Capital.

211
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,040
And that is
never gonna happen again.

212
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:39,915
Things got a little too free
and fucking easy around here.

213
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,499
And to eliminate the possibility

214
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,040
of any questionable information
passing from any of you to me,

215
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,999
all future conversations
will be held

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,082
in the presence of my Chief of
Staff, Stephanie Reed.

217
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,040
And I mean all.

218
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,124
If you see me
at the coffee machine,

219
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,416
you wait until Steph is there
before you pitch me the cream.

220
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,790
I am a survivor.

221
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,374
And I will do whatever it takes

222
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,874
to avoid my fate.

223
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,832
Ask yourselves...

224
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,499
Are you?

225
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,499
You have an amazing
level of insight

226
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,290
into how we hedgies think.

227
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,415
Well, if I didn't
after the time I put in...

228
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,915
With Axe.

229
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,999
Yes.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,291
I don't mean Axe Capital.
I mean Bobby himself.

231
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,040
You've had sessions with him.

232
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,874
You must understand
at a molecular level almost

233
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,124
why he does what he does.

234
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,040
Well, I'm not talking about
a rising market.

235
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,790
I mean, we all know how to trade

236
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,332
once we get
a little mo-mo going.

237
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,707
But when things
get a little choppy,

238
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,040
does he steer into the skid

239
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,333
or does he retreat to
look at alternatives?

240
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,124
I thought you'd overpaid me.

241
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,499
But if that's what
you're really looking for,

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,665
you weren't even
close to the number.

243
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,665
The number doesn't exist.

244
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,958
I'd never sell him out.

245
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,832
You passed the test.

246
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,665
Ah. Do I get the whole
chocolate factory now?

247
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,415
Yes, you do.

248
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,790
I thought I wanted to
bring you on full time,

249
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,540
but now that I know
I can trust you,

250
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,165
I'm certain I do.

251
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,082
Well...

252
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,582
that makes one of us, Todd.

253
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,624
I'm already set up
in an office of my own

254
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,915
starting to see clients.

255
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,124
Is that permanent?

256
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,665
I'm not sure. Yet.

257
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,999
I'm keeping my options open.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,166
Is that a lie?

259
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,499
I hope not.

260
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,082
Anyway, why don't you just
keep an open mind,

261
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,291
and let's find something
to collaborate on soon, okay?

262
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,457
I have information.

263
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,165
- Got your homework ready?
- Yep.

264
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,332
All right. I got to
drop some papers off

265
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,207
at the development office.
I'll see you guys at pickup.

266
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,624
- Okay.
- Have a good day.

267
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,333
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

268
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,166
Help! Help!
Katie fell on the floor!

269
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,582
- What's going on?
- I'm calling 911.

270
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,582
- What happened?
- She came in with nausea,

271
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,915
threw up in my office.
She's having a seizure.

272
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,707
She's in anaphylaxis.

273
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,040
Epi-pen.

274
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,165
That's why hysterical moms
aren't school nurses.

275
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,749
We don't give adrenaline
unless the allergy...

276
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,165
She needs a rescue shot.
She carries one.

277
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,915
I need an ambulance to
the Horace School right away,

278
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,332
- please.

279
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,165
Okay.
All right.

280
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,207
- Okay, honey.

281
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,749
Listen,
you're having a reaction,

282
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,458
but I got you, all right?
Just breathe for me.

283
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,540
Michael, thank you.

284
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,500
Why don't you go
walk the perimeter?

285
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,165
Word out of Washington

286
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,207
is that Rhoades' misconduct
is being investigated.

287
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,999
You somehow put that in motion?

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,624
Look, when an enemy's down
on the field,

289
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,082
you got to finish him.

290
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,207
If this investigation hurts him,

291
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,040
we got to take it
the rest of the way.

292
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,165
He's really in your head.

293
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,457
As long as Rhoades is
in that job, I'm not safe.

294
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,165
Hall,
I want your guys all over it.

295
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,790
Bach, I want to file a lawsuit
against him immediately.

296
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,165
A smart woman once said,

297
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,082
"You can no more win a war
than an earthquake."

298
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,500
It's what's called for.
How long to prepare it?

299
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,499
Bobby, détente can be good.

300
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,332
Like after the armistice,

301
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,624
the Europeans back in the cafés,
drinking wine.

302
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,124
- Making love.
- Yeah.

303
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,040
And if they would have known
the Germans were laying in wait,

304
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,124
arming up again, they would have
been better off crushing them

305
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,832
- when they had the chance.
- With a suit comes publicity.

306
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,207
Everything that happened

307
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,915
gets dragged back through
the press, re-litigated.

308
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,540
You get called a criminal
every single day.

309
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,040
Instead of how it is now?

310
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,332
With the murky suggestion
hanging over me,

311
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,124
looming over every encounter?

312
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,957
Look, lots of people
he's crossed swords with

313
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,124
have gone away
stuck and steaming.

314
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,624
Most can't even get a lawyer

315
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,874
to take on an individual case
of this nature.

316
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,165
You know why?

317
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,665
The downside's too steep

318
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,874
and the upside's
too hard to see.

319
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,082
And if you still hope
to get Wendy back somehow,

320
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,707
I don't see how this can help.

321
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,165
You said you had some
information on that front.

322
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,124
Wendy and Rhoades
remain separated.

323
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,374
Where is he living?

324
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,790
The house.

325
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,124
Part of the time.

326
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,665
She is, too, part of the time.

327
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,915
- How?
- They call it nesting.

328
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,540
It's bullshit.

329
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,249
I tried it for a few weeks
between wives two and three.

330
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,165
Yes, the parents trade nights.

331
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,249
The children stay
in the familial home.

332
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,915
A utopian idea
that's supposed to

333
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,499
impart a feeling of well-being
in the young ones

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,082
during a turbulent time.
- Like I said, bullshit.

335
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,832
And Wendy was at Krakow Capital
earlier today.

336
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,040
- What? That fucker's hired her?
- Unclear.

337
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,415
If we're not getting her back,

338
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,915
I've heard about this guy,
Lenny Gustaferson...

339
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,999
Dr. Gus.
He is supposed to be badass.

340
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,999
I can't believe
she's considering Krakow.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,790
That's a bucket shop.

342
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,040
I want to know where
she's working,

343
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,665
the hours.

344
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,707
Hold off on that Gus guy
until I say.

345
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,041
Good.

346
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,665
I know Katie.
I know that she has the allergy.

347
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,124
How does a mother passing by
know more than her?

348
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,165
I can't administer
serious medication

349
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,290
just because some rich lady

350
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,165
- stopped...
- Stop talking.

351
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,165
Topher, I am not leaving my kids
in the care of this idiot.

352
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,415
Are you gonna do it now,

353
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,624
or do I have to call
the rest of the board?

354
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,165
I get it, Lara, but we can't
do this thing bang-bang.

355
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,000
I need a licensed nurse
on premises at all times.

356
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,082
Hey, Mo. It's Lara.

357
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,290
Look, I know
you're working nights,

358
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,874
but I need your help.

359
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,040
Can you come do a shift here
at the Horace School right now?

360
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,040
Oh, you're the best.

361
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,624
My cousin will be here
in 45 minutes.

362
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,957
I'll cover until then.

363
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,416
Fully licensed.

364
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,500
Bye.

365
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,249
It'll take a long time
to fill Bart Schooner's seat

366
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,332
as head of criminal prosecution.

367
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,249
- Oh, at least 15 minutes...

368
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,082
until someone with a law degree

369
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,624
and a controlled drinking habit
stumbles in.

370
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,040
Let me... Let me get serious.

371
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:48,290
I just want to talk
about Bart's...

372
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,082
Head of Crim. Man.

373
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,665
Plum perch.

374
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,749
Freaking launch pad
to the private sector.

375
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,832
I mean, you land it,
you're minted.

376
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,999
Seven figures the day you leave.

377
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,332
How the hell do you get it?

378
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,832
There's 75 AUSAs in here
all going after it.

379
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,082
You got to pay your dues.

380
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,957
Yeah.
Big cases, ingeniously won.

381
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,749
After years of dutiful service.

382
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,374
- Years and years.

383
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,332
So I'm too young?

384
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,082
You're getting that?

385
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,957
Too green.

386
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,415
It'll go to an old hand
like one of you two, then?

387
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,290
"Experienced", not "old".

388
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,957
- Seasoned.

389
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,999
I'm out of scotch.

390
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,165
See, I order two at a time
at these things

391
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,165
because the waiters disappear
like Houdini after the entrées.

392
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,957
You got to know that.
Plan ahead.

393
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,665
Smart. Seasoned.

394
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,040
Souses.

395
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,374
What I'd like to know is,

396
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,875
will Chuck still be the one
handing out the job?

397
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,499
- The investigation.
- Hell yeah.

398
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,790
They say Dake rides in
on a pale horse.

399
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,124
What do you think
he's got on Chuck?

400
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,332
Well, well, well.
Three young apprentices

401
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,666
celebrating the departure
of a colleague.

402
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,624
Sure.
But don't they also want to

403
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,624
put a foot in his ass
and take his spot?

404
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,457
Hmm?

405
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,208
Oh, come on.

406
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,290
You know Head of Crim
is the hyperloop

407
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,832
that propels you into
whatever job you want next.

408
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,790
How to get it...

409
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,790
Let me tell you.

410
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:21,082
Our practices
leave grooves over time.

411
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,124
And eventually,
those grooves become walls

412
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,790
that box us in.

413
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,915
So what I figured out
recently is,

414
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,125
find another way.

415
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,082
I found myself in a chess match
in Washington Square Park

416
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,082
with one of those hustlers

417
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,165
who's been taking
tourists' money for years.

418
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,957
A bit of a crowd had formed.

419
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,791
This was a hard-fought match.

420
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,915
I had just gained an edge.

421
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:57,624
I had an unstoppable waiting
attack when I saw it happen.

422
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,999
He swiped both my knights
with one capture.

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,165
Oh, the cheat was
very well executed.

424
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,665
I was about to go across
the table at him.

425
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,540
To make sure he was banned
from the park,

426
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,874
to exact retribution.

427
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:17,124
But then in an instant, I saw...

428
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,915
this was the chance

429
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:23,082
to re-frame
my entire approach.

430
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,541
So instead...

431
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,249
I caught what you did.

432
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,665
Takes practice to master
something like that.

433
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,374
It's to be admired in a sense,

434
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,208
but that is the last time
you use it today.

435
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,415
I'm a man who could
make things difficult for you,

436
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,832
but I won't.

437
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,040
As long as
you'll understand this.

438
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,625
Your next opponent is that boy.

439
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,833
And I want him to have a very
good time playing against you.

440
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,707
Thank you.

441
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,624
The man thanked me.

442
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,915
Imagine that.

443
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,165
And I knew he wasn't gonna
cheat anyone else that day

444
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,165
and would look over his shoulder
thereafter.

445
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:27,999
I had managed something
better than payback.

446
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,457
By acting with purpose
and understatement,

447
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,249
I had created
a more just environment,

448
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,833
which is what I am asking
of all of you.

449
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,000
This is the new way.

450
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:47,124
Well, how do you know
if he did the right thing

451
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,415
after you left?

452
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:52,208
Uh, I sat on a nearby bench
and watched awhile.

453
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,249
Thanks for coming.

454
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,415
I know you'll think
it's worth the effort.

455
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,874
- Quickly, Spyros.
- Okay.

456
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,832
I always listen to the ground.

457
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,790
- It's how I got where I am.
- Mm-hmm. And?

458
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,082
An investigation has begun

459
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,999
into your office's
methods and conduct,

460
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,457
focusing on an aborted
bribery case against Axelrod.

461
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,582
And the man leading
the investigation

462
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:35,124
is dangerous and capable.

463
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:39,415
A younger, even smarter
version of me,

464
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:42,124
if you can conjure that
for yourself.

465
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,749
I scarcely can.

466
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,999
Who is he?

467
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,208
Oliver Dake.

468
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,416
Are we square now?

469
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,040
Don't serve rabbit food
to an elephant

470
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,000
and ask if he's full.

471
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,707
Sir.

472
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,624
Would you get these fine young
barristers another round?

473
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,457
- Of course.
- Thank you.

474
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:25,082
Before I go and have
a nightcap with Bart Schooner

475
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,790
and get his thoughts on
who should replace him,

476
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,165
let me speak to
what's hanging over the table

477
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,082
and this entire room.

478
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,125
The investigation that
Mr. Dake is conducting.

479
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:43,332
You all know how to
handle yourselves.

480
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,832
I want you all to cooperate,

481
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:50,000
to be truthful, of course.

482
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,083
Because I don't believe
we have anything to worry about.

483
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,165
See what he did?

484
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:12,790
We handle ourselves and Chuck
gives someone Head of Crim.

485
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,874
Or we cooperate with Dake
and try our luck

486
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,790
starting over with
Chuck's replacement.

487
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,625
Yeah, we saw what he did.

488
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,832
And so you haven't seen anything

489
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,915
that makes you think
this office is acting

490
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,624
- in an out-of-bounds manner?
- Ambiguous.

491
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,332
Sharpen up the question
so I can give you a good answer.

492
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,165
How would you describe
Mr. Rhoades' tactical approach?

493
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,582
Effective.

494
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,582
And his understanding of
the rules governing behavior?

495
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,499
I can't speak to
his state of mind.

496
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,290
Uh-huh. Let's, uh...

497
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,749
Let's switch gears for a moment.

498
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,999
Tell me about your meeting
with Axelrod.

499
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,332
The aborted settlement?

500
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,791
No.
Your private meeting.

501
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,374
You tell me how that is

502
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,499
in any way relevant
to your investigation.

503
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,457
I am investigating
all misconduct,

504
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,415
wherever it may be.

505
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:17,457
And however
an investigation may start,

506
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,332
once I'm in it,

507
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,957
I'm like a Goddamned octopus...

508
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:27,749
Tentacles out in every
direction, looking, listening,

509
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,625
sucking up every bit of
information that I can find.

510
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,249
Look, I reported that meeting

511
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,040
the second it was over,

512
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,082
and I have the documentation
to prove it.

513
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,624
Ahhh.

514
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,124
You reported it the next day

515
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,749
in the afternoon.

516
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,999
First chance I got.

517
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,957
Or maybe it took you
that long to decide

518
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,916
what to leave in
and what to leave out.

519
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,207
I left it all in.

520
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,457
Axelrod offered me a job.

521
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:01,124
This is at the pizzeria
in Yonkers, yes?

522
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,499
That's right.

523
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,749
I turned it down.

524
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,040
Did you?

525
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,999
With no provers in the room,

526
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,249
it's only your word and his.

527
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,832
If I asked Axelrod,
is that how he'd remember it?

528
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

529
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,499
Ooh, nice space.

530
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,833
Contained.

531
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,000
I bet your patients
must feel safe here.

532
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,540
You gonna invite me to sit down?

533
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,500
No.

534
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,707
If you knew enough
to make an appointment

535
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,082
under an assumed name, you knew

536
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,540
- I didn't want to see you.
- I knew you wouldn't,

537
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,624
but that's not the same
as not wanting to.

538
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,833
Yes, it is.

539
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,750
There's this thing that happens
when we're in a room together.

540
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:41,124
It always has, Bobby.
It just flows like this.

541
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,165
But I'm shutting it off.

542
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,249
I have shut it off.

543
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,249
Okay.

544
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,624
First, I apologized.

545
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,124
But if it takes me sending you
flowers every day,

546
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,874
Joe DiMaggio style,
to prove it, I will.

547
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,040
He did that
after Marilyn was dead.

548
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:02,082
Yours would have the same effect
on me that his had on her.

549
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,332
But I need you back
at Axe Capital.

550
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,583
Well, that's not gonna happen.

551
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:11,207
Look, there are decisions
I have to make

552
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,457
over actions that I might take,

553
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,624
and I have never had to do it
without you.

554
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:19,124
The time to recognize that
has long since passed.

555
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,124
We are at an inflection point.

556
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,999
We have to make big changes
to the company.

557
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,499
We have to make it quickly.

558
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,207
And I am getting conflicting
advice from my people.

559
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,499
The kind of things that

560
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,207
I bounce off you
and it all makes sense.

561
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,249
I know you well enough
to tell you one thing.

562
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,165
You'll figure it out.

563
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,707
You'll connect the dots,
synthesize the information

564
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,540
in a way few others
in this world can.

565
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:47,040
You always do. It'll be
an amazing thing to see.

566
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:50,499
But I won't be there to see it.

567
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,957
What, then?

568
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,250
This?

569
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:00,582
Just sit here in a nice,
small, well-appointed office,

570
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,790
listen to bullshit all day long

571
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,749
from people who are
half as smart as us?

572
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,457
I don't know. I was thinking
maybe another hedge fund.

573
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,957
Oh, is that right?

574
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,957
Yeah, I was at another one
the other day.

575
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,707
I won't tell you which,
so don't ask.

576
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,749
And the manager played
some heavy game theory on me,

577
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,374
boxed me into a spot,
essentially put himself

578
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,499
in a position to win
no matter what I said.

579
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,082
I know who it is. I can tell
already by what you said.

580
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:26,124
Well, I'm tired of being on the
losing side of that paradigm.

581
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:28,124
- He was looking to hire you?
- Yeah.

582
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,207
That motherfucker is just trying
to poach my most valued...

583
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,666
I'm not your anything.

584
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,040
I'm not gonna kick you out.

585
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,832
But I am asking you
to respect my wishes.

586
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,916
Can you do that?

587
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,250
Okay.

588
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,707
And don't send flowers.

589
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,750
Eva's allergic.

590
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,874
Gene therapy
is finally bearing fruit.

591
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,457
- There's a great company...
- Next.

592
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,790
We buy an algorithm.
I know a guy from Wharton

593
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,040
- with a...

594
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,499
We should go to cash,
take some time off, and...

595
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,207
Okay, fuck this. Do any of you
have juice with Raya?

596
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,457
I could build a model for it.

597
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,040
I don't want to invest in it.
I want to get on it.

598
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,749
- What is that?
- High-end hookup app.

599
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,082
- Tinder for the rich and famous.
- That's so reductive.

600
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,915
It's exclusive,
and it's about connection.

601
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,499
I was saying
with cash on hand...

602
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,082
Stop talking.

603
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,665
I'm not gonna take any of this
dog shit back to Axe.

604
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,249
It's time for you folks to
sharpen your pencils,

605
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,249
and you better come back
with one Traci Lords of an idea.

606
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,457
And if you need that fucking
defined, here it is.

607
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,249
A barely legal,
market-dominating,

608
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,208
brilliant cocksucker of an idea.

609
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,457
Thanks for working
through lunch.

610
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,582
I've got to dump five million
shares of Bluudhorn Steel at 40.

611
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,499
Problem is,
the trade's by appointment.

612
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,290
No broker will take
all five million

613
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,165
and guarantee my price,

614
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:05,040
so I've got five brokers
selling a million each,

615
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,790
and they don't
know about each other.

616
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,082
Are you sure about
the way you're unloading that?

617
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,165
It's kind of shady
and not very efficient.

618
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,999
They'll find out
and ding you later.

619
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,790
I've got to get the price.

620
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,999
You heard what Axe said.
Survive or die.

621
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,207
What if you create
a zero-cost collar?

622
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,415
Right...

623
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,957
Use options to protect the sale.

624
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,082
Buy $40 puts in Bluudhorn,

625
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,749
then sell $45 calls
to offset the purchase.

626
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,374
You've got free protection
at $40.

627
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,207
The maximum downside
is protected.

628
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,457
But now you can be patient,

629
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,415
and you don't have to
lean on the stock.

630
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,207
You're right.

631
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,999
That'll save us ten million
on this trade.

632
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,665
This is why I need to keep you
when your internship's over.

633
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,249
Yes. I'd believe the same thing
were I you.

634
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,082
Oh.
I ordered you lunch.

635
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,207
Vegan.

636
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,249
What makes you think
I'm a vegan?

637
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,665
I don't know.

638
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,124
Everything?

639
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:59,124
All of it?

640
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,332
Fuck.

641
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,249
You're not?

642
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,749
I'll eat it.

643
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,957
Look, I've eliminated slippage
since you've got here.

644
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,124
My trade-cost analysis
is up 150 bips.

645
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,790
And that's before the 10-ball
you just saved me.

646
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,999
It's not a fluke.
It's efficiency.

647
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,749
It's you.

648
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,249
And now you're leaving.

649
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,332
I can't afford that.

650
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,499
I'll die off.

651
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,457
And that's before I blew lunch
with you not being a vegan.

652
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,208
Of course I'm a vegan.

653
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,207
Here's my problem.

654
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,040
The shit that I do to keep most
people after an internship...

655
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,624
Throwing money around,
showing them a good time...

656
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,124
None of that's
gonna work on you.

657
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,457
You mean like hot girls
showing up at my place

658
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,082
and drink till I puke
and all that?

659
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,790
I agree.
That wouldn't work in this case.

660
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,582
So how do I keep you?

661
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,375
You kind of can't.

662
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,082
Just look at him.

663
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,040
The everyman grilling away.

664
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,165
You know, he sent the chef away
tonight

665
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,290
because the two of you
always do this together.

666
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,165
And even though you've frozen
him out the past few months,

667
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,582
he's still counting on it.

668
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,583
That's before I knew
what he was.

669
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:20,707
You're the toughest guy
in the family, no doubt.

670
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:24,249
But I think we both know
what happens if you test me.

671
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,832
Now get out there

672
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,208
and be a human being
to my husband.

673
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,250
Under protest.

674
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,124
Hey, hey.

675
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,500
Mo!
Fuck, you're here.

676
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,707
- What's going on?
- It's good to see you.

677
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,124
It's like a hunting knife.

678
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,415
You rip it open...

679
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,124
Hey, Matt.

680
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,166
Axe.

681
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,415
I'm glad you came.

682
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:01,332
Yeah, of course, man.

683
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,707
You guys know each other, right?
Same precinct?

684
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,124
Different years. Detective.

685
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,749
Long before you became a banker

686
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,499
or a trustee or whatever, Raul.

687
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,624
- Still more police than banker.

688
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,999
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

689
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,124
I had good come-back about you
from the school.

690
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,290
- Oh, how fucking lovely.

691
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,999
Be an easy road to make you
the full-time nurse.

692
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,790
- Yeah?
- Yep.

693
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,874
- What are we talking about?

694
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:29,207
Well, they'd start you at 72k,
something for housing.

695
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,207
And I'll get them up from there.

696
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,499
Come on, Mo.

697
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,624
It'd be so nice to
have you around, man.

698
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,332
Instead of rolling with
these stiffs

699
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,207
that I've got up here
all the time.

700
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,874
Oh, no,

701
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:43,124
it's not much more than
what I'm taking down now,

702
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,249
and it's still
just pulling shifts.

703
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,040
If I'm making a change,
it's got to be bigger.

704
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,665
You know, I need to step up

705
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,457
and score my next chapter,
you know?

706
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,332
Yeah.

707
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,707
I know.

708
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,165
Certain douchebag motorcycle
club was dealing out of

709
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,165
the men's room at the Hendricks.
And these guys were good.

710
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,499
Our undercovers couldn't make
one buy off of them.

711
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,499
So we started sending in teams
to surveil through the ceiling

712
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,707
of the men's room.
And one day I'm up there.

713
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,582
I'm watching.
And I see a deal go down.

714
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,457
I must have been
leaning over too much,

715
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,665
'cause I fell right through
the drop ceiling

716
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,624
and landed right on my ass
in the middle

717
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,040
- of the men's room.

718
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,124
A black man
in an N.Y.P.D. uniform.

719
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,540
I'm like... I look up,

720
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:25,290
and it's a half a dozen
Hells Angels staring down at me.

721
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:28,207
So...

722
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:32,582
They lit in on me with
fists, bottles, boots.

723
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,999
They damn near beat the cop
right out of me.

724
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,999
Barely got out of there alive.

725
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,832
They say it never happened.

726
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,082
Of course not.

727
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,374
But the way it still gets told,
that night end of shift,

728
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,499
every swinging dick
at the station

729
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,457
went back to that bar
with nightsticks,

730
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,290
reduced those fucking bikers
to smudge marks on the floor.

731
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:54,166
No dealing went on in that bar
for a long, long time.

732
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,040
See, back then, it came down
to factions, superior numbers.

733
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,957
When they had them
and I was alone,

734
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,165
they won.

735
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,290
But when we had them,

736
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,040
well, it's hard to defend
against numbers.

737
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,000
That's a lesson
you only have to learn once.

738
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,500
Absolutely.

739
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,207
I need to deploy your
specialized computing skills,

740
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:29,415
can-do attitude, the magic
of your tech nerdistry.

741
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,540
No one's ever said I have
a can-do attitude before.

742
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,290
That's because you hide it
behind a superior, dismissive,

743
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,207
and pessimistic mask,
but I see past all that.

744
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,082
Uh, what do you need?

745
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,499
Raya.

746
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,915
I need you to hack into Raya
and get me an account on there.

747
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,625
I can't do... do that.

748
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,707
- Of course you can.
- I mean, maybe I could,

749
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,457
but that site's encrypted with
a 128-bit Blowfish cipher.

750
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,040
And no brute-force attack
has been

751
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,999
extensive enough to crack it.
There's...

752
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,957
There's no way I can make
a reasonable attempt and still

753
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,749
- complete my other tasks.
- Like what?

754
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,082
Making sure this place
is secure from cyberattack.

755
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,624
- You've already done that.
- But I have to oversee

756
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,040
all our trading software,
all our servers, my team.

757
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,749
And you will.

758
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,916
As soon as you get me onto Raya.

759
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,791
Yes.

760
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,082
Judge DeGiulio!

761
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,749
Mr. Rhoades, sir.
At your service, sir.

762
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,999
Good.
Let me tell you what I need.

763
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,874
I'm not really at your service.

764
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,582
Chuck,
I was quoting "Hamilton."

765
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,207
Ah.
I haven't been able to see it.

766
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,707
What do you need?

767
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,499
There's an investigator named
Dake up here from D.C.

768
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,790
Ooh. That's a hard man.
Good one.

769
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,040
Yeah, terrific.
Yes, I can see that he's good.

770
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,457
I'd like him to be
good and gone.

771
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,332
Now, I need to know who sent him

772
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,125
and what they hope
to accomplish.

773
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,832
Are you familiar with the origin
of the word "billet"?

774
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,374
Is this another
"Hamilton" thing?

775
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,457
- No.
- Well, then, yes.

776
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,124
It came from the French

777
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,915
to mean an order to allow
a soldier to live in your home.

778
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:17,040
But what it's come to mean
is a post or position

779
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,332
and responsibilities
that go along with it.

780
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,540
So my billet is to be a judge

781
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,207
and adjudicate
on various matters

782
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,457
as put forth and et cetera.

783
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,082
It is not, and will never be,

784
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,915
to do your bidding.

785
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,165
I forgot to say please,
didn't I?

786
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:36,082
I'm working on that.

787
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,499
Please?

788
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,249
Always a lovely word to hear,

789
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,249
but I'm not some deputy anymore.

790
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,749
Oh, no.

791
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,082
Uh, I get that and respect it.

792
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:49,540
But we both know why
you're not a deputy anymore,

793
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,165
so I am asking you
to do this one for me.

794
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:55,041
As a final courtesy.

795
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,249
Sure, sir.

796
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,624
Come by my chambers
Friday morning.

797
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,207
I should have information
by then.

798
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,582
And thank y...

799
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,208
You're welcome, Chaz.

800
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,416
Give me your phone.

801
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,040
We need our I.T. staff back
and your focus.

802
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,874
I can't have you phishing
the Internet pointlessly.

803
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,707
I'm logging you on to Raya.

804
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:32,207
- How?
- I'm a member, so I vouch.

805
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,707
You need two reccos.
I got Michael Che to second you.

806
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:37,415
Can't have you distracting
our staff with this bullshit.

807
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,457
- You're a member?
- So are you now.

808
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,040
All I ask is
Chatham House Rule on it.

809
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:45,375
And when you see me on there,
don't fucking tap the heart.

810
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:50,916
Sweet!

811
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:22,124
Mr. Rhoades.

812
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:27,040
So, I'm going through
my initial round of interviews

813
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,499
and all seems,
uh, if not kosher,

814
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,040
then at least within
a reasonable bandwidth.

815
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:36,665
And I'm thinking, you know,
I'm just about out of here.

816
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:37,666
Uh-huh.

817
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:40,207
But...

818
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:43,165
Then I

819
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:46,333
become aware of a payment.

820
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,915
A payment?

821
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,499
That your wife received.

822
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,790
From Axelrod.

823
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,749
An account of hers
that you're a signer on.

824
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,915
Right around, uh,

825
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,665
well, hell, right on

826
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:06,249
the day that you suspended
your investigation into him.

827
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,665
$5 million.

828
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,582
Now,

829
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,207
it may not be a bribe,

830
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,540
but, dang,
if it doesn't look like one

831
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,290
and smell like one.

832
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,915
And if I put my tongue on it,

833
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,915
I bet it tastes like one, too.

834
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:29,915
Yum-bang.

835
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,582
Now, I suppose

836
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,083
you didn't know
anything about that?

837
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:01,499
If we're doing this,
we're supposed to knock,

838
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,249
- not just let ourselves in.
- Uh-huh.

839
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,832
I was gonna let the sitter
get them ready for you.

840
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,415
She still can.

841
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,540
We need to talk.

842
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,624
That's not really
the idea of this.

843
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,165
We have to give each other room.

844
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,540
Yeah, I know.
I'm aware.

845
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,875
Not a social call.

846
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,125
What, then?

847
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:32,207
I understand that we are in
a temporary moment of separation

848
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:36,290
and no longer in the mode
of telling each other

849
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:38,165
our day's events in detail.

850
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:40,124
If we'd been communicating
that well before,

851
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:43,124
we might still be together.

852
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:46,082
Are we putting that on me?

853
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,458
Half of it at least.

854
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,749
But there were some things
that really

855
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,207
ought to have been discussed,

856
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,207
some things that I cannot
imagine keeping to myself.

857
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,249
For instance,
if I had suddenly received

858
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,999
a $5 million
lump-sum payment

859
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,665
the same day that my husband
dropped an investigation

860
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,790
on the man making that payment,

861
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:12,083
I might have fucking managed
to say something about it.

862
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:23,040
I didn't see how that...

863
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:26,207
sequence of events might appear.

864
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,083
Is that an apology?

865
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,915
I didn't mean to put
your reputation in question.

866
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,665
Not just my reputation.

867
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:38,832
My job.

868
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,290
Perhaps my freedom.

869
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,915
Perhaps yours.

870
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,124
Freedom? Pfft.

871
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,665
I am just beginning to remember
what that feels like.

872
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,040
And I'm not gonna let you ruin

873
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:50,415
one of the first free nights
I've had in years.

874
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:54,040
I always knew I'd end up snared
by Axelrod's money. It's poison.

875
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,999
And you don't even need to
ingest it for it to kill you.

876
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,499
- Proximity is enough.
- Well, good for you.

877
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,332
I no longer
have proximity to it,

878
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,040
and you no longer
have proximity to me.

879
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:07,915
Have fun with the children.

880
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,915
Hey, kids, I'm leaving!

881
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,624
Your daddy's here!

882
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,375
I love you!

883
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:22,083
Hey, guys! Here I come!

884
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,415
This place gave me
my first real look

885
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,040
at how the world worked.

886
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,874
I watched people running toward
the betting window

887
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:38,207
with high hopes.

888
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,165
No plan.

889
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,415
Then I'd watch them
walk away from the track

890
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:46,165
ripping up their tickets
in disgust.

891
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,082
That wasn't gonna be me.

892
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,540
You didn't bet?

893
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,374
Oh, I bet.

894
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,499
I bet, but first I figured out

895
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,124
where the sharp action was,

896
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:59,499
where the guys who
had a plan were,

897
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,290
guys who grinded,

898
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,207
take the guesswork out of it.

899
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,040
They knew which drivers
had been rested.

900
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,040
They knew
which horses were ready.

901
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:10,332
And they also knew which ones
were on last legs.

902
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,082
How'd you meet those guys?

903
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:15,165
I didn't at first.

904
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,999
But I figured out

905
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,083
that they always bet late
and they bet heavy.

906
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,999
So I started watching that

907
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,124
instead of that.

908
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:33,707
The numbers told the story.
They always do.

909
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:36,207
I started making bets of my own.

910
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,332
You know, the right ones.

911
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,665
And once I understood
what had happened,

912
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:44,041
I watched the track
to see how it happened.

913
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,124
Strange time for a workout.

914
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,749
Yeah, he comes here
most days of the week.

915
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,207
Likes to run his new prospects
out under the lights,

916
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:57,708
get them used to it.

917
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,749
He's a good driver.

918
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,457
But his father...

919
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,540
His father was
the best there was.

920
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:10,082
True master.
Hall of Fame.

921
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,749
Always finished top three.

922
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,749
Oh, but to you,
top three is never enough.

923
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,999
You don't show. You win.

924
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,540
That I do.

925
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,416
Mine's a different business.

926
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,790
Look,
you and the team are right.

927
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,124
There's too much risk.

928
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:33,207
I could open myself up
to a big loss

929
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,208
if I made a move and miss.

930
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,082
When I used to come down here,

931
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:43,040
I had nothing,
so I-I just figured it out.

932
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:45,333
That you did.

933
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,457
I need Rhoades gone.

934
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,499
Or this will never be over.

935
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,540
My suit alone,

936
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:59,207
it's like me firing a pea
shooter against a Panzer tank

937
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,624
when what we need is a Howitzer.

938
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,250
But I know how we can
get ourselves a Howie.

939
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,124
We find everybody
that he fucked,

940
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,957
who went away aggrieved,

941
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:17,374
people with real grounds,

942
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,207
and we buy up their claims.

943
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,874
Ah.

944
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:24,290
Aggregate the lawsuits.

945
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,124
Where one is weak,
many are strong.

946
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,207
And that's a lesson you'll never
have to learn more than once.

947
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:32,040
It'll be tantamount
to a class-action suit.

948
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,999
Not so easy to ignore.

949
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,999
Not possible to.

950
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,040
The stories won't be about you
anymore. They'll be about him.

951
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:42,708
And the world of shit
that he is in.

952
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,041
You know what you have to do?

953
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,083
I know what I have to do.

954
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:03,124
This guy doesn't really come out
here a few times a week.

955
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,249
No.

956
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,749
He doesn't.

957
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,000
But I wanted to see him run,
so he ran.

958
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,124
Do what I need.

959
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,082
Get it in motion now.

960
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,250
Tonight.

961
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:00,540
- Shit!
- Whoa, whoa!

962
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:03,124
Jesus Christ.

963
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,832
You all right there, guy?

964
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,207
Yeah.
Can you hold this for me?

965
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,999
Yeah. Come on.

966
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,124
Thanks.

967
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,166
You've been served.

968
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,999
With a lawsuit.

969
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,165
One-hundred and twenty-seven
of them.

970
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,333
Sorry, brah.

971
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm being sued.

972
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,040
Apparently by
everyone I've ever met.

973
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:33,624
Didn't make any sense
until I saw...

974
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,958
this one.
Bobby Axelrod.

975
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:42,665
A Bivens Claim for violation
of his Fourth Amendment rights.

976
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:45,124
Malicious prosecution.

977
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,582
And the rest of these
are similar,

978
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,207
and they all came together.

979
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,499
I think he's financing
all of them,

980
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,915
and I have a feeling he's gonna
make this his life's mission.

981
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:59,749
Well, I wish I could say that's
all you'll be fending off,

982
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,165
but D.C. is all over
this Dake investigation,

983
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,999
and Dake has
told the A.G. about

984
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,165
some kind of balloon payment
that has a certain stink to it.

985
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,374
Yeah. To my wife.

986
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,040
Business as usual in her world.

987
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:12,999
I don't imagine
that's how he's spinning it.

988
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,415
Nor do I.

989
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,916
Sort of unspinnable I fear,
Chuck.

990
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,082
Yes?

991
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:31,040
Chuck, I need to see you in D.C.
in my office Thursday.

992
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,750
Yeah.

993
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,125
Yes, General.

994
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:51,207
That was the attorney general
herself.

995
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,957
She's summoned me to Washington.

996
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:57,165
Dake did indeed make her aware
of the balloon payment.

997
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,333
She seems to also
know about this, too.

998
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,124
So I'm to report
to her Thursday...

999
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:10,832
where she will greet me warmly,

1000
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,582
shake me by the hand...

1001
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,208
and then she'll fire me.

1002
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,457
The tip that led to
my investigation was called in

1003
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,999
from a cellphone that
pinged a tower in Yonkers

1004
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,707
in the middle of the night.

1005
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,790
Why do I give a fuck?

1006
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:43,040
Because you were in Yonkers

1007
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:45,707
at the pizzeria
meeting with Axelrod.

1008
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:49,332
And I think whatever you heard
in that meeting

1009
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,040
made you squeamish.

1010
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:55,707
You know what Rhoades is, Bryan.

1011
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,040
You know he should be
out of the job.

1012
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:03,958
And I know you made that call.

1
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:09,053
Previously
on Billions...

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:10,261
The fuck
is this all about?

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:13,512
Site's closed.
Security reasons.

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,804
This is what
it's about, Dad.

5
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:17,679
Head of the Board of
Elections is deciding

6
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:19,512
whether to allow
blockchain technology-

7
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,470
voting from
mobile phones.

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,178
Chuck, welcome.

9
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,804
I thought this was
to be our meeting-

10
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:27,720
The DOJ has grave concerns
about mobile voting-

11
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,595
Uh. You mean
Jock Jeffcoat does.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,637
Sanford Bensinger
is on the phone.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,929
Sandy.

14
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,345
The NFL
is turning you down.

15
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:38,804
Sports franchises are how we
knight people in this country.

16
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:41,178
And you're not royalty.

17
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,095
They were finally fed up
with your legal troubles-

18
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:44,512
Thank you for
the firefighter prompt.

19
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,095
I'm happy it was useful.

20
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:48,261
I need you to track down

21
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:49,345
some old session notes.

22
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:52,220
All my files for Taylor Mason.

23
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,512
You're not here to ask me to
speak at a conference, are you?

24
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,804
There have been
accusations of malpractice.

25
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,470
Dr. Rhoades, your medical
license is under review.

26
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:03,095
dramatic music

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

28
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:21,804
You can't
allow it to happen.

29
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,261
You can't let them
strip me of my license.

30
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,220
The Medical Board is not
under my jurisdiction.

31
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,720
What you're asking-

32
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,220
Is something you can do.

33
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,053
Make them drop
the inquest?

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,929
If I can pull it off,
it'll be nearly impossible.

35
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,136
And if it goes sideways,
I'm-

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,970
You wanted to know
what you could do

37
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,428
to make things better
between us.

38
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:40,762
This is it.

39
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,929
So, I do this thing,

40
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,261
and then what,
we're all the way back?

41
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:46,720
Is that the promise?

42
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,095
I can promise
you this:

43
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:49,804
bargaining never
won a woman back.

44
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,762
But selfless
acts have.

45
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,303
I don't need Chuck
Rhoades the lawyer.

46
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,053
Or the husband.
Or the power bottom.

47
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,053
I need Chuck Rhoades
the killer.

48
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,970
You've judged me
for being that,

49
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:07,887
criticized me,
reviled me-

50
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,804
but now, when it's
on your behalf-

51
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,845
you're willing to
call upon it.

52
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,261
To let it out.
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,470
Well, you have to want
the whole package, Wendy.

54
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,804
As I do with you.

55
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,178
Or what the devil
are we?

56
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,720
Right now I don't-
I don't know what I am.

57
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:24,845
I state that freely
and without pride.

58
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,428
But you are a killer.

59
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,053
You-You kill for
yourself all the time.

60
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,845
So go kill for me.

61
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,845
I'm giving you license
to use the part of yourself

62
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,053
that makes you feel
most alive.

63
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:37,387
Because it serves you.

64
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,595
I've done wrong.

65
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:45,220
Turned myself into that which
I swore I would never be.

66
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,595
I had to.
And, uh...

67
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,762
It worked.

68
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:54,595
And yes, I-I learned something
about myself that is unpleasant.

69
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,428
But now I need to
turn myself back into

70
00:02:56,512 --> 00:03:00,220
who I'm supposed to be-
if that's even possible.

71
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:03,220
But I can't do that
if I'm not a doctor.

72
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:08,011
So, help me, Chuck,
or I'm fucking lost.

73
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,178
Don't fuck with the
State Medical Board, Chuck.

74
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,470
You're still consolidating your
power. Extending your reach.

75
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:18,428
If you try to manipulate
the board and fail-

76
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,470
it'll be the one scandal
too many,

77
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:23,345
and too early,
that ends your career.

78
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,679
So, instead,
prepare a defense for Wendy.

79
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,679
Let the hearing happen.
Win it.

80
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,303
That's the smart approach.

81
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,512
Well. This isn't about
the smart move.

82
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,136
It's about what
my father would call:

83
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,553
"The future of my dynasty."

84
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,220
The marriage.

85
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,095
I can't keep
shuffling along

86
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,804
with muttered apologies
and half measures.

87
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,178
I need to
change the paradigm.

88
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,178
A big move.

89
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:47,637
Get back to zero.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,553
If I know my man, you have
a big move at the ready.

91
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,303
I know a former
State Board member

92
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,136
who's acquainted
with every crevice

93
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,387
and loophole of their
disciplinary procedures.

94
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,679
Why didn't you
start there?

95
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:01,387
Because
I put him in prison.

96
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,679
Merle Haggard's
"Sing Me Back Home"

97
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,011
The warden led a prisoner

98
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:18,345
Down the hallway to his doom

99
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:20,387
And I stood up

100
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,595
To say goodbye
like all the rest

101
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:31,303
And I heard him
tell the warden

102
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:35,553
Just before
he reached my cell

103
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:39,136
"Let my guitar-playing
friend"

104
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,178
"Do my request"

105
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:48,553
Let him sing me back home

106
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:53,428
With a song I used to hear

107
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:58,345
Sing me back home
before I die

108
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,345
You'd think after
so much time in this place,

109
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,053
I'd be happy
to see anyone.

110
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,428
Oh. I don't fool myself that
I bring any measure of joy

111
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:08,553
to most with whom
I daily interact.

112
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,553
That's the prosecutor's curse.

113
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,637
Like a dentist without
the laughing gas.

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,387
Do know what we called dentists
in medical school?

115
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,261
"Little brains."
Like in Defending Your Life.

116
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:23,470
The lawyers, we called
"little hearts."

117
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:26,553
Which I now know gave them
too much credit.

118
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,011
Your compatriots in here

119
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,595
must love the Albert Brooks
references.

120
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,387
Oh. You'd be surprised.
I'm useful to them,

121
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,679
tend to them
when they get ill,

122
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:36,553
tell them how to get into the
infirmary and off work detail,

123
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,553
teach 'em what to say to get
the drugs they want there.

124
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,261
So they pretty much
follow along,

125
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,970
or try to, no matter what
I'm talking about.

126
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:46,095
Perhaps I can be
useful to you.

127
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,470
That's why
I came here today.

128
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,470
No. You came because
there must be

129
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:51,512
some way you believe
I can be of use to you.

130
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:54,679
And there's something you think
that I need in trade.

131
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,220
But that didn't work out so well
for me last time.

132
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,929
That's one way to see it.

133
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,845
The other is that
the eleven million dollars did,

134
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,303
as promised,
stay in your bank account.

135
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:09,053
So that your wife and kids
are well taken care of.

136
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,887
Well, that brought me more peace
before she divorced me.

137
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,720
And when she was still
letting the kids visit me.

138
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:18,470
Sorry to hear that.

139
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,095
But I know that you don't
want my sympathy.

140
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:24,387
Thankfully, I may be able to
offer you more than that-

141
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,220
if you can offer
some cooperation.

142
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,512
A close acquaintance-
a medical doctor-

143
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,053
like you were
and perhaps might be again-

144
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:41,512
is facing
disciplinary proceedings.

145
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:45,428
She needs help shutting them
down before she has to appear.

146
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,095
You want me to be
your Hannibal Lecter.

147
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,762
I need pressure points
on committee members.

148
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,929
So I can press 'em.

149
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:57,762
Well. Like Dr. Lecter, I can put
practicality above vengeance.

150
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,679
So, sure, Chuck,
we can negotiate.

151
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,178
Get me out of here.
Get me free.

152
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:04,095
So I can remind my children
of who I really am.

153
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,720
And then I'll help.

154
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,220
That I cannot do.

155
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,637
I am no longer
US Attorney.

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,679
But I do sit a powerful throne,
attended by powerful friends.

157
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:19,512
So I will work, tirelessly,
to make it so, over time.

158
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:22,929
Yeah. I don't see how
I can trust you on that.

159
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:26,136
Again, I did let you keep
the eleven million.

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,595
It was never mine.

161
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:32,845
And I would gladly give it back
to be freed of all of this.

162
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,762
So...

163
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,887
No.

164
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,470
If I'm your best bet,
it seems all you can do

165
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:46,053
is go home
and make your wife miserable.

166
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:49,303
As I have mine.

167
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,261
Yeah.
Don't be surprised.

168
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,053
There's at least one old
colleague on the outside

169
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,387
I still correspond with.

170
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,762
Positively
Lecter-like.

171
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:07,553
dramatic music

172
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,637
If I hear you call
anyone on the Board,

173
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,220
try to make this
harder for her,

174
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:15,637
your wife-ex-
whatever-

175
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
will be prosecuted for
ill gotten gains

176
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,178
on that eleven million

177
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:25,970
and your kids will end up living
in a fucking housing project.

178
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:33,428
Do we understand each other,
Clarice?

179
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,428
Seen better days.

180
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:55,720
It will again,
once I do my magic.

181
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:58,970
First thing: "fire every one of
these cocksuckers."

182
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,887
Hoffa.

183
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,637
"You're gonna can
a lot of people,

184
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,387
make sure you do it
on the first day.

185
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,428
That way, the ones that are left
don't feel insecure, you see.

186
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,261
What they feel
is grateful."

187
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:13,053
That's a sad view
of how people tick.

188
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,720
But true. So when we walk
into that boardroom-

189
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,136
I can't fire them.

190
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,011
I have to show stability
in the Street.

191
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:22,428
Especially since I'm making
so many changes to the business.

192
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,011
I'll run you through
all the numbers

193
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,220
before tomorrow's
board meeting.

194
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,595
Tomorrow is
Rebecca Cantu's first day

195
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,095
as CEO of Saler's.

196
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,428
I want it to be
a bad one for her-

197
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,136
Which will ruin Bobby Axelrod's
fucking day too.

198
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,428
I want her to think
the board is hers,

199
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,261
then find out
it's really mine.

200
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,679
We've met with three of the
largest individual stakeholders

201
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:45,845
and accumulated a position,
but not enough to be a threat.

202
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,887
After all the shares Axe
and Cantu bought up,

203
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,512
there's not much left
out there we can get

204
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,220
without causing the price
to skyrocket.

205
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:52,762
But there is
a white whale out there-

206
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,470
Saler's biggest debtholder-

207
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,095
and you haven't put his blubber
within reach.

208
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,887
You're talking about
Sanford Bensinger,

209
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,303
Mr. Giving Oath,
the "American Champion."

210
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,553
I am.

211
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,887
Good.
Grab your harpoon.

212
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,679
You got the meeting
with Bensinger?

213
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:08,845
I'm taking his son, Landry,
to breakfast.

214
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,637
He'll get us the meeting.

215
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,261
Tomorrow morning?

216
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,303
Tonight. And you're
coming with, Taylor.

217
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,303
No work allowed
on site.

218
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,637
Does it look like I'm here
to rivet the girders?

219
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,637
Family business.

220
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:37,512
I'm getting
starved out.

221
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,303
If we don't
resume work here soon,

222
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,387
the-the-the loans
are gonna crush me

223
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,553
like a steel worker
in a hydraulic press.

224
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,762
What would you
have me do?

225
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,595
Prostrate myself
before Jock and Connerty?

226
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,428
Hell no!
Find a way to hurt them back.

227
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,970
Get them into the same kind of
vise that they have us in.

228
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,720
And then crank the handle
so hard they beg you to relent.

229
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:00,637
And they relent
in return.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,804
I need men
and trucks in here.

231
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:07,679
Hoh man, did the wind
just change?

232
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:11,929
What in God's name
is that smell? It's brutal...

233
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,428
It's the fucking
porta potties!

234
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:16,762
I need them
carted out of here.

235
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,887
Whatever it is
construction workers consume,

236
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,929
their night soil is not
fit for breathing.

237
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,011
I've taken to putting Vicks
under my nose

238
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,762
to mask the stench.

239
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,303
Ah.

240
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,512
Dad...

241
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,345
where does it
normally go?

242
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,637
The shit?

243
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah.

244
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,470
Fuck if I know.
It gets trucked out of here.

245
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,387
I don't know
where it ends up.

246
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,345
dramatic music

247
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:44,011
Where are you going?

248
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,845
To crank.

249
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,637
So they beg.

250
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:58,637
Hoses.

251
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Long, industrial hoses,
called cakasuckas on job sites,

252
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,845
extract the waste
from the portajohns

253
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,512
into specially treated
sanitation trucks.

254
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,303
Goes into
the city sewage system

255
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:10,053
where it is dehydrated into
a solid and compressed...

256
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,095
Yeah, yeah, and eventually
it all winds up in a landfill.

257
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:13,970
Far, far away
from New York.

258
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:16,178
Via the way of
John Henry's hammer.

259
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:18,136
A long cross-country
train ride.

260
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,679
To here.

261
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:23,970
Karl, we're about to
redraw the route

262
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,095
for this foul piece
of transport.

263
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:33,595
Thank you.

264
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,220
You can go.

265
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,178
No.

266
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:39,637
I get to watch.

267
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,595
How was it?

268
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,637
Go.

269
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,178
You're right.

270
00:12:57,261 --> 00:13:00,679
Sometimes words can't speak
what we both know.

271
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:03,679
There's this site,
Beautiful Agony,

272
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,595
that is all about
the O face,

273
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,845
and looking at you right now
I can sense-

274
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,428
You are like an over-caffeinated
serial killer.

275
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:13,053
Go!

276
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:18,470
We should talk about what
happened in the meditation room.

277
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:22,261
I hit you in the face.

278
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,845
You held me.

279
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,303
We bonded.

280
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,095
We should bond
some more.

281
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:31,136
Drinks, after work tonight,
just the two of us.

282
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,929
I usually only go out with
people who have one wife.

283
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,345
There was vibe.
I don't mistake vibe.

284
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:40,428
You got a stiffie because
your head was between my tits.

285
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:41,553
That's not vibe.

286
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:42,845
It is where I come from.

287
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,929
Where's that, 1954?

288
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,929
It's happening again.

289
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,178
The droogs are starting to
fall all over themselves,

290
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:58,970
fall over me.

291
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,095
I have noticed a certain

292
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,970
increased level of interest
on the floor.

293
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,428
Since I mentioned getting
"railed" at my birthday.

294
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,970
I see it-the way Spyros
brings you that cortado

295
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:13,011
every day at 11,
lingers by your desk...

296
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:16,762
At least chatty Lurch
makes good fucking coffee.

297
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:18,929
But today
it was Dollar Bill.

298
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,637
And that's different.

299
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,220
You want to know
the best way to blow him off

300
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,720
without fucking up
the workplace?

301
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,887
More like: the best way
to do the thing

302
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,887
without fucking up
the workplace.

303
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,595
Are you thinking of him as
a love partner or a sex partner?

304
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,387
When you put it that way,
I'm thinking about yakking-

305
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:46,011
I'm feeling a bit
fucked...over.

306
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,887
And a little afraid
of what I might do.

307
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,387
I like the way you're
owning that, Ben Kim.

308
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,053
But I am in session.

309
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:54,261
Bonnie should hear this.
It concerns her, too.

310
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:59,387
I've just learned Axe Cap
maintains a fund for employees.

311
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,720
Yeah, that's why
we fucking work here.

312
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,261
To get our money
invested here

313
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:04,804
and beat everyone
else's returns.

314
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:08,720
No, a separate, elite fund
called Flagship.

315
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,261
Where returns are,
apparently,

316
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,136
three times greater
than the main fund.

317
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,303
But only "key employees"
are in it.

318
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:18,845
I'm a PM...
and I'm not.

319
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:21,011
Wendy,
are you in it?

320
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:23,387
I haven't heard anyone
mention Flagship in years.

321
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,470
I think Axe liquidated
funds like that

322
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:27,845
when he ran into
his legal troubles.

323
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,303
So I should let go
of this anger?

324
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,220
Or hold onto it for the day
and see where it takes you.

325
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:37,011
I'll let it go.

326
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:38,428
Thanks, Wendy.

327
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,345
You didn't
answer his question.

328
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,220
I think I did.

329
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,470
Not fully.

330
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:51,428
Not the part about whether
you were invested in Flagship.

331
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:54,011
Didn't I?
Huh.

332
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,720
How 'bout yours?
Did I answer those?

333
00:15:55,804 --> 00:16:00,887
Yeah. I know just what I need to
do with Dollar Bill now.

334
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,553
dramatic music

335
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,595
We're on, buddy.

336
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,095
Vibe.

337
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:15,929
I fuckin' knew it.

338
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,553
Name the place.

339
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,345
How about, "I Thought
You Were a Real Man,

340
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,720
So You Fuckin' Name It."

341
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,970
You got room
for improvement.

342
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:33,428
Not much.

343
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:38,637
I am kicking ass
and taking names.

344
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Only I ran out of names,

345
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,762
so now it's just
ass-kicking all the time.

346
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:44,095
Join the club.

347
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,053
Is it an exclusive one?

348
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,679
You know it.

349
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:51,220
Because I like entrée.

350
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:57,220
There's another exclusive club
I'd like to be in-

351
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:01,970
the Flagship Fund.

352
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,470
How the fuck do you know
about Flagship?

353
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:06,929
First rule of Flagship is
you don't talk about Flagship.

354
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,929
You should know it was
talked about to me.

355
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,970
Someone influential
was whispering

356
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,637
that it might be
on my horizon.

357
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,220
Huh.

358
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,553
Yeah, I could
see that for you.

359
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,178
If you keep it up-

360
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:22,595
What are the odds of me not?

361
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,261
Just saying-
it is a big deal though.

362
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,637
You gotta be like Eric Roberts
and Chris Penn-

363
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,512
Best of the Best.

364
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,845
So you're in?

365
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,595
Fuck yeah,
ever since I...uh...

366
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,595
showed Axe how I always
manage to come through.

367
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,845
Alongside
Axe and Wags...

368
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,345
And Wendy, yeah.

369
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,845
And the rewards
are substantial?

370
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,929
Big enough to afford
two families,

371
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:55,428
with two sets of kids,
all with straight teeth.

372
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:58,720
dramatic music

373
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,011
How, with your vast knowledge
of NYC nightlife,

374
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:10,470
did you settle
on this place?

375
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,679
It'll make more sense
to you soon.

376
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,845
Never mention his dad.

377
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:22,679
Never mention business.

378
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:23,929
Unless you get him to.

379
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,261
Then how am I gonna-

380
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,428
By being yourself.

381
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,220
Wow.

382
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:29,428
This place.

383
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:30,595
The colors.

384
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,970
Throwback.

385
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:33,553
I've never
been here before.

386
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,595
Taylor picked it.

387
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,011
You did, huh?

388
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,428
Yeah. I dig the ironic
camp of the place.

389
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:44,220
Nope. I saw your face
when you walked in.

390
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,595
You weren't smiling
ironically.

391
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,345
You were taken with it.
As I am.

392
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:48,720
It makes me
get back in touch

393
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,011
with the child-like
part of myself.

394
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,136
Not childish.
Child-like.

395
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,679
I embrace
that part of me.

396
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:55,387
It's the most creative,
most engaged part,

397
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,887
the part that continues to push
the rest of me to grow.

398
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,428
Yeah. Yes.
That's right.

399
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:03,220
What's more evocative
than the smell

400
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:05,261
of your favorite cereal
from when you were a kid.

401
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,887
I don't know why I said
that ironic thing.

402
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,261
Because you are human,

403
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,261
and we are here in this city,
at this time.

404
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,637
You were worried
you gave yourself away.

405
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,303
Don't worry. You did.
And it was great to see.

406
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,512
What was your flavor?

407
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,595
Honey Smacks.

408
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,136
When I was a kid, I only got to
eat cereal once a week.

409
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,303
My father wanted me to have
better habits than he did.

410
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,053
I still feel a little guilty
when I eat it.

411
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,929
But I love it.

412
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:32,887
And this place.

413
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,011
You nailed me, Taylor.
That was impressive.

414
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,011
Get to know
each other.

415
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,345
Taylor, I'll circle back.

416
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:42,845
Frosted Flakes for me.

417
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,845
Grrreeeeat!

418
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:46,470
dramatic music

419
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,887
Lauren, you were right.

420
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,428
I'll set up the meeting.

421
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,929
No guarantees
beyond that.

422
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:58,553
My father sees things I don't,
which is why he is who he is.

423
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:01,053
But I feel comfortable
getting you in the room.

424
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,345
That was a big
fucking risk you took,

425
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,345
going off book like that
without telling me.

426
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:12,512
Nah.
I knew you'd crush it.

427
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,845
It was fun as hell watching you
think on the fly like that.

428
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,303
You just come alive
to the challenge.

429
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,220
And then seeing him
have that feeling of

430
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:28,053
someone recognizing
who he really was.

431
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:32,387
You picked up on
all that, huh?

432
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,470
Think I like knowing
you're watching that closely.

433
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:40,261
So, nah, that wasn't
a risk at all.

434
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:46,136
But this-this is.

435
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:53,136
soft music

436
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,470
We broke
some rules here.

437
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:22,595
Must be why
it was so much fun.

438
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,428
For the record
I kissed you first.

439
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:28,387
But maybe we don't mention this
to Sara either way-

440
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:31,845
Don't mention what to me?

441
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:34,303
Lauren's got some moves

442
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,136
that don't include
shots and nightclubs.

443
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,345
She landed us
the Bensinger meeting

444
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,970
in a very
child-friendly way.

445
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,762
Nice. Good to know.

446
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:46,428
Yeah, but keep it low,
I don't want to ruin my rep.

447
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,428
dramatic music

448
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,970
State Attorney General
Rhoades,

449
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,470
what causes you to
darken my doorstep?

450
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:59,762
Like Moses giving
Pharaoh a chance

451
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:02,762
before the plagues were visited
upon Egypt, I come to-

452
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:06,261
When heathens quoth from
the book of the Good, I recoil.

453
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:09,595
Still.
Heed my word.

454
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,261
Don't make
Pharaoh's mistake.

455
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,970
You want me to
remove the blockade.

456
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:17,887
And if I don't, what?

457
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,595
Pestilence? Locusts?

458
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,845
You will be visited by
horrors of that scope.

459
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,220
Yes.
As will your family.

460
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,887
Since you have
encumbered mine.

461
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,470
So. Simply free my father
from the bonds-

462
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:31,095
Well, first: if the Almighty is
speaking through one of us,

463
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:33,053
I can assure you,
it's me.

464
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,845
Because I kneel before him.

465
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,553
On the daily.
Hmm.

466
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:39,887
Second: He's the only one
I get on my knees for.

467
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,261
Or ever will.

468
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:43,345
I don't ask for
your bended knee.

469
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,261
Only that you take it
off my father's neck.

470
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,428
You put your pappy
in this position, Chuck,

471
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:50,095
when you stood against me.

472
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:52,345
And now
he pays the price.

473
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:55,220
How dare you fucking
come down here

474
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:57,970
from that cesspool of a city
to threaten me.

475
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:00,303
I can even smell it on ya
a little-

476
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:02,512
Oh, you think you can smell
all that on me now?

477
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:05,637
'S right.
Putrefying my pristine air.

478
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,804
As do your perversions
of scripture.

479
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,345
That is the 12:02.

480
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,804
That is your cue
to vamoose.

481
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:20,845
Now, you best
get on out of here.

482
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,595
You're right.

483
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,303
Scent of Southern magnolias
surrounds you here.

484
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,470
Mmm!

485
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:32,053
Positively
redolent of 'em.

486
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:34,261
dramatic music

487
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:41,845
Alright everybody,
let's do this.

488
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:46,845
I'm going to need to withdraw
from the board.

489
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:47,929
Me, too.

490
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,095
The fuck?
How come?

491
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,679
We sold our shares.
Deal just came through.

492
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,512
Nice premium,
couldn't pass it up.

493
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:57,553
You bailed on me without even
hearing my plan.

494
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,595
Who'd you sell to?

495
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,345
I'd prefer not to say-

496
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:04,345
Oh, I'm gonna
find out anyway.

497
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:06,804
And when I do,
I'm gonna turn my focus

498
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:10,178
from this business, onto each
of your personal holdings.

499
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:13,553
And think about just how
I can take them to zero.

500
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm gonna run you down
into the dirt.

501
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:18,970
And I'm gonna smile like
the Joker while I do it.

502
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:21,845
Taylor Mason.

503
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,345
Mason's meeting
with Sanford Bensinger,

504
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,428
they're going to
have control.

505
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:30,804
Resignations
fucking accepted.

506
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:35,095
This meeting is postponed until
the board is reconstituted.

507
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,428
With the amount of convertible
debt Bensinger controls,

508
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,261
he's our largest creditor.

509
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:46,261
He can convert it into enough
shares to dwarf our position.

510
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:49,970
Then we'll get diluted
and our voting power shrinks.

511
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,720
If he backs Taylor
they can run the company

512
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:54,136
right from underneath me.
Or fire me.

513
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,929
Kind of move he's made
many fucking times.

514
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,011
You know him?

515
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,178
Well. Maybe we can go
sue for peace. Work him.

516
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:01,553
I do know him.

517
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:03,345
But the kind of peace
that he'll grant

518
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:04,970
is the type that has
my head on a pike.

519
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:06,970
You have a remarkable
way with people.

520
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:08,595
Thank you.

521
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,387
But believe me,
we can't work this guy.

522
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,595
No, it's time
to punish him.

523
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,553
Okay, everybody, take
a nice, big, deep breath in.

524
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,845
Roll your shoulders
all the way up and back.

525
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,762
We got the final
stretch of class.

526
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:31,220
It's never coast,
never quit.

527
00:25:31,303 --> 00:25:35,261
I need everything you got
all the way until the end.

528
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:38,178
In three, two, let's go!

529
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:50,970
That's five, four,
three, two, one!

530
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,679
Done!

531
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,970
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

532
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:04,845
Dr. Gus.

533
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,011
Yeah.

534
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,011
G-man can pedal!

535
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:10,470
Thought I had you.

536
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,470
Yeah?
Yeah.

537
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:15,679
Now, how often do you say
that...and turn out to be wrong?

538
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:17,095
Next time,
I'll want it more.

539
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:19,303
It's not enough
to want it more.

540
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:21,679
I need to want it most?

541
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:24,512
No.

542
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:28,679
You need to sharpen your odachi
and slice a hole in the universe

543
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:30,470
between you
and where you're going.

544
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:31,845
And if you don't
cut down everyone

545
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,720
and everything
that gets in your way,

546
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:36,804
then they will return
and they will cut you to shreds

547
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,595
and then they will cover
those shreds in bukkake.

548
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,053
dramatic music

549
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,053
Whoo!

550
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:51,095
These mayors...

551
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,720
We need easements on
their rail corridors.

552
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:55,637
So they need to be
put to a decision:

553
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,470
the sweet smell
of honeysuckle.

554
00:26:57,553 --> 00:26:59,345
Or the other.

555
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:02,053
Warm 'em up and invite
each of 'em to a phone call

556
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:03,762
upon which we give 'em
what they need.

557
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,011
And threaten 'em
if they don't take it.

558
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:10,512
Headlocking a bunch of
backwoods mayors, sounds grand.

559
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,053
Mm.
Pizza or Thai?

560
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:15,011
I too have a dinner
to attend.

561
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:17,345
Bon appétit.

562
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:21,095
Happy birthday, Kevin.

563
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:23,553
Thanks, Grandpa.

564
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:25,929
It's a fucking slinky.

565
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,762
Now leave us alone
and make some fun out of that

566
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,679
with your hands
and some hardwood stairs, huh?

567
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:34,345
If he's still playing with it
tomorrow,

568
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:36,970
put all of your energies
into the girl.

569
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:39,595
I have energies enough for
all the people I love.

570
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,345
Do you?
Because I haven't heard anything

571
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,804
about a matter of
great personal importance.

572
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,845
I might, in fact,
say the same thing.

573
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,762
Well...

574
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,845
I always thought you two,
coming together,

575
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:57,470
united in a common cause
would be a good thing but-

576
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,220
But nothing.

577
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,720
Which is what I gather you're
delivering for each of us.

578
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,637
I assure you

579
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,804
I am laboring on
both of your causes.

580
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,595
Save your assurance

581
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,720
for those not so well versed
in your bullshit.

582
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,595
Normally, I'd be aghast

583
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:16,637
at a father speaking to
his son that way,

584
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,428
but I know the motivational
power you hold over him.

585
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:22,303
Sure, on the inside he may be
saying: "Fuck the old man."

586
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:23,720
Screaming it.

587
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,261
But he always
comes through.

588
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:27,261
The need for your love.

589
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:28,970
The shame
in not delivering...

590
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:31,887
And, like a country doctor

591
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,428
with an outbreak across
the shire to deal with,

592
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,845
I'm gonna get back
to fucking work.

593
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:46,470
Grateful Dead's
"Casey Jones"

594
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:50,345
Driving that train

595
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,220
High on cocaine

596
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:57,679
Casey Jones, you better
watch your speed

597
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,387
Trouble ahead

598
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,553
Trouble behind

599
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:07,553
And you know that notion
just crossed my mind

600
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:17,428
This old engine
makes it on time

601
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:22,220
Leaves Central Station
'bout a quarter to nine

602
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:26,470
Hits River Junction
at seventeen two

603
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:31,595
At a quarter to ten you know
it's travelin' again

604
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,387
Driving that train

605
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,428
High on cocaine

606
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:39,011
Casey Jones, you better
watch your speed

607
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,470
Hall said a Chinese consortium
is in town

608
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,095
to buy
the Chrysler Building.

609
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:45,303
Which is why
Bensinger is in town.

610
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:47,929
So he's not just here to fuck
with me on Rebecca's company?

611
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,929
He wants to keep it
out of Chinese hands.

612
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,095
He's planning to
purchase it preemptively.

613
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:54,220
Part of his little campaign
to preserve the nation.

614
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:57,095
Sure. And he'll do it
without fanfare, too.

615
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:58,512
That's what
he'll say anyway.

616
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,220
That he wants
no recognition for it.

617
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,220
But somehow,
he'll get it.

618
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:05,970
Or maybe he won't,
huh?

619
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,929
Yeah.

620
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,679
The Flagship Fund
is "choice."

621
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,887
And we should demand
our inclusion.

622
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,387
Wendy misled me?

623
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,970
That's how I knew
what was going on.

624
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,053
Maybe it's not my time.

625
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:25,303
Maybe if I wait
and keep my head down,

626
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:26,637
I'll be rewarded
down the line.

627
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,178
Said every
factory worker ever

628
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,720
before watching his job
disappear,

629
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:31,095
then going home
to beat his wife.

630
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:34,136
Tell me you're just fine
with this caste system.

631
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,595
Jesus. I don't think that's
an okay thing to say.

632
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,053
Trying to make you angry enough
to fucking do something.

633
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,553
You good being salarymen
in this place?

634
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:46,512
I bust my ass.
I want my due.

635
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,970
Yeah, seems right.

636
00:30:50,053 --> 00:30:51,720
We're in.

637
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:55,762
up-tempo music

638
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,595
A lot of physical force goes
into pulling a shot of espresso,

639
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,136
and sometimes the torque
of said pull,

640
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,136
leads to a follow-through arc
where one's hand could

641
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,136
accidentally graze
the outer contours

642
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,929
of a receptionist's
mammary.

643
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,845
Whatever the fuck that is about,
take it to your grave.

644
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:19,720
You're not in trouble.
At this moment.

645
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,720
In fact, you are
urgently needed.

646
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:25,553
How may I be of service,
fair maiden?

647
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:27,136
Leadership.

648
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,845
To take our demands
to Axe.

649
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,261
You have his ear.

650
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:35,011
My words do
traverse that regal canal

651
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:37,762
like a vaporetto gliding
to the Piazza San Marco.

652
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:43,136
Yes,
you are our man.

653
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,178
dramatic music

654
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:53,637
You know how many people
jumped from those buildings

655
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,220
to their deaths
on Black Tuesday?

656
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,595
Not a one.

657
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,470
But people were so
upset with the banks,

658
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,553
they wanted to believe.

659
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,053
What will the future
believe about

660
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:05,929
people who partnered
with Bobby Axelrod?

661
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:09,220
I think you know
he's not my partner.

662
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,011
Quite the opposite.

663
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,470
But if you support
the Saler's board

664
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:15,387
under Rebecca Cantu,
you are supporting him.

665
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,595
My son said
you had a direct

666
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,679
and incisive way
of looking at things.

667
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,845
I've cultivated that
within myself.

668
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,929
And your son is
a complete person.

669
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:27,303
Not easy to achieve in a child
raised with billions.

670
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:29,887
A credit to you both.

671
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,845
Let's say I didn't want
to support Axe.

672
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:35,595
Let's say I wanted
to pay him back

673
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,929
in trouble and pain
for the high crimes

674
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,970
and misdemeanors
he's committed against me.

675
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:42,261
Then support me.

676
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:44,512
Convert your debt into shares
and back me with them.

677
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,261
I'm coming out shooting.
So's he.

678
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:48,053
When we tally up the bodies,
it'll be a long ledger.

679
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:50,136
But if you don't want it
to include Saler's,

680
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,387
as I believe you don't,
because of your status,

681
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm your best
and only choice.

682
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:57,470
dramatic music

683
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:06,637
Why is he
our man?

684
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,553
Because of what they thought
about Rambo-

685
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:11,970
He's got PTSD and he's going to
tear apart the entire office?

686
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:14,053
No, they thought
he was expendable.

687
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:15,970
If he gets cut down
it's only him we've lost.

688
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,053
Spyros.

689
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,011
I don't like it
when you come in here.

690
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:33,220
Especially don't like it
when you're smiling.

691
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,095
I smile
the people's smile.

692
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:39,011
For I am here, not in my
capacity as your grand vizier,

693
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:41,053
but to bring
their demands unto you.

694
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,637
Demands?

695
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,553
One demand really.

696
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,428
The Fundo De Flagship.

697
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:48,053
What about it?

698
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:49,762
That's a hands-off
situation.

699
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,679
Access for all
Axe Cappers.

700
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:57,887
And everyone out there

701
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,512
is on board with
this campaign of yours?

702
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:11,595
I know: "This is too much power
for one man to have."

703
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,136
But I gots it.

704
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,970
Spyros. Most who are first
pay the price.

705
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:21,220
Very few exceptions:
Maybe Vaclav Havel?

706
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:22,637
Lech Walesa?

707
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,679
The tightrope guy?

708
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,887
The Flying-

709
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,512
No, you simp.

710
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,845
Write down those names
and look 'em up later.

711
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,553
I feel they could've
pulled this off.

712
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,178
You can't.

713
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:41,178
Now,
had you come up here

714
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:43,595
and asked me the path
to the Flagship Fund,

715
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,970
I would have told you...
you are compliance,

716
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,345
you don't make enough,
and you are never getting in.

717
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:51,345
Though the others could have
worked their way in.

718
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:55,970
But since you rolled heavy,
no one is getting in ever again.

719
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,178
There is no
Flagship Fund.

720
00:34:58,261 --> 00:34:59,929
It's a thing
of the past.

721
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,804
Fucking dissolved.

722
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:04,011
Everyone can eat
what they kill.

723
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,053
And they can invest
in the main fund,

724
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:09,095
side by side
with our clients.

725
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:12,220
Now get out of here before
I don't even let you do that.

726
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,595
dramatic music

727
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,011
Is buying this building
so the Chinese can't

728
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,512
part of
a nationalistic impulse?

729
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:35,345
Don't forget you're not
a reporter at the moment-

730
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:37,053
you're my ghostwriter.

731
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,428
My WW Beauchamp.

732
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,845
I still have to
ask the questions,

733
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,679
to get to your mindset.

734
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:45,220
The question shouldn't deal with
nastiness like nationalism.

735
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:48,053
Some things should remain
American owned.

736
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:50,053
Our greatest buildings
among them.

737
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:52,637
Which is why
I'm buying this one.

738
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,720
And why the book is gonna be
called "American Champion."

739
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:57,887
You get all that?

740
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,428
Yes, sir.
Great.

741
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:01,220
Pleasure doing business
with you, Gary.

742
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:03,637
Enjoy Montana.

743
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,387
Sanford, I'm sorry
I wasted you a trip.

744
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,428
But-
Well, this is awkward.

745
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,303
He sold to
the higher bidder.

746
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:15,512
You just made
a world class mistake.

747
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:17,679
The fact is,
we overpaid.

748
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,053
I didn't catch your-

749
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,804
Why do you give a darn,
Sandy?

750
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,845
Your priority was to keep this
building in American hands.

751
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,387
And that's where
it is.

752
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:30,929
Who the hell was that?

753
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:34,679
That was Michael Wagner-
Bobby Axelrod's COO.

754
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:36,887
Want to give it some context,
for you to overcome in the book?

755
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,095
Turn that
goddamn thing off.

756
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:41,345
dramatic music

757
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:43,261
Time to stop
the motor of the world.

758
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:51,637
Yes, Inspector, this looks like
a bona fide health risk.

759
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,637
I don't know what color
you'd call that sludge

760
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,303
coming out the sides
of those boxcars

761
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:56,845
but you need to
stop this thing. Now.

762
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:00,428
There's a biohazard sign
on the side, sir...

763
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,512
but something's leaking.

764
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,303
Best send a HAZMAT team.
Immediately...

765
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:09,553
Yes, I can give you
the exact location...

766
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,720
dramatic music

767
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,970
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

768
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,095
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

769
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:41,303
Through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

770
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:43,095
Amen.

771
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:51,345
Jock? My nose is picking up
an odor that is rather off...

772
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:53,929
Oh. What is that?

773
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,762
A goddamned plague...

774
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,553
I-I feel as though
I might...

775
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:00,095
Oh, lord...

776
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,470
Oh, Jesus.

777
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:05,387
That fucking train
is from New York City,

778
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,261
courtesy of Rhoades.

779
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:09,345
You were supposed to
have your arms around him.

780
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:11,720
I do. NYPD is still
at the building site.

781
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:12,970
Well,
it hasn't stopped him

782
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,637
from deploying bio-weapons
against me!

783
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,679
Maybe you're so used
to the foul and fetid

784
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,011
up there in New York City
that it doesn't faze you.

785
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,095
But I consider it
a fucking war crime!

786
00:38:21,178 --> 00:38:23,804
Yes, General.

787
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,261
We need to slice
a hole in the universe,

788
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,679
cut down everyone
and everything in our way,

789
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:32,512
or they will return to
cut us into shreds and...

790
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:35,970
do some fucked up stuff
to those shreds.

791
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,679
I don't care about waiting for
biothreat testing to come back

792
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:44,095
or your investigation-
move that fucking train

793
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:46,387
or I start
investigating you!

794
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:50,887
Don't strain your neck
like that.

795
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,220
Liable to pull a muscle.

796
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:53,470
Breathe, you know?

797
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:55,095
Later.

798
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:57,011
If I don't get that shit train
out of there,

799
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:59,553
I'm gonna have a first class
ticket on it. Any ideas?

800
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,970
Tighten things up
at the construction site.

801
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:03,261
Start looking
for violations.

802
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,595
And suffocate 'em
with fines...

803
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,887
Or skip the JV shit
and let's just take 'em.

804
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,387
For bribing Biancarosa

805
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,804
and everything else
we got on the wire.

806
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:16,428
I can't engage with
marginal junk. Not now.

807
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:19,470
What I need is
the Brass Brazilians.

808
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:21,845
I'll go see what
I can come up with.

809
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,887
Kornbluth called.
He wouldn't talk.

810
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,887
He's protecting his sinecure
with Bensinger.

811
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,220
One thing I did
yank out of him:

812
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:32,929
Bensinger had a good meeting
with Taylor.

813
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:35,261
With Bensinger behind Taylor,
I am boxed in.

814
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:36,512
'Fucked' is the word.

815
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:38,303
I'm fucked.
I know.

816
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,637
Why hasn't the Chrysler move
gotten him in here yet?

817
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,053
What else can we do?

818
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:43,303
Give it time to work.

819
00:39:43,387 --> 00:39:44,595
For the salt to settle
in the wound.

820
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,512
To grind on
his sense of self...

821
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:48,887
What the hell?

822
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,720
I thought I ended this.

823
00:39:53,553 --> 00:39:56,345
Mm. Can you do that,
appropriate the glove?

824
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,887
They just did.

825
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,470
You get back to your
stations right now!

826
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:06,762
dramatic music

827
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:09,345
Shall I line 'em all up
Paths of Glory style

828
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:10,887
and give 'em what
they're asking for?

829
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,053
Mass firing? No-what more of
a distraction do we need?...

830
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,679
Oh, shit.

831
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,011
Wendy!

832
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:29,053
Something about this whole
Sandinista revolt thing

833
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,470
isn't clear to me.

834
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:35,178
Where did it
all start?

835
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,929
up-tempo music

836
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,345
You were the one who went to
Wendy about the Flagship Fund.

837
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,804
Where'd you find out
about it?

838
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,929
I shouldn't answer, I should
hold strong for my source.

839
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:00,762
Damnit...

840
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:01,762
Really...?

841
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:04,220
Tuk, who fed you?

842
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:07,762
Oh, God, it was Danzig.

843
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:10,679
He was going to write you
an email asking in.

844
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,887
He asked me to review it
before he hit send.

845
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:14,929
He didn't hit send.

846
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:17,345
So many angry words.

847
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:19,053
So many other words
misspelled.

848
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:21,011
So. How'd the Flagship
come to you-

849
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:26,970
rumor of the old days
or fresh information? Hmm?

850
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:30,428
Or did your seat neighbor
spill?

851
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:31,679
Hey!
I kept my mouth shut...

852
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:37,428
Except when I fucked up
and told Bonnie.

853
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:39,178
I first heard it
from Ben Kim.

854
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,011
The circle closes.

855
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:43,428
And tightens.

856
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:45,595
Which leaves
our source as...

857
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:50,261
Glad you landed
back on your feet.

858
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,178
Hope they're taking care
of you.

859
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,637
You in the Flagship yet?

860
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,637
This whole thing
was a psy-op

861
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,220
to ruin our morale
and our productivity-

862
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:02,553
Worked pretty damn well-

863
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:05,345
And you all fucking bit.

864
00:42:05,428 --> 00:42:09,679
But this is not
a union shop.

865
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:11,720
There's no limit to
what you can earn here.

866
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:16,845
So take responsibility and get
back on it right fucking now.

867
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:18,178
And you...

868
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:20,470
Shit, Axe,
I got fucking used.

869
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:23,637
I don't deserve to
be in the Flagship.

870
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,011
I don't deserve to
work here at all.

871
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:26,679
No, no, no.

872
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,428
You stay here, you stay alive
and you suffer.

873
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:31,095
I'll deal with you later.

874
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:32,679
dramatic music

875
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:34,970
You're gonna wish your way out
was so easy.

876
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,220
Matter of time now.

877
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:43,303
What? Before Connerty finds out
about my jail visit? Yep.

878
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:46,011
Should be enough to break the
blockade on your father's site.

879
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:47,679
Mm.
But it was a gamble

880
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:49,512
putting Wendy's thing in play
in your fight.

881
00:42:49,595 --> 00:42:52,178
You play the pass line,
you can only win small.

882
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,345
Not the game I'm in.

883
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:56,178
But I've gotta find out
what Jock wants,

884
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,720
what matters most to him.

885
00:42:57,804 --> 00:43:02,261
You wanted something,
I have something.

886
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,178
Visitor log.

887
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:05,804
From the federal prison

888
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,095
where a certain doctor
is serving his time.

889
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:11,053
dramatic music

890
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,095
Right this way.

891
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:43,595
That only took a little
longer than I thought.

892
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,762
For me to figure out you bought
that building to fuck with me?

893
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:49,303
No. For your ego to rise up
and make this all about

894
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:53,303
you not being the one to
save it-American Champion.

895
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:56,762
Guess it takes a narcissistic
egomaniac to know one.

896
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:59,095
Fair enough.

897
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,178
What now?

898
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:03,220
You flip it to
a Chinese national company

899
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:05,261
at a steep profit just to
rub it in my face?

900
00:44:05,345 --> 00:44:06,720
Actually, no.

901
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:08,720
But you can if you want.

902
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:10,679
Because
I'm selling it to you.

903
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:13,303
At my cost.

904
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:18,011
Well that pitch had some break
on it I didn't pick up.

905
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:20,220
Well, I knew you'd be leaning
into the fastball

906
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,428
of me selling off
a chunk of Americana,

907
00:44:22,512 --> 00:44:24,595
so I had to come
with the hook.

908
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,512
And I'll let you
take all the credit

909
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:28,345
for protecting
our national heritage

910
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:31,512
and give you that
last chapter of your book.

911
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:34,053
This is about
Saler's then.

912
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:36,845
Yes. It is.
And trying to persuade you

913
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:40,553
not to side with Taylor Mason
against Rebecca Cantu.

914
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:44,303
The Saler's chain is bigger than
your personal feuds, Axelrod.

915
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:45,720
Indeed it is.

916
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:47,845
Which is why I had to
get you here.

917
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,095
You two haven't met.

918
00:44:54,178 --> 00:44:56,470
We know one another
by reputation.

919
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:59,845
And yours is a very good one,
Ms. Cantu.

920
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,178
Rebecca has the best vision
for this company.

921
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:03,929
So I'm gonna turn this
over to her.

922
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:05,970
It's her project,
her passion...

923
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,970
And my chance to take something
that mattered to me

924
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:10,303
and make it matter again.

925
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:11,970
Why?

926
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:14,136
You know this even better
than I do, Sanford.

927
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,387
But legacy
is important.

928
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,720
So I want this now,
today,

929
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:22,679
as a businesswoman,
for my legacy-

930
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,136
so I can say I did
what others couldn't.

931
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,679
But I also want it for the
little girl that I once was.

932
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:32,053
And publicly I say that girl
was allowed to dream

933
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:35,220
by looking at the catalog,
but you know the truth:

934
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:37,637
My parents-My parents couldn't
afford to buy me anything.

935
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,428
And I promised that one day
I would buy it for myself.

936
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:44,637
So now I want
to own it all.

937
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,178
That kind of personal stake
can be very risky-

938
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:49,053
But I'm not
a child anymore.

939
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,637
And when you read my plan,

940
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,553
you will see a clear
march forward

941
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:55,637
to massive profitability.

942
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,053
And the ice cream fountains?
I'm keeping them.

943
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:00,470
Alongside
an artisanal coffee bar.

944
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:02,345
Because coffee
is good business

945
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,220
and addictive
and we'll sell enough of it

946
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,053
to float the entire
fucking enterprise.

947
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:08,512
And ice cream
is delicious

948
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:10,720
and it's the perfect reward
for everything.

949
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:14,428
But ice cream,
at a fountain-

950
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:20,845
I mean, that makes you feel free
and young, like-

951
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,679
An American.

952
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:26,637
You want Saler's
to be America.

953
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,220
That's right.

954
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:30,095
And, wait,
there's more:

955
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:31,512
I'm stepping off
the board.

956
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:32,845
You two should work
closely on this,

957
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,220
and I don't need
to be in the way-

958
00:46:34,303 --> 00:46:35,845
Bobby-

959
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,470
Sanford can take my place
on the board.

960
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:39,387
It's a net PR win
for everyone.

961
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,512
No.

962
00:46:42,595 --> 00:46:44,762
The company needs Sanford.
For sure.

963
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,095
But I need you there
helping me steer this.

964
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:50,470
You've already protected it
like a pit bull

965
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:53,095
in this opening salvo.

966
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:57,512
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't have believed it.

967
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:02,095
Bobby Axelrod actually gives
a goddamn-enough to walk away.

968
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:06,512
And you actually giving enough
of a goddamn about him

969
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:08,804
to risk me walking away.

970
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:10,553
That's the kind of
strength and loyalty

971
00:47:10,637 --> 00:47:12,679
great brands
are built on.

972
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:14,804
I want that at the heart
of this company.

973
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:18,178
And I want the wattage in
your combined brain pan too.

974
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:22,762
Okay,
keep your board seat.

975
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:24,470
I'm not going with
Taylor Mason.

976
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:26,053
I share your vision.

977
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:30,053
But what really sold me is
the two of you. Together.

978
00:47:30,136 --> 00:47:32,762
Ms. Cantu, if you can
make this fallen man

979
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:35,220
part of something good,

980
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:38,261
you can make us all
part of something great.

981
00:47:38,345 --> 00:47:42,345
dramatic music

982
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,679
I'm gonna need you to tell me
what Chuck Rhoades wanted.

983
00:47:55,762 --> 00:47:57,178
And I need to know now...

984
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:29,178
Now I know what this is
really all about...

985
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:31,512
I missed it at first,
but now I see.

986
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:33,261
See what?

987
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:37,178
That sure, this is a psy-op,
like I said.

988
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,595
That it was about
the Flagship Fund.

989
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,595
But it's more than that.

990
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,845
This is a move.

991
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:46,804
On you.

992
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,720
Is that right?
Yeah.

993
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:52,261
That's what all this was,

994
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:55,178
on top of sowing
general chaos in here

995
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:57,512
and distracting me
from the billionaire

996
00:48:57,595 --> 00:48:59,470
that I was tangling with:

997
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:02,011
this is Taylor
poaching you-

998
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:05,053
I see how they all
look to you out there-

999
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:07,261
and Taylor must have
figured it out too.

1000
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,845
They're going to reach out
to you, come at you...

1001
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:16,178
Or did they already?

1002
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:18,428
It's possible.

1003
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:25,303
When you take that
meeting with Taylor,

1004
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:27,887
you tell them that you are
staying at Axe Capital.

1005
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,929
Because Axe values you.

1006
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,053
So much so, in fact, that
he's reopened the Flagship Fund

1007
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,470
under a different name
and put you in it.

1008
00:49:36,553 --> 00:49:39,303
Which I just did.

1009
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:42,136
Nah.

1010
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,887
I'm not gonna
tell Taylor that.

1011
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,345
dramatic music

1012
00:49:47,428 --> 00:49:49,679
Axe should have put you
in the Flagship Fund.

1013
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:52,136
Come aboard here
and you'll be treated right.

1014
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,387
Hey Taylor, Bonnie's very happy
at Axe Capital.

1015
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,011
We're taking
great care of her.

1016
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:05,220
And she's staying.

1017
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,679
I guess I was wrong about you-
I thought you were smart.

1018
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,470
The elevator is that way.

1019
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:28,470
Bensinger's not
going our way.

1020
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:30,512
We lost this one.

1021
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:31,804
Against Axe
and Rebecca.

1022
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:34,053
Bensinger's backing them.

1023
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:39,845
Okay.

1024
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:41,929
This means
our data's come in:

1025
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:43,720
Axe is that emotionally
committed to Rebecca.

1026
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:45,679
Especially so if
I'm coming after her.

1027
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:48,220
Is that a stopper?

1028
00:50:48,303 --> 00:50:51,095
The opposite.
A structural weakness.

1029
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:52,720
This means
if I push hard enough

1030
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:55,595
it all collapses
on both of them.

1031
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,178
And Bensinger,
we just quietly retreat?

1032
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,303
Nope. He just added himself
to my fucking list.

1033
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:07,303
dramatic music

1034
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:40,470
Part of me still roots for you,
Bryan, you know that?

1035
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:42,387
Oh, yeah?
Which part's that?

1036
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,595
The part that remembers
an idealistic young man

1037
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:46,470
walking into
my office,

1038
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:49,011
asking for a chance
to chase the bad guys.

1039
00:51:49,095 --> 00:51:50,303
Whaddaya think happened
to change him?

1040
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,095
Better question: who?

1041
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:54,679
Oh, you're gonna say it was me
did that to you.

1042
00:51:54,762 --> 00:51:58,261
But we both know that no man can
change the nature of another.

1043
00:51:58,345 --> 00:52:01,845
No. You went dark because good
was just too fucking hard.

1044
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:04,345
But you're not really dark
either, are you?

1045
00:52:04,428 --> 00:52:06,387
No. It's like back during
Project Mercury,

1046
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,470
you either had the right stuff
or you didn't.

1047
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:09,720
And I don't see
any wings on you-

1048
00:52:09,804 --> 00:52:12,053
Enough. Look.

1049
00:52:12,136 --> 00:52:13,929
You won
this fucking round.

1050
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:15,929
Move that shit train

1051
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:17,845
and Jock will let
your father's people go.

1052
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,470
But that's where we were-

1053
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:23,220
before the rain of frogs
and the river running red.

1054
00:52:23,303 --> 00:52:26,303
You want more.

1055
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:28,595
You want us to clear things up
with the med board.

1056
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,220
Med board?

1057
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:31,637
I know you went to see
that doctor in jail.

1058
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,845
I know why. And I know
you wanted me to know.

1059
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:36,970
It's what you really need.
And to get it you'll have to-

1060
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,845
Oooh, I did teach you how to
make a deal. Didn't I?

1061
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,178
Better than you think.

1062
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:43,178
Because the deal requires
you also walk away

1063
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:44,637
from the voting nonsense.

1064
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,303
Blockchain.
Your pilot program.

1065
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:50,595
So that's what
Jock needs.

1066
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:54,679
Of all I could do for him,
that's what matters most?

1067
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:57,136
I tried to convince the man
to have you owe him one.

1068
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,220
Classic Rhoades:
lord one over 'im

1069
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:00,303
and hold out for
something bigger.

1070
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:03,637
But, uh, he wants to
be paid up front.

1071
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,637
Yeah.
That shit train is powerful.

1072
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,261
No. I move it
and you give me both.

1073
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:12,428
Uh uh. You need two things,
you give two things.

1074
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:14,553
No mobile voting.

1075
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:17,303
These are the terms:
Your dad gets taken care of.

1076
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:19,303
Wendy
gets taken care of.

1077
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:20,345
Jock
gets taken care of.

1078
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:23,303
Everyone gets something.
Except me.

1079
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:26,762
So really that's
one more thing for you.

1080
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:29,637
Do we have a deal?

1081
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,553
I'll give you
your answer now.

1082
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:33,637
No.

1083
00:53:35,095 --> 00:53:37,970
Not even you
can be this petty,

1084
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:39,512
that you'll let
your wife suffer just-

1085
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:42,845
Some things are even more
important than marriage.

1086
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,387
Like fair
and free elections?

1087
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,887
Bullshit!

1088
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,553
I know you too well
to buy that from you.

1089
00:53:48,637 --> 00:53:51,679
Well, when you figure
that out-why this matters-

1090
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,679
maybe you'll become
an ally.

1091
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:55,220
Or
a worthy opponent.

1092
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:57,303
Or maybe you'll finally
be fully corrupt.

1093
00:53:57,387 --> 00:54:01,637
But either way, the answer is
official and the answer is no.

1094
00:54:04,136 --> 00:54:08,095
Another in a long line of
Chuck Rhoades mistakes.

1095
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:13,428
One step closer
to the fucking end.

1096
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,178
dramatic music

1097
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,261
You fucking played me.

1098
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,261
You're in the fund
and I'm out.

1099
00:54:52,345 --> 00:54:54,345
That's the only reason
we had our tomahawk date.

1100
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:57,387
Not the only reason.

1101
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,303
Not even the biggest one.

1102
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,053
Funkadelic's
"Funky Dollar Bill"

1103
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:11,428
Funky dollar bill

1104
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:14,428
U.S. dollar bill

1105
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:17,011
Funky dollar bill

1106
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:20,762
U.S. dollar bill

1107
00:55:20,845 --> 00:55:23,679
You go to school
to learn the rules

1108
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:28,512
On how to love
and life your life

1109
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,053
The Medical Board...

1110
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:45,428
I'm afraid it's a no-go.

1111
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,220
I'm sorry, Wend.

1112
00:55:52,303 --> 00:55:54,011
You're gonna have to
take your chances with them.

1113
00:55:57,512 --> 00:56:02,011
I asked you to go out
and kill, and-

1114
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:03,845
I couldn't.

1115
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:07,261
UFO's "Doctor Doctor"

1116
00:56:07,345 --> 00:56:08,970
I just didn't
have the pull.

1117
00:56:21,053 --> 00:56:24,011
Then I know
it couldn't be done.

1118
00:56:44,345 --> 00:56:46,261
I don't usually
work this late.

1119
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:47,887
And I don't
take walk-ins-

1120
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:52,845
I don't have
the right stuff...

1121
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:56,053
Re-make me.

1122
00:56:57,887 --> 00:57:01,095
Doctor, doctor, please

1123
00:57:01,178 --> 00:57:04,804
Oh, the mess I'm in

1124
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:08,261
Doctor, doctor, please

1125
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,679
Oh, the mess I'm in

1126
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,345
She walked up to me

1127
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:18,679
And really stole my heart

1128
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:21,303
And then she started

1129
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:25,345
To take my body apart

1130
00:57:25,428 --> 00:57:31,553
Livin', lovin', I'm on
the run far away from you

1131
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:35,470
Livin', lovin',
I'm on the run

1132
00:57:36,305 --> 00:58:36,227

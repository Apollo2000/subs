You know those poison-tip arrows

that go through one
guy and kill another?

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,250
As long as it doesn't
come from you.

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,750
You get someone else to ask her.

6
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:15,959
Won't track back to me.

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,792
You come through for me,
I'll pay off your house.

Now, that's an Ivan Koloff bear
hug you're putting on the man.

You're squeezing the

A favor to be named later.

14
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,750
Back channeling, patronage.
I lost my taste for it.

15
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,154
Just don't forget, it was the
back channels and deal-making

16
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,250
that put you in that position.

17
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,834
Remind me again, and it's
the last meal we share.

18

It is still Axe Capital,

19

no matter who's making the
day-to-day decisions.

20
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,625
Are you sure?

21
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,959
I know it's Axe's faith
that confers value on me

22
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,521
until I have a track
record of my own.

23
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:53,333
Unless it becomes necessary,
I will not leave.

24
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,875
I'm holding in my hand
Robert Axelrod's signature

25
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,125
relinquishing his ability
to trade securities.

What?

49

The deal. I can't do it...
not trade.

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,542
I've worked my entire life

52
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:23,875
putting myself in a position
where I would be truly free...

53
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,458
No limits, nothing
I couldn't do.

54
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,208
And with one signature,

55
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,542
I've stripped myself
of all of that.

56
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,208
It wasn't the signature
that did it.

57
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,375
It was the living like
there were no rules.

58
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,375
That's what made the
signature necessary.

I can't do this now.

63
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,875
Realize that limits,

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
constraints, they can be useful.

65
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,000
Letting someone else run
Axe Capital gives you

66
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,834
a chance to realign who you are.

67
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:57,917
To get good at letting go.
Which is a different

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
kind of freedom. A more
powerful kind of freedom.

back then, during a case,

I tried to allude to the
favor in conference,

and that man hammered me
for even hinting at it.

160
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,667
Seemed to grow
larger as he talked,

00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,834
You withdrew the request?

164
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,542
I did.

165
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,417
And I fear it would
be even worse today.

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,917
See, if he wouldn't return a
favor back when it was fresh,

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,834
why would he do so now?

168
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,458
But that's not what
happened, is it?

169
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,262
He didn't actually refuse.
He didn't say no.

170
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:12,500
Not in so many words.

171
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,667
What he did was: Spare
himself the question

172
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,291
by putting a tougher one to you.

173
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,375
It's about will, Chuck.

174
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,709
Impose your will on him
until he does what

175
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,709
he needs to and repays the debt.

176
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,458
Why, you are a marvel.

177
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,625
Go.

178
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,750
Do what you have to do.

I've recently invested nine
billion of Axe Cap's money

183
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,125
back into the market. In phases.
And now when it's time

184
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,041
for the next phase,
another two billion...

185
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,375
You can't.

186
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,166
Why?

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,792
There's a velvet rope around it.
So to speak.

188
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
What's actually around it?

189
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,375
A directive from Axe that
the money remain untouched.

190
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,000
Is he considering
moving the funds

191
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,041
or deploying them elsewhere?

192
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,333
Never mind. You don't know.

193
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,125
Don't I?

194
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,709
Maybe Axe is hedging.

195
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,959
Against the main fund?

196
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,458
Against you.

Ah. The two billion.

201
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,125
I told them: Velvet rope.

202
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,291
Spoken like a man who's still
mad he never got into Xenon.

203
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,959
I'm on it, Taylor.

204
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,041
This is clean. And it
does what you need,

205
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,725
how you need. Tracks
it all in real time.

206
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,309
We've also swept the apartment.

207
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,667
There are no listening devices,
no visual recording devices,

208
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,000
no compromising
devices of any kind.

209
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,709
But guests leave eyes and ears,
so we should sweep often.

210
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,125
- The women.

211
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,583
Wand them.

212
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,041
He will.

213
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,417
So, this is the Counter
Intel team, the new Halls.

214
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't think they
care for that.

215
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,500
Why should I trust you to
do anything other than

216
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,667
point me to the nearest
avocado toast?

217
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,917
For whom have you worked?

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,667
Is this just a walk
on the wild side

219
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,667
to spice up the b.

220
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,375
How much you doing
this for the money?

221
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,625
You can answer him.

222
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,309
In re bona fides, John
built the code for

223
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,375
four successful startups in
high school then Stanford,

224
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,834
then was asked to travel
to 71 countries for DARPA

225
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,291
and Other Government Agency,

226
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,875
all which he did
without complaint.

227
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,599
And Timmy Dones has a
military background.

228
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,709
What fucking war were you in?

229
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,709
Mr. Hall fought the
wars you've heard of.

230
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,208
I fought the ones you haven't.

231
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,959
As for your other questions.
It's none of your business,

232
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,417
smashed spring pea toast
is the new avocado toast,

233
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,125
and 70 percent.

234
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,291
Are we clear to talk to Mr.
Wagner going forward?

235
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,458
Discuss anything except
women you care about.

236
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,041
Yeah, so, the two billion.

237
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,917
Ah, and here I was thinking
you came to keep me company.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,166
Look, I know you're giving
it to outside funds,

239
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,250
not on the surface.

240
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,333
It'll get routed around
the world first,

241
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:20,125
but then it will land
in certain funds,

242
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,917
and suddenly they'll get hot
as Farrah Fawcett in '76.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,250
Don't do it. One errant e-mail,

244
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,583
one recorded call, one
trade that tracks back

245
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,583
to you... and it's Hassan chop!

246
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,458
We're done. All of us.

247
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,417
There's no need for it, bwana.

248
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
Satisfy your urges
some other way.

249
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,709
Buy yourself something.

250
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,583
I bought it all already.

251
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,959
Probably thrown it out.

252
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,201
What about that vintage Cheetah
you've been eyeballing?

253
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,959
Look, this is not a message
I'm born to carry.

254
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,417
It goes against everything
I've built my life on.

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,375
But for you, holding back
is essential right now.

256
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,125
You're right about
hiding the money.

257
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,728
That's too dangerous.
What if I didn't?

258
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:59,792
- I could have Taylor move it,

259
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,625
on-the-books, perfectly legal
disbursements to outside shops.

260
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,375
Bobby... that's right, I'm not
calling you "Mr. President,"

261
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,298
I'm calling you "Bobby"
because I've never used

262
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,458
your first name and
I want to underline

263
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,959
how serious this moment is.

264
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,834
You've called me Bobby before.

265
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,542
Strategic mistake, but
not nearly as big

266
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,166
as the one you're making if
you ask Taylor to do this.

267
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,667
They have nothing to
gain by going along.

268
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,470
They get to keep their
princely fucking job.

269
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,166
If you fire them, it will
look like what it is.

270
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,917
And you can't have it appear
you're illegally meddling.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Especially when you're
illegally meddling.

272
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,333
- My point...
- I get your point.

273
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,542
So you won't take
the two billion?

274
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,542
I get your point.

275
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,750
Let's leave it at that.

276
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,917
Ah!

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,709
If it isn't George and Edward.

278
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,417
Which one of you will give
up the throne for love?

279
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,125
That seems like a stupid reason.

280
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
You must be George.

281
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,667
Are you coming to our
game later, Uncle Wags?

282
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,166
Is it official Little League?

283
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,875
- Yeah.
- Can't. Banned for life.

284
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,667
Well, here we are on the
Axelrod case together,

285
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,834
so, you know, we got our
fairy tale ending after all.

286
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,277
You been working out? You look
like you've been working out.

287
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,834
There's no good way to
answer that question.

288
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,917
Is it ping pong? You
back at the tables?

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,792
Uh, can I get a lawyer?

290
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,000
Excuse me, Ms. Gonzalez...

291
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,041
Special Agent Terri McCue, FBI.

292
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,166
Uh, me llamo Bryan Connerty,

293
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,709
uh, Federal prosecutor.

294
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,041
He's also second alternate

295
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
at the World Table
Tennis Championships.

296
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,333
I'm really not... that good.

297
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,000
Ms. Gonzalez, we don't care
about your immigration status.

298
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,375
That's not what we do.

299
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,208
We may even be able to help
you if you cooperate with us.

300
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,411
We want to speak to you about
your boss, Victor Mateo.

301
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:51,208
Mr. Victor, he's very good.

302
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,917
He and his wife,
they sponsor me for

303
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,792
the green card, so
I don't need help.

304
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,583
You're not eligible
for a green card

305
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,375
if you've committed a crime.

306
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,750
A crime? No. No, no, no.

307
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,375
Let's put it up
on the colortini.

308
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:11,166
That couple near you snapping
selfies were undercover agents.

309
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Mr. Victor made me do it.

310
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,583
Did Mr. Victor
give you the vial.

311
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:22,041
It was someone else. A woman.
But I know that it was for him.

312
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,542
Him and his wife, son monstruos.

313
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,041
One time I drop a glass licorera...
Baccarat.

314
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:33,208
Then Missus, she break the tail
light to my car to punish.

315
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,208
I had to drive home afraid
that I get pulled over

316
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,625
and sent back to Guatemala.

317
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,041
Now I take the bus.

318
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,458
I want to know how it worked.
When and where...

319
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,902
The way that Mr. Victor and his wife are...
I can't be late.

320
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,125
Or do I have to tell them...

321
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,792
No, no, no. Don't...
don't say anything.

322
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,583
After work, you'll
come to my office

323
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,500
and give a statement.

324
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,875
Lo prometo.

325
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,291
Yeah, what is it?

326
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,250
My maid was late today.

327
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,917
She's never late.

328
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,291
We have a real problem.
We need to meet.

330
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:25,709

00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,834
Which is exactly
why I'm buying it.

333
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,000
Which is why I'm gonna
let you outbid me.

334
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,375
Thanks.

335
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,917

I want in on the new shit.

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,333
You're raising money for
new ventures, count me in.

339
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,000
Thanks, but I'm not looking
to give up any more equity.

340
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,000
You're saying no to money?

Look, Axe, let me answer the
question you didn't ask,

the most notable,

400
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,166
- Brazilian sugar and shipping.
- So we buy sugar futures.

401
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,041
Impending shortage
means prices go up.

Everyone will do that, but sure.

Shorting Brazil's
largest debt holder,

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,875
buying long-dated VIX calls.
Also buying solar, wind,

406
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,750
and every alternative
energy play

407
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,000
not dependent on
government subsidy.

408
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,000
Um, is no one worried

409
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,792
about the people, you
know, in Brazil?

410
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,417
If you want to pretend
you're concerned, see Wendy.

411

He's not pretending, Wags.

412
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,667
If you really care,
start a walk-a-thon.

413
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,000
Tough Mudders are the
new walk-a-thons.

But don't bring that shit to me.

415
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,792
Our own foundation was set
up for just these situations

416
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,917
as a kind of emotional
and fiscal catch-all

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,250
for you to use as a
tool for you to get

418
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,250
your conscience out of the way.

419
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,458

you fucking vulture.

421
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,834
What would salve my conscience
and my wallet is if I was

422
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,250

423
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,500
Too bad their leading

424
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750

425
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,083
Can't get into bed with a
firm that's had almost

426
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,041
100 executives indicted.

427
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,792
Our principal has been indicted.

428
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,208

429
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,542

mean you can't fulfill

430
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,333

431
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,750
We're on the clock, people.

Now's the time to

433
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,583
There's something I
always wondered:

434
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,083
Why aren't you Charlie?

435
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,246
- Feels like you would have

436
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,417
- been a great Charlie.
- No, I agree.

437
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,291
Oh, Charlie Rhoades, yeah,
that guy's yer best friend.

438
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,375
- Yeah.

439
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,917
Sure. Call ol' Charlie, see
if he can fill in, uh,

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,640
as a fourth for tennis
or on a double date

441
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:14,208
or just ride around
smashing mailboxes.

442
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,625
Yeah. Charlie. The best.

443
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:21,417
But in our household,
my father was Charles.

444
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,125
And every now and then someone,

445
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,608
business associate, the guy who
managed one of his buildings,

446
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:29,458
who would get just
a little casual,

447
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,000
accidentally let a Charlie fly.

448
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,291
The world would stop dead.

449
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,208
"Do I look like a fucking
'Charlie' to you?"

450
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
And that was that.

451
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,542
The guy would piss himself,
and the day would continue.

452
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,625
So, he was Charles,
and you were Chuck.

453
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,041
And Good Time Charlie
was somewhere else

454
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,792
out on the town having
all the laughs.

455
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,208
Christ, man.

456
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,625
Don't I know it.

457
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,542
And how 'bout now?

458
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,542
You just show up in my
chambers for the laughs.

459
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,625
No. No.

460
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,667
I am here in your chambers
to put myself in your debt.

461
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,917
In my debt.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,834
That's right.

463
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:21,041
I was thinking back to
our last meal together,

464
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,166
wherein you told me I
ought never mention

465
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,291
the favor I had done you again.
And I promised then,

466
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,375
and I intend to
keep that promise.

467
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,000
And so I am here to
ask of you a favor,

468
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,375
not as repayment to
me but the opposite.

469
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,792
Oh, this must be big.

470
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,375
Judge Funt is stepping
off the Axelrod case.

471
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,959
No one knows.

472
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,542
And when he does, Morgenstern
will make a special appointment

473
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:52,208
of the judge who convinces
him he most wants the case.

474
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:56,458
As often as not, that's
the first judge to ask.

475
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,083
And you need that to be me.

476
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,709
We'll time it out so it will be.

477
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,792
Now, there are those
that would frame this

478
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,000
as a favor for you, because
it's a marquee case.

479
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,375
But I won't.

480
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,166
You would be doing me a service.

481
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,208
And all you're asking
is that I be the judge,

482
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,531
not that I rule in Dake's favor,

483
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,375
not that I'd be
slanted in any way.

484
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,166
That's right. It's
that straightforward.

485
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,875
Win. Lose. Draw.

486
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,917
I want you on that bench because
I know you can't be bought.

487
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,166
You can't be bent.
You can't be worked.

488
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,417
Dake has a strong case.

489
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
I want it heard fairly
and without prejudice.

490
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,667
And if I grant this request...

491
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,083
There is nothing you can ask me

492
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,875
that I'll refuse you for
the rest of our days.

493
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:48,458
If I agree, I would take
those words as gospel,

494
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,458
Chuck. And I would not
be bashful to collect,

495
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,583
should the need arise.

496
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,125
I'd be honor bound to deliver.

497
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,709
That's too small a play.
It won't save us.

498
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,125
Keep looking.

499
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,792
Axe would be out on that
floor screaming at them

500
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,792
like Gordon Ramsay
until they delivered.

501
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,625
Hm. You're more Alton Brown.

502
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,875
The ideas they're bringing...
Some deployable,

503
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,208
some useful as a benchmark
of what other firms

504
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,375
will be thinking and how
we need to do better,

505
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,750
but none platonically good.

506
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,959
Your first round of
investments coinciding

507
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,750
with your first crisis.

508
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,625
That would be a lot for anybody.

509
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,458
Axe was already considering
sidecarring two billion.

510
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:38,458
And you think today will
make the decision for him.

511
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,625
I am acutely aware of the
way people look at me.

512
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:44,667
I have cultivated, through
achievement and discipline,

513
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,917
a mystique that compensates
for my lack of track record.

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,625
A loss shatters that,

515
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,417
and with it the confidence
of everyone who works here.

516
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,000
In their eyes... in Axe's eyes...
I become simply inexperienced.

517
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't let that happen.

518
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,000
That's why I need to get
through today unscathed.

519
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,166
The way you think Axe would.

520
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:08,875
It's important in your job that
you face unpleasant realities.

521
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,667
Axe Capital may
lose money today,

522
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,083
probably will.

523
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,291
You know that, right?

You know that painting

the Delaware. In the boat
with all his troops?

538

I forget what it's called.

539
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,827
I think it's called Washington
Crossing The Delaware...

- You didn't forget.
- No.

And do you know why
it's called that?

542
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,166
Because at the moment that
his troops were facing

543
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,125
the sting of battle,
Washington was right there

544

with them, leaning
into the wind.

Not back at home jerking off.

I'll admit, Washington Crossing
the Delaware would look pretty

547
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:27,750
fucking strange without
George Washington.

548
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,709
Then how can you ask me not to
be with my troops right now?

549
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,083
Well, Washington was allowed
to talk to his men.

550
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,250
He was allowed to lead.

The person behind its

the same man you tried
to cooperate against.

596
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,500
You think he targeted
me deliberately?

597
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,875
Wow, that's a long road
to travel for revenge.

598
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,250
But if he did it, I
hope you nail him.

as a good store-bought
flat white.

to talk about it. The kids.

642
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:53,041
I don't like to go far.
We got a spot in Mystic.

643
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,045
While the family's looking
at the boats and shit,

644
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,083
I can play a little pai gow.

645
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,959
I was planning to go
back and climb Kili.

646
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,583
How much vacay time is it
culturally appropriate

647
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,250
to take here?

648
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,000
Ah, maybe I'll
just do base camp.

649
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,000
- Korst.
- Scandinavian shipping company.

650
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,923
While the South American
companies are down for

651
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,131
the count, these guys will
have a shot at a monopoly.

652
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:18,792
- We should buy in two days.
- Four days, when it bottoms.

653
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,375
But this is going to help
dig us out a little more.

654
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,709
Good work.

655
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,375
Will you make sure Axe
knows it came from me?

656
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:32,125
Why would you think we're
communicating about trades?

657
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,291
What?

658
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,583
That would be illegal.

659
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:38,333
I know. But...

660
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,125
What are you saying about me?

661
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,417
What are you saying about
the place you work?

662
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,792
Actually, if he hates it,
that would be worse.

663
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,625
Don't say anything.

664
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,875
It is now 1:47 on
the 9th day of...

665
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,375
I'm sitting in my office,
which I paid for,

666
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,959
seeing how things
run without me.

667
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,208
Won't work.

668
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,667
People are afraid
to take chances

669
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,000
with you here. To be wrong.

670
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,625
Or they want a slap on the ass from you.
Which you can't give.

671
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:04,989
Move over, Zapruder. I got this.

672
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:07,074
Actually, I think this
falls within my dominion,

673
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:10,667
and the stick can be
really tricky for noobs...

674
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,792
Hmm. Guess it was tricky.

675
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:20,750
Why didn't you
anticipate the tsunami?

676
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:22,375
Maybe I should have when that

677
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,875
underground earthquake
hit off Mozambique.

678
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:29,000
Strange conditions
bring strange results.

679
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,709
That's what brought this on.

680
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:33,500
You knew right then
but you couldn't act.

681
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,183
Maybe you would have
used your experience

682
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,000
to think more globally.

683
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,883
Maybe you would have been cautious.
De-risked.

684
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,041
The mature move.

685
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,125
Is that a dig?

686
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:42,792
It's not.

687
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,250
You have more experience.

688
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,375
You connect points I don't
even know to look for.

689
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:51,792
I understand how hard it is
to have things inside you

690
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,500
that you can't communicate.

691
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,542
I can't imagine how hard it
must be to know how to say them

692
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,959
and still not be allowed to.

693
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:01,375
And yet, you are not allowed to.

694
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,858
Have you heard me
direct any trades?

695
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,399
The people out there don't
know who they're looking to.

696
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,291
Since it can't be you,
it needs to be me.

697
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,291
If you can't live with that,
I can be the one who leaves.

698
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,792
You'll probably make up the
losses but get yourself

699
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,875
banned for life or worse.

700
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm leaving,

701
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,458
and I'm taking the two billion.

702
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:34,709
I'll send instructions shortly
about what to do with it.

703
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:40,375
And at 1:53 p.m.,

704
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,583
Robert Axelrod...

705
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,667
has left the building.

706
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm glad I caught you.

707
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,417
You wouldn't have if
my fucking car guy

708
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,959
could time his job right.

709
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,291
Yeah, George Washington had the
same problem leaving Trenton.

710
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,583
Wags told you?

711
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,250
Texted me while you were
rampaging through the office.

712
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,458
I wasn't rampaging.
I was inspiring.

713
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,125
You know Washington
didn't actually.

714
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,625
- Of course.

715
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,583
Structurally unsound, and he'd
have made himself a target.

716
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,959
Yet you worry about neither.

717
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,917
It's hard to shut it off, Wend.

718
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,792
I know.

719
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,834
But if you can't, you will
lose the battle and the war.

720
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:27,375
Do you want me to come with you?

721
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,083
Stay here with Taylor.

722
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,667
They need some senior
officer for back up.

723
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:40,208
You're fired.

724
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,458
Find out when Judge Funt's
court is in recess.

725
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,542
Yep.

726
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,250
A Mr. Allerd is here for you.

727
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm Karl Allerd, your new AUSA.

728
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,875
I think I'd remember if I
hired a new line prosecutor.

729
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,625
Remember when Dake said there'd
be a favor to be named?

730
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,667
Ah.

731
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,375
You're the favor.

732
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,709
You don't trust me.

733
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,500
Hell, I wouldn't
from your chair.

734
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,792
A Spy In the House Of
Lords and so forth. Yes.

735
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,375
So I'll earn your trust.

736
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,333
Will you?

737
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,000
I look forward to
seeing that trick.

738
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,250
That'll be a neat trick.

739
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,959
Ms. Sacker, our Head of Crim,
will get you situated.

740
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,166
- Mm.

741
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,250
Mm, I will.

742
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:28,633
Hey, I've been revising my idea.

743
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,959
There's a division of
a struggling company

744
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,417
in Thailand, that I think...

745
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,291
Wait, is this the sugar company?

746
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,917
Is it, is this the
same damn deal?

747
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,875
No... It's just one
facet of the company

748
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,875
that I think could be
promising to look into.

749
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,434
It started out as a
family business, and...

750
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,938
- So this is... This
is the same deal.

751
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:43,814
- Not really...
- Kimmy,

752
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:48,208
this piece of shit
ain't Axe Cap.

753
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,041
What are you working on?

754
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,250
Nothing.

755
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:16,500
I want to see all Ben Kim's
search results for the day.

756
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,063
You mean, like, browser
results, or...

757
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:21,588
Everything he did today.

758
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,333
Hey, you on your way home?

759
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:25,417
Nope.

760
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,375
Chief. You got to
get on your way

761
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,125
if you want to make
it in time to take

762
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,166
the princelings
to Little League.

763
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,750
Have Bruce take 'em.

764
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,583
You got it.

765
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,625
He's been home three
weekends this year.

766
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,458
I'm almost positive one of them
was his assistant's mistake.

767
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,667
And he assumes I never
say anything about him

768
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,417
fucking his way through
the entire New York pool.

769
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,291
But if you can leave Axe...

770
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,875
You give me courage, Lara.

771
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,625
You're smart, Lilly.

772
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,166
You had a career for a second.

773
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,750
You know your shopper
isn't your friend,

774
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,458
personal trainer doesn't think
you're actually making progress,

775
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:21,417
and all the charities you
give money to don't actually

776
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,375
honor you when they honor you.

777
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,291
But on some level, you
believe every bit of it.

778
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:31,041
You think the attention
you receive is deserved.

779
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,125
But when that fades,
when every relationship

780
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,250
in your life reveals itself to
be a trade on your husband's

781
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,792
net worth, you may say
"Fuck false friends,"

782
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,595
but you'll be hiring a
PR rep the first time

783
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:47,118
your Halloween costume isn't
mentioned in Page Six.

784
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,250
So keep your own courage, Lilly.

785
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,333
And while you're at it,
consider keeping that husband.

786
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,166
Because while he may not give
you what you think you want,

787
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,166
he lets you keep on being Mrs.
Keith Currier Smith,

788
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,750
and I'm pretty sure
that's what you need.

789
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:05,375
Now you're trying
to decide whether

790
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,834
to be pissed or grateful.

791
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,792
Definitely grateful.

792
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,875
Whoa!

793
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,625
Here you go.

794
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,542
Have fun.

795
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,500
Thanks, Bruce.

Uh, well, I read
what you sent me.

860
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,083
Just to make sure I have it
straight: We got the wrong Guad?

861
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:16,083
That is indeed the case.

862
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,625
Say it.

863
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:24,250
We got the wrong Guad.

864
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,542
But Maria Gonzalez,
our Maria Gonzalez,

865
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,625
is a key cooperator.

866
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:31,667
We need her back.
And since this is

867
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,250
an extraordinary situation...

868
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,792
Well, in one respect.

869
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,625
In another, it's just the way
things are supposed to go.

870
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,990
The right Maria Gonzalez came
into this country illegally,

871
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:44,500
she stayed illegally, and
she committed a fraud

872
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,250
on the stockholders of that
snake-bit juice company.

873
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,709
She is three times illegal.

874
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:54,667
That makes her removable,
and she was removed.

875
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,583
Um...

876
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,083
Next time...

877
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:04,458
instead of asking me
to undo your fuck-up,

878
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,542
maybe just see to it that
the situation remains like

879
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,083

blessedly un-fucked.

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,417
How'd that go?

881
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,834
Does Axe ever hesitate?

882
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,500
Why?

883
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,750
I'm hesitating. Can't
pull the trigger.

884
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,500
Markets are closed.
Overseas play?

885
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,250
Ben Kim found a big
opportunity in Thailand.

886
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,125
A troubled public company with
a promising sugar division.

887
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,333
He spotted a good target
but just couldn't quite

888
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:44,518
figure out how to hit it...
Or didn't have the courage

889
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,709
to shoot at it.

890
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,041
We need to keep working
with him on that.

891
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,208
But you see the play?

892
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:53,166
Yes. A PIPE. Private
investment in public equity.

893
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,291
Basically, we take
ownership of a spin-off,

894
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,975
and a commission from
brokering its sale.

895
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,000
So, why the hesitation?

896
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,000
It will be the single largest
investment I've made as CIO,

897
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,250
and a type Axe Cap has
never made before.

898
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:07,041
If you make this move, where
do you end up for the day?

899
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,709
Unscathed?

900
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:14,583
This would lock in a loss.

901
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:19,542
Yes. The high-reward
plays are all high-risk.

902
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,250
It's good you can't
run it by Axe.

903
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:27,458
Forces you to hear your
own voice and trust it.

904
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:33,291
You'll probably do
the right thing.

905
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,458
And when the day comes you get
one wrong, that'll be good, too.

906
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,000
Because I'll realize I'm
mortal and it's not so bad?

907
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,750
Because it'll be
fucking horrible

908
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:44,208
and you'll do anything you can
to avoid that feeling again.

909
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,875
Hey.

910
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:00,166
You know what, Bobby?

911
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,959
I'm gonna do you a favor:

912
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,959
You're off the hook.

913
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,417
If you don't want 50-50 custody,
you don't need to have it.

914
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
I can tell other
people it's 50-50,

915
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,208
and I can come up with something
to tell the boys, too.

916
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,625
Why the fuck do you think
I don't want the kids?

917
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:18,750
You had them for one day,
at a time when you don't

918
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:22,625
have to go to work,
and you ditched them.

919
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,875
You let them be airlifted
into Little League.

920
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,458
I mean, it was mortifying.

921
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,041
I didn't mean to embarrass them.

922
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,792
They weren't embarrassed.

923
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:34,166
They didn't know to be, which
is a whole other thing.

924
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,875
You know, I don't know if you
need to work on your case

925
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:39,750
or go on a trip

926
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,917
or become a fucking cobbler,

927
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,542
but it doesn't seem like you
are where you need to be.

928
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,250
And I'd offer to help,
but my help doesn't seem

929
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,453
to be what you want, either.

00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,083
You didn't have to.

959
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:41,041
Your son's doing well, I hope,

960
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,250
made the most of his
medical career.

961
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,583
Yeah, he's a good doctor.

962
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,500
That's what I wanted for him.

963
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,500
If he hadn't have supplied those
future sons of Hippocrates

964
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:57,583
with Adderall, some other
med student would have.

965
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,125
I won't let you
dictate my rulings.

966
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:05,959
The bench cannot be tainted
by personal debts.

967
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,959
Name another favor.

968
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:11,959
I know that this is the biggest
case that you've ever drawn.

969
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,750
Well, that's something that you
would think about in my shoes,

970
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,625
but I don't.

971
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:20,583
No, you wouldn't.

972
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,500
And you wouldn't hide
in a hallway waiting

973
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,792
to pounce when I walked by.

974
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,166
But I am not the man you are.

975
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,792
Oh.

976
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,792
You're not here to ask
me to shade my rulings.

977
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,000
You're here to ask
me to step off it.

978
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:46,792
It's a hard laydown. And I'm
asking you to lay it down.

979
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:51,375
Ask yourself

980
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,750
who you really are, Chuck.

981
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:57,041
Are you the man that's
reduced to collecting debts

982
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:01,333
of the soul like... Like old Mr.
Scratch?

983
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:03,709
Well, as with all stories
about that being,

984
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:07,458
the debt is due, even
if, especially if,

985
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:11,542
it is not fair or even
right to collect it.

986
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,542
Believe me, my... my insides
hurt making this request.

987
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,333
Oh, I don't believe
that even a little.

988
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,041
You like your insides
just as they are.

989
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,917
You want to be right here,
making these moves.

990
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,333
You need that feeling in your
stomach to know you're alive.

991
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,333
I really think I am sorry.

992
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:39,166
Fuck you, Chuck!

993
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,208
I'll recuse myself.

994
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:52,250
My tab is clear.

May I?

1000
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,291
Do you want me to call the
Secretary of the Treasury

1001
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,125
and ask for a personal loan?

1002
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:21,125
I just heard DeGiulio is the
new judge on the Axelrod case.

1003
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,208
Not our dream judge,
but fair-minded,

1004
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:26,792
likely to hew closely to
the law, rule narrowly.

1005
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,250
That'll favor us a
lot more than Funt.

1006
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, then,

1007
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,417
I guess it's a gift.

1008
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,291
Chuck.

1009
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:39,166
I know his fingerprints.

1010
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,709
Are you gonna do
something about this?

1011
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,709
I'm not in the habit
of rejecting gifts.

1012
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:53,333
Do you know about
White Day in Japan?

1013
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,792
Over there on Valentine's
Day, women buy presents

1014
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:00,166
for their salarymen bosses, and
those presents are displayed

1015
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,450
for all to see, so the most
important thing is the size.

1016
00:51:02,474 --> 00:51:06,041
That's how others know that
the recipient is valued.

1017
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,959
A month later, on White Day,
the men give a return gift

1018
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,250
of two to three times the value.

1019
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:16,500
So if there's a salaryman
you don't respect,

1020
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,041
you get him something
small but expensive.

1021
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,166
Chuck just gave you
diamond cufflinks,

1022
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,458
and when White Day comes,
you're gonna have to give him

1023
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:34,000
something that costs a lot more.

How did we do today?

1038
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,834
Just executed a huge PIPE.

1039
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,917
We're going to arb a Southeast
Asian sugar company.

1040
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:20,667
Fun.

1041
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,458
If all my projections hold,

1042
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,375
we're still down five
percent overall.

1043
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,291
Anyone else would have lost 12

1044
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,417
or done something
stupid to get even.

1045
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,083
Booking the loss
was the only way.

1046
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,917
I'm not pulling the two billion.

1047
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,709
It's yours to invest.

1048
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,458
I really thought you
didn't trust me.

1049
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,000
That's why you
were in the office

1050
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,709
looking over
everyone's shoulder.

1051
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,250
I was in the office,
because as of now,

1052
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,583
I don't know what else
to do with myself.

1053
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:57,250
And...

1054
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:02,000
as much as I can trust
anyone with my name

1055
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,709
and my money...

1056
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,041
I trust you.

1057
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,250
I am irrelevant.

1058
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:10,208
You want the money because you
want the stake, the control.

1059
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,959
You need the game to
remember who you are.

1060
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:17,583
I've decided how I'm going
to invest that two billion.

1061
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:21,709
I'm going to diversify,
invest in outside funds.

1062
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:25,125
I'll hear pitches, among them
your hand-picked favorites.

1063
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,917
And after I give them the money,

1064
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,250
I'm going to be a
passive investor.

1065
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,208
Thank you.

1066
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,500
You're not doing this
'cause I need it.

1067
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,583
You need it.

1068
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:49,291
You're giving me a place to
play so I stay off your field.

1069
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:52,417
And you want the benefit of
my moves on our bottom line

1070
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,125
in case there's
another disaster.

1071
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,959

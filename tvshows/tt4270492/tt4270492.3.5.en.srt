1
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:07,106
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,475
He is a candidate for a
drug trial in Pittsburgh

3
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,745
that's been yielding some
pretty interesting results.

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:13,647
Maybe we shouldn't bring it up.

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,082
Thank you, Dr. Gilbert,
for the excellent care.

6
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,451
<i>I was told they
weren't in any danger,</i>

7
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,386
that a doctor was consulted.

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:21,620
A doctor?

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,389
<i>You broke into my computer,</i>

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,891
<i>opened my files,
and read my session notes.</i>

11
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,593
You stole the evidence you needed.

12
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,128
I'm here to ask a favor.

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,729
Why would I do that?

14
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,831
Oscar Langstraat.

15
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,832
Good to finally meet you
in person, Bobby.

16
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:35,034
I know who you are.

17
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,502
To the good we've done.

18
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,870
And will do.

19
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,039
I'll leave this to you two to carve up.

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,340
<i>You will make a
call to Bobby Axelrod.</i>

21
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,909
<i>You'll tell him that my father</i>

22
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,812
<i>has taken a massive
position in a new IPO.</i>

23
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:47,914
<i>Ice Juice.</i>

24
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,315
I believe I can do all that.

25
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,542
<i>I'm a man of science.</i>

26
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,112
<i>But this isn't Jonas Salk.</i>

27
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,180
<i>It's Doctor Mengele.</i>

28
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,417
<i>Pure evil.</i>

29
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:29,586
It's outrageous.

30
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,088
Imagine being so heartless

31
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,757
that you continue to put
tumors in living creatures

32
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,694
even after you know the
drug wasn't working.

33
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,663
No profit is worth that.

34
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:44,400
Only a monster would profit from
an animal's misery and death.

35
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,603
And it's illegal!

36
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,473
Well, we're gonna blow the whistle,
loud and long.

37
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:52,942
And I'm going to get you
whistleblower protection.

38
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:55,111
I've already got the
attorneys all lined up.

39
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,279
We need to go quickly.

40
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,281
They're trying to get
one more stock bump

41
00:01:58,383 --> 00:01:59,815
before it becomes public that...

42
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,184
Here's a little something
to tide you over

43
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,187
in the fallout from your
testimony against Mendham.

44
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,799
Waiting for anyone?

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,702
Wheels-up as soon as I hit the chair.

46
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,409
EDNY just grilled Dr. Gilbert.

47
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,743
We tracked them interdicting

48
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:30,805
every doctor you've gone to
or made a donation to.

49
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:31,927
When they got to Gilbert...

50
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:33,882
We knew we had to pull
you off the plane.

51
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:36,951
I was really fucking looking
forward to the City by the Bay.

52
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,221
You want your slide
back from my lab or...

53
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,423
No. Get rid of it for me.

54
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:46,895
For your foundation.

55
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:50,798
<i>The slide.</i>

56
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,201
<i>What did he do with the slide?</i>

57
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,635
Fingerprints live for years.

58
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:55,536
Decades.

59
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:59,373
Offering it up would give him
massive bargaining power with the Feds.

60
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,576
You were right to intercept me.

61
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:02,843
I need to see him.

62
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,218
You can't cancel.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,154
I mean, you can,
but tomorrow's opportunities

64
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,090
will be subscribed with or without you.

65
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,826
I'll send my CIO.
Taylor Mason. You've met.

66
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,627
<i>Sure did. Smart person.</i>

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,929
Didn't seem like a fan of me
or my work, but...

68
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,511
Well, we jerked them around a little.

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,865
So they felt jerked around.

70
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:29,135
But trust me, they are
a huge Oscar Langstraat fan.

71
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:30,970
<i>Don't make me
spend time with that guy...</i>

72
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,606
VCs are just hedge fund managers

73
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,708
who can quote the
<i>Tibetan Book Of The Dead.</i>

74
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,477
Well, he has the pick of the
best investments out there.

75
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,678
I need to manage our investments<i> here.</i>

76
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,647
Axe Cap goes wherever you do.

77
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,820
<i>How'd it go with the doctors?</i>

78
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:49,922
Not well.

79
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,590
There's something there, but...

80
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,025
Then you have to find it.

81
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:56,695
We know Axelrod used a doctor
to help develop the toxicant.

82
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,097
You need to find out which and how.

83
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,566
- Trying.
- You're very aggressive

84
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,668
when it comes to running
down phantom leads,

85
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,236
but when it comes to real ones...

86
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,216
Dake, I've already seen
literally dozens of doctors

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,339
with ties to Axelrod.

88
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,075
The trial is looming and
you are not making progress.

89
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:13,311
Failure is getting to be
a familiar refrain with you.

90
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,213
Don't let it become your anthem.

91
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,418
Wend.

92
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,756
I just heard from Dake.

93
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,364
Whatever it is, however bad, say it...

94
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,966
I can't unsee what I saw

95
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,836
when I read your session notes.

96
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:41,005
And something in them may be the key

97
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,541
to making sure that you
and I don't go down.

98
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,542
But Axe does.

99
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:48,712
I can't unsee it.

100
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,283
And I know it's, uh...

101
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,784
What almost ended our marriage?

102
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:54,685
Yes.

103
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,188
But the information...

104
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,023
Axe convinced a doctor

105
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,992
not to give that experimental
treatment to Donnie Caan,

106
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,829
to shorten the man's life.

107
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,999
He may have used the same doctor
in his Ice Juice poisoning.

108
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,470
You didn't put the doc's
name in the session notes.

109
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:16,005
I didn't have it.

110
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,407
I don't.

111
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,777
I'm gonna have to go to Donnie's widower
to get the name.

112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,148
That's what I woke you to say.

113
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,852
And if it makes you feel
better to tell me not to,

114
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,188
do so, right now.

115
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,023
But I promise not to listen.

116
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,675
Thank you.

117
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:07,955
Where you going?

118
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,791
Barcelona.

119
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:14,195
You're not supposed to tally up
your trial wins in advance,

120
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,998
but I've seen it a
thousand times in my mind.

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,767
Jury shuffles in.

122
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:21,836
And Axe turns my way,
rich fuck smirk on his face,

123
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,137
sure he's charmed them.

124
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,839
Certain he's won,
because that's life as he's known it.

125
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,987
You know he thinks I'm a sucker
for not taking the money.

126
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,910
For doing my job.

127
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,844
He thinks I don't understand the game.

128
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,214
And yet...
why did the foreman just say "guilty"?

129
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,616
Must be a mistake.
Must've skipped the "not."

130
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,919
But then they read the
next count and the next.

131
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,887
"Guilty, guilty."

132
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,726
Is that what you're
picturing when we're...

133
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:46,960
No.

134
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,463
Sometimes.

135
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,832
I might be able to tell
the times that you do...

136
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:54,568
Anyway, lately
that vision is slipping away.

137
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,403
Same as my case.

138
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:59,572
Bry, I have to go.

139
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,707
The corporate jet just got re-done...

140
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,510
They took Lawrence Boyd's
initials off of it,

141
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,146
put the new CEO's on.

142
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:09,115
I want to get there early and
make sure everything is right.

143
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,583
Sure...

144
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:11,818
How the mighty tumble.

145
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,564
One day your initials are
all over the private jet,

146
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:15,054
next you're in jail...

147
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,457
And the next day you're out.

148
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,992
Crazy ride for the rich
and infamous, right?

149
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:25,665
See you soon.

150
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,600
Mm.

151
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,496
You got me.

152
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:58,964
I'm here with Dollar Bill.

153
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,131
He wants to short...

154
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:01,633
Mendham Pharmaceuticals.

155
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:04,369
They're about to draw the ire
of the libtards for cruelty

156
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:06,070
and the Street for missing targets.

157
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:09,507
You use that word so I feel rage
and then tell myself not to allow that

158
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:12,010
<i>to make me predisposed
against your idea. Smart.</i>

159
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:14,812
And would work if I hadn't
studied Agrippa, which I have.

160
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:17,281
Regardless, I support this
if Compliance approves.

161
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,317
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

162
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,019
Welcome.

163
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,220
Hello.

164
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,156
- Sorry, the office.
- Oh. Do what you must...

165
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,424
Can I arrange some coffee?

166
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,627
You don't have Chromatic
in New York, do you?

167
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,128
No, thank you... and no.

168
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,030
We have a pitch in a few.

169
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,598
I'll use the few.

170
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,766
It's Steve Wozniak.

171
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:38,001
Really?

172
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:40,303
No.

173
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:52,283
We're clear.

174
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,559
Doctor.

175
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,793
He'll hold your stuff.

176
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,531
Nice hobby.

177
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,333
<i>My</i> time of late has been
spent in reflection.

178
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,070
Replaying pivotal moments in my life.

179
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,771
Yeah, I don't see how I fit in.

180
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:18,374
I need the slide that I left with you.

181
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,576
I disposed of it. As you asked.

182
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,911
<i>Get rid of it for me.</i>

183
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,587
<i>Get rid of it for me.</i>

184
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,865
I wouldn't lie to you.

185
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,734
No, no, of course not.

186
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,336
You've always been good to me.

187
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,171
But have I been good enough to you?

188
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,306
Absolutely.

189
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,808
I could have done more.

190
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,943
What can I do for you<i> now?</i>

191
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,178
I want for nothing.

192
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Oh, you must want<i> something.</i>
Give it some thought.

193
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,216
We'll meet again soon.

194
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,062
The Donnie Caan Success Academy.

195
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,165
Impressive.

196
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,233
When do you break ground?

197
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,567
Already did.

198
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:23,670
Should be completed
by the end of the year.

199
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:24,505
Chuck...

200
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,173
I know who you are.

201
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,708
You're the man who made
my husband's last days

202
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,876
a living hell.

203
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,911
Pressuring him to wear a wire,

204
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,781
to testify, inform.

205
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:39,653
Well, I'm not proud
of every day of my life.

206
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,688
And I hope you don't
think I'm speaking ill...

207
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,758
but I don't imagine that Donnie
was proud of every day of his.

208
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:48,961
He wasn't a saint.

209
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:51,297
Donnie made choices. Compromises.

210
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,968
He made decisions about how to live.

211
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,971
Unfortunately not how he died.

212
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,575
There was an experimental drug.

213
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:05,410
It probably could have given
him another half a year.

214
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:09,848
But Donnie's doctor,
bought and paid for by Bobby Axelrod,

215
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,850
withheld that information...

216
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:15,453
so Donnie wouldn't live
long enough to testify.

217
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:20,059
His last Christmas
with you and your kids,

218
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,259
was taken away.

219
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:25,297
What the fuck are you saying?

220
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,332
Donnie died when he did,

221
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,967
because that's when it was
convenient for Axelrod.

222
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,471
Privilege prevents me

223
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:37,609
from being able to get
Donnie's medical records.

224
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,977
You, as next of kin, can overcome that.

225
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,113
You can give me a waiver,

226
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,016
so that I can get access
to who that doctor was...

227
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,484
His oncologist

228
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,822
was as compassionate
and thorough a doctor

229
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,857
as I've ever seen.

230
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,559
He came to the funeral. He held my hand.

231
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,030
He was among the first 15 people
to donate to this place.

232
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:11,541
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

233
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,576
I'll leave you in peace.

234
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:19,049
<i>I have some questions
about the legitimacy</i>

235
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,785
of a certain charter school,
its independence.

236
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,921
I have questions about the
entire idea of charter schools.

237
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:26,580
No one knows if they work.

238
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,523
It's just because a bunch of rich people

239
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,704
- decided that they were...
- Let's... let's take a long canoe

240
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,961
trip someday and discuss it.

241
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:34,597
But for now I need some records

242
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,600
and I don't want to start a
whole official investigation.

243
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:41,904
I just need to know who invested
in the launch of this thing.

244
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,606
Can you help?

245
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,740
Off the books?

246
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,075
You know I can.

247
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:53,015
Mm.

248
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,084
Nice digs.

249
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,186
But you didn't have me over to see them.

250
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:03,858
I needed to get you away
from your place, from Chuck,

251
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,128
in the hopes that you'd see it,
and him, clearly.

252
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,830
Because what I see disturbs me.

253
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:11,132
Chuck's fucked up.
That's your big headline?

254
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,554
Chuck's<i> done</i> something fucked up.

255
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:14,356
And it's gonna take the
whole office down...

256
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:17,071
unless you put some daylight
between the two of you.

257
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:20,541
Why would I do that now,
right after he promoted me?

258
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,179
What do you think I don't know?

259
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:27,081
The day Axe was arrested.
The day you got promoted.

260
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:28,950
- The day I got transferred.
- Busy day.

261
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:32,287
And yet before all that,
something else happened.

262
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,955
Something you and I couldn't explain.

263
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,163
Why isn't Lawrence Boyd in prison?

264
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,536
Right. Tell her...

265
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,070
Oh, good. Good.

266
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,039
Let's hear what you have to say, Darren.

267
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:53,473
Everyone loves Table Service,

268
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,775
an app that connects millennial diners

269
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,044
to their favorite tables.

270
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:59,346
I knew this whole thing
was a waste of time.

271
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,250
I'll be right back.

272
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,134
Figure a fella flies out here,
you'd show 'em something

273
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,792
- they might be able<i> invest</i> in.
- He's got a solid pitch!

274
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,194
And so your position in it
must be thick as Nicki Minaj.

275
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,630
- You didn't even hear it.
- Did I need to. Really?

276
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,866
I promised to show Axe
investable start ups.

277
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,868
- That's what I...
- You were testing me, us,

278
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,370
to see if we could tell that
this was in your bottom tranche.

279
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,273
Hedge funds come out here,
their time horizon is different,

280
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,942
they want to tell their investors
they're diversified.

281
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,244
That's what I offered you.

282
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:32,912
Thank you for a very pleasant day.

283
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,358
Have your car take me to the airport.

284
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:36,648
Mr. Axelrod insists on
hearing bad news at once.

285
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:38,886
Funny.

286
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,952
No. I wasn't testing you.

287
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,655
But if I was, you passed.

288
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,056
Stick around.

289
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,693
I think you'll enjoy the next pitch.

290
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,195
Go ahead, Darren.

291
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,669
A great-looking machine, huh?

292
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,837
All that chrome.

293
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,041
Grinder, tamper, knock box.

294
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:06,611
Quality and integrity.

295
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:10,048
After a full review

296
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,051
I can't say the same thing
about you, Dollar Bill.

297
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:16,120
And I can't approve the Mendham short.

298
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:17,789
Are you fucking kidding me?

299
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:18,891
There's research.

300
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,858
That's not research. I know research.

301
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,094
This is<i> caca De vaca.</i>

302
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:25,430
I can translate if you...

303
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:29,066
Is everybody here under this
nitpick fuck hole microscope

304
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,334
or just me?

305
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,702
I've been aware of your
moves ever since my time

306
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,571
at the Securities Exchange Commission.

307
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,640
Y-You think because the cat's away

308
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,075
the Bill will play?

309
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:46,382
You motherfucking, needle-dicked,

310
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,652
six-figure pants shitter!

311
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:51,020
And if you need me
to translate<i> that,</i> it means...

312
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:53,089
It's<i> cagato addosso</i> in Italian.

313
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,658
<i>Hosenscheisser</i> in German.

314
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,726
But also, let me say this in English.

315
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,429
Fucking stop this steel
cage match right now.

316
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,865
No. I am the last line of defense.

317
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,866
Keeping us all out of prison.

318
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:06,302
If we were in prison,
I would rent you out

319
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,472
for a fucking scoop of mashed potatoes.

320
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:14,677
Calm the fuck down, shut the fuck up,
and get into my office. Both of you.

321
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,090
Is this couples therapy?

322
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,826
Is this what couples therapy is like?

323
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:31,961
You've never been?

324
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,396
I've never been married
but I've gone to couples

325
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,365
with three separate women.

326
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,799
Never did it.

327
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,335
Which may be how I stay
married to two women.

328
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:41,803
This isn't couples.

329
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:44,006
But behind pretty much
every shouting match

330
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,640
is a communications breakdown.

331
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:47,442
What we got here

332
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:48,710
is failure to communicate.

333
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,379
<i>A</i> failure to communicate.

334
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,679
Actually it's both.

335
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,860
Strother Martin says it one way,
Newman another. But, yes.

336
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:55,495
Now I'm going to give
you 30 seconds to say

337
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,429
what you think of each other...
to really blow it out

338
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:00,121
into the open... and then
we're burying that crap forever.

339
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:01,689
- Who wants to go first...
- May I?

340
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,359
Bill is ego-maniacal. Greedy. Dangerous.

341
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:06,895
Crude. Juvenile...

342
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,729
Okay. Dollar Bill...

343
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:11,899
You're a pretentious, preening ass.

344
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,867
You're a parasite. You're not an earner.

345
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,504
You're a page pusher. You got no balls.

346
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,805
You're less than a man...
and that's not sexist

347
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:21,308
because you're less than
any woman I've ever shared

348
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,709
- a trading desk with...
- Stop.

349
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,111
Dammit.
I was just getting into a rhythm.

350
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,380
Wasted three seconds on
that not sexist crap...

351
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,883
Can I add reckless to my prior list.

352
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:32,252
And borderline criminal, bigamist...

353
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,755
Enough. That was ugly.

354
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,925
We don't live there or we become ugly.

355
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,459
Instead: goals.

356
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,594
Simple. Make money.

357
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,663
Fucking craploads of green.

358
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,665
For myself. For my family.

359
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,101
For Axe Cap.

360
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,436
Earn a nice living?

361
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,570
Sure.

362
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,072
But my duty is to do so

363
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:55,275
while stewarding this
company through safe waters,

364
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,009
avoiding regulatory scrutiny

365
00:17:57,112 --> 00:17:59,211
and upholding our
fiduciary responsibility...

366
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,448
I hate every pore of you...

367
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,816
Shit.

368
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,152
If this was couples therapy,
my prescription would be: break up.

369
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,254
Immediately.

370
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,790
But we are all more than married here.

371
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:13,192
And this is our unit.

372
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:16,161
And we are sticking together
to win this<i> fucking</i> war...

373
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,797
You two will never,
ever like each other.

374
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,599
This is like<i> No Exit</i> without the guy.

375
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,501
Or, fuck, I'm the guy.

376
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,603
Jesus.

377
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,537
I have nothing to offer except this:

378
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,708
I have never told Axe to fire
someone for being a dick.

379
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,310
Don't become the first.

380
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,786
<i>Dr. Gilbert would have
to keep it refrigerated.</i>

381
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,454
How long could it last on its own?

382
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,224
After 18 hours, give or take,
the toxin would evaporate.

383
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,825
Unless refrigerated.

384
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,963
<i>Do you want us to check his lab?</i>

385
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,835
And his home.

386
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,742
He hasn't reached out yet.
Hasn't asked for anything.

387
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,484
- Are you sure he kept it?
- You ever take

388
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,612
a get-out-of-jail-free card
and just throw it away?

389
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,214
I think I've trained to have
the discipline to do just that.

390
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,083
You would. I know it.

391
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,654
He ain't you. He has it.

392
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,723
And we have to make sure he
gives it to us and not the Feds.

393
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,895
Bottle.

394
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,935
I don't literally mean bottle.

395
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,585
I always wondered if shrinks
did that after a session.

396
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,555
They would if they had to deal
with the bullshit I just did.

397
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,523
I'm sitting there
talking to those two...

398
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,725
and I say this with love... idiots,

399
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,894
and all I can think is:

400
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,796
I have to do this with Chuck and Axe.

401
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:01,898
Why haven't I?

402
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,131
Because you're not insane.

403
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,601
And if you think that was
a waste of your fucking time...

404
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,036
Why is it so crazy to think
that these two brilliant...

405
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,538
Because Dollar Bill and
Spyros may be oil and water

406
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,241
but your two other fellows
are nitrate and glycerol.

407
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:14,375
You combine those...

408
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,311
Yeah. I know. Boom.

409
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,980
And, I really don't want
you burning up with 'em.

410
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
Surprised you haven't already.

411
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,017
You know.

412
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,484
They would never admit this,

413
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:25,587
but when they first met,
when Chuck and I

414
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,256
first started dating,
they liked each other plenty.

415
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,657
More than that.

416
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,427
Smartest guys in the room.
Saw themselves in each other.

417
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,894
Chuck was in private practice.

418
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:36,897
No reason he and Axe
needed to end up here...

419
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:39,900
I miss the old days. Don't you?

420
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:43,003
Hell yeah,

421
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,805
doing lines off a hooker's hip bones,

422
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,540
my cell phone in one hand, and my...

423
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:48,242
Mnh-mnh.

424
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,211
I meant simpler times.

425
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:52,947
And as great a toll as
that lifestyle took on you,

426
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,217
this one is kicking the shit out of me.

427
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:59,386
Some days, I don't understand
how you're still ambulatory.

428
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:03,257
What's my choice,
succumb to a case of the vapours?

429
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,128
Because it's either that or soldier on.

430
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,398
Come.

431
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:19,672
Is this a desk talk or a couch talk?

432
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,040
Lawrence Boyd.

433
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:23,843
Couch.

434
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:26,780
We made a deal to put Boyd in prison.

435
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:28,514
Boyd is not in prison.

436
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,885
And he's not Papillon. So...

437
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:35,254
The judge's order
releasing him is under seal.

438
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:37,956
And it should stay that way
for the foreseeable future,

439
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:41,093
so... maybe let that be enough.

440
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,498
It's Connerty asking.

441
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:59,311
<i>I</i> secured
Lawrence Boyd's release.

442
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:03,682
He was instrumental in
bringing Axelrod to justice.

443
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:04,917
Hmm.

444
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,918
But since neither of you
could officially

445
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,687
be affiliated with that case,

446
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:14,492
you must have come up
with something else...

447
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,494
Active cooperation?

448
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:18,863
Against?

449
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:23,434
What would raise fewer eyebrows
than Boyd turning on his own employees?

450
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:26,337
But I haven't seen any new
cases against Spartan-Ives.

451
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,707
I was hoping not to go back to Boyd.

452
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,542
But now we have to.

453
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,477
I'll need your help.

454
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,713
- Why would I...
- You already decided.

455
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:38,415
Before you told me the Connerty piece.

456
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,120
We here at Rhoades Airlines know
you have many travel options

457
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:47,558
and are grateful that you
have chosen to fly with us.

458
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,394
You will be rewarded.

459
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,963
Your Honor, we request
that you unseal your order

460
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:55,531
re-sentencing Lawrence Boyd
to time served.

461
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,868
We're not saying a fraud
has<i> necessarily</i> been

462
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,570
- committed on this court, but...
- Excuse me, counselor.

463
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,973
Please wait for SDNY to respond.

464
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,008
This isn't an adversarial motion.

465
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,010
Then don't fight.

466
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,811
Apologies for my tardiness.

467
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,180
Kate Sacker, for SDNY.

468
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:12,248
We originally asked you
to seal this order

469
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,217
as a matter of witness safety
and investigative integrity.

470
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,453
Those same concerns still apply.

471
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:19,321
We'll keep it under seal.

472
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:23,225
And maybe the government
could talk amongst itself.

473
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:32,334
You say it's a dead-end, then show up

474
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:34,403
- to argue against me?
- I'm Chief of Crim.

475
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:36,305
And if you remember that whole contest,

476
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,718
you know that Chuck likes to
pit people against one another.

477
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:41,343
He thinks I'm working him,
so he's using our friendship

478
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,745
- to work me?
- Wouldn't put it past him.

479
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,179
You gonna appeal?

480
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,917
See you in the Second Circuit.

481
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:53,455
This is the most private room I have.

482
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,490
No one will know you were at the office.

483
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:58,527
I've been in war rooms before...

484
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:02,063
Love that frisson of danger in the air.

485
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,400
I've asked you here because
I require cooperation.

486
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,835
I did what you asked.

487
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:10,805
Oh, that was<i> entre nous.</i>

488
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,907
Officially, I need you

489
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:15,810
to give up a few
misbehaving moneylenders.

490
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,135
I never did repent for doing good,
nor shall not now...

491
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,715
I tell the judge you're not cooperating,
you go back inside.

492
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:25,319
And I tell him about our real deal,
you bunk with me.

493
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,620
Why, Chuck?

494
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:29,323
Why do you default to
demanding and threatening?

495
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,559
Why don't you ever ask what I want?

496
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,427
What do you want?

497
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:34,894
Thanks for asking.

498
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:38,131
I like simple pleasures...
butter in my ass,

499
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,233
lollipops in my mouth...

500
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:43,903
and taking my boat
to Antibes free and clear.

501
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,873
I'll have your passport returned,

502
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,776
your supervised release
restrictions removed.

503
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:51,744
Now: names.

504
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,480
My boat.

505
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:56,048
- I need The Champlain back.
- That's out of my hands.

506
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,350
The government seized it.

507
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,185
It's been deemed legally forfeit.

508
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,287
So navigate the swamp.

509
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,289
Until then, no names.

510
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:06,659
Sorry, pal, your credit,
is no good here.

511
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:09,528
If he has... what you think he has...

512
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,730
you have a shot at a
chain of custody argument.

513
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:14,400
Could convince the court that
your fingerprints could have

514
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,335
been taken off a glass
of Pappy and transferred.

515
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:18,637
How likely is that?

516
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,307
In reality or in the collective
imagination of a jury?

517
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,409
Either.

518
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:25,043
Lightning striking the Powerball winner.

519
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,482
He called to meet?

520
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,751
On my way.

521
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:34,452
Is that the lightning bolt?

522
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:36,421
We'll find out.

523
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,429
Axe. I've been calling.

524
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:45,897
And I haven't been answering.

525
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:48,211
Don't you think that's maybe
a sign it's not a good time?

526
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:51,102
You won't believe the bullshit
that's going on in your name.

527
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,171
- Spyros is blocking me...
- Unsafe.

528
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:56,074
Use the proper channels.
I don't know where the ears are.

529
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,777
Strip or Retire!

530
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:00,778
What?

531
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,527
"Strip or Retire."

532
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,562
That's the motto that was
carved above the palestra

533
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:07,051
in ancient Athens.
Where they wrestled in the nude...

534
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:08,452
This is getting weird, Bill...

535
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:11,488
It means every man
should have skin in the game.

536
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,758
His rep, his honor, fully on the line

537
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,960
because it means all.

538
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:18,128
Like mine.

539
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,697
You think you can't trust me,
you're wrong.

540
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,332
Show me the wire, Bobby!

541
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:24,201
- Huh, where is it?
- Bill.

542
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:27,071
This is public. Very public.

543
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,739
And we look like we're having
a lovers' tiff, at best.

544
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:32,141
Now, I got an important
fucking meeting to go to.

545
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:33,409
So pull up your pants

546
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:35,545
and stop looking to me for help.

547
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,246
Help yourself.

548
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:43,687
I'm starting at the
justifiable tradeoff point...

549
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,789
traceable user identity
based on the human voice.

550
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,692
The whole thing utilizes
extant voice technology.

551
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:51,461
All right. Thoughts?

552
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:54,497
Strong concept. My only concern is:

553
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,566
You don't own the tech
you want to retool.

554
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,167
That's your thermal exhaust port.

555
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:59,269
My...

556
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:00,769
Flaw in the Death Star.

557
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,238
The two-meter wide gap

558
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,074
that runs directly into
the reactor system.

559
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:06,441
Why I'm here.

560
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,111
I need help to seal it before
I get blown the fuck up.

561
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,245
Let us talk.

562
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:12,748
I think we can figure out
something you'll like.

563
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,850
That was nice.

564
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:15,651
- Yes, it went...
- Yeah, that was good.

565
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,923
People are too harsh on the port.

566
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:23,265
They think it's a plot problem.

567
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,093
Like, "Why didn't they plug the hole?"

568
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:26,628
I know! Unfairly derided.

569
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,341
What material<i> could</i>
withstand the heat expended

570
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,365
from that mammoth sphere?

571
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:31,600
Plus, it was fortified
with gun turrets and...

572
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:33,301
And a fleet of TIE fighters. Yes.

573
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,604
Nobody gets on Homer for the
whole Achilles' heel situation.

574
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:38,372
She had to hold him by something.

575
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,042
Have dinner with me.

576
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,144
I can get a table at
State Bird Provisions.

577
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,446
Sorry. When I saw how
things were going earlier

578
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:46,614
I made other plans.

579
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:50,685
But now... well, shit.

580
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,487
Tomorrow?

581
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,623
Leaving first thing. Another time.

582
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,863
So, here's a chance to earn my trust.

583
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:08,569
What do you know about asset forfeiture?

584
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:11,404
You want to toot around
in a drug pusher's Ferrari,

585
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:12,572
Sonny Crockett-style?

586
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:16,143
I want to know how
assets might wind up...

587
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:18,511
where they don't belong.

588
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,113
There's "the undercover brother."

589
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:23,817
Requisition the asset for use
in a confidential investigation

590
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,486
that lasts... as long as you want it to.

591
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,254
Want the item out the door.

592
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:30,557
Mm.

593
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,825
What about running the
old empty auction play?

594
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,127
Give insufficient notice
on the Marshals' site,

595
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,431
then have a straw buyer
snatch up the thing for a song.

596
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,366
Of course, you gotta cajole a Marshal.

597
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,002
But that's almost its own reward.

598
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,503
That.

599
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,837
And do it in stealth mode.

600
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,739
Roger. What's the vehicle?

601
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,275
Ah, a floater...

602
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:04,021
We're clear.

603
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,858
You got in touch with my guys.

604
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,461
Yeah, in the last day,
I found my grant under review,

605
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,563
the lease on my lab
suddenly in question,

606
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:14,410
nothing out of place at home...
though I still feel

607
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:16,500
- like someone has been there.
- Huh.

608
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:19,136
These tactics are deeply objectionable.

609
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:21,605
Well, you're a diagnostician.

610
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:25,142
So, before you form a hypothesis,
let alone reach a conclusion,

611
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:27,044
I thought you should have all the data.

612
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:30,114
Meaning that you can hurt me
as much as the government can.

613
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:31,615
Who wants to hurt anybody?

614
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:32,916
All of this is unnecessary.

615
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,118
I told you: I disposed of the slide.

616
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,786
How?

617
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:37,787
<i>How?</i>

618
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:38,921
Wastebasket? Hallway?

619
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:40,257
Dumpster?

620
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,625
Talk me through it.

621
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:44,827
Okay. The slide was on
my desk in a plastic bag.

622
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:48,231
<i>You left, I took the slide
to my exam room.</i>

623
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,467
<i>I was going to
put it in the biohazard bin,</i>

624
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,701
<i>and then I
remembered it's emptied weekly</i>

625
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:55,138
<i>and had just
been picked up that day.</i>

626
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,539
I didn't want the slide
sitting there for a week.

627
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,208
<i>Oh. So you took it home?</i>

628
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,777
<i>No.</i>

629
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:03,412
<i>I went to my lab. We have a kiln.</i>

630
00:30:03,514 --> 00:30:04,847
That destroys slides?

631
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:09,050
<i>Russians destroyed thousands
of doping samples that way.</i>

632
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:10,153
How did you get there?

633
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:11,153
How did I...

634
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:12,621
Did you fucking beam yourself?

635
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,357
I walked down the hallway.

636
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,858
Did you see anyone?

637
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,859
<i>No.</i>

638
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,161
Yes.

639
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:22,030
<i>Jenny. One of my assistants.</i>

640
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:23,732
<i>Did you say anything to her?</i>

641
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,733
<i>I just kinda nodded.</i>

642
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:28,870
You need me to demonstrate the nod?

643
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,505
I'll let you know.

644
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:33,608
<i>I tossed it in the kiln.</i>

645
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:37,345
<i>That was that.
No one else there.</i>

646
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,048
That's very cautious and precise.

647
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,084
I swear on my Hippocratic oath.

648
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:45,252
You have to trust me.

649
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:46,921
That's a very credible story.

650
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:51,225
But in my line of work,
we aim to eliminate risk.

651
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,093
It's called downside protection.

652
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:55,129
Now, there's always a price for it.

653
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:56,897
The question is:

654
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,999
Am I going to pay it...

655
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:00,600
or are you?

656
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:06,606
Mafee!

657
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:07,709
What up, brawler?

658
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,910
Got a trade I want you to execute.

659
00:31:10,012 --> 00:31:12,213
You want to go<i> long</i>
on Mendham Pharmaceuticals?

660
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:14,113
Like Staubach to Drew Pearson.

661
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,416
Vintage ref. Nice.

662
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,455
I return to you your prized vessel.

663
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,663
Are you ready to name names?

664
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,832
It hurts me to do that
to generally good men.

665
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,702
I'm sure the pain will subside
as the Cֳ´te D'Azur comes into view.

666
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:38,071
That it will.

667
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:41,407
So, as the venerable
David Lee Roth once said:

668
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:42,641
Might as well jump.

669
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:47,913
Please speak those names
to my associates.

670
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:50,182
They will oversee the case-making.

671
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,453
So you were saying?

672
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:02,817
_

673
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,613
_

674
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:06,865
I got you.

675
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:09,902
Knocking? No?

676
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:11,736
Fire Dollar Bill Stearn!

677
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:13,984
I thought you already
packed that peace pipe

678
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:15,173
and smoked it to the dome.

679
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,243
My software flagged him
trying to slip the trade by.

680
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:19,444
He repackaged it.

681
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:23,782
Instead of shorting Mendham,
he went long. Very long.

682
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:25,917
And hedged it with credit default swaps.

683
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,852
So, when Mendham tanks, we clean up.

684
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:30,021
You gotta admit,
that's pretty fucking good.

685
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:35,259
The only good thing is that
I ran down his little charade.

686
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:37,661
This trade fits Bill's MO to a T.

687
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:42,366
It is exactly what my compadres
down at the Commish salivate over.

688
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,667
So block it.

689
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,403
I did. That's not enough.

690
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:47,571
If he isn't fired, I'm gone.

691
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:50,274
And to make sure that I don't
face any future charges,

692
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:54,377
I would need to document
all of this and turn him in.

693
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,483
Compliance must be... complied with.

694
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,496
This is the Netrunner tournament, yes?

695
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:14,764
- Yep.
- Taylor Mason,

696
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:17,500
- you should have my name...
- Let me take a look.

697
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,239
You're good to go.

698
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:29,912
Good evening, gentlemen.
Welcome to Daniel.

699
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:32,882
I've prepared a wonderful
tasting menu for you tonight.

700
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:35,017
Enjoy your evening, and bon appיtit.

701
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,286
Thanks for opening up for us, Daniel.

702
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:38,554
Good to see you, Axe...

703
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:44,726
Full restaurant buyout.

704
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,829
Impression made, Mr. Axelrod!

705
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:49,764
And Daniel of all places!

706
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:53,202
The precision of that man's
kitchen is mesmerizing.

707
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:56,505
Puts me in mind of a
formicarium I built as a kid.

708
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:58,607
That where you jerked off?

709
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,608
Ant farm...

710
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,276
He knows it's an ant farm.

711
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,779
That's some white burg...

712
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:12,954
...fleshy yellow apple,
notes of starfruit...

713
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:14,056
Enough of that.

714
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:16,324
Spyros, tell me what you see
as the difference

715
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:18,326
between your old job and your new one.

716
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:19,894
Ah. Well.

717
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:23,731
As you know, my career at the SEC was

718
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,366
rather distinguished.

719
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:27,902
I attribute that to one thing:

720
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,504
integrity.

721
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:30,905
Which I now bring with me

722
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:34,542
as I walk the other side
of the same street for you.

723
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:38,245
Where I once policed violations,
I now prevent them...

724
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:39,613
Wrong.

725
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:41,348
One word: risk.

726
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,784
Inside the government there is none.

727
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,719
Every action, every moment is backed

728
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:49,056
by the full power and credit...
suspect as that may be...

729
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:51,058
of the United States of America.

730
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,161
Everything is all fucking
covered by Big State.

731
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:55,695
Like a plump bosomed wet nurse.

732
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,264
But for us...

733
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:00,067
and for you too now...

734
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:01,901
everything is on the line.

735
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,204
We don't feel like coming
into work one morning,

736
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:07,473
we make a series of fucked up calls...
the lights get shut

737
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:09,576
and we are on the balls of our asses.

738
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:10,710
Testify!

739
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,613
But what do we get
for taking all that risk?

740
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,750
Capital.

741
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,351
Value.

742
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:22,421
It's why you drive that gorgeous
German engineered sports car.

743
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:24,590
She is a beautiful beast.

744
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:26,959
No one wheeled one of those
into your office at the SEC,

745
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,927
no matter how good you were at that job.

746
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:32,664
You know what those click
monkeys are looking for,

747
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:36,001
so while your title
is Head of Compliance,

748
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:38,870
you are really here to
help manage that risk

749
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:41,940
by pushing what we do
right to the fucking edge.

750
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,541
So instead of fucking with us,

751
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,344
use what you learned
in your<i> distinguished</i> career

752
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,446
to help us.

753
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:50,682
And Dollar Bill?

754
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:52,217
Oh, he stepped out of line,

755
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,952
so he doesn't get to do his deal...

756
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,020
which'll hurt him more
than paying retail.

757
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,724
But no more of that him-or-me shit.

758
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:04,129
Oh, and you don't threaten
to turn us in.

759
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:06,297
<i>Ever.</i>

760
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,366
You are us now.

761
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,868
And a man who turns on his own family,

762
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,037
he turns on himself.

763
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:15,239
You're better than that,
aren't you Spyros?

764
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,709
You never told me I was family.

765
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,210
- Favorite son.
- Like a brother.

766
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,879
Then, yes.

767
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,981
I will protect the family.

768
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:27,384
But there is one thing that I need...

769
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,294
I'm listening...

770
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:48,851
_

771
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,126
I've answered everyone's questions.

772
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,994
So why don't you just
talk to your colleagues?

773
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,362
That's the last thing you want.

774
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,199
Because I know more than they do.

775
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,366
About your association with Axelrod.

776
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:21,636
About Donnie Caan. About that bacteria.

777
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,472
And if Axe knows the
government is circling

778
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,975
oh, he must be pressing as well.

779
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,155
Well, if what you say is true,

780
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,245
I should just drown
myself in that fountain.

781
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,448
I think I'm a better
choice than self-harm.

782
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,685
Testify against Axelrod:

783
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:39,787
You will escape prison...
for all your crimes.

784
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,493
I'd lose my license.

785
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,861
Probably. Yes.

786
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,631
My work has saved thousands.

787
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,333
Me being a doctor is
too important to me and,

788
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:54,368
<i>fuck it,</i> the world, for me to give it up

789
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,138
so that you people can take
one bad man off the street...

790
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,076
regardless of how rich or powerful
or depraved he may be.

791
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,358
And, of course, for the record...
I have absolutely no idea

792
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:08,482
what you're talking
about in the first place.

793
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,889
We are gonna find a compromise.

794
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:27,400
I will pay four credits,
rez the Adonis campaign,

795
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:31,271
put 12 credits and take three.

796
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,873
Nice.

797
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:34,841
I modeled for that.

798
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,843
The Adonis.

799
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,912
The Jerry West of Netrunner.

800
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:42,948
Mandatory draw.

801
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:48,387
I install, advance twice.

802
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,392
Bold.

803
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,895
Click one, I'll draw.

804
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,333
Click two. The Maker's Eye.

805
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:03,634
Ooh.

806
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:04,859
Sorry.

807
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,637
Why?

808
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,572
Luck.

809
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:12,210
I don't view luck as zero sum.

810
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,544
Good.

811
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,446
So... run on R and D.

812
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,748
Spending two credits

813
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:20,117
to break Wall of Static with Paperclip.

814
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:22,687
Spending three plus three and one.

815
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,391
Gordian Blade to break tollbooth.

816
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,666
Do you want access?

817
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:41,038
Cards on the table...

818
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:45,775
Yes.

819
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:47,110
I believe I do.

820
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,587
What do we know?

821
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,755
Problems are two-fold:

822
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,590
he had a clandestine meeting tonight.

823
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,492
- With?
- Unable to say.

824
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:05,595
We would have been burned if
we got close enough to verify.

825
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,963
And?

826
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:09,665
We're not convinced that the
good doctor can be bought.

827
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:10,833
I've bought him before.

828
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:12,401
We got into his banking history.

829
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:15,304
He actually did not personally
benefit from your donations.

830
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:16,839
- No?
- It all went to research.

831
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:19,175
He lives pretty frugally.
Has little debt.

832
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:20,910
Does not have a second home,

833
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:23,612
goes on bird watching vacations and...

834
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:26,749
Birds don't charge for a look.

835
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:28,617
Fuck.

836
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:40,359
_

837
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:47,735
Dig out a pad from, oh, six weeks ago.

838
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,179
From an old batch.

839
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:01,783
Ink will date properly.

840
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:06,287
You do the writing,
this all pre-dated me.

841
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,558
Fabricating evidence.

842
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,094
Nah, evidence is real.

843
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:17,264
We're just massaging the dates.

844
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,766
For the right reason:

845
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,835
justice.

846
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,640
Do you want to tell Chuck
to do it another way?

847
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,127
Late-night session.

848
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:53,066
How can this sustain?

849
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:58,237
You giving all of yourself
to both of us?

850
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,409
It can't.

851
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:16,622
We're not alone.

852
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:18,524
She's discreet.

853
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:21,793
Eve, shut down.

854
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:40,512
This good?

855
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:44,849
What I'd have hoped for
if I'd thought about it.

856
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:56,351
You need to know
if you can trust someone.

857
00:43:56,454 --> 00:43:58,654
You know I don't really do that.

858
00:43:58,756 --> 00:43:59,821
You trust me.

859
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:01,457
Yes.

860
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,660
Is that intellect or instinct?

861
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,530
Some fusion of the two.

862
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,633
What are they telling you now?

863
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:14,203
Robert Axelrod funds my research

864
00:44:14,305 --> 00:44:16,938
and buys a table at
our annual fundraiser.

865
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,708
And that is the extent
of our relationship.

866
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,978
He came to me. He had a toxin.

867
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,346
I advised on deployment.

868
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:27,215
It was some kind of revenge play.

869
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:29,818
I was weak.
I did everything that he asked.

870
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,657
I don't have a read.

871
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,833
I know you were initially unimpressed.

872
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,868
I'm pleased you've come around.

873
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,337
Pleased as well to make this investment.

874
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,106
Be in touch.

875
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:53,907
Yes.

876
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:28,007
How many blocks extra you
have to walk for that thing?

877
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,341
Buck saved, buck earned.

878
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:30,877
Bill, keep your clothes on.

879
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,181
Moving forward all your
most creative trades

880
00:45:35,283 --> 00:45:37,516
will flow through Victor Mateo's fund.

881
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:40,586
Okay that's... yes.

882
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:42,154
I'll bring him Mendham today...

883
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:45,157
Mendham's dead.
You tripped the alarm. Twice.

884
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:47,571
There are now<i> two</i> records
of Compliance flagging that trade.

885
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:48,827
It's busted.

886
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,229
Fuuck...

887
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:55,901
You at least gonna fire
that<i> latte con leche</i> Spyros?

888
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,869
Not under consideration.

889
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:01,907
Bill, Bill, you're gonna have
to apologize to him.

890
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,115
Publicly.

891
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,510
- I'm not...
- Has to be done.

892
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,248
W...

893
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,350
Axe, please...

894
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:12,483
<i>Has</i> to be done.

895
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:13,751
Yes.

896
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:15,386
<i>Axelrod, it's Dr. Gilbert.</i>

897
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:16,921
Doctor.

898
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,956
<i>I'd like to meet again.
I have a proposal.</i>

899
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:20,558
I'm very pleased to hear that.

900
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,560
You want us to preserve the status quo.

901
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:24,128
There are security implications.

902
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:25,996
Whose security? Not national security.

903
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,077
Not Lawrence Boyd's...
He's free and walking around.

904
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,444
Boyd's person may well be in jeopardy

905
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:31,108
if the target of the
investigation knew...

906
00:46:31,137 --> 00:46:33,771
What is that based on?
Have credible threats been made?

907
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:35,873
Perhaps Mr. Connerty,
so used to his current trial

908
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:38,256
being in the spotlight,
has forgotten that it's not always

909
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,510
best to scream "I'm coming for you"
at the target.

910
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:42,713
Well, thankfully
there's an easy way to avoid

911
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:44,381
putting the whole world on notice.

912
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,550
You can let me review
the order in camera.

913
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:54,190
Mr. Connerty's motion is granted.

914
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:00,597
You and me. Your file cabinet.

915
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,266
And it's gonna be like Geraldo
in Al Capone's vault...

916
00:47:03,368 --> 00:47:05,168
only I'm gonna be happy to find nothing.

917
00:47:14,312 --> 00:47:15,344
Happy?

918
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:18,648
Can I see what you have on the servers?

919
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,183
Nothing online.
Chuck said cases were too hot.

920
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,351
Dead-tree only.

921
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,699
You wanted me to see this.

922
00:47:38,803 --> 00:47:41,203
You lost in court, on purpose,

923
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,038
so I would see this and go away.

924
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,373
I would never lose on purpose.

925
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:46,875
Don't be a sore winner.

926
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:53,748
You might've just lost the privilege
of telling me how to be.

927
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:06,561
Do you know what this is about?

928
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:07,728
Somebody's birthday.

929
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:09,530
We're all getting a Fudgie the Whale.

930
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:11,598
I'm 99 percent sure you're lying.

931
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:13,901
But the one percent
is bursting with hope.

932
00:48:20,443 --> 00:48:21,775
All right.

933
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:24,678
In what I can only pray will
not be a regular occurrence,

934
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,349
Bill Stearn will take a page
from the Otis Redding songbook

935
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:30,083
and try a little tenderness.

936
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,390
Yeah, um...

937
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:37,891
okay.

938
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:42,595
Compliance is to be...

939
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:43,697
complied with.

940
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:51,136
Ari Spyros is a human man

941
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,673
worthy of the respect
due to any freeholder.

942
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:04,449
And I apologize for the remarks
I made to and about him.

943
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,197
Oh, my god.

944
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,737
No Fudgie?

945
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:36,079
It was in this very
room I learned the price

946
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,616
of trusting men in your line of work.

947
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:40,518
If that's a reference to Chuck Rhoades,

948
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,888
let me tell you this:
I am nothing like him.

949
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:47,024
What other non-epiphanies
do you have for me?

950
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:48,225
Hmm.

951
00:49:48,327 --> 00:49:52,963
I know the supposed investigation
into Spartan-Ives is bullshit.

952
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:56,099
A cover for whatever agreement
you guys really have.

953
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,835
I'm not after you.

954
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:01,138
I already got you.

955
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,475
But Chuck... I fear
has begun to abuse his power.

956
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:08,178
That he's become something of a tyrant.

957
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,480
And you're gonna what?

958
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:11,714
Put one in his ear

959
00:50:11,817 --> 00:50:14,818
during a performance
of<i> Our American Cousin?</i>

960
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,052
Not how I'd phrase it.

961
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:18,220
I just wonder:

962
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:20,957
Wouldn't you like to fuck Chuck up?

963
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,495
Pitch it out.

964
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:28,431
What you think happened.

965
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:31,334
How Charles Rhoades, Junior
took down Robert Axelrod

966
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:32,768
and got me out of prison.

967
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,736
A three-part mini-opera.

968
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:37,239
And you'll confirm or deny?

969
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:39,775
If you're good, you'll know by my face.

970
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:45,747
Chuck put his best friend's
money in a company.

971
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,417
His father's money. His own.
So it'd be enticing, convincing.

972
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,620
And you earned your freedom

973
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:56,091
by delivering that curly
tail grub to Axelrod,

974
00:50:56,193 --> 00:51:00,828
getting him to swallow it
hook, line, and the rest.

975
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:07,135
The Nite Owl case made you.

976
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:09,204
Do you really want
to tear that all down?

977
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:10,905
With a wrecking ball.

978
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:12,807
Wanna help me swing it?

979
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:18,178
Not even a little bit.

980
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,549
I'm leaving.

981
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:24,184
I'm going to get on my boat
and disappear.

982
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:26,487
For a long, long time.

983
00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:57,651
What the fuck?

984
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:01,120
Oh!

985
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:02,822
What the fuck?

986
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:03,925
What the fuck are you...

987
00:52:04,026 --> 00:52:06,225
What the fuck?

988
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,795
What the fuck!

989
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:11,664
Fuck you!

990
00:52:19,274 --> 00:52:21,974
God's honest truth...
I don't have the slide.

991
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,876
By now whatever remains of the glass

992
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:27,412
are ashes buried with tons
of other biomedical waste.

993
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:30,482
But we both know I don't need that slide
to be a danger to you.

994
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:32,084
I could just tell them the truth.

995
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:33,652
But I've been pushed far enough.

996
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:35,253
I want something for my troubles.

997
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:36,655
Name it.

998
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,523
Money.

999
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:39,824
For your foundation?

1000
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:42,294
For me and my family.

1001
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:45,464
Two hundred million.

1002
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:47,332
I want to live a little.

1003
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,302
Okay.

1004
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:52,237
My people will take care of it.

1005
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:01,712
Well, I finally got my read:

1006
00:53:01,814 --> 00:53:02,913
I'm fucked.

1007
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:04,515
He asked for money.

1008
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:06,417
But we know he doesn't<i> want</i> money.

1009
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:07,718
Especially for himself.

1010
00:53:09,888 --> 00:53:12,856
He's made a deal with the government
and he's stalling...

1011
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,523
<i>We are gonna find a compromise.</i>

1012
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,825
You're asking me to testify, I refuse...

1013
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,493
I don't see a position.

1014
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,828
Squint with me.

1015
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,498
If you don't want to get on the stand,

1016
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,001
then there needs to
be physical evidence.

1017
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,736
<i>Is</i> there physical evidence?

1018
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,873
An item that could speak for you.

1019
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,776
If such a thing existed,
I could make sure

1020
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,678
that it would appear where it needs to,

1021
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,747
and it would be the matador's sword.

1022
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,084
He would walk out of that
court room right into his cell

1023
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:20,889
and you, my good doctor,
would be free from all of this.

1024
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:20,486
Don't let your paranoia make
you take unnecessary risks.

1025
00:55:20,538 --> 00:55:22,571
Not unnecessary if they
keep me out of jail.

1026
00:55:22,673 --> 00:55:23,873
_

1027
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,441
They don't have the slide.

1028
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:27,576
God, you're slaying us.
He'll roll it out at trial!

1029
00:55:27,678 --> 00:55:31,213
The spotlight moves all over
Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.

1030
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:33,816
Several other witnesses
have been tampered with.

1031
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:37,052
Tell me again how we have to leave Chuck
out of this investigation.

1032
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:39,021
What is this really about for you?

1033
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:41,990
Next time you talk,
there should be lawyers present.

1034
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,612

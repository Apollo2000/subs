1
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,245
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,981
NFL thinks it would be
best for all involved

3
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,583
if you didn't bid.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,584
Stated reason?

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,086
Public perception.

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,654
I think we should start something...
a business.

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,723
Yay!

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,792
I'm already set up in
an office of my own,

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:25,993
starting to see clients.

10
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:29,997
- Is that permanent?
- I'm not sure... yet.

11
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,832
I'm keeping my options open.

12
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,301
Say hello to my nephew, Marco.

13
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,401
Kid just got elected

14
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,070
to county executive
up in Sandicot.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,272
I'm Marc. An honor to meet you, Mr.
Axelrod.

16
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,541
You will give me what I need.

17
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,344
Or maybe we'll have a
pepperoni slice in Yonkers.

18
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,313
We can invite your boss.

19
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,315
Sleeping well has
become important to me.

20
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,117
So is looking my
daughter in the eye,

21
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,285
knowing she's looking
back at a good person.

22
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,554
Congratulations. If I
fire you now, it'll look

23
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,656
like the administration
is protecting Boyd,

24
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,924
obstructing justice.

25
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,692
There's a reason no
one's done this.

26
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,394
I'll just fire you
in a few months.

27
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,695
All you've bought is time.

28
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,964
I got news last night I
never wanted to get...

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,899
Chuck Rhoades, coming at me.

30
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,236
You squared off with him,
walked away unmarked.

31
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,838
I need your playbook, I need
to know how to beat him.

32
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,706
Lawrence Boyd can be
friend to no man.

33
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,543
He needs to dominate
you in his own mind

34
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,745
by heaving his seed
into your bride.

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,781
Turn it off.

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,783
Disgrace him. Humble him.

37
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,752
Boyd's been rigging
Treasury bids.

38
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,287
I'll get you whatever I can.

39
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,055
Whatever it takes, I'm in.

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,739
* ominous music *

41
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,684
I've seeded over 125 companies.

42
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,118
I don't do it to make money.

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,055
If money comes with that, and
it always has, that's fine.

44
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,057
But it's not the driver.

45
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,093
I do it for the same reason

46
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,529
that Edison created
telephonic communication,

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,431
Oppenheimer harnessed
nuclear fission,

48
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,267
and DJ Kool Herc set up two
turntables and a microphone

49
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,769
on Sedgewick Avenue
in the Bronx...

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,674
To move at great velocity
towards a better future.

51
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,676
And this?

52
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,945
This represents the
culmination of it all.

53
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,948
Farpoint isn't just going to
bring the earth closer together.

54
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,518
It's going to bring us
closer to what's out there.

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,855
This is the first one
you sent into orbit.

56
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:35,989
Yeah.

57
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,493
We're two generations
beyond Manticore.

58
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,761
Manticore-3...

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,198
"The first ship to make a
manned mission to Mars."

60
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,700
That your impersonation of me?

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,203
Well, you've certainly
said it enough times.

62
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,708
That's how I make it happen.

63
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,313
Elena Gabriel.

64
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,149
Lead candidate for
that first mission.

65
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,751
Well, it'll take
a couple of days

66
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,453
for me to do a full
work-up on it.

67
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,221
We have a conference
room set aside.

68
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,989
I appreciate that,
but since she has

69
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,558
no prior relationship with me...

70
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,360
Build rapport however
you want, okay?

71
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,828
Just, keep in mind, we're
not giving her the keys

72
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,565
to a school bus here. This
is a $1.2 billion vessel.

73
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,267
And your legacy. I get all that.

74
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,035
You need to know that she's
psychologically bulletproof.

75
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,406
There she is. Right on time.

76
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,707
Does that mean anything?

77
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,210
Yeah, that her watch works.

78
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,679
Elena Gabriel.

79
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,315
Ah, dominant handshake.

80
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,616
Intentional?

81
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,018
You tell me.

82
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,789
Elena will show you
around the facility.

83
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,925
I know what you're doing
with the lawsuit.

84
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,527
What am I doing
with the lawsuit?

85
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,629
Look, Axe, I spent seven years

86
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,364
and more money than
I care to admit

87
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,733
fighting the S.E.C.
just to clear my name.

88
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,868
- And you did.
- Fuck, yeah, I did,

89
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,404
but in those seven years,

90
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,706
I tried to buy two
baseball teams.

91
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,575
You may notice... I don't
own a baseball team.

92
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,545
You think the S.E.C.
was the dealbreaker?

93
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,880
It fucking didn't help.
That's for damn sure.

94
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,582
Look, Axe, we're
different, right?

95
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,217
We didn't inherit our money.

96
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,586
We earned it calling
bullshit early,

97
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,788
often, and very publicly.

98
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,290
The NFL doesn't like that shit.

99
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,459
They're afraid you're
gonna break etiquette,

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,793
come in long and loud.

101
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,396
They think you're gonna be
the Mark Cuban of the NFL.

102
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,264
Oh, so I'm pre-fucked?

103
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,899
You need to make
it clear to them

104
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,568
that you're hanging
up the gloves

105
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,969
and moving on to a new phase.

106
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,038
You know what else
you need to do?

107
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,541
You need to stop fucking with the U.S.
attorney.

108
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,942
I'm not gonna do that.

109
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,510
Come on, Axe.

110
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,579
So, when are they gonna
make the decision?

111
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,747
This week.

112
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,649
You know, even if you
win this lawsuit,

113
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,216
that's the long game.

114
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,687
If you really want this team,
you got to ask yourself...

115
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,591
How are you gonna change
hearts and minds today?

116
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,694
* ominous music *

117
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,938
Well, the Japanese
would be proud.

118
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,174
You waited until
the meal was done.

119
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,144
But at this point,
hit me with it,

120
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,980
and let us both get
on with our days.

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,682
What's the status
on Spartan-Ives?

122
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,050
- Only a matter of time.
- How much time?

123
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,122
- How much time I got?
- Not a lot.

124
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,524
The AG didn't appreciate you

125
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,225
leaking news of
your investigation.

126
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,561
I didn't leak it. I
denied it when asked.

127
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,297
Okay. You've lodged official
protest of my statement.

128
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,366
Say what you came to say.

129
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,235
You're alive as long as
you're making progress.

130
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,937
But the AG thinks
that you stalled,

131
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,673
she's gonna show you the
Hans Gruber Memorial Exit.

132
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,011
Well, it's nice to hear you
take the potential demise

133
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,480
of my career so seriously.

134
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,416
Laugh or cry. You
know what I mean?

135
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,918
I sure do.

136
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,723
* tense music *

137
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,899
Get me Bensinger.

138
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,669
Very few things get the third
wealthiest man in America

139
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,970
- to leave home.

140
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,172
A handful of
economic conferences

141
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,775
and reeling in billionaires
for the Giving Oath.

142
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,176
No conferences are happening

143
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,978
in the city right now, Mr.
Bensinger.

144
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,680
Well done, young man.

145
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,616
If your publication will
grant me a 48-hour hold,

146
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,184
I'll give you a head start.

147
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,153
Of course.

148
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,556
Richard Winstead is joining us

149
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,058
and pledging 80% of his assets.

150
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,627
It's a great act
of philanthropy.

151
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,832
Excuse me.

152
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,270
Robert. A rare treat.

153
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,939
Can you find some time for
me while you're visiting?

154
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,140
The city's so noisy.

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,709
If you want to have a real talk,

156
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,478
come to the house
in Shaker Heights.

157
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,246
That's a kind offer, but I
don't want to wait that long.

158
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,615
What are you doing tonight?

159
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,784
Bridge game, grabbing a hot dog.

160
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,452
So, the usual?

161
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,554
If I know you, you're
gonna stop at a cart,

162
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,457
or, even worse,
order room service.

163
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,826
New York is, in some
respects, a fine city,

164
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,795
but not where cased
meats are concerned.

165
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,797
I got a place.

166
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,298
I think it more than stacks up

167
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,966
against what you
got in Cleveland.

168
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,536
Challenge accepted.
I'll see you tonight.

169
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,741
It doesn't matter what I do.

170
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,342
The faucet's run dry.

171
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,911
What does that mean?

172
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,713
I can't get anything
on Spartan-Ives'

173
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,481
Treasury bid-rigging
'cause there is

174
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,416
no Spartan-Ives'
Treasury bid-rigging.

175
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,152
That's bullshit. We all
know it's happening.

176
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,122
It was, till news got out that
you guys were targeting them,

177
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,557
and then they just, you know.

178
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,326
Boyd's snake crawled
back up his flap.

179
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,829
Look, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do here.

180
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,665
I can't share a
bed with my wife.

181
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,901
I can't move out, 'cause then
she'll know that I know.

182
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,237
I spend half my day at
home in the bathroom.

183
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,639
She thinks I have the shits.

184
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,440
Look, I don't think
I'm gonna be able

185
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,275
to help you get Boyd.

186
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,210
I mean, I want to, but...

187
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,549
Your boss violated the
sanctity of your marital bed,

188
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,316
and you can't man up to...

189
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,718
Bryan.

190
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,520
He's all man.

191
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,990
He's John Wayne in
Liberty Valance.

192
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,860
'Cause most fellas in his
position would run and hide,

193
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,828
but he is standing in.

194
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,164
Now, I don't know if
I'd be man enough

195
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:21,168
to watch my wife sleep next
to me, knowing what he knows.

196
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:25,372
Mr. McKinnon, a bit more time,

197
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,841
and your struggle will
have been worth it.

198
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,342
Players return to their mean.

199
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,611
And we will be waiting.

200
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,648
Get back to work.

201
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,617
Keep it together.

202
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,519
We'll find another way
to nail Lawrence Boyd,

203
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
and when we do,

204
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,722
we'll need you.

205
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,767
Setback. Not a defeat.

206
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,304
I promise.

207
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,077
I could go through
the Panama Papers,

208
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,714
look at all the assets that
offshore firm was hiding.

209
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,481
Boyd didn't have money there.

210
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,950
There's no direct link to him.

211
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,586
Maybe we'll find someone
else to flip up the chain.

212
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,256
The problem isn't the
missing link to the top.

213
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,759
The problem is the top.

214
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,861
* suspenseful music *

215
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,636
- Your friend Lawrence Boyd.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,870
You said he was ready.

217
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,038
Fuck.

218
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,940
There's a methodology I deploy

219
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,508
that gets the results
you've come to expect.

220
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,212
But he isn't letting me
take the steps I need to.

221
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,182
Do you want me to take
actions I deem necessary

222
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,416
without his approval?

223
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,052
No, keep offering help.

224
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:49,389
If he's too genteel to accept,
there's nothing we can do.

225
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,627
Whose house?

226
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,229
Whose house?

227
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,931
- Lonnie's house.

228
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,833
All right.

229
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,834
Whose house?

230
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,602
I'm not fucking saying it.

231
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,004
Aw, you're breaking my heart,

232
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,039
but whether you admit it or not,

233
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,241
it is, in fact...

234
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,010
Lonnie's house.

235
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,079
You did not just
close another one.

236
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,882
Yeah. Predator this week,
Panamanian drug lord last week,

237
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,717
but who's keeping score?

238
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,586
Uh, by the way, how's that whole
Spartan-Ives thing going?

239
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,954
Solid.

240
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,956
Great.

241
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,560
Hey, there.

242
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,179
New look?

243
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,105
Oh. The wife.

244
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,272
Understood.

245
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,809
Rhoades' motion to
dismiss was denied.

246
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,576
Boom! Body shot!

247
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,846
Deposition's confirmed
for Thursday,

248
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,381
but we should postpone.

249
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,582
Oh, yeah. I know.

250
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,785
That's what I would say
were I my own lawyer.

251
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,621
Yet we press on.

252
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,791
If he doesn't get to depose me,
I don't get to depose him.

253
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,892
It has to happen now.

254
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,494
Ah. The NFL.

255
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,496
I heard you were down
to the final three.

256
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,966
Yeah. Even for me,
this kind of chance?

257
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,634
I know. Of course.

258
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,271
Most folks, when they get their
first job on the Street,

259
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,106
cold-calling out of phone books,

260
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,710
they think the idea is,
get the mark to yes.

261
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,680
But the way I saw it... and it
bought me a 911 my first year...

262
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,250
Is never give them a
reason to say no,

263
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,319
because if you take "no"
out of their vocabulary...

264
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,221
"Yes" is the only word left.

265
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,724
And right now, Chuck
Rhoades' accusations,

266
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,227
his insinuations...
That's their no...

267
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,097
unless I can make it clear

268
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,232
he was the one who
crossed the line.

269
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,668
You have to know going in...

270
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,637
Depositions are
unpredictable beasts.

271
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,274
In depos, I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

272
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,742
Attack ships on fire?

273
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,512
Yes. The very best
cases gone forever,

274
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,181
like tears in rain.

275
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,285
No replicant... no lawyer
is gonna rattle me.

276
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,124
Mr. Axelrod, you say the U.S.
attorney harassed you,

277
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,726
that he overstepped the
bounds of his office.

278
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,962
Are you sure he didn't
have legitimate reason

279
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,630
to come to your
place of business?

280
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,899
At that hour? No.

281
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,200
His wife worked for you.

282
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,868
Could have been
coming to see her.

283
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,469
His wife had quit
working for me.

284
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,971
She'd also quit being his wife.

285
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,306
Don't be cute.

286
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,775
If you want this to help
you in the PR department,

287
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,176
keep the digs off the record.

288
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,477
What about Mick Danzig?

289
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,980
Do you deny bribing police
to wipe out his arrest?

290
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,882
Of course. I would nev...

291
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,718
Fuck.

292
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah.

293
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,755
Let's not give him a perjury
charge for nothing.

294
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,726
I know you don't get rattled,
but if you get rattled,

295
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,230
even for a second, don't answer.

296
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,365
Just ask for a break.

297
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,338
So... you want a break now?

298
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,640
Keep 'em coming.

299
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,312
That's the shaker room.

300
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,150
I don't see a lot of Amish
furniture in there.

301
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,953
That's funny. I like jokes.

302
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,822
No, it's where metallurgy
gets subjected

303
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,691
to the speed and pressure
it'll face in space.

304
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,426
It's where things tend to break.

305
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,928
Why do you want to go up there?

306
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,130
It's the undiscovered country.

307
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,367
Hmm. That's from Hamlet.

308
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,269
He was describing death.

309
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,272
It's the final frontier.

310
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,908
How about in your own words?

311
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,250
Everyone I went to school with
works on one of two things...

312
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,088
Theoretical particle physics
or the next great start-up.

313
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,822
You don't care about
those things?

314
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,125
I have too much self-respect
to be an academic,

315
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,994
so number one is out.

316
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,730
And the pure money grab, while
intoxicating in theory,

317
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,566
never seems to leave anyone
any better off than they were

318
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,270
the moment they had the big
idea in the first place...

319
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,372
because they are
still stuck here,

320
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,808
bound to this place
and its limitations

321
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:05,745
of fuel, space, and
class struggle.

322
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,748
Face it... Earth
is pretty screwed.

323
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,721
Where does that leave you?

324
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,394
I want to do something
impossible.

325
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,933
I want to point to the
sky, at another planet,

326
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,636
and say, "I used to live there."

327
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,607
I don't think I've said
that out loud before.

328
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,110
Does it sound silly?

329
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,245
No.

330
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,019
Following Axelrod's
a nonstarter.

331
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,220
Why?

332
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,855
He's got operatives, pros...

333
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:49,956
With him, on him.

334
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,058
They hang back.

335
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,526
His own staff probably
doesn't know they're there,

336
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,661
but they are.

337
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,930
I saw a guy I used to
work with at the Bureau.

338
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,798
Quality agent. Lucky
he didn't see me.

339
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,301
This would be much easier
for your son to assign...

340
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,401
No, no.

341
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,137
This has nothing to do with him.

342
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,006
He can't even know about it.

343
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,507
Understood.

344
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,376
Maybe you don't
personally do it.

345
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,944
No. They'd make anybody.

346
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,314
They're squared away.

347
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,848
Drop down a rung.

348
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,117
Follow his top people.

349
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,319
Okay.

350
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,356
And this... is for you.

351
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,425
Results on the other subject.

352
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,128
Surveillance of a federal
employee is a Class E felony,

353
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,696
so if you want me to keep it up,

354
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,931
I'm gonna need to charge
you a higher rate.

355
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,467
Then it's a good
day for business.

356
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,241
Yes?

357
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,510
Your father's driver
dropped this off for you.

358
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,046
Oh.

359
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,816
* brooding music *

360
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,996
- Thanks, man.
- For you, Bryan, anything.

361
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,165
That coffee is terrible.

362
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,799
How do you drink it?

363
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,006
I close my eyes and
think of England.

364
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,543
When you close your eyes, I
want you to think of me.

365
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,012
Coming after you.

366
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,214
Like my own personal
Anton Chigurh?

367
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,452
Oh, no. I'm not some
surrealist nightmare.

368
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm flesh and blood.

369
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,357
I feel like you've got some
bedrock misunderstandings

370
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,558
about government work.

371
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,528
The Spartan-Ives investigation
isn't going anywhere.

372
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:39,899
It's not going to
save Chuck's job.

373
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,337
Who told you that?

374
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,407
Don't throw away a
promising career

375
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,444
over a selective and
misguided sense of loyalty.

376
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,213
Your boss is going down,

377
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,383
so why not finish
Chuck off yourself

378
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,386
and earn some Justice
points with the deathblow?

379
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,571
So, we're finally
gonna have the talk?

380
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:22,242
Well, you've been reaching
out to me for five years.

381
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,678
This isn't how I like to do it.

382
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,447
You prefer the house?

383
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,548
It's more intimate.

384
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,916
For a seduction?

385
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,220
When you ask a person to
invest his money with you,

386
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,921
that's a seduction.

387
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,023
When you ask him to
pledge his net worth...

388
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,726
That's what the Mongols did
when they sacked a village.

389
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,528
I was gonna say it's a marriage.

390
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,464
Well, the Mongols
called it that, too.

391
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,633
Look, I get why you've
been putting me off.

392
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,067
Most people don't like

393
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,537
to think about giving
their money away.

394
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,905
It makes them think
they're gonna die.

395
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:57,177
But you can rest assured...
You are gonna die.

396
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,146
Yes.

397
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,348
A man tries a lot of things.

398
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,784
He fucks, he fathers,
he letters his name

399
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,720
above doorways he'd never
otherwise walk through.

400
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,289
Any of this sound familiar?

401
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,825
How's your hot dog?

402
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,128
Goddamn delicious.

403
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,896
Why do you make so much money?

404
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,831
Because I can.

405
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,099
Bullshit.

406
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,635
A lot of things you can
do that you don't...

407
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,372
Bark like a seal,
ride the subway.

408
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,341
You make money because
it feels good.

409
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,677
Well, here's the crazy thing.

410
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,879
Giving it away feels better.

411
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,618
Do you remember what it felt
like to make that first million?

412
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,455
I didn't feel that good again

413
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:46,793
until I pledged to give
away 20,000 times that.

414
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,529
It's the cure.

415
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,300
Accumulation with no end
in sight is gluttony.

416
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,967
That's the disease.

417
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,669
I thought it was a sin.

418
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,438
Fuck sin. Fuck piety.

419
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,440
I'm talking about
what you can use.

420
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,175
Gluttony hollows you out.

421
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,076
Giving goes the other way.

422
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,480
I know. It's a fucking
paradox, but I worked it out.

423
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,817
The reason that nothing levers
up your happiness like giving

424
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,720
is because it puts you back
in charge of the only thing

425
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,625
that you ever really cared about...
yourself.

426
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,893
That's why I founded
the Giving Oath.

427
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,132
And that's why I'm sitting here.

428
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,509
Aw.

429
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,611
Fuck.

430
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,984
I like the way you fight
to pass my guard,

431
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,087
but you practically dove
into that arm lock.

432
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,889
You've got to learn
the difference

433
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,059
between naive aggression
and effective aggression.

434
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,028
Yeah.

435
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,113
Yeah?

436
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,685
That's not what you were
wearing at the office.

437
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,219
No.

438
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,424
I found something.

439
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,393
I was looking through
the Panama Papers.

440
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,160
There was a link to
Boyd, after all?

441
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,597
No. He's not hiding money there.

442
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,334
Your father is.

443
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,105
That's what couldn't
wait till morning?

444
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,208
No. He stashed $12 million
in an offshore account.

445
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,843
I know.

446
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,314
You knew about this?

447
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,181
He didn't do anything illegal.

448
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,650
He didn't stash it.

449
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,453
Moving money that
way is not a crime.

450
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,322
It's just bad PR.

451
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,327
But what is it that really
bothers you, Bryan?

452
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,861
The fact that he hid the money

453
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,298
or the fact that he had that
much in the first place?

454
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,705
* suspenseful music *

455
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,940
Here it is.

456
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,675
No, not that one.

457
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,510
The Carolina sauces
are too vinegary.

458
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,379
I want something spicy.

459
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,382
I'm sick of the barbecue sauce.

460
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,984
So, Wags?

461
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,486
Hitting it hard.

462
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,988
He has a standing
appointment every morning.

463
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,157
He has his own IV
stand in his room.

464
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,526
Yeah, he's fucked right now.

465
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,261
I'll deal with it soon.

466
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,598
He showed me this.

467
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,034
Says it came to his work e-mail.

468
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,571
It's Dan Wolfe's company.

469
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,839
Private equity guy who
invests in healthcare.

470
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,141
They've got real
money behind them.

471
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,411
Well, they're hitting on
our customer base now

472
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,012
and undercutting us.

473
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:57,283
So I was thinking we change
our focus to smaller firms,

474
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,185
maybe out in New Jersey.

475
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,653
Yeah, let's let him bigfoot us

476
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,423
into becoming, like, a lovely
little boutique, you know?

477
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,057
We can open a bed-and-breakfast

478
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,127
and serve intravenous maple
syrup to our guests.

479
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,562
You want to fight?

480
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,231
This is our fucking
corner, Stringer.

481
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,938
Yellowbird.

482
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,476
You are going to
obtain and execute

483
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,778
a search warrant
for Spartan-Ives.

484
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,380
What's the basis
for the warrant?

485
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,648
Quote stuffing.

486
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,650
I brought you that a year ago.

487
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,085
You called me a piker for
wanting to go after it.

488
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,887
Yeah, you said
high-frequency trading

489
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,056
confuses juries more
than advanced calculus.

490
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,591
It is advanced calculus.

491
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,561
This is the first
wave at Normandy.

492
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,596
You know what happened
on the first wave.

493
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,698
- Got cut down.
- Right.

494
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,135
Ensuring that the second
wave had a fighting chance.

495
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,170
Judge Wailand is expecting you,

496
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,274
so go make like a piker...

497
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,909
Today.

498
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,579
Hey.

499
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,947
Hey.

500
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,381
Miss me that much?

501
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,783
Hm, yeah.

502
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,152
And I wanted to talk to a
few of your employees,

503
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,454
who are also my clients.

504
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,855
Sure. Why?

505
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,624
Just to gauge their experience
and overall satisfaction.

506
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,528
So, you didn't want
to see if they or you

507
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,865
are being specifically targeted
by Dan Wolfe's Mercy Squad?

508
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,567
I am, right?

509
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,103
- Fuck.
- It's okay.

510
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,038
I'll call Wolfe, ask
for some courtesy,

511
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,138
have him back off.

512
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,776
You will not. I'll handle it.

513
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,110
How?

514
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,412
I'm a businesswoman.
I'll handle it.

515
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,019
You signed up for
the Giving Oath?

516
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,088
You've gone soft. How
much are you giving?

517
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:45,592
Nobody needs to know what
he does or doesn't do.

518
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,694
The giving is later.
The headlines are now.

519
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,896
You planted it... so
you'd look like the type

520
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,999
of charity-minded champion that
gets to steward a sacred trust,

521
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,366
like a sports franchise.

522
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,570
Didn't want to just sit back
and leave it to the gods.

523
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,941
* tense music *

524
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,442
It worked. I mean, you got me.

525
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,677
Yeah.

526
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,113
But you've also
been hitting the IV

527
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,215
- a little hard lately.

528
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,651
I barely touch the stuff.

529
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,321
Every day.

530
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,725
* suspenseful music *

531
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,098
Do you believe Chuck
really has this?

532
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,534
That, or he's losing it.

533
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,602
Either way is good for you.

534
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,871
So smile. Enjoy it.

535
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,809
You're really okay with
leaving Earth behind?

536
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,846
Leaving your family behind,
potentially forever?

537
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,849
I'm an only child.

538
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,383
Was that lonely or...

539
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,054
It was ideal, in the
truest sense of that word.

540
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,556
Because I could deploy language

541
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,357
from an early
developmental stage,

542
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,392
we all got really
used to talking.

543
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,695
Oh. That must have been nice.

544
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,363
We communicated in
my family, too,

545
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,732
but there were more of us,
and most of the time,

546
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,001
it wasn't conversation
with a capital C.

547
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,370
It's hard to find people
you could just...

548
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,472
Do you...

549
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,141
This may sound like a weird
non-answer-question thing,

550
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,376
but do you like Wilco?

551
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,711
Yeah.

552
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,381
Yes, I love the one with
"Jesus, don't cry."

553
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,250
Yeah, me too, because
in that one,

554
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,686
Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett

555
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,655
had found in each other
a perfect mind meld.

556
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,057
They communicated on a
level few ever reach.

557
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,460
But the thing about Wilco
in that moment is,

558
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,329
it was never that good again.

559
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,497
Bennett left the group.

560
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,132
Somehow, even though each had

561
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,234
to know the other
made him better,

562
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,837
they just couldn't find a
way to keep going together.

563
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,538
Did the band break up?

564
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,241
No. Even without Bennett,
Wilco was Wilco.

565
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,409
It kept trucking along.

566
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,944
And Bennett?

567
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,648
He died, just a
couple years later.

568
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,949
He OD'd.

569
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,386
Somehow, on his own, he
couldn't keep it together.

570
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,489
Makes you wonder how you
can find a true partner

571
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,291
and keep them.

572
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,996
Who is that person for you?

573
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,269
You've never found them.

574
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,642
You've never looked.

575
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,277
If things got messy,

576
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,446
I wasn't sure I could
keep trucking.

577
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,749
You didn't want a
relationship holding you back

578
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,450
from doing what you love most.

579
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,054
Yeah, that's...

580
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,389
Yeah.

581
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,792
Thank you for talking to me.

582
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,226
That's it?

583
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,495
That's it.

584
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,967
My dad taught me.

585
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,003
He knew I'd always be
competing against men.

586
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,505
Wanted me to have some
measure of control.

587
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,876
You're gonna do great things.

588
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:58,985
Whatever you heard in that
meeting made you squeamish.

589
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,153
You know what Rhoades is, Bryan.

590
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,290
You know he should
be out of a job.

591
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,360
And I know you made that call.

592
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,141
You rang, boss?

593
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:42,729
I need you to reach out to
Boyd and set up a meeting.

594
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,897
Just the two of you?

595
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,098
Mm-hmm.

596
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,570
This is what the warrant
was setting up.

597
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,039
Second wave.

598
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,909
Where's the meeting?

599
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,078
Not in our offices.
We're not there yet.

600
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,415
No. No, he picks the spot.

601
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,718
I come to him.

602
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,486
I even ask him for something.

603
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,656
Trying to hoist
him on his own...

604
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:13,926
No. It doesn't matter
what I ask for.

605
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,799
You know, the best way
to bond with someone

606
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,367
isn't doing a favor.

607
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,135
It's asking for one.

608
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,670
That's the Franklin Effect.

609
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:26,973
You make the other
person feel valued,

610
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,741
like you've given them power...

611
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,276
so you won't hurt them.

612
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,379
Now, that's how I
need Boyd to feel.

613
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,317
* suspenseful music *

614
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,556
Now, isn't this a literary club?

615
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,858
I've written a book...

616
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,459
"Steady at the Helm."

617
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,727
Sure.

618
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,797
I tore through it
in one sitting.

619
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,865
The club motto actually
comes from a poem.

620
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,100
Mm.

621
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,069
"In the afternoon, they
came unto a land..."

622
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,638
Where they assumed
a supine position

623
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,141
and sucked each other's dicks.

624
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,410
That's Tennyson, right?

625
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,146
More or less.

626
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,580
What's the topic, Chuck?

627
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:14,286
The state of war we're in

628
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,988
and what you can do to end it.

629
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,190
I don't write polite letters.

630
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,326
I don't like to plea-bargain.

631
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,627
I like to fight.

632
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,563
You sure you want to take
life advice from Roy Cohn?

633
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,667
He got things done, and
he was a generous man.

634
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,804
Mentored Trump, mentored me.

635
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,073
What have you grown
in your shade?

636
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:38,344
I have all the king's
men arrayed behind me.

637
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,747
And yet a tentative hold
on your commission.

638
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:45,484
Yes, the AG is not
very happy with me,

639
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,620
yet she seems to like
you for some reason.

640
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,058
Maybe because I don't
turn a man's house

641
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,625
upside down for nothing

642
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,761
just so other people
will look at me.

643
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,401
You're right.

644
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,906
I don't have much
on Spartan-Ives.

645
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,540
I'm here to ask a favor.

646
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:18,885
You have a strong
compliance department.

647
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:24,156
I was hoping that you might put
on an internal investigation.

648
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,359
Make it look like you're
responding to my pressure.

649
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,395
Why would I do that?

650
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,164
Because, after a year or so,

651
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,001
when your investigation is over,

652
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,702
my office signs off on it.

653
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,972
I declare I've cleaned
up Wall Street,

654
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:43,675
and you crow about how you've
swept the rogue elements

655
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,278
out of your own shop.

656
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,680
It's a win all around.

657
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,983
Not if I have to wait a year.

658
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,153
I want to get out from
under this immediately.

659
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,787
I am not taking this with me

660
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,390
on the boat off
Antibes this summer.

661
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,595
Then what can you give me now?

662
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,499
How about this?

663
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,601
There are a few mid-level guys

664
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,704
my compliance
department has flagged.

665
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,273
What if I sacrifice them?

666
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,978
Well, that might give me the
cloak I need to move on.

667
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,950
Yeah. And you would get
to fire them for cause

668
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,584
and save three
months' severance.

669
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:26,885
Six.

670
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:30,056
You are munificent.

671
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,692
And thank you.

672
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,827
Have your guy call mine.

673
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,564
They can coordinate
press releases.

674
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,314
All right, 90-second cool down.

675
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,418
Go.

676
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,320
Rachman pulled his
bid for the team.

677
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,956
Couldn't afford it or knew
it was going another way?

678
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,492
Someone let the league know
about his FCPA issues,

679
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,261
and with you and Bensinger
splashed all over the papers,

680
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,463
he didn't want to drown
in your rising tide.

681
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,066
There's only one other bidder
left, and it's a group.

682
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,401
He can't afford it solo.

683
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,836
* Are you ready for
some football? *

684
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,371
Yes, I am.

685
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,107
Let's finish this.

686
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,975
Will you draft the
Giving Oath letter?

687
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,277
- What do you want in there?
- The usual stuff...

688
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,179
- Good for people, communities.
- Got it.

689
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,182
And when it's done, you give it
to Bill to read to the world.

690
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,183
Gates or Clinton?

691
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,551
Either.

692
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,021
Both.

693
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:40,792
You always were a
fucking pisser, Lara.

694
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,029
Little Lara fucking Benjamin.

695
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,430
She's not Benjamin anymore.

696
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,998
She's aristocratic now.

697
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,867
No. What I'm not is little.

698
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,669
I'm all grown up.

699
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,005
You serious about this?

700
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,606
Can you hook it up?

701
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,942
Sure. I know just
the right girl.

702
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,445
I think she graduated, she's
certified, everything.

703
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,147
I don't think she
passed the test.

704
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:04,050
Either way, she's
the right girl.

705
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,217
Mercy Squad?

706
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,154
Yeah, that's what it's called,

707
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:11,357
but I need it to stay
all the way quiet.

708
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,660
* And let the truth be told *

709
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,295
Hey, no, no, no, no.

710
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:17,496
You're family.

711
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,098
To pay the girl.

712
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,369
Okay.

713
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,005
Anything for Dean's
little sister.

714
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,441
To Dean.

715
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,910
* Whoo-hoo *

716
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,546
* Hey, hey, I got to
pick myself up... *

717
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,187
Rhoades reached out to me.

718
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,556
Did you cut off his hand?

719
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,395
You did the other thing.

720
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:52,030
You would have cut
off his hand, right?

721
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:55,534
That's me.

722
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,971
I have another source I can
check to be sure it's legit.

723
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,007
I'll be careful.

724
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,275
You better be.

725
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:08,747
Your advice was appreciated,
and it wasn't wrong,

726
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,649
but ask a barber if
you need a haircut,

727
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,384
he's always gonna say yes.

728
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,953
I asked a warrior.

729
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,389
But not everyone out
there's a savage.

730
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,459
Rhoades opened his eyes
to the bigger picture.

731
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,072
Are we playing it too safe?

732
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,841
These are just the
initial questions

733
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,376
I'm gonna be asking Axe.

734
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,045
I'm giving him a little Rumble
in the Jungle at first.

735
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:41,313
Bomaye.

736
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,081
Yeah. I'm gonna do all that,

737
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,451
you understand, at
the deposition.

738
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,587
But I got to say it again...
You shouldn't come.

739
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,922
It should be cold, clinical.

740
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,658
You're worried I'll
say something.

741
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,660
Yes, I am.

742
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,094
Anything unscripted from you

743
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,896
could put you in an
even deeper hole.

744
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,265
I won't say a word.

745
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,400
Well, then, why come?

746
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,802
Trust me, it'll have value.

747
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,838
My mere presence will
make Axelrod stumble.

748
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,740
It's too risky.

749
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,042
I don't want the whole
thing becoming a circus.

750
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,179
Just let me bore him
into fucking up.

751
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,381
Come!

752
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:18,049
I'm sorry. I thought
you were alone.

753
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,452
That's okay. I could
use a cup of coffee.

754
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,628
What's on your mind?

755
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,702
My father.

756
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,637
What happened?

757
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,039
He isn't who I thought.

758
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,610
Well, every child in the
history of the world

759
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,710
has learned that.

760
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:46,777
I'm not naive.

761
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,480
No, never thought you were.

762
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,250
But when he gave me advice,

763
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,820
I looked at it through
a certain prism...

764
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,423
knowing that he had integrity.

765
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,959
Now I...

766
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,896
I find out he has a
pile of money offshore.

767
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,534
Legal tax avoidance,

768
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:12,003
but he has always
sold himself to me

769
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,139
as somebody who doesn't avoid.

770
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,007
Mm.

771
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,912
Don't be so hard
on your old man.

772
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,353
Reach out to him.

773
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,988
Don't keep the
disappointment inside.

774
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,258
Let him know what's going on.

775
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:42,834
So, you got a few sacrificial
Spartan-Ives shitheads

776
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,437
that nobody had
heard of yesterday

777
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,307
and nobody will
remember tomorrow.

778
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,609
You sure that's enough
to save your job?

779
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,513
But be careful, 'cause
that kind of directness

780
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,282
is a change of pace.

781
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,817
I did the best I could.

782
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,519
That's what there was to get.

783
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,521
It can't be where you live.

784
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:05,524
You'll need to keep
going after Boyd.

785
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:09,795
No. You can't get
blood from a C.E.O.

786
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,664
If I'm out of a job,
then I can finally earn

787
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:17,035
some of that money everyone's
always talking about.

788
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,337
Okay, sonny.

789
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,174
I'm sure you know
what you're doing.

790
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,012
Mmm.

791
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:34,586
You have to protect the
parent-child relationship.

792
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:40,125
Anyone else in the world
will fuck you over...

793
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,561
Friends, lovers...

794
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,795
bosses.

795
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,170
No, your father
is the one person

796
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,274
you're gonna be able to
count on when it matters.

797
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,682
Soft 6?

798
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,818
No. You can swing free.

799
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:15,260
You can swing free,
and not just here.

800
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,162
Chuck meant what he said.

801
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,333
The investigation's over?

802
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,805
And you'll put in a word
for him with the AG?

803
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,876
He's showing a real
awareness of the landscape.

804
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,110
You must be proud.

805
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,646
I've always been proud.

806
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,715
Now I'm happy for him.

807
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,459
Elena's brilliant...

808
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,461
ideal for research...

809
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,931
but not a fit for the program.

810
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,134
Why?

811
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:03,409
She's a leaver, a ghost.

812
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,076
She's never faced
real adversity,

813
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,312
never had to deal with
terrible consequences.

814
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,582
When something goes wrong in
space, as it always does,

815
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,551
she's gonna crack.

816
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:16,555
So, your judgment is what?

817
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,356
She needs a trip to
the shaker room.

818
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,725
Who among us doesn't?

819
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,427
Reject her.

820
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,629
If she comes crawling
back, reject her again.

821
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,432
If six months later, she
makes another attempt,

822
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,933
stress test her once more.

823
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,769
I can't wait to run my
next candidate by you

824
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,105
so we can do this
all over again.

825
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,708
I'm not sure I'm
gonna be available.

826
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,312
I've realized I like
working with people,

827
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,081
not just judging them.

828
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:46,585
That's not all it is.

829
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,559
Look...

830
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:57,663
we all have to chase
our truest calling.

831
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:04,770
Mine is to make this
universe traversable

832
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,238
and to leave this company
a living organism

833
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:12,077
that can thrive long after
I've gone off on Manticore-IX.

834
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:18,517
To do that, I need stewards.

835
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:22,454
That's not what you're
looking for me to do.

836
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,591
You're asking me to sort people
into one box or another,

837
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,093
like a second-rate
Freud, which...

838
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,394
Which is Freud.

839
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:33,665
Anyone with a DSM-V and a
label maker can do that.

840
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,801
I don't want distance.

841
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,236
I like getting messy.

842
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,108
The power of the instant...
That's what excites me.

843
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,343
Ice into steam... or back.

844
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,581
Is this a test? To see
if I come crawling back?

845
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,083
No.

846
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,620
I don't test people that way.

847
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,467
But...

848
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,002
if you ever decide

849
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,271
to grapple with why you
feel happiness for you

850
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,974
can only exist light-years away

851
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:20,311
or in the company of
hairless 21-year-old girls,

852
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,815
come see me.

853
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,017
We can fix that quick.

854
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,060
Holy shit.

855
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,994
No.

856
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,495
What's up?

857
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,532
Dan Wolfe just got popped
for aggravated pimping.

858
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,768
Mercy Squad nurses
were turning tricks.

859
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,804
One of them solicited sex
from a PM at Vista Verde.

860
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,180
Hey, babe.

861
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,082
How'd you do it?

862
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,519
I told you... I'm
a businesswoman.

863
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,856
That you are.

864
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,859
Love you. Bye.

865
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,061
You should really put
a bocce court in.

866
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,230
This floor is so level,
it's a waste not to.

867
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,499
I'm kicking myself I
didn't think of that.

868
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,967
Thanks for taking the meeting.

869
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,502
Anything for Bruno.

870
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:21,006
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:22,540
Thank you, Bruno.

872
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,975
Sure.

873
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,577
Do your best.

874
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,113
- Yeah.
- Right.

875
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,416
This is incredible.
What do you put in it?

876
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,585
Dough, sauce, cheese.

877
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:36,187
That's insane. What's, like,
your secret ingredient?

878
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,956
Well, I start with the dough

879
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,759
and a little sauce
and then cheese.

880
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,427
Huh. Awesome.

881
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,329
Keep it up.

882
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,566
He called you Marco out there.

883
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,268
I go by Marc outside the family.

884
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,970
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

885
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,271
I shortened it.

886
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,340
Yeah, no, I get that.

887
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,108
Me, I'm proud of
where I come from.

888
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,244
Oh, I'm intensely
proud of my people.

889
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:01,112
- That's why I'm here.
- Mm-hmm.

890
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,115
Are we waiting for someone?

891
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:05,550
No.

892
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,518
Sit.

893
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:12,991
So... tell me.

894
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,560
Aside from your pride,

895
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:18,797
why would I ever put
any of my money

896
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,565
in your corner of the state?

897
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,935
Sandicot's downtown is
ripe for redevelopment.

898
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,336
Buildings waiting to be razed

899
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,405
and replaced with
LEED-certified condos

900
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,307
and a city council
on which I sit...

901
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,308
Mm-hmm.

902
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,977
Which is highly motivated to...

903
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,612
Okay. What you've
just described...

904
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,182
And no offense, since I
know it's your home...

905
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,385
But what you've just
described is a shithole.

906
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,587
The whole county's on
the edge of default.

907
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:46,257
It's not called a distressed
debt because we're thriving.

908
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,761
You get to buy it cheap...
Pennies on the dollar.

909
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,330
Yeah, more like millions
on hundreds of millions.

910
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,265
Well, think of that upside.

911
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:58,704
Look, I get offers
like this every day.

912
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,872
The only reason you got
through this door...

913
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,141
I know. And I don't expect
you to do this deal

914
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,575
as a favor to my uncle.

915
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:07,345
I expect you to do it
because of the casino.

916
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,647
You buried the lede, kid.
Come on.

917
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,683
Okay. Tell me about the casino.

918
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:14,485
It's gonna be paradise.

919
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,554
Monte Carlo.

920
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,857
You never been to Monte
Carlo, have you?

921
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,361
It's the Sandicot
of the Riviera.

922
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,336
Tell me.

923
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,973
Okay, I don't care if
you spit or swallow.

924
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,742
Just don't keep me waiting.

925
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,509
The faucet's back on.

926
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,845
It worked?

927
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,012
Overnight.

928
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,315
So, what do you
want me to do now?

929
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,417
Am I going to have
to wear a wire?

930
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,586
You're gonna be a hero.

931
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,021
Talk soon.

932
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:57,929
Spartan-Ives is back to
rigging Treasury auctions.

933
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,430
We've got a beachhead.

934
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,902
Sometimes you just got to trust
people to be who they are.

935
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,039
Every time I think
maybe I'm caught up...

936
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:11,009
Mm. Long time in this racket.

937
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,711
Still impressive.

938
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:15,346
Thank you.

939
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,415
Come on. Let's hit
the Gorilla truck.

940
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,818
No, I'm not gonna watch
you eat a number five.

941
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,087
Onions and... Unh-unh.

942
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,922
Stay here and have
some hand salad.

943
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,623
Please.

944
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,325
Do me this favor.

945
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:33,531
Do you think they really have
the inside track with Albany

946
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,733
- on a gaming license?
- I don't want to guess.

947
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,735
I want you to know
so that I know.

948
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,470
Okay.

949
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,072
And if it checks out,

950
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,674
you know, that's the kind
of giving I can get behind.

951
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,944
I mean, this is how all
charities should work.

952
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,479
You mean benefiting you
more than anybody else?

953
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,151
As much as. Not more.

954
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,058
People noticing you
have a new favorite.

955
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,559
They're not happy about it.

956
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,462
Anybody who makes me
money is my favorite.

957
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:08,333
Uh, look, Axe, I know I'm late.

958
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,902
Take a seat. You missed
the Sandicot meeting.

959
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,271
- I'm sorry.
- Went fine without you.

960
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,008
Take a fucking seat.

961
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,377
I can't.

962
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,348
Why are wearing sweatpants?

963
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,517
Could you...

964
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,120
Steph, step out, please.

965
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,263
I woke up in a hotel
this morning.

966
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:40,331
You're living in the
fucking Pierre.

967
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,701
This was the Americana Suites,

968
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,771
some shit dive next
to Port Authority,

969
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,473
with my ass on fire.

970
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,376
And...

971
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,778
I saw I had a tattoo.

972
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,447
On your ass?

973
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,884
Yeah.

974
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:02,353
You got an ass tattoo?

975
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:07,392
All evidence points to
that being the case.

976
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,629
I need to see it.

977
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:12,563
You want to...

978
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,965
No, don't want to.

979
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:16,367
No. I need to.

980
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:28,779
What the fuck is that?

981
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,048
Is that Yosemite...

982
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,884
I think so.

983
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,920
I was a fan.

984
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,557
I'm sending you somewhere.

985
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,660
Please, not rehab.

986
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,064
No, not rehab.

987
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:49,167
Well, you know what Dr. Sarno
says about that kind of pain.

988
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:54,505
Excuse me.

989
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:00,511
Yes?

990
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,751
I'll buzz you in.

991
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,755
I am so sorry. I
need one second.

992
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,463
Want to hear a funny story?

993
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,830
Not really.

994
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:21,332
I need help.

995
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,970
Did he send you?

996
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,871
Yeah.

997
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,207
But it's not for him. I
really do need help.

998
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:31,409
You've always needed help.

999
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,211
What's different now?

1000
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:51,729
I don't even remember
how I got it.

1001
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,103
Okay.

1002
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,172
Mnh-mnh. Not today.

1003
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,075
I'm no longer available
to you on standby.

1004
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:07,845
So you want me to call and
schedule an appointment?

1005
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,381
Yes.

1006
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,183
Like a fucking grown-up.

1007
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,187
I can do that.

1008
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,198
I knew you'd reach out.

1009
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,001
Cooperating was always
the smart move.

1010
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,873
You think I tipped you?
Prove it.

1011
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:42,080
You think I had a moment
of moral confusion,

1012
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,182
forgetting why I do
what I do and who for?

1013
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,317
Prove it.

1014
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,453
You think Chuck screwed up?

1015
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,188
Earn your 150k...

1016
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,822
You're making a mistake.

1017
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,524
And prove it.

1018
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:57,395
Chuck Rhoades has proven shit
no one should be able to.

1019
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,264
And if he were going
after this case,

1020
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,866
he would have the target
nailed, dead to rights.

1021
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,568
But Chuck is lucky

1022
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,804
because he's not being
chased by himself.

1023
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:08,306
He's being chased by you.

1024
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:12,710
Nearer, My God, to Thee.

1025
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,845
Back the fuck off.

1026
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,249
That was the last song the
band played on the Titanic,

1027
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,552
and it is a dreary tune.

1028
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,954
I offered you a lifeboat.

1029
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:27,092
You picked up a violin.

1030
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,026
Happy fiddling, Bryan.

1031
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:44,775
* What do you mean, I
don't believe in God? *

1032
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,413
* I talk to him every day *

1033
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:51,582
* What do you mean, I don't
support your system? *

1034
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,252
* I go to court when I have to *

1035
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,589
* What do you mean, I can't
get to work on time? *

1036
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:02,026
* I got nothing better to do *

1037
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:05,296
* And what do you mean,
I don't pay my bills? *

1038
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,832
* Why do you think I'm broke? *

1039
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,268
* Huh? *

1040
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:13,904
* If there's a new way *

1041
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,141
- * I'll be the first in line *
- Oh!

1042
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,708
You flinched.

1043
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,945
* But it better work this time *

1044
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,458
Mr. Axelrod, good day.

1045
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:39,130
I'm Ira Schirmer, attorney
for Charles Rhoades Jr.

1046
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:44,101
I'll be asking you
a few questions.

1047
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,771
Orrin Bach for Robert Axelrod.

1048
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:47,905
Are you ready?

1049
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,640
Rock and roll.

1050
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,942
Let's go on the record.

1051
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,046
You assert that Mr.
Rhoades harassed you...

1052
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,815
I'm sorry. Can we
go off the record?

1053
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:04,121
I just wanted to say, you
did a great job rebuilding.

1054
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,592
Sometimes I laugh myself
to sleep at night

1055
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,960
just thinking about you
ripping the place apart.

1056
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,429
- Hey, Chuck.
- Oh.

1057
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,431
You know, I never
think about it.

1058
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:16,000
But then, of course, I'm
not alone at night.

1059
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,668
Let's go back on the record.

1060
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,140
You assert that Mr.
Rhoades harassed you.

1061
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:24,275
Off the record.

1062
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,712
Where are you sleeping now?

1063
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,247
Bobby.

1064
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,416
Suitable accommodations.

1065
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,318
Mm-hmm. Who paid for it...
me or Daddy?

1066
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:35,520
We all know Uncle
Sam pays you shit.

1067
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,422
It was me.

1068
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,390
Found some loose change
in the cushions.

1069
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,292
Is this going to happen or...

1070
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:42,627
Back on the record.

1071
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,232
You assert that Mr.
Rhoades harassed you.

1072
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,700
How do you know he didn't
have a legitimate reason

1073
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,801
to be in your office?

1074
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,603
Well, it was the
middle of the night.

1075
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,206
He didn't come with a SWAT
team, not even a subpoena.

1076
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,808
It was just him, trying
to intimidate me.

1077
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,310
But his wife works for you.

1078
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,145
He could have been
coming to see her.

1079
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:04,114
His wife had quit
working for me.

1080
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,556
So, are you saying you did or
didn't intercede with the police

1081
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:14,592
and bribe them regarding
your employee, Mick Danzig?

1082
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,993
- I...
- Objection.

1083
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,162
This is a deposition.
Objections are waived.

1084
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:19,564
Except to form.

1085
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,666
That was a compound question.

1086
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:22,667
I can answer.

1087
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,669
A smart man listens
to his lawyer.

1088
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,405
I'll rephrase.

1089
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:31,242
Did you bribe the police
regarding Mick Danzig?

1090
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:37,014
Look, this whole thing
is about what he did.

1091
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:38,283
That question isn't.

1092
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,917
So you're declining to answer?

1093
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,185
Yes.

1094
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:43,220
An element of your
claim is damages.

1095
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,756
Are you willing to
open up your books

1096
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,725
to show the concrete
monetary damages

1097
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,260
you've supposedly incurred?

1098
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,262
Yes, I have damages.

1099
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:54,532
No, I am not willing to
show my books at this time.

1100
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:58,336
Ah, so then you must not be
asserting actual damages?

1101
00:53:58,436 --> 00:53:59,870
You're saying that your damages

1102
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,640
can be presumed from Mr.
Rhoades' actions?

1103
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,275
Right.

1104
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:05,776
Right.

1105
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,615
Legally, we call these
mental or emotional damages.

1106
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,283
So...

1107
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,218
are you saying Chuck
hurt you mentally,

1108
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,521
or are you saying he
hurt you emotionally?

1109
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,169
I'd like to take a break.

1110
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,672
Oh, you don't want to
announce to the whole Street

1111
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,341
that Chuck hurt your feelings?

1112
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,643
He got into your head,
threw you off your game?

1113
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,446
Turn the camera off.
We're taking a break.

1114
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,324
What?

1115
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,827
Sanford Bensinger
is on the phone.

1116
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,602
Sandy.

1117
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,538
We call it the Giving Oath
because you fucking swear it.

1118
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,206
Do you understand
what an oath is?

1119
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,308
I do.

1120
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:15,746
I do, and I've already begun
moving on what we discussed,

1121
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,616
and actually, I was
gonna reach out to you

1122
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,718
to talk about
structuring a trust.

1123
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,653
You mean a photo op?

1124
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,121
Maybe in costume.

1125
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,723
Me as John the Baptist,

1126
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,291
you as the Son of Man.

1127
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:29,727
Hey, look, Sandy, I'm as...

1128
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,596
I'm as upset as you are

1129
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,831
that our meeting got
tipped off to...

1130
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,234
Do me the courtesy of not lying
again on this phone call.

1131
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,438
I do not appreciate being used.

1132
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:43,574
I got to be where I am
by connecting the dots,

1133
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,077
scores of randomly placed ones.

1134
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,516
The NFL is turning you down.

1135
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:54,218
I asked for the favor
of telling you myself.

1136
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,160
They're, um...

1137
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,499
They're really gonna walk
away from the highest bid?

1138
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:12,603
Sports franchises are how we
knight people in this country.

1139
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,505
And you're not royalty.

1140
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,074
You're a robber baron.

1141
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,903
* suspenseful music *

1142
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,832
We're talking about damages.

1143
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:22,106
I have actual, concrete,
monetary ones.

1144
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,311
You cost me a professional
football team.

1145
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,116
Can we go back on the record?

1146
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:36,186
Actually, I think we
need a break now.

1147
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,088
No. Let's continue.

1148
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,257
A wise man always
listens to his lawyer.

1149
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:43,093
I keep my own counsel.
Let's keep going.

1150
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,029
Fucking right, we will.

1151
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,400
Fire away.

1152
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,439
* If there's a new way *

1153
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,009
* I'll be the first in line *

1154
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,478
* But it better work this time *

1155
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:11,188
* What do you mean, I
hurt your feelings? *

1156
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:14,725
* I didn't know you
had any feelings *

1157
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,828
* What do you mean,
I ain't kind? *

1158
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,930
* I'm just not your kind *

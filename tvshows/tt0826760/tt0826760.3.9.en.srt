1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:06,499
The police are searching for Robert
Zeuthen's 9 year old daughter Emilie...

2
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,638
If the perpetrator is seeking justice
for Louise Hjelby, we need to hurry.

3
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,763
There were 13 black
cars in that booklet.

4
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:19,680
That precise page was torn from the book.
You're hiding something.

5
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,597
Let me know if you
find anything out.

6
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:26,194
I've removed that report from the file.
It was your personal car that the boy saw.

7
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,117
-Who was driving it?
-Your son.

8
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:32,324
If your son has committed a murder,
there will be evidence and we'll find it.

9
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:37,320
-What did Benjamin do?
-That doesn't matter. He's innocent.

10
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:41,034
-What had he seen?
-He said he had seen Karen.

11
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:44,083
We have a witness. A Swedish sailor.

12
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,682
-Which ship was she on?
-First, let's sort out the formalities.

13
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:50,801
-Can we stay with you?
-Yes.

14
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:54,924
-He knew about the blue rainwear.
-How could he know that?

15
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:58,202
The perpetrator won't give up.
And neither will you.

16
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:02,684
A seven year old boy wrote
down the plate numbers.

17
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:09,318
The first letter was in mirror
writing.The car belongs to Niels
Reinhardt, Zeuthen's personal assistant.

18
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,998
Stay here.

19
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:17,004
The Killing lll

20
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:22,525
Wednesday, November 16 5:45pm
In ten minutes, we have a dinner
with the agricultural sector and...

21
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:28,078
If they have almost found the
perpetrator, I'm not going to go
talk about manure. What do you know?

22
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:33,478
The perpetrator went to Zeeland and
posed as a witness who had seen Emilie.

23
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:37,797
They discovered his identity too late.
They are now searching the building.

24
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:43,961
-Why did he go to Zeeland?
-They don't know. He demanded money.

25
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:50,997
Ask Justice for more information. The
child's fate will determine the election.

26
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,402
-That's Kristoffer again.
-Don't answer it.

27
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,762
I want to to see a prognosis
on undecided voters.

28
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:03,282
What were you talking about before?
What did you find out about your son?

29
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:07,961
-Benjamin may have seen something.
-What had he seen seen?

30
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:16,164
That doesn't matter. Call Mogens,
I want to know what's happening at Zeeland.

31
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,635
He has information
about the staff search.

32
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,434
He's looking for a specific person.
We don't know who.

33
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,835
- Not Zeuthen?
- No.

34
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:29,998
- Nobody saw him go out?
- The building is closed.

35
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:35,000
Find out who he was looking
for so we can protect them.

36
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,953
- I'm at Zeeland. Come here.
- I'm at Reinhardt's.

37
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,074
The lights went out when we were talking.
Send over a squad car.

38
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,476
Get here, we think
the perp is here.

39
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,335
Why?
-I see you.

40
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:52,836
Borch found out that one of
the cars listed in the book...

41
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,109
The last time I listened to you I looked
like an idiot in front of the PM. So, no.

42
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:06,537
I closed all the windows I could,
but you need to come with me...

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

44
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,261
Have you checked the basement?
Yeah, we have.

45
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,186
He was looking for information
about someone specific.

46
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,500
The important thing now
is that you catch him.

47
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:09,893
He looked at Zeeland's
fleet of cars. ZE 23 57 4.

48
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:14,134
It corresponds to a plate in the booklet,
except the Z is an S.

49
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:21,139
- Who has the initials NJR?
- My assistant. Niels Juhl Reinhardt.

50
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:26,254
- Why would he search for Reinhardt?
- No idea. He went to the airport.

51
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,685
Two cafeteria ladies saw him.

52
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,201
He left the building about a half
hour ago through the kitchen exit.

53
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:50,338
I don't understand.
What do you want from me?

54
00:04:55,505 --> 00:05:00,499
You saw her at the school.
You followed her to the main road.

55
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:07,621
You drove up beside her and stopped.
You asked if she wanted a lift.

56
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:14,583
Because she was tired and
had run away, she said yes.

57
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,054
I don't know what
you're talking about.

58
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:24,096
Maybe she was scared when she
saw you drive the wrong way.

59
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,098
And even more afraid
when you locked the door.

60
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:32,942
You don't know if it was him,
you can't be sure. Think about it.

61
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:38,816
She probably hoped you would leave
when you were done. But you didn't.

62
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:42,182
You drove to the harbor and
threw her into the water.

63
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:46,074
Stop, you're going to kill an innocent man.

64
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,942
Innocent? You should look at this.

65
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:22,062
Tell me, was she conscious when
you threw her into the water?

66
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:25,695
She had salt water in her lungs.
She drowned.

67
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,996
So I'll ask you again... was she conscious?

68
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,219
You're silent. I guess it's fitting
that you'll be conscious too.

69
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:40,457
Stop there. Put it down
and step away from him.

70
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:47,662
Put that thing down and get away from him.

71
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,342
Get away from him.

72
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,337
Further away.

73
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,523
Stop there.

74
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,017
Hands above your head
and on your knees.

75
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,100
I've emptied the magazine.

76
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:19,543
Move.

77
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,937
Move now, Lund.

78
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:10,539
That's enough, that's enough.

79
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,202
Come on.

80
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:32,294
With the kidnapper in custody, we have
reason to hope for Emilie's safe return.

81
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:35,901
It should strengthen the
position of the prime minister

82
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:39,597
as the now eight day
ordeal comes to a close.

83
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:42,699
- What has he said about Emilie?
- Nothing yet.

84
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:46,653
He has been taken to the
station for questioning.

85
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:50,022
I want to know who he is,
how he was caught, everything.

86
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:54,975
He worked for Zeeland and is the
father of the murdered girl.

87
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:59,297
- He's homeless, but that's all I know.
- Go check it out.

88
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:05,176
- They caught him? Did he say anything?
- Talk to Karen when she comes back.

89
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:10,663
Mogens is trying to find out.

90
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:15,535
If she's alive, it's likely she'll be
returned to them before the election.

91
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:21,416
- He was your son, he was also my nephew.
- Let the group in. I'll call you back.

92
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:25,452
You can place blame for his suicide,
on anyone, but not me.

93
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,166
For fuck's sake, instead of telling
me what he was going through,

94
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:31,628
you make up shit about Karen,
or Zeeland, or whatever...

95
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:35,198
Pardon me Mogens,
Kristoffer was just leaving.

96
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,562
I have some new information.

97
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:43,218
The perpetrator thinks Zeuthen's personal
assistant was in Jutland at the time

98
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:45,346
and that he has something
to do with the murder.

99
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:48,717
The assistant was attacked at home,
but he is fortunately unharmed.

100
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,183
- But he was at Jutland?
- Who?

101
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:58,000
- Zeuthen's assistant. Was he at Jutland?
- I have no idea. Why?

102
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,276
Get Karen. I want everyone to hear this.

103
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,190
You're aware of your rights,
and you don't want a lawyer, correct?

104
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:22,797
Are you the same Loke Rantzau Poulsen
that went to Majg×•rden 4 years ago

105
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:27,828
to look for his daughter, Louise Hjelby?

106
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:35,900
You're an electricial engineer.

107
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,514
Besides the Scandinavian languages,
you speak another four.

108
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:44,984
Loke Rantzau worked for the oil division
of Zeeland. Here's a picture of you.

109
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:50,139
It's about twelve years old,
but shall we assume that's you?

110
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,736
- We should be at the hearing.
- Technically, so should you.

111
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:58,523
I'm in charge. If you have a
problem with it, then too bad.

112
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:02,957
- And what is Borch doing in there?
- You know very well that he...

113
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:06,921
If he's not there because he's
caught the kidnapper, fine.

114
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,680
But we have Zeuthen coming
in a half-hour and he

115
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,830
along with the world,
wants to know where his daughter is.

116
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:16,616
The last time you called you said
Emilie Zeuthen could still be alive.

117
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:20,818
We found your hideout,
and evidence that you put her on a ship.

118
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:27,162
I want you to tell me where she is.

119
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:32,257
You are suspected of kidnapping
and murder. I would talk.

120
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:38,978
Your daughter deserves to have her killer
tried and convicted, whoever that it is.

121
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,740
We can do that unless you
tell us where Emilie is.

122
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:46,215
We will find her anyway,
whether you cooperate or not.

123
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:49,934
You have nothing to gain by
playing dumb. Where is she?

124
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,136
Where is she? Loke?

125
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,174
Now you tell us where she is.
Where is Emilie?

126
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,974
Look at the numbers.
What kind of boat is it?

127
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:09,343
Where is she? Is she alive?

128
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:17,282
You will not get the justice you
want by punishing Emilie Zeuthen.

129
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,064
I know that your
child was a victim.

130
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:27,220
And if I am going to make sure the offender
is punished, you need to help me now.

131
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,175
They won't allow that.

132
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:39,663
You've ensured that he goes free.

133
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,453
And if I do it anyway?

134
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,015
If I prove who did it...

135
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:51,781
and it's certain
that he's punished?

136
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,508
Then you will be in a
bigger rush than you think.

137
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,051
What's that?

138
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,561
Where's she being kept?

139
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,681
He says Emilie is still alive.

140
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:18,262
But he will not say where she is,
that's all we got out of him.

141
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,435
We want to talk to him.

142
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:26,262
That won't accomplish anything.
He thinks Zeeland covered up the murder.

143
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,171
He has no compassion.

144
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,439
- Who is it?
- A former Zeeland employee.

145
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:35,022
Loke Rantzau Poulsen. But I need your help.

146
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:39,622
We need to look into your assistant,
Niels Reinhardt.

147
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:44,654
He knew the murdered girl and
we know that his car was seen...

148
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,498
This is ridiculous.
The kidnapper is here.

149
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:51,621
We have to show him we can solve the murder,
before it's too late.

150
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,979
What do you mean 'too late'?

151
00:13:55,145 --> 00:14:00,173
- We will examine the children's...
- What is too late?

152
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:08,863
The kidnapper claims that
he shipped Emilie abroad.

153
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:13,863
She will be in an air-tight tank
with a limited amount of oxygen.

154
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,916
He signed a sworn statement.

155
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:20,908
It's a decompression
tank for divers.

156
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:29,857
And how much time is left?

157
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,842
We don't even know if
he's telling the truth...

158
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,421
How long?

159
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:39,772
48 hours or less, he says.

160
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,167
So now that you've had all your
relevant questions answered...

161
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,370
about your asssistant and
Zeeland's children's fund.

162
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,852
Reinhardt is back home and
Borch has talked with his boss.

163
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:15,084
It can't be true.
He doesn't say where she is.

164
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:20,045
They will continue to question him and
in the meantime, try to solve the case.

165
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:23,013
What about the old case?

166
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:29,853
The license plate of Zeuthen's assistant
matches the one in the boy's book.

167
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:33,087
Is that the only thing that
connects him to the case?

168
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:37,612
He only met her once.

169
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:42,219
Zeeland's children's fund helped her out,
but to then claim that he...

170
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,910
Wait a second.

171
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:47,983
Is there any indication it was Reinhardt
that pressured the prosecutor?

172
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,895
No, no. But who said the
prosecutor was pressured?

173
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,853
The police say it, but whether or
not their information is reliable...

174
00:15:56,975 --> 00:16:00,995
He dropped a homicide case.
That was not his own idea?

175
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,309
We have nothing to do with it.

176
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,418
Unless information was kept secret.

177
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,366
What do you say Karen?

178
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,585
Well...

179
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,694
Do you know Zeuthen's assistant?
Did you meet him in Jutland?

180
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,778
We talked to them a
lot at that time.

181
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,718
Did you meet him or not?

182
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,050
Yeah, I did.

183
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:34,484
Yes. But I only had you and
the party's interests in mind.

184
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,110
It was the day we had the
agreement with Zeeland ratified.

185
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,811
We had a financial crisis, polls were bad.
We needed their support.

186
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:56,593
Zeuthen had just taken over after his
father's death, there was a lot of unrest.

187
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:59,164
They insisted we freeze taxes.

188
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,896
With our program it kept them out
of trouble. It was your idea.

189
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:10,254
The conversation with Reinhardt, which
Benjamin heard, was nothing secretive.

190
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:14,252
I was only reassuring Zeeland.

191
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,954
Did I tell you to do that?

192
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,014
No.

193
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:20,121
I wanted to meet him and thank
him for the extra campaign money.

194
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,803
Money you needed for
the final sprint.

195
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,913
What kind of campaign money?

196
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,703
We needed their support we couldn't
have done it without Zeeland.

197
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,389
I hope he's not guilty.

198
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:32,013
We didn't do anything wrong.

199
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:37,418
Ussing will say we let Zeeland sabotage
the case because they gave us money.

200
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:43,423
You think I knew about Reinhardt and the
murder but kept silent because of Zeeland?

201
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:47,091
Why didn't you say that he was in Jutland?

202
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:50,930
Because I hadn't thought of it.
What do you think?

203
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:56,294
Do you really think that I
had something to do with it?

204
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:13,611
We must go to the police.
Give it to the PR department.

205
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,243
But tomorrow is the final debate.

206
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:20,454
Benjamin trusted you more
than anyone at the time?

207
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:23,770
He hung around with those guys
from that Internet newspaper.

208
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,609
What paper?

209
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:29,594
<i>Frontal</i>. Some half-baked
leftist propaganda site.

210
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:33,694
- He was in love with a girl named Sally.
- Find out where she is.

211
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,212
Can I take this call?
My wife is traveling back from France.

212
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:43,574
According to the agenda of your secretary,
you were in Jutland.

213
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:47,569
Do you remember if you
went to Guldbjerghavn?

214
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:52,767
Where were you heading to?

215
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:56,223
To Esbjerg. I had some early meetings.

216
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
With who?

217
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,668
With government representatives.

218
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:05,686
The elections were approaching.
The financial crisis was at its peak.

219
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,975
We negotiated arrangements that could
help the country get through it.

220
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:14,328
And you remember that perfectly.
After two years.

221
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,739
I also remember
that I was stressed.

222
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:20,549
On April 21, the day after,
my wife was turning sixty.

223
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:23,209
I had organized a big party.

224
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,585
How long did you stay in Jutland?
Did you go home the same day?

225
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:27,762
No.

226
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:32,885
I was feeling ill, and my wife
suggested I stay in a hotel.

227
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,264
Which hotel?

228
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,295
I don't remember,
Zeeland can tell you which.

229
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:38,926
As fund President...

230
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:45,011
you had access to the address
of Louise's foster home.

231
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,114
And you knew her
from the orphanage.

232
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,316
I didn't know it was her.

233
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,609
Would I display a photo if
I had something to hide?

234
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,168
Can anyone confirm what you did
the rest of the day in Jutland?

235
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:06,648
According to your mobile phone provider,
on the afternoon of April 20,

236
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,375
you were within twelve
kilometers of Guldbjerghavn.

237
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,958
Until the following morning
where there was contact

238
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,009
with a cell tower in Copenhagen.

239
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,533
What were you doing there?

240
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,148
Maybe the fuel tank was empty.

241
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:24,494
This is ridiculous. Do you think that
I have murdered an innocent child?

242
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:28,047
Sorry, I need to take this call.

243
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:35,008
We'll take your car into forensics,
we'll need fingerprints and a DNA sample.

244
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:39,805
Give us your passport. Don't leave
the country without our permission.

245
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:48,010
Hi Mark, it's mom. The midwife called and
they want to keep Eva in the hospital.

246
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:49,667
What are we going to do here?

247
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:54,929
It's not good, so we need to make
sure she has everything she needs.

248
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,325
Will you call me as
soon as possible?

249
00:20:57,495 --> 00:21:02,764
I don't understand why we're running
around while that girl is choking for air.

250
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,897
What's up?

251
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:10,573
Let's search Reinhardt's house in France
and any other places where he goes.

252
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:12,088
Go find Mark.

253
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:16,885
- Have you really found the culprit?
- We need to find more.

254
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:21,845
We'll take care of it. We're getting there.
I'll call as soon as I know anything.

255
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,290
Can I talk to the suspect?

256
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,766
Just go.

257
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,929
I can't find my passport.

258
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:42,373
Maja, everyone has searched
and we have no idea where...

259
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:47,051
Make sure you find out.
Where is that passport?

260
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:53,165
Maybe in your other coat.
In the coat closet.

261
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,293
Gilsfort is here.

262
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:03,094
Sorry to interrupt but we need to talk
about the police's interest in Reinhardt.

263
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:08,409
- It's absurd. I've known him my whole life.
- It's just not Reinhardt.

264
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:13,569
The CSR strategy is a core value of Zeeland.

265
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:17,853
The media will revel
in Reinhardt's story.

266
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:21,485
My problem now is that the
police are wasting time.

267
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:26,809
I only ask that you convince Reinhardt
to follow the advice of our lawyers.

268
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:32,607
This misunderstanding must be handled.
We're not letting it ruin us.

269
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:37,974
What if he is really guilty? The police
wouldn't suspect him for no reason.

270
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:42,811
You let him investigate if Zeeland
was involved in the old case.

271
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:50,211
I wish the best for you and Emilie.
Let me know if I can help with anything.

272
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,045
The plane is ready.

273
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:22,610
But they have not found anything in Hamburg.

274
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:35,285
If any of us had done something wrong,
I would already know.

275
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:44,151
I'll go to the office.

276
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,790
No, stay here.

277
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,212
We'll find her.

278
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:55,165
She will come home.

279
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,698
And everything will be the
way it should be. I promise.

280
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:01,290
All that matters is the four of us.

281
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:08,367
And we can go traveling.
As long as the kids stay with us.

282
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,813
Promise?

283
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:39,649
There is a bowel movement in the amniotic
fluid, which is often a sign of stress.

284
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:45,412
It may indicate preeclampsia.
We may have to initiate labor.

285
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:50,569
She doesn't want us to call her parents,
because of her boyfriend.

286
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:54,808
- But the baby is ok?
- We are keeping an eye on it.

287
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,969
Is your son aware of
Eva's current condition?

288
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:08,244
I tried to call him,
but I don't know where he is.

289
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,850
Excuse me. Did you put a
bag down in the hallway?

290
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:38,863
What? No.

291
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,725
It says Eva Lauersen on it.
I'll put it down here.

292
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:05,492
To be fair to her, you have to be there.

293
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:08,044
You can live with me.

294
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:13,573
Eva spent two days with you and now she
lies here. Why do you think that is?

295
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:17,250
You can't keep blaming
me for everything.

296
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:21,727
I know I've failed,
and if I could do it over...

297
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,807
That is precisely
what you don't want.

298
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:29,173
It has never interested you.
You were never there.

299
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:33,647
Now you have a house and garden
and stand on your pedestal,

300
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:36,454
and you tell me how to live.

301
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:40,210
I don't know how you should live.

302
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:46,694
You're smarter than me.
And stronger.

303
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,142
And I know that you've had to be.

304
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:56,509
That's the only good thing to have
emerged from me not being there.

305
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,791
It's me. Reinhardt
was in the village.

306
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:26,327
His credit card was used at a nearby kiosk
half an hour before Louise disappeared.

307
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,843
Zeeland's lawyers are stalking me.

308
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:36,204
You have to find something better
than where he bought chocolate frogs.

309
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,730
Forensics searched the car.

310
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:43,923
Unfortunately it's cleaned often,
but there are marks on the paint.

311
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,087
The color matches Louise's bicycle.

312
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:50,565
They cannot conclusively
prove it was Louise's bike.

313
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,125
And the body? Is there nothing
on Reinhardt or the car?

314
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,604
Photos were analyzed.

315
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:01,974
She had many injuries from physical
violence. Most are pre mortem.

316
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:06,048
Are there traces of blood in the car?
None we could detect.

317
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:11,369
But she has wounds, and dental damage
caused by the killer's wrist watch.

318
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,845
- I'm now waiting for a follow up...
- That should be all

319
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:19,247
Those injuries may not track
back to Reinhardt's wristwatch.

320
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:24,603
- So you have nothing?
- He wasn't seen that day.

321
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:28,324
We can't even place him in the hotel,
where he was supposedly staying.

322
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:35,094
He has no alibi for the entire day.
Asbj×¨rn is investigating the children's...

323
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:41,603
Then, where he left the car to be cleaned?
What did he dress for?

324
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,407
We are now looking to see when he
drove over Storeb×–ltbrug, but...

325
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:50,951
You have heard yourself that
Emilie Zeuthen is in that tank.

326
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:54,136
We should go. Annet Reinhardt
is on her way to the station.

327
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:03,730
It was a surprise party.

328
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:09,128
My husband and the girls had
organized a wonderful party.

329
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:13,853
I was lured to Switzerland where
one of our daughter's lives.

330
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:18,108
We went back to Denmark,
Niels picked us up from the airport.

331
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:21,490
I thought we were
meeting for dinner...

332
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,194
When we arrived home,
all of my dearest friends were there.

333
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:30,365
- He took you to his own car?
- Of course, Where else?

334
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,208
- Did you use the trunk?
- Yes.

335
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:36,765
- What did he do at the party?
- He gave a wonderful speech.

336
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:42,168
Did he seem stressed or tired,
after the trip to Jutland?

337
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:44,451
I told him to go to sleep.

338
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:50,167
Niels has blood clotting issues,
so I asked him to stay overnight.

339
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:53,508
He wore his wrist
watch to the party?

340
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:56,867
Probably, he's very
attached to that watch.

341
00:29:56,975 --> 00:30:00,570
I gave it to him on
his sixtieth birthday.

342
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:04,495
Niels seems to be really involved
with the children's fund.

343
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,855
He's the chairman.

344
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,538
That's right.

345
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:12,303
He also visits the children often,
but that's not part of his job. Right?

346
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,590
What is your opinion of the way
he deals with the children?

347
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:23,405
Niels and the fund do important social work.

348
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:29,411
Both my husbands and I appreciate that
the orphaned children have a chance.

349
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:31,612
I'll ask the question differently.

350
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:36,767
You have two daughters. As children,
how was their relationship with Niels?

351
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,467
It's a fair question.

352
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,733
What's so important?

353
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:55,293
You also have a house
in Anhult and France.

354
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:59,047
Any other places where you sometimes sleep?

355
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:04,114
A flat in London,
but that's not really interesting.

356
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:08,303
But not here in Zealand or Funen?
A hut, or a boat...

357
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:12,014
No, we sail. We do not hunt.

358
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:14,288
I golf and my husband
has his gallery.

359
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:16,784
Gallery?

360
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:23,512
Reinhardt has a place
he hasn't told us about.

361
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:26,466
Let's go now.

362
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:35,544
Don't leave, it's because
of you that we're here.

363
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:42,666
Mathias wants some time away from us.
So I brought his clothes.

364
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,191
What do I say to the girls?

365
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:51,487
When will they see him again? About a week,
a month? What do you say?

366
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:54,534
Just leave it. There's no reason for this.

367
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:56,798
NO! I have a right to know!

368
00:31:56,895 --> 00:32:01,825
You were fucking in Jutland,
I want to know what your plans are.

369
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:04,505
What do you want from him?

370
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:07,009
This has nothing to do with Sarah.

371
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:14,946
Listen to me. Quiet down now.

372
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:16,386
Let go of me.

373
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,819
I don't get it.

374
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:24,791
Another seven companies
gave us permission to board.

375
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:29,824
They checked almost everywhere
but no trace of Emilie.

376
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:34,546
Let's speed things up. We wait for no one.

377
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:38,708
If she's not there,
there's other possibilities.

378
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,947
Come.

379
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:02,630
I've told them everything and
Annet has also talked to them.

380
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:12,865
I hope the worst is now behind us.

381
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:18,792
It probably is. I suggest you enjoy
go home until everything is over.

382
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:26,951
But you're wasting time.
Emilie's out there somewhere...

383
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:30,332
We have to hope he'll talk soon.

384
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:37,173
In the mean time, go home.
Make sure you're available to the police.

385
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:40,534
What does Maja think? She doesn't think...

386
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:42,594
No, of course not.

387
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:47,546
We both know it was all out
of thin air, don't worry.

388
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:56,506
Nothing here. Let's see how
far they are from Zeeland.

389
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:59,064
Why does he keep his gallery here?

390
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,550
It is far away from everything.

391
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:07,948
There was a large shopping mall here
and a multipurpose stadium being built.

392
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:13,394
The developer went bankrupt,
then Reinhardt bought part of it.

393
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:17,673
For the money you can get something
far more luxurious. Why here?

394
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:21,828
I'll go there. You stay here. Don't leave.

395
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,904
I'm sorry Marie asked you those questions.

396
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:28,934
I don't want to talk about it.

397
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,765
Things haven't been good for a long time.

398
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:36,173
I don't want to get involved,
that's just not going to happen.

399
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,404
And I can't...

400
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:41,183
I can't.

401
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,292
Let's just pretend
it didn't happen.

402
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,504
No.

403
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,028
This time I'll allow
myself to not be put off.

404
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:53,465
Listen to me. I don't
want to lose this again.

405
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,573
I don't give a shit what you say,
I'm not letting you run away again.

406
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,431
Do you hear me?

407
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:32,633
Pressure washers.

408
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:38,027
Car rubbish.

409
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:02,325
These are the records for
Zeeland's children's fund.

410
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:20,024
Here's Majg×•rden,
the orphanage where Louise was.

411
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:49,766
Do you own any former industrial buildings?

412
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,427
Just my gallery.

413
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:58,311
Why are there files from the
children's fund stored there?

414
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:02,846
I'm taking you in for questioning.
You have the right to an attorney.

415
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:10,631
I will inform the lawyers.

416
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,781
Thanks.

417
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:17,869
Lisa. I want all the information
about the children's fund.

418
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,913
And about Reinhardt's
relationship to that girl.

419
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,430
I'll get on it right away.

420
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:35,634
We should ask Karen back to the
strategize for the final debate.

421
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,185
Not while Reinhardt's innocence is in doubt.

422
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:45,510
Are you sure you want to do this?
This isn't the best place to be seen.

423
00:37:57,555 --> 00:38:01,548
There is plenty of tea,
but you have to find a cup.

424
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:07,110
I understand that you knew my son Benjamin.

425
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:11,943
I need your help.

426
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:17,392
Before his death, he was over in Jutland,
during my campaign.

427
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:19,944
That's not what he said.

428
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:24,745
He said he was dragged out by his ass to go.

429
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,630
Did he say anything
about that trip?

430
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:28,150
Why would I tell you?

431
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:29,708
It is important to me.

432
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:31,076
He told me not to.

433
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:39,068
Not long after, he said he had done
something for which I'd never forgive him.

434
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,830
I need to know what he meant.

435
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:51,025
It started when he saw an employee
of yours with someone from Zeeland.

436
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,271
He said it smelled like cronyism to him.

437
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:55,288
When did that start?

438
00:38:56,035 --> 00:39:01,014
Then he went into a story about
you and your campaign money.

439
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,754
He began to see a monster.

440
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,170
That's it.

441
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:10,111
You wrote a story
because he was my son?

442
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:14,234
Well naturally it was,
because he wasn't proud of you.

443
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:24,668
Anyway he was sorry all of
a sudden and he backed out.

444
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,883
When was that?

445
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:29,123
Shortly before.

446
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,252
But you know that.

447
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:36,588
It would have cost you the victory
and he would have been killed.

448
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,868
Of course not!

449
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:40,884
The idea alone...

450
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,367
You'd better get going.

451
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:49,368
PET wants to leave and the press is coming.

452
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:53,231
Unless you like being surrounded by
joints on live tv, we'd better leave now.

453
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:06,588
Your garage is now being searched.
Tell us why you've been there.

454
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:11,114
There is a shower and a bed,
so you sleep there sometimes.

455
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,393
I like to study my art and
sometimes it gets late.

456
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:17,943
files of orphans

457
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:22,970
Including information about Louise,
and the address of her foster family.

458
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:28,474
It's just storage,
I don't know what's in those boxes.

459
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:32,413
But you know what this is,
huh? A broken watch. What did it say?

460
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:34,491
This is my old watch.

461
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:40,093
It is the same watch that you gave us,
only it's broken. Why is that?

462
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,590
It happened when I moved.

463
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,480
Why did you buy an identical watch?

464
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:51,826
It was a gift from my wife.
I didn't want to tell her.

465
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:55,544
When did it break? I can call the store too.

466
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:58,787
I don't know anymore. A couple of years ago.

467
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:02,425
You're not wearing your watch
in the pictures of the party.

468
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:08,591
It broke when you killed her.
It's why you bought an identical watch.

469
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:15,228
You might not have been in Guldbjerghavn,
but your credit card was used there.

470
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:19,274
Did you drive by Louise's school?
Did you follow her?

471
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,903
- I do not deserve this.
- Look.

472
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:25,704
Paint scratches caused by her bike.

473
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:30,665
You turned off your mobile.
You looked for a place no one ever goes.

474
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:35,351
Louise is tied up and raped.
Look at the pictures.

475
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:38,188
She resisted. Why did you hit her?

476
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:44,430
She bled profusely, but she was still
breathing when you threw her in the water?

477
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:48,634
You went that night directly
to your gallery, showered...

478
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:52,185
Cleaned the car and then
picked up your wife.

479
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:57,383
Tell us the truth,
and we can still save Emilie.

480
00:41:57,555 --> 00:42:02,583
The girl had injuries matching a watch.
We'll find out anyway, so...

481
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:05,633
We're on.

482
00:42:12,555 --> 00:42:18,949
Keld Mongg×•rd. I represent
Zealand and Niels Reinhardt.

483
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:23,586
We see no reason why an innocent
man should be held any longer.

484
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:25,586
We have evidence against him.

485
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:30,749
Also you imply that Zeuthen and Zeeland,
directly or indirectly...

486
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:35,033
had a crime covered up by a prosecutor.

487
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:36,947
We imply nothing.

488
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:41,552
A murdered orphan girl and a
multinational corporation.

489
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:44,787
A good story, especially during a crisis.

490
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:49,107
But your conspiracy theory is full of flaws.

491
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:54,144
That prosectuor was under pressure
to cover up the case, for sure.

492
00:42:54,315 --> 00:43:00,834
According to his colleagues, he was
only under pressure from budget cuts.

493
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,591
If he wanted to cover up, he should have
covered up the mistakes he made before.

494
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:11,990
The first two weeks after the murder
he was investigating the sailors

495
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:16,706
but he really should have thought
of concentrate elsewhere.

496
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:20,550
Like a black car that a
witness had pointed out.

497
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:23,832
But by then, important trace
evidence had already disappeared.

498
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:28,785
And in order to save his career,
he buried the case.

499
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:33,312
According to the booklet was
Reinhardt near the girl.

500
00:43:33,475 --> 00:43:40,108
The book is useless. I have my
own questions to ask that boy.

501
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:43,790
- We have talked to him.
- Not well apparently.

502
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:48,233
He ??only wrote down
cars with Danish plates.

503
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:54,191
Remember that road leads
directly to the German border.

504
00:43:54,355 --> 00:44:00,703
She disappeared around Easter, and at
least 60 to 70 cars passed through there.

505
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:04,185
Especially tourists
and foreign workers.

506
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:09,509
Statistically, seventy percent
of all the cars were black.

507
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:12,253
But you know that's already been determined.

508
00:44:12,323 --> 00:44:13,843
It means Reinhardt
wasn't available.

509
00:44:14,115 --> 00:44:19,428
He has no alibi and the girl had sustained
an injury from the perpetrator's watch.

510
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:23,713
PET can confirm that at
the time of the crime,

511
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,834
he was in bed at the Royal
Prince Hotel. Sleeping.

512
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:30,987
The hotel found the records.

513
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:35,273
Reinhardt used his
keycard at 15.25...

514
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:39,747
And only used his pass again to leave
his room early the next morning.

515
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:45,194
His car was in the garage
from then until noon.

516
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:50,952
I assume neither Reinhardt nor Zeeland
will be the focus of your investigation.

517
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:57,270
And I hope that you use all
these people to find Emilie.

518
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:59,266
Have a nice day.

519
00:45:03,115 --> 00:45:08,314
- If it's not him, then who is it?
- We go to the kidnapper.

520
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:12,309
But not you. From now on,
take PET in with you.

521
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,546
I only need a moment.

522
00:45:40,915 --> 00:45:43,110
It may not have been him.

523
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:47,507
We've missed things that
aren't in that notebook.

524
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:53,824
I will have to start the investigation
again from scratch and that takes time.

525
00:45:55,315 --> 00:46:01,993
I will solve this. You have to
trust me and tell where Emilie is.

526
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:14,466
Read it for yourself.
He was in his hotel room.

527
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:20,107
It was almost Easter, cars passed by that
the little boy didn't even write down.

528
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:27,226
Maybe you're blind, because you
still think Zeeland is involved.

529
00:46:27,395 --> 00:46:32,423
You have a son. Why is a little
girl so important to you?

530
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:37,669
- You have a home and a good life...
- You've proven what you want.

531
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:42,863
But if you want to do
right by your daughter...

532
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:50,546
That's the only thing
I can do for her.

533
00:46:54,715 --> 00:46:59,869
I wasn't there for a
single moment of her life.

534
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:05,871
There wasn't time.

535
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:13,511
Now you ask me to
take into account...

536
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:16,587
your feelings of entitlement.

537
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:20,225
My child was abused and
thrown into the harbor.

538
00:47:20,395 --> 00:47:22,511
PET will interrogate him.

539
00:47:34,915 --> 00:47:39,033
You can never do right by
your child if Emilie dies.

540
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:41,425
Not because the will was not there.

541
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:44,864
But because you didn't want to.

542
00:47:57,835 --> 00:48:02,431
The hospital called.
Your daughter-in-law gave birth.

543
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:08,467
What did he say? Did he say anything?
What do we do now?

544
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,432
But who was it?

545
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:14,873
Probably a motorist who crossed
the border and is now gone.

546
00:48:15,035 --> 00:48:18,710
The main thing is that all
conspiracy theories...

547
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:23,107
about manipulative companies
and politicians are refuted.

548
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,665
Prosecuteor had his
own case covered up?

549
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:31,863
During my conversation with him,
he said the matter to close was...

550
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:38,713
Zealand and that they were not involved.
Then he probably realized his mistake.

551
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,834
Did he say anything that surprised you?
About the book or cars?

552
00:48:42,995 --> 00:48:46,783
No, only a notebook with prominent names.

553
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:51,585
It had only drawn attention to
his mistake, and the whole thing.

554
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:55,304
He ??would rather sweep
it under the rug.

555
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:59,309
Especially when he realized that the
perpetrator was out of the country.

556
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:03,354
We'll use this.
It is important for the debate.

557
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:08,270
I'm ready for a press conference,
if you'll let me.

558
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:14,829
Ussing's accusations that the government
protected Zeeland have been proven false.

559
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:21,946
There's no reason to rejoice until Emilie
is found. Put pressure on the police.

560
00:49:22,115 --> 00:49:25,471
Where are you going?
We have to leave now.

561
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:30,793
It doesn't matter,
the flyers are just out.

562
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:44,531
I had to distance myself from
you during the investigation.

563
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,667
It was in your best interest.

564
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:50,870
You're running late,
you're final debate's going to begin.

565
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:58,193
I'm sorry that I did not trust you.
You have every right to be angry.

566
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:03,833
I need you now.

567
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,945
I really need you.

568
00:50:20,555 --> 00:50:22,432
You've never been greater.

569
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:29,607
We're gonna be late. I have a
list of focal points for you.

570
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:31,873
Are you friends again?

571
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,990
You've probably already seen this.

572
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:38,867
No. But if you want a piercing,
we can advise you.

573
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,868
I'll see you guys in the car, okay?

574
00:50:57,915 --> 00:51:00,304
What I said about Benjamin,
was wrong.

575
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:04,124
He was proud of you, even though
he did not agree with you.

576
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:07,074
You shouldn't have come,
but there was something wrong.

577
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,685
What do you know?

578
00:51:10,555 --> 00:51:17,313
When he said he was sorry, he came over
to remove all the photos from the server.

579
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:22,344
He had taken pictures in Jutland and <i>Frontal</i>
wanted to convert them to use.

580
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:25,951
- What were they, the photos?
- I have not seen them.

581
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:30,791
But his account was deleted.
All the material was gone.

582
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:34,664
- A technical error, they said.
- Why are you telling me this?

583
00:51:34,835 --> 00:51:38,464
Because the server provider,
Delta, called.

584
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,593
And Delta is owned by Zeeland.

585
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:46,909
He said something about a backup.
He ??asked me to save it.

586
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:57,588
- Are you sure?
- No. But the police have nothing more.

587
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:01,543
And the kidnapper won't talk.

588
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:06,006
I will inform the Board of Directors.
Let's hope for the best.

589
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,624
She's not on a junk boat.

590
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:45,913
I'm going to the police to
see if I can speak to him.

591
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:48,191
Maybe he'll talk to me.

592
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:55,271
Something good will happen.
We'll get her back.

593
00:53:02,355 --> 00:53:06,587
No evidence that Reinhardt
was interested in that girl.

594
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:12,705
I have also checked if he was there when
the police questioned those sailors.

595
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:16,470
But when he was with you
at the conference in Davos.

596
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:21,390
But there is something strange.
I think you should see it now.

597
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:27,790
You were supposed to call
me if something happened.

598
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:33,348
- The baby came too quickly.
- But I didn't want her to be alone.

599
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:38,031
She is not alone. He came this
morning and was here for all of it.

600
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:43,315
He didn't cut the umbilical cord,
but they have done well.

601
00:53:43,475 --> 00:53:46,626
Everything went well with the baby,
congratulations.

602
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:12,549
PET is on the line.

603
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:15,866
- For Me?
- Yes. He says it's important.

604
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,906
I'm entitled to a phone call. That you get.

605
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:26,114
Promise me that the killer of
my daughter will be punished.

606
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:28,948
Then I'll tell you where Emilie is.

607
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:32,346
- I already promised.
- Come get me.

608
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:39,353
- Tell me where she is, then I will...
- I want to go. That's my condition.

609
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:43,303
I can't do that. And I decide it's not over.

610
00:54:43,475 --> 00:54:45,943
There are no other options.

611
00:54:47,195 --> 00:54:50,585
You should now come.
Time is running out.

612
00:54:57,195 --> 00:55:01,154
I don't like this. He doesn't
talk and suddenly says something.

613
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,273
I'll see you.

614
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:26,627
Gilsfort. Why did you suggest 2.5 years
of back interest in that girl's case?

615
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:32,188
I've just seen the documents.
You wanted to be kept informed. Why?

616
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:35,950
Well, one of our
sailors was involved.

617
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:41,906
No they weren't. Why were
you interested in that case?

618
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:45,147
- Was Reinhardt already suspicious?
- Of course not.

619
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:50,867
My daughters life depends on it,
so if you have protected Reinhardt...

620
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:54,186
I'm just protecting you.

621
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:58,473
I had promised your father I would
help you and the firm after his death.

622
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:05,268
The crisis, talks with the government.
Sorry if I've done my job.

623
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:09,588
We all find this terrible.

624
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:17,552
But if you doubt Reinhardt,
you have to go talk to him.

625
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:43,474
I understand.

626
00:56:43,635 --> 00:56:50,313
I should have told you about Gilsfort's
interest. It didn't seem important.

627
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:56,092
I'd do anything for you to get Emilie back.
I hope you know that.

628
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:59,891
Whatever it takes.

629
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:06,915
-I'm leaving.
-The kidnapper is going to show us where Emilie is.

630
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:11,193
He's not saying anything yet,
but they're going to the airport.

631
00:57:12,305 --> 00:58:12,193

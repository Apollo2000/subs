1
00:00:01,304 --> 00:00:04,376
Police are looking for Robert Zeuthen's
9 year old daughter Emilie

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:08,298
If the kidnapper wants justice
for Louise Hjelby, we need to hurry.

3
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:11,376
You don't know if it was him.
-Go there.

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:17,537
Your daughter deserves that her killer is
brought to justice, whoever it is.

5
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:24,223
Emilie is located in an air-tight container
with a limited amount of oxygen.

6
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:29,742
What does Maja think? She doesn't think that...
-We know that you are innocent.

7
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,267
Ussing's accusations
about the government's

8
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,898
relationship with Zeeland
have been proven false.

9
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:37,294
We won't celebrate until
Emilie is found safe.

10
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:42,140
You knew my son, Benjamin?
-He had all of his photos removed from our server.

11
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:46,013
What kind of photos?
-He had a backup.

12
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:50,260
You're not wearing your watch in
the photos from the surprise party.

13
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:53,621
It broke when you killed Louise Hjelby.

14
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:56,662
I haven't done anything!
-We have to let him go.

15
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:03,423
Promise me that the murderer will be punished
and I will show you where Emilie is.

16
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:08,297
The Killing III

17
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:11,804
Thursday, November 17th 9:57pm

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,892
The Norwegian police will escort them to
the spot where we hope to find Emilie.

19
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,100
I will make sure to keep leadership
informed of any developments.

20
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:20,574
How do we know that the
girl is in Norway?

21
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:25,693
The kidnapper says that he shipped
Emilie in that direction.

22
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:31,302
In a container. It was the escape
which he had prepared for himself.

23
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:34,262
This explains the container list.

24
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:37,780
Isn't she in a decompression chamber?
-Yes.

25
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:43,780
Inside the container. He placed Emilie
there so no one could hear her.

26
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:47,493
Can't we find that container?
Not fast enough.

27
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:53,057
Hundreds of containers have already been
transported to various cities in Norway .

28
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:55,738
He didn't write the name down.

29
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:59,180
Emilie only has enough oxygen for 24 hours.

30
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:04,657
And you have approved a tour
led by a criminal.

31
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:10,660
We promised that the murder of his
daughter will be thoroughly investigated.

32
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:16,774
He changed his mind when we found evidence
that it couldn't have been Zeuthen's assistant.

33
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:23,497
I don't know why he cooperates. He
certainly doesn't trust you.

34
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:29,455
Thanks to us, the kidnapper was caught and
he had reason to suspect Reinhardt.

35
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:34,459
But not for long. I told you
the notebook didn't matter.

36
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:40,978
The Minister of Justice has
criticized us in a press conference.

37
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:44,216
His take on Lund is disastrous.

38
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:48,059
It doesn't matter which party
wins the election tomorrow...

39
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:53,457
We'll be out of our jobs if
that girl doesn't show up alive.

40
00:02:55,784 --> 00:03:01,256
Why do I have to sit on the car while
Lund and Borch are in Norway?

41
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:04,336
Patience. Have you gotten
in touch with Zeuthen?

42
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:08,941
Zealand says he's unreachable.
I can still go, you know.

43
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:12,176
Why can't you reach him?

44
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:19,341
Is the baby well?
-Yes, she's so beautiful.

45
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:25,420
She's 44cm tall, and weighs 7 pounds.
She has all her fingers and toes.

46
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:30,578
So it's a girl.
-It all went great and Mark was there.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:35,295
He's so cute when he holds her.
Wanna talk to him?

48
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:40,140
I can't now, maybe tomorrow when I'm
back. Will you send me a photo of her?

49
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,695
Will do. She just woke up.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

50
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:54,252
Here's paperwork confirming our commitment
to investigating your daughter's death.

51
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:58,279
We're looking at all possible vehicles
in the area, especially black ones.

52
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:02,220
Does Zeuthen know we're travelling?
-Why?

53
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,775
I've informed Emilie's parents and
I'll keep you informed of our investigation.

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,520
Now it's your turn to keep up your end
of the bargain and tell us where Emilie is.

55
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:14,118
We're landing.

56
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,383
Where to? Between Havn and Stavanger?
-Along the coast.

57
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:23,254
So the container was transported along the coast from Stavanger?

58
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:29,613
I will lead you to the girl.
-Just tell us where the container is!

59
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:33,580
Brix here. There is a problem.

60
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:39,341
Zeuthen's plane has landed in Stavanger.
But we can't get in touch.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

62
00:04:56,584 --> 00:05:01,055
Welcome to Norway. We're
ready to assist.

63
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:06,981
Is that our car? We'll take Loke,
so he can show us the way.

64
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:14,293
What did he say? Where is she?

65
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:18,616
We will go along the coast.
You should wait here for Emilie ...

66
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:23,904
I'm coming with you. She had 2 days worth of air, and you've wasted half already.

67
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,136
That was unfortunate.
Now we must focus on this.

68
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:29,135
You have to get inside.

69
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,031
Zeeland does a lot of business
in this area, we know it well.

70
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:38,392
We'll stay back and help where we can.

71
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:41,297
I should be there.

72
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:50,016
Do whatever the Norwegian
police tells you to do.

73
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:00,867
Did he say how long you have to drive?
-No, how is Carl?

74
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:04,773
He wants you to come soon so we could leave.

75
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,856
Give him a kiss. I'll call again soon.

76
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,457
Any news?

77
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:15,227
I have to go. Make sure we have a
helicopter and doctor waiting in Stavanger.

78
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,767
The kidnapper is in Norway.

79
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:22,856
The police have all the information they  need.

80
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,506
Thanks.

81
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,351
There's a lot of empty buildings and closed locations.

82
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:34,122
Because you moved everything overseas to Asia.

83
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,222
Come on, Carl.

84
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:45,254
We put as much press as we could
on the police to find Emilie.

85
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:47,654
Come on Carl, you should go to bed.

86
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:52,382
When all this is over, you
should take care of your family.

87
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,958
Maybe you don't care, but this is about us, not Zeeland.

88
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:59,595
It's your money and your business.

89
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:03,821
Do you think Robert is
going to be busy at work

90
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,164
to make more money when
Emilie is back home?

91
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:10,253
Carl, leave that ship alone, let's go.

92
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:18,014
Can you confirm that the police
are in Norway to find Emilie?

93
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,884
This is our final televised
debate, but if you're so eager to

94
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:24,017
know, the Minister of Justice will
be speaking about it tonight.

95
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,977
This isn't the first time the
PM has given us false hope.

96
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,130
He's putting up a smokescreen
in front of the case.

97
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,961
He'll need it if he wants to implement his crisis plan.

98
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:41,101
The PM can't achieve any of
his promises without Zeeland.

99
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:45,359
Zeeland has cut funding until Emilie is found.

100
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:50,576
All of the accusations you've
made have been proven false.

101
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,980
Nobody believes the deputy prosecutor
acted of his own volition.

102
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,533
Can you be more specific?

103
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:04,495
In a moment -- Rosa Lebech, what can you
draw from Ussing's criticism of Kamper?

104
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:07,414
We'll leave the dirty
work to everyone else.

105
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,750
That's probably how you get
all the important seats.

106
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:16,886
We want to support the one person who
is most in the middle politically.

107
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,911
It's as if you want the voters to think
the deal with Zeeland is certain.

108
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,005
We've been crystal clear about our deal with Zeeland.

109
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,631
Zeeland has threatened to
move its operations abroad.

110
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:31,281
Zeeland will not move abroad,
they're committed to contributing.

111
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,182
Time is up.

112
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,680
If everyone contributes, it will
bring only good things to Denmark.

113
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,801
We have every reason to believe we
will endure this crisis safely.

114
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,798
That was it. I thank you
all very much for coming.

115
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:50,053
Ussing's accusations are influencing the
voters, we're 2% behind in the polls.

116
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,159
And Norway?

117
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:58,448
The kidnapper is taking them to a container
with a decompression tank inside.

118
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:02,001
When will it be over?
-Hopefully soon.

119
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,899
He's cooperating and Zeuthen is
there to take his daughter home.

120
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,482
We can't wait.

121
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,376
Rosa Lebech and the Central Party had its chance.

122
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,745
I suggest we invite the right parties tonight to the ministry.

123
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,539
Did you find anything?
-No.

124
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:26,998
They're keys to a padlock. Not one
of his friends knows anything.

125
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,295
Well they fit somewhere!

126
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:34,413
Benjamin gave them to his girlfriend and
told her it had a backup of his pictures.

127
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,542
Can I see?
-We already know what it says.

128
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:42,732
Karen got money from Reinhard to
finance the campaign. It's nothing.

129
00:09:42,904 --> 00:09:46,692
Still, someone had all pictures deleted.
-That's Sally's explanation.

130
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:52,163
Their server provider was nearly bankrupt, other customers lost all their files.

131
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,728
Well I want to know what was in there, okay?

132
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:57,035
And someone knows what that key unlocks.

133
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:02,842
Yeah well tomorrow is the election, it has
nothing to do with Benjamin's suicide.

134
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:08,531
I'll figure it out. If it means so much
to  Kristian, we should find out.

135
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:26,177
Brix says 70 containers were sent
north from Stavanger.

136
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:30,974
One of them has to be on Loke's list of containers.

137
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:35,774
He planned it all on that ship?
-We have examined everything.

138
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:39,903
It won't matter if
he leads us to the girl.

139
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:47,618
Even if we find the container,
she may be dead already.

140
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:49,502
She should still be alive.

141
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:55,820
Suppose we find the container and she's still alive.

142
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,452
Will you let me move in with you?

143
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,412
That much you owe me.
Because of the deposit the other time.

144
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:07,863
I'm not going to live with anybody.
And you're married. And I ...

145
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:12,300
You just became a
grandmother, it's time.

146
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,760
You're sitting here whining and all I want
is to move into that little shack of yours.

147
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,616
That's not gonna happen.

148
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:26,097
I'm with Juncker. We have information
out of cell towers in Jutland.

149
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:30,940
There were 50 black cars on the road
that day, in addition to those in the booklet.

150
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,696
Germans and Poles and ...

151
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,937
We'll talk to them all.
Verify their alibis.

152
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:40,062
Are we sure of the date?
-Which date?

153
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:43,773
The report says Louise dissapeared
on April 21st...

154
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:48,620
Forget it. The deputy prosecutor
tampered with the date.

155
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:52,060
We need to look at April 20th.

156
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,784
What's going on over there?
Are you there yet?

157
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,668
Get in touch with the watchmakers.

158
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,960
Louise's dental injuries came from a watch.

159
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,220
Find out if any of the drivers
had any watches and what make.

160
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,625
But it could be any watch maker.

161
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,993
We're at Fossmark, where to now?

162
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:23,496
Can we stop? I want to smoke.

163
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,779
No stops until we get there.

164
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,697
You need to take a left soon
and then follow the coast.

165
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:34,036
And then for how long?
-Until the next fjord.

166
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,734
That's four hours away.

167
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:42,932
There's nothing on the map there.
-No. Wake me when we get there.

168
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,056
This is gonna work out.

169
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:56,134
My house may be small,
but it's not a barn. Really.

170
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,899
And we can always build.

171
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:16,297
Why's he taking us thru this wasteland?
-He worked out of Stavanger.

172
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:20,855
I got a quick brief about the landmarks.

173
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:28,622
It's a good idea to go on vacation with your family soon.

174
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,581
It'll have to be a lot more than just that.

175
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:35,818
Perhaps you won't think that way when
you get back from vacation.

176
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:40,933
I have promised Maja. And I will
speak to Gilsfort once we get home.

177
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:44,983
You can stay in the business and with the Children's Fund.

178
00:13:57,824 --> 00:13:59,576
What's going on?
What's gonna happen, Robert?

179
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:05,494
Nothing. Nothing's happening.

180
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,542
How's it going?
-We're driving up the coast.

181
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:11,616
And Carl?
May I wish him goodnight?

182
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:16,778
He's fast asleep already. The nanny is
there, while I go back to the office.

183
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:22,382
I'll power the phone off to save battery.
I'll call if something happens.

184
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:26,253
Take care of yourself.
You can call me on my cell.

185
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,064
Friday, November 18
10.37 am

186
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:42,261
day 10
ls election day a celebration for the Prime Minister?

187
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,018
Any election is cause for celebration.

188
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:50,816
What are the consequences if the girl
is not found? Is she trapped in a tank?

189
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,018
How much further do
they have to go?

190
00:14:55,184 --> 00:15:00,861
Only the kidnapper knows. The parties you
talked to are awaiting further developments.

191
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:05,256
Why don't I hear anything from Karen?
-Hopefully she's doing well.

192
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:09,975
Ussing's still there. Let's wait.
-I'm not waiting for Ussing.

193
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:15,020
Shall I drop it?

194
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:19,853
You will be allowed to photograph
the Prime Minister.

195
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:23,255
It's annoying that we vote
at the same place.

196
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,939
It's just a little cozy in here.
A good day to you.

197
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:32,019
Likewise. Enjoy the day.
It's your last as prime minister.

198
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:44,133
I'm in the voting booth. I hope
you found out more about the keys.

199
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,579
I'll call later. I still
don't have anything.

200
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:50,623
Did you go to his friends?
-Yes. I thought I'd try.

201
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:56,302
He had bought a lock. But he said that
was for the place where he played basketball.

202
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,295
He didn't play basketball.

203
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,854
Have you voted?
-Did you hear anything further?

204
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:05,494
He's unsure of who to vote for.

205
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:12,336
Yes, now you can.
-And we don't get a photo?

206
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,064
What are you doing?
You still need to win votes.

207
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,740
Karen has found a place where the key may fit.

208
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:23,658
Close to where he died.
Postpone all appointments.

209
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:30,213
What does the kidnapper say?
-It's a green container. No. 67678.

210
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:32,944
Why can't you find it?

211
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:37,461
Borch's asking the chief here where we
should be. I'll call you back.

212
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:39,376
What did he say?

213
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:43,901
What did he say?
-The container was picked up.

214
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:45,816
And besides that?

215
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:48,976
Where's the girl?

216
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:55,693
If he does that again, we go home.

217
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,014
He won't.

218
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:03,861
These are the shipments from last night and
this morning, listed by ship and road.

219
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,935
Our container is amongst them.

220
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:07,901
Where is it?

221
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:12,413
We have a schedule. It's in your own
best interest to keep it.

222
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:21,782
He could go to a quieter place, but
this is indeed faster.

223
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:26,415
Who transported it? Name a name or company, or I'll strike you again.

224
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:30,543
We must follow the fjord.
Then we go sailing.

225
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,855
Sailing? Where to?
-Back up.

226
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,812
We need a boat.

227
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,702
Sailing? What does he want?

228
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:54,780
He didn't think the container would be picked up.
I think we're close.

229
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:00,500
Maja Zeuthen can not reach her ​​husband.
She wants to talk to him.

230
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:06,296
Make sure that Zeuthen calls home.
And figure out what's in the fjord.

231
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:28,942
We had business in the fjord.

232
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:33,063
If you look at his file you'll
know he knows his way around here.

233
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:37,900
Where else are containers picked up?
-There are some small harbors.

234
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:42,023
If we look at the end of the fjord,
we'll be late for any other place.

235
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:45,938
He said that we are safe, believe it.

236
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,177
What's happening there?

237
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:51,700
Where are you calling for?
-The mother wants to speak to Zeuthen.

238
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,493
Send her to Brix and go
to those watch shops.

239
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:57,575
That's why I'm calling.

240
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:03,694
None of the car drivers have been to
a watch specialist. Only Reinhardt.

241
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:07,334
I saw it on a credit card printout.

242
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:13,579
The Monday right after the murder of
Louise, Reinhardt bought a new watch.

243
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:18,054
But he couldn't do it if he was at the hotel.

244
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,660
Are you certain he bought a watch?

245
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,975
The shop owner remembered him.

246
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:29,183
Where are you sailing to?
And don't hang up again.

247
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:37,380
Loke identified the spot.
It's an abandoned oil terminal.

248
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:45,783
Was that hotel data checked thoroughly?
-Why?

249
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:52,417
Reinhardt bought shortly after the murder
a watch. I want to be sure of his alibi.

250
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,540
There is no doubt.

251
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:59,494
He came in the afternoon, went to his room,
and checked out the following morning.

252
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,894
But his car was in the child's book.

253
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:06,023
The deputy prosecutor tampered
with the date in the report.

254
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,017
It must be because of that booklet.

255
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:13,655
He acknowledged that his
watch broke two years ago.

256
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:18,579
He couldn't have tampered with
the electronic lock's data.

257
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,383
Here we are.

258
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,022
It takes a little longer in Norway.
They are now in the fjord.

259
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:51,698
Damn.
What's going on?

260
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:54,822
We are unfortunately dependent
on the kidnapper.

261
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,689
We are screwed with the other
parties until Emilie is returned.

262
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:03,132
Tell your brother when he is
drawing up his next ministry list

263
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,119
to put me as Minister of Finance.

264
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,666
I hope no photographers are lurking
about, you don't want to be seen here.

265
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,045
Find a door with a padlock.

266
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,390
We have no feasible option
for a support party!

267
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:36,031
What are we doing here?
There's no padlocks.

268
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,262
<i>WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM</i>

269
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:15,075
<i>Government collision course</i>

270
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,503
Okay I see something here.

271
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:22,975
Reinhard gives Karen Zeeland money.
She shakes hands and thanks him.

272
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,715
Someone's been in here
searching through his things.

273
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,511
Who? The door was locked.

274
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,037
Well someone came to
remove these pictures.

275
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,330
There has to be something
else that explains it all.

276
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:44,087
There's nothing here but the
conspiracy theories from his head.

277
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:47,838
He took that stuff seriously,
but it's not why he died.

278
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:01,201
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

279
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,317
Karen have everything boxed up.

280
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:05,638
We'll find a support party.

281
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:09,142
Ask them how long they want to
wait for good news from Norway.

282
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:14,459
And the buildings next to the terminal?

283
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:20,859
We are working on it. What about the
hotel? Nobody saw Reinhardt ...

284
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:25,142
It's being checked. Are we looking for a
green container?

285
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:29,013
Is there anything on
the garage or his watch?

286
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:32,256
We put that line of inquiry on hold.

287
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:35,461
Hedeby is coming
and Maja Zeuthen is still waiting.

288
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:39,981
We need to have that alibi retraced.
-I will.

289
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:46,492
Maja wants to talk to Robert Zeuthen.
Get him on your mobile.

290
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:49,622
Robert, can you hear me?

291
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:54,175
We are still looking for her.
I have to hang up now.

292
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:58,622
I know what you took out of the closet.

293
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:04,700
I gotta go.
-What do you want it for?

294
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:09,097
What was that?

295
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:12,176
What was that just now?

296
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:25,896
Nothing really.
-We are still looking.

297
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:32,139
We looked everywhere. It's gone.
He tricked us.

298
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,297
Here he comes.

299
00:25:55,264 --> 00:26:02,136
You promised to give her to me.
-And you said you would punish the killer.

300
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:06,820
You had a container shipped.
You led us here.

301
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:11,136
So we didn't find the girl sooner.

302
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:16,977
Tell me where she is. Come on.

303
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:22,355
Why would I do that? You don't want
my daughter's murder to be solved.

304
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,628
Why are you letting him go?

305
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,447
I had him.

306
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:34,835
And the one chance I
had, you took him away.

307
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:44,096
If you are lucky, there is still
a little time to find her.

308
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,514
But tell me honestly,

309
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,000
how did you do it?

310
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:59,998
Did what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

311
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,372
So you have no idea.

312
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,824
If he does, he will be punished.

313
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:07,969
Why should I believe you?

314
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:09,752
Because I-

315
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:14,816
Zeuthen, calm down.

316
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:18,101
Now you tell me where she is!
-Calm down.

317
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:20,016
Where is she?

318
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:24,854
I know exactly how you feel.

319
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:28,016
Zeuthen, put that gun down.

320
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,618
If you do, we find her again.

321
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,702
Think!

322
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,536
Put the gun down.

323
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:58,060
Put the gun down. Listen to me.

324
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,192
No come on, stay with me.

325
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,591
Why? Why did you do that?

326
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,930
Come on, why?

327
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,424
I had to, I thought...

328
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,500
The Medea.

329
00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:07,494
What did he say? Did he say where Emilie is?

330
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:11,862
What happened? Is he dead?

331
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:16,495
How could you have
authorized that trip?

332
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,017
Tell me what's going on.

333
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:22,143
The kidnapper is dead.
We need people on the Medea.

334
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:25,758
There's nothing on that ship,
it's going to be scrapped.

335
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,561
If the ship is in port,
the kidnapper could have

336
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,717
used that boat to hide
Emilie Zeuthen there.

337
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,783
Find out if the ship is still there.

338
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:37,946
Has the girl been found or not?
-I don't know.

339
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:43,106
I hope we get some good news
before the polls close.

340
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:49,782
The latest polls. I'm going to coordinate
the dinner while we still have a party.

341
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:54,854
If I were you, I'd rebuild bridges
with Lebech and the Center Party.

342
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:57,697
I'm not on my knees yet.

343
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:01,361
She's calling again. We've worked
so hard, will you take the call?

344
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:04,431
I don't have the time to do it.

345
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,035
I'll be brief.

346
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:11,159
We'll support Ussing unless you come
up with something good for us.

347
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,535
We want a greater role, and at least
as many posts as your own ministers.

348
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:21,659
A strong alliance is in your best interest.

349
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,537
This is just blackmail.

350
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,417
You should have thought of that
before you tossed me aside.

351
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:32,051
Hello? Kristian?

352
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,219
What did she say?
-Any news of Mogens?

353
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,773
But we need to talk.
-Not now.

354
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:39,684
Is Kristoffer gone?

355
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,227
Have the IT people look at this.

356
00:30:42,953 --> 00:30:44,073
I'll take care of it.

357
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,162
When we were there I asked
some of the basketball

358
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,128
players if they had seen
anything back then.

359
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,976
I gave them my card.

360
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:54,894
One of them saw something
because he just called.

361
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:59,497
He called because he
recognized someone there today.

362
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,938
We have to wait here.

363
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,119
I want to help with the search.

364
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,806
You should wait here.

365
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:21,568
The ship is still here, we've searched
half of it and she hasn't turned up yet.

366
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:24,443
<i>She should be there, search the whole ship.</i>

367
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:26,645
I am, there's nothing here.

368
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:33,162
<i>She's somewhere she can't be heard.</i>

369
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,230
<i>Maybe the cargo hold, or a cooling room.</i>

370
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,098
We have already looked.

371
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:38,946
<i>Then check again.</i>

372
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,744
<i>The kidnapper said she could still be
saved, it's probably an unlikely place.</i>

373
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,968
<i>A place he knew where she wouldn't-</i>

374
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,191
Is she there?

375
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,139
<i>She is here, but...</i>

376
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:09,707
<i>28-1 here. Asbjørn's coming
up but he needs help.</i>

377
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:32,088
Emilie, mommy's here.

378
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:34,474
Wake up.

379
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,870
Wake up my sweetheart, wake up.

380
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,694
Maja? What's going on there?

381
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:09,053
Wake up, sweetie.

382
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:24,299
She's here. She's alive. She's here.

383
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:33,942
I'll be there as soon as I can.

384
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:50,382
Thank you, Brix.

385
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,120
Robert knows he broke the law and
he's really sorry about what he did.

386
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:21,988
I'd like to ask the Norwegian police
to allow him to return by plane.

387
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:23,838
That's fine.

388
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,097
I'll take care of the formalities.

389
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:39,252
It just may be him.

390
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,804
We'll go investigate.

391
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:44,027
The hotel and their lock system.

392
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:48,685
He went around acting as
the protector of orphans-

393
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:52,762
He has for years. All over the world. And he still does.

394
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:04,326
A happy end to the kidnapping case
is good new for the government.

395
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,395
The news of Emilie returning
home is definitely good news.

396
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:12,838
It's gone reasonably well with her.

397
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:18,653
I have to say that the police and PET have done a good job.

398
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:26,339
The rumors of Zeeland pulling its support
for the government have been quashed.

399
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,952
According to exit polls, in the
last few hours massive numbers

400
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:31,255
of voters have turned out to
vote for the ruling party.

401
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,515
We've achieved a big victory.

402
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:40,744
Rosa Lebech just called, but now they are
all falling in line and want to talk.

403
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:47,577
You were in Benjamin's room on the day
he died. You were recognized.

404
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:49,257
What were you doing there?

405
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,102
Answer me.

406
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:54,423
Nothing happened.

407
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:59,214
I was tipped off about those pictures.
They could have been misconstrued.

408
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:03,696
They could have hurt us.
-What kind of tip?

409
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:08,858
I explained to him, it might hurt us
should the photos become public.

410
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:12,334
He threw me out and I prevented the
pictures from being published.

411
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,893
Who asked you to go there?

412
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,503
It was Mogens.

413
00:36:20,664 --> 00:36:24,896
Mogens said PET had discovered
the photos on that server.

414
00:36:25,064 --> 00:36:27,976
That's what they do for us, right?

415
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,899
Mogens wanted me with him when they
started talking, so we kept you out of it.

416
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:37,216
Have you searched the room?
-No. Nothing more happened.

417
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:40,535
Did you or Mogens know where he was?
-Mogens.

418
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:45,494
I would have told you everything,
but Benjamin died the next day.

419
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,258
And then it didn't matter anymore.

420
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:56,620
You're nothing to me.
Absolutely nothing.

421
00:36:56,784 --> 00:37:00,572
Maybe you should take a
long look at yourself.

422
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:04,259
I kept my mouth shut
to spare you.

423
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:09,657
It's not my fault you were
a bad parent.

424
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,940
I haven't failed.

425
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,580
We need to talk.

426
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:21,534
The IT department took a look at the
USB stick. There are tons of photos.

427
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:27,574
Benjamin took those pictures of Reinhardt
and me, but they are not interesting.

428
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:32,613
He followed Reinhardt
after I left him.

429
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:38,097
Maybe he wanted to find out
who he was. But then he had enough.

430
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:42,542
But he takes a picture, the importance
of which he does never know.

431
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:56,698
We need to go over Reinhardt's garage
again, and his old watch. We ...

432
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,174
As long as his alibi stands,
we can't do anything of the sort.

433
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,950
His alibi needs to be reexamined,
he may have been there earlier.

434
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,058
I have a printout from the hotel.

435
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:12,397
Reinhardt had room 108 and the lock
recorded when he came and went.

436
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,462
You gave me permission to continue
with the case, I'll go to the hotel-

437
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:26,655
The investigation is closed and management
wants you to start your job with OPA.

438
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:31,202
The trail is cold and things are different
now that the kidnapper is dead.

439
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:36,882
We have no evidence. And even if
you're right we can't touch him.

440
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,405
In the eyes of the law
that means he is innocent.

441
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:46,953
Do you get what I'm saying?
There's nothing I can do.

442
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:50,719
<i>The man is covered by
Zeeland's team of lawyers.</i>

443
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,428
I can't seem to get my
boss to go to bat for me.

444
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:06,244
Everyone in my department
considers his alibi water tight.

445
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:13,073
There's no way to know
if it was Reinhardt.

446
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:16,651
It might as well have been a car that
is long gone and out of the country.

447
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:20,069
We've found Emilie Zeuthen. You found her.

448
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:23,536
That's what this was all about.

449
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,862
I've taken care of the formalities,
thanks again for everything.

450
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,942
I've called for a taxi and we have a
plane waiting at a nearby airport.

451
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:35,816
You can come with, but
we have to leave now.

452
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:38,153
You can ride with us.
-Fine.

453
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,646
We'll say goodbye and then go.

454
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:47,542
We'll have a party soon.

455
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:52,101
The head of PET had to go to the Justice Ministry.

456
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:55,638
That should reduce the tension around here.

457
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:58,978
I'm sorry for getting mad.

458
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:03,302
You know me.

459
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:07,814
Is there something I should know?

460
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,600
Only that in six months the chief is leaving.

461
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:20,971
You'd look good in a uniform.

462
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,510
Royal Prince Hotel, Esbjerg.

463
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:37,294
I'm calling on behalf of Zeeland. I'm
Niels Reinhardt's secretary.

464
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:42,982
I want to book a room for him, but
I forgot which one he wants.

465
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:48,502
That's easy. Mr. Reinhardt always
takes 312, overlooking the sea.

466
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:51,019
Which dates do you need?

467
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,020
Which dates do you need?

468
00:40:55,824 --> 00:41:01,342
Are you sure it was 312?
I thought he said 108.

469
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:08,182
Mr. Reinhardt has come here for years and
always asks for room 312. Hold on.

470
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:14,374
I'm looking in our system. Oddly enough,
a few years ago he stayed in 108.

471
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:16,182
Why is that weird?

472
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:21,293
That is a lesser room. We always take
good care of the bosses.

473
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:25,537
What do you mean by 'bosses'?
-The upper echelon of Zeeland.

474
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,461
Thanks again for your efforts.

475
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:54,347
No thanks necessary.

476
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,239
You can save your greetings
for headquarters.

477
00:42:00,181 --> 00:42:03,681
The votes are not counted, but I'd
still like you congratulate you, eh?

478
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:12,142
Do not tell me this is the first
time you've seen this picture.

479
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:19,973
You knew all along what Zeuthen's
assistant had done it.

480
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:26,138
You let the deputy prosecutor cover up
the murder and involved PET.

481
00:42:26,304 --> 00:42:29,740
You found out that my son
had taken pictures.

482
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:33,101
You notified Zeeland,
who erased them from the server.

483
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,668
Kristoffer told me PET told you about the pictures.

484
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:40,654
What happened to my son?

485
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:43,191
Well?

486
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:48,372
Perhaps the minister can explain it better...
-What happened to him?

487
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:51,978
Answer me!

488
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:57,859
Intelligence knew were the box was.

489
00:42:58,024 --> 00:43:03,894
We went to search through them, but he
ran out of the house when we arrived.

490
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:07,852
My people tried to explain what they
were doing there.

491
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:12,859
But he ran into the backyard
and then along the track.

492
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:18,098
We tried to call him back,
but he wouldn't listen.

493
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:22,735
He was beside himself.
He never saw the train.

494
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:27,578
You killed him.

495
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,700
It was an accident.

496
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,620
It was not my decision to go there.

497
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:47,582
It is extremely unfortunate...

498
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:51,622
and sad what happened to your son.

499
00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:55,982
But we had already been cleaning
up his messes for him...

500
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:59,693
after he had ran around
Jutland in your car.

501
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:03,220
And that picture is much more important ...

502
00:44:03,384 --> 00:44:07,855
You can explain that to a judge.
Kristian, come on, let's go.

503
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:11,653
Listen. The economic
crisis was at its worst.

504
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:17,501
A baseless accusation against a
man who embodies Zeeland ...

505
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:19,655
we couldn't use it.

506
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:25,296
Unsubstantiated accusations? This
photo proves that he is the murderer.

507
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:29,252
That photo proves nothing.

508
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:34,418
And Zeeland said that making such
accusations wouldn't be forgiven.

509
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,461
Who said that?

510
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:43,062
I had to make a choice
and I did the right thing.

511
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,773
Reinhardt has an alibi
and the case is closed.

512
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:54,223
Why go into such trouble for an orphan
girl that nobody will miss?

513
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:58,256
Let's get going.

514
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:03,937
We won't make it without Zeeland.

515
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:09,053
With their support, you won the election
back then, like you will win this one.

516
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:14,462
We'll first go to the police
and show them the photo.

517
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:17,616
Then we go back before Mogens can clean up.

518
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:23,461
We call on the party leadership together
and explain how you weren't involved...

519
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,297
and everything will come to light.

520
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:28,978
Congratulations on the victory.

521
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:33,301
With some luck you can
form the government tomorrow.

522
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:37,582
You should issue warrants for the
Minister and to the PET...

523
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:41,453
so the whole thing can be
brought to justice.

524
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,816
The photo proves nothing by itself.

525
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:52,059
What are you talking about?

526
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:56,422
It was in the best interest of the country.
It was an accident.

527
00:45:56,584 --> 00:45:58,336
You need to hear yourself.

528
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:05,816
Benjamin had it hard.
We should not stir this up.

529
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:08,214
That's exactly what they want.

530
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:14,980
That you swallow their filth because
you won the election.

531
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:22,463
I'll get a car and then we'll go, okay?

532
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:45,779
I'm on my way, I'll be there as soon as I can.
How is she?

533
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:49,380
The doctors examined her and she'll make it.

534
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:53,856
It'll be nice for the four of us
to go away.

535
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:56,777
It will certainly be great.

536
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:11,496
Robert, how great! The management and
board of directors are very happy for you.

537
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:15,339
Tell me if Reinhardt killed the girl.

538
00:47:15,504 --> 00:47:18,940
On the way home I called our lawyer.

539
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,653
You talked to him when Reinhardt
was still a suspect.

540
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:25,657
The lawyer said he had no alibi.

541
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:30,338
Shortly after your conversation
he suddenly has an alibi.

542
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,506
From our own hotel chain.

543
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:37,479
I understand your reaction.

544
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:40,568
Did Reinhardt kill the girl?

545
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:50,457
To be honest, I don't know.
But there is no reason to believe it.

546
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:56,733
After all, he was your father's assistant.
And we already had enough crises.

547
00:47:56,904 --> 00:47:58,462
Get out.

548
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:03,975
Pack your stuff and get out
before I throw you on your ass.

549
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:07,262
You won't.

550
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:12,181
First, you will find no evidence.

551
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:15,416
Second, you can't risk a scandal.

552
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:20,055
It will destroy everything
your family has built.

553
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:23,341
The same goes for your decision to leave.

554
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:27,577
Look at the bright side.
You gout your daughter and Maja back.

555
00:48:27,744 --> 00:48:31,976
The government has won the election.
The board supports you.

556
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:37,502
You can postpone the company's relocation
to a time that suits you.

557
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,054
It's time for Reinhardt to retire.

558
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:47,977
Spend a long weekend with your family.

559
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:53,138
Then come Monday we can talk about
the future, shall we?

560
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:12,707
You should be here. Mark
and Eve are doing so well.

561
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:14,898
Alright mom.

562
00:49:15,116 --> 00:49:17,216
Are you with Mathias Borch?

563
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:21,041
Tell him hello, come home soon.

564
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,280
I'll put Mark on.

565
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:33,222
She's so sweet.

566
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:38,283
She sleeps a lot of course, but I was
 would be okay to stay until-

567
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:41,126
Of course, of course,
and congratulations.

568
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,393
I forgot to text you pictures.

569
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,439
It's okay.

570
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:52,571
<i>I'm needed again, we'll talk later.</i>

571
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,420
I'm really looking
forward to seeing her.

572
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:04,368
Did a little one just arrive?

573
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,850
I spoke to the airport,
the plane is ready.

574
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,188
I'm looking for where I should park.

575
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:49,579
You must have wondered about the
alibi that appeared yesterday.

576
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:55,459
Someone at Zeeland has ensured
it seemed like you were in room 108.

577
00:50:55,624 --> 00:50:59,822
That way the electronic lock would
establish your alibi.

578
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:04,580
You never were in room 108.
You always take room 312.

579
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:10,262
You killed Louise Hjelby.

580
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:14,778
And she wasn't the first, was she?

581
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:22,055
Justice will be served.

582
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:26,021
Justice will be served.
I will make sure of it.

583
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:41,624
I don't think so. Otherwise we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

584
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:48,136
But I admire your perseverance,
diligence and decency.

585
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:51,853
These are qualities that
I appreciate... greatly.

586
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:59,138
I appreciate you have reminded me of those
things. You've taught me a lot.

587
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:03,183
I'll take them to heart.

588
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:10,576
But now we must go.

589
00:53:10,904 --> 00:53:12,462
What have you done?

590
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:25,296
Jump in the car.
Jump in the car, dammit.

591
00:53:32,704 --> 00:53:36,697
Okay. We'll say he tried something.

592
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:40,015
He went for your gun and then
you had no choice but to...

593
00:53:43,184 --> 00:53:45,778
Goddamn it, Sarah.

594
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:48,299
He said he did it.

595
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:50,182
He murdered her.

596
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,696
He did.

597
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:07,059
Take off your coat and wipe the blood off.
Listen to me.

598
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:11,255
Nobody expects us until the plane lands.

599
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:16,020
I'll think of something to say here,
that'll give you a few hours.

600
00:54:17,584 --> 00:54:20,257
You tell the pilot ... Do you hear me?

601
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,621
Tell the pilot to fly you to Reykjavik.

602
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:28,016
And from Reykjavik go straight
somewhere else.

603
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:30,698
Some place with lots of people.

604
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:34,573
You need a security pass to go abroad.

605
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:38,817
ln Reykjavik you say that your
husband works for PET.

606
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:45,776
You are visiting a sick aunt, but you
left your passport at home.

607
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:50,256
That way it tracks as me travelling.
And they can contact me directly.

608
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,177
Also, you should take my
children's health insurance cards.

609
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:02,023
Take your coat off, dammit!

610
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:08,014
This is not a good plan.

611
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:11,654
If you don't make waves, you'll
get by for years.

612
00:55:11,824 --> 00:55:14,019
They trust statements made by PET.

613
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:25,543
Sarah, for fucks's sake
why did you do it?

614
00:55:28,864 --> 00:55:32,140
If you think he has done this before ...

615
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:37,178
this was your chance to prove it.

616
00:55:38,744 --> 00:55:41,383
Find something.

617
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:44,502
Find something and then come back.

618
00:55:48,104 --> 00:55:53,178
You return and then it'll be alright.
Sweetheart. It'll be alright.

619
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:22,743
I'll let headquarters know
we are leaving.

620
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:25,054
And when I come back, be gone.

621
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:28,022
Okay, sweetheart?

621
00:56:29,305 --> 00:57:29,300

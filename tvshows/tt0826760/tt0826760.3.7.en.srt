1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,719
The police are searching for Robert
Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,039
who disappeared earlier this evening
from her home.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,079
What are you doing to find her?

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,239
- Sarah Lund. Who is this?
- The girl's all right.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,599
I'm collecting on a debt.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,079
I have a suggestion - a life for a life.
I'll get Zeuthen, you'll get the girl.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,959
Emilie! No!

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,239
The perpetrator listened to you.
You made him think twice.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,879
- I saw him shoot her.
- Did you?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,719
Sarah Lund, Juncker and Borch
have gone to Jutland.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
The perpetrator may have spared Emilie.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,279
He won't finish until he knows
what happened back then.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
- We don't know what happened.
- He shot her and threw her in the water.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,719
- I can't feel it.
- And the investigation in Jutland?

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,239
We haven't found anything to show
that your daughter is alive.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,279
You could say that mourning
is love without a home.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,119
Don't!
Let me out, damn it!

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,039
I've decided to resign
as Prime Minister.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,599
The assistant public prosecutor
had another meeting that day.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,159
- I won't argue over Emilie's grave.
- They say she may still be alive.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,959
The investigation is ongoing.
Ussing's affairs are being checked.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,639
I'm siding with Ussing.
I hope you understand.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,919
The public prosecutor was reluctant,
but Ussing insisted strongly.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,759
Step down of your own accord
or we'll have to withdraw our support.

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,839
We're looking for someone
who may have been close to Louise.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,999
- She only had us.
- Did anyone else see her that day?

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,279
One of your colleagues called to ask
about the same things an hour ago.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,559
Why would the perpetrator
use your name, if he doesn't know you?

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,159
- Was Special Branch involved in this?
- I wasn't involved in that case.

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,759
- Why don't you believe me?
- What are you talking about?

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,359
You shut everyone out.
Me, us, your son.

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,399
No one's allowed into your life.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,479
Her bike got broken that morning.
I think that's why she got a lift.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,319
There was a man in a black car.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,479
Those are all his notebooks.
He's crazy about car registrations.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,639
- Where does that road lead?
- To a closed boat builder's yard.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,279
That looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.
This is where she was taken.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,159
Borch took the boy's book with
licence plate numbers this morning.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,239
It was you and Special Branch who erased
everything about the black car.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,359
- I'm not discussing this.
- Why is that book important?

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,199
THE KILLING III

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,799
Tell Ruth Hedeby
that the case is wide open.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
We're not closing anything.
Call those who've taken time off, back in.

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,079
The resources will be there when
management sees what I've just seen.

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,279
- They didn't find anything in Jutland.
- Then send the men out again.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,799
Ask the local police to keep searching
for Emilie, and coordinate it with Lund.

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,479
Give them all the help they need.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,039
Call the Zeuthens
in for an urgent briefing.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,999
Asbjørn is asking for reinforcements.
They've traced the perpetrator.

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,279
Asbjørn, what's happening?

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,319
Lund and Borch have tracked him down.
We're on our way there.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,999
It didn't sound good.
They're not in control.

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,639
- What's the problem?
- Apparently they're trapped inside.

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,839
I don't know what happened,
but we're on our way.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,199
Yes? What's up?

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,519
Push the book under the door,
then I'll spare you.

58
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,159
He wants the book.

59
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,719
Give that to me.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,639
Listen, we don't have that book.
People are on their way here.

61
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,199
Turn the damn car engine off.
Do you hear me? Hello?

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,999
Hello!

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,319
No, you do it.

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,119
You do it, and then get me out.

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,839
Go!
We don't have time for this.

66
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,079
Drop the gun.

67
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,239
The book.

68
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,279
The police and Special Branch
have traced the perpetrator in Jutland,

69
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,479
but you need to focus on the meeting
with the party committee.

70
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,119
Listen, Kamper... Kamper?

71
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,959
Kamper, I just want to say...
I've just heard about the meeting.

72
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,559
I will of course back you up.

73
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,719
The Treasurer will undoubtedly try
to put you in a bad light.

74
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,679
She's tried to sway some of
the others ahead of the meeting.

75
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,479
It doesn't matter what she's done,
there won't be any meeting.

76
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,439
We're looking into
important information

77
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,519
that will clear the government of
all suspicion, and you arrange this?

78
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,599
As a Minister and a party member,
you're responsible to me alone.

79
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
So, go and tell your people that
you're sorry to have wasted their time.

80
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,719
- What information?
- I'm not getting into that.

81
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,079
But according to a witness,

82
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,359
it was Ussing who put pressure
on the prosecutor then.

83
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,959
- What witness?
- One of Ussing's former staff members.

84
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,439
Special Branch are looking into his affairs.
I can't give you any more details.

85
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,319
- Of course. Hopefully it isn't Seifert.
- Do you take us for complete idiots?

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,599
Everyone knows he was reported for
stealing from Ussing's campaign budget.

87
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,439
Well... That doesn't matter.
If it's true...

88
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,199
Regardless, it should be investigated.
I've asked Special Branch...

89
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,639
Unless Emilie has come back to life,
the meeting will begin in a minute,

90
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,359
with or without you.

91
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,119
- I'll contact the Ministry of Justice.
- Do that. I was about to suggest it.

92
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,199
- How the hell did he get away?
- I don't know.

93
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,959
- They're still looking for him.
- You were right. Emilie wasn't shot.

94
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,359
She wasn't there.
They're searching his car for clues.

95
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,839
- What the hell have you found then?
- Louise Hjelby's crime scene.

96
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,759
It seems she was picked up by her killer
in a black car on her way home.

97
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,599
He took her to an old boat builder's yard,
where she was held captive and abused.

98
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,799
- Then he faked a suicide in the harbour.
- And the perpetrator found this place?

99
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,119
He's trying to find whoever did it,
with a notebook he's acquired.

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,279
- What notebook?
- A boy was writing down licence plates.

101
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,239
The perpetrator
took the book from Borch.

102
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,199
- The Zeuthens have just arrived.
- How did Borch get that book?

103
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,639
You'll have to ask Borch
or Special Branch about that.

104
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,159
There was a reason.
I'd like to explain.

105
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,439
I don't want...

106
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,319
We've searched the dunes
and the beach with a team of dogs.

107
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,279
- They lost the scent by the stream.
- He's on foot. He's wounded.

108
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,239
They think he followed the stream inland.
There are large wetlands but it's dark...

109
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,799
I didn't help stop the investigation.

110
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,639
Send his blood to the lab
and have them test for matching DNA.

111
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,839
- And the car?
- They don't think she was in the car.

112
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,719
The dogs didn't even react.

113
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,079
We'll return to Copenhagen.

114
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,919
The notebook is likely to lead him
in that direction.

115
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,199
I couldn't have done it differently.

116
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,439
- I've told you everything.
- Who did you cover for?

117
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,839
I can't say anything before it's cleared.
It wouldn't make a difference.

118
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,079
Let me explain.
Why are you?

119
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,599
We're not just talking about
a single error.

120
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,519
From your relationship with Rosa
Lebech and a jilted ex-husband,

121
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,759
who leaks confidential material,
to the handling of the Zeuthen case.

122
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,479
You've ignored all warnings and haven't
called the Justice Minister to account.

123
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,839
The Ministry of Justice
is not to blame.

124
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,159
You're taking
the Zeuthen case personally,

125
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,679
and undermining
the party's credibility.

126
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,319
You must understand the situation,
you've put us in.

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,919
We owe it to the electorate,
and not least to the Zeuthens.

128
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,199
It's not up to the party
to remove the Prime Minister.

129
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,519
No Prime Minister has survived for long
without his party's backing.

130
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,719
What kind of party are we, if we
have nothing better to do than this?

131
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,559
Yes, our credibility, our future and
our standing with Zeeland are at stake,

132
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,239
the basis of our financial rescue plan,
but you know where I stand.

133
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,799
In spite of what the Treasurer's been
telling you about me, this is useless.

134
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,639
You chose me because you had faith.
I need that faith right now.

135
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,399
That won't bring Emilie back to life.
So you're not open to reason

136
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,199
and would rather have the party
fight a destructive internal war?

137
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,319
Then I'll call the business committee...
Please sit down so we can decide this.

138
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,759
Excuse me,
it's news from my department.

139
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,199
I'm not entirely up to date.

140
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,679
The police have salvaged what they
thought was the body of Emilie Zeuthen.

141
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,639
He apparently shot a duffel bag
rather than Emilie.

142
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,599
Clearly, we're only talking
about material damage.

143
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,239
This is indeed a joyful message.
So, if no one has any objections,

144
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,319
we'll have to conclude that events
have overtaken our discussion here.

145
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,559
It's even clearer in this one.

146
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,999
The perpetrator escaped, and there are
no signs that Emilie was in Jutland.

147
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,359
- The good news is, she may be alive.
- Has Zeuthen been informed?

148
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,999
Yes, he's at police HQ.
What happened?

149
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,039
We need to speak with Special Branch.

150
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,559
The witness must be taken seriously.
I want to know Ussing's involvement.

151
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
He's with Special Branch
but there's trouble.

152
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,199
How so?

153
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,919
The police accused Special Branch
of keeping information

154
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,399
from them in the old case.

155
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,919
Special Branch said
they didn't know about it.

156
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,519
I don't know what it's about.

157
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,479
But regarding the Treasurer,
you have every reason to be angry.

158
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,039
I'd just like you to let it slide.
No more trouble now.

159
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,319
Call the head of Special Branch in
to explain.

160
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,439
The current took the bag out into the
fjord where we found it 12 metres down.

161
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,839
The umbrella anchor made it sink, in spite
of the buoyancy of the other materials.

162
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,479
The bullets
went through bag and contents,

163
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,279
and match the calibre
used by the perp.

164
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,079
I wish I could answer
the questions that this raises but...

165
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,399
She's alive.

166
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,519
He was traced to Jutland, but there
are no signs Emilie was with him.

167
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,959
So far, her trail ends at the boat
in Copenhagen harbour.

168
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,399
We've intensified the search,
but as I've said, nothing is certain.

169
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,399
I have to warn you against...

170
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,599
Brief our head of security and all
other security staff on the matter.

171
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,199
No, we'll manage our own search,
and it begins right now.

172
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,399
I understand your frustration,
but you can't interfere in the search.

173
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,079
- We've wasted 48 hours.
- They weren't wasted.

174
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,319
We were about to tell our boy
that his sister was dead. Understand?

175
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,599
I apologise for our mistake,

176
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,359
but you'll only complicate matters
if you interfere.

177
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,879
This is not the right way.

178
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,399
I can explain. The girl was found dead
in that harbour in Jutland.

179
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,679
The local police found a notebook with
licence plates, and we were informed.

180
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,279
You told me Special Branch
weren't aware of the case. Correct?

181
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,159
Yes, and that was a mistake.
We didn't know all the details.

182
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,839
We were only interested in the book,

183
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,159
because the PM's campaign car
was in it.

184
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,079
- Excuse me, what?
- Your campaign car's licence plate.

185
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,359
We knew you had nothing to do with it,
but we kept an eye on the case.

186
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,639
- My car? I don't quite understand.
- During your last election campaign.

187
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,879
You went all over the country,

188
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,399
and your campaign car
was noted in the boy's book.

189
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,439
The public prosecutor told us
the case was solved. It was a suicide.

190
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,279
We had no idea that the book
was important until now.

191
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,679
The prosecutor covered up a murder -
what difference does the book make?

192
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,959
The other numbers are interesting,

193
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,639
not least because Anders Ussing's car
was also listed.

194
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,319
I was wrong to say we didn't know
about the case. It's regrettable.

195
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,999
What exactly does it mean,
that Ussing is listed in that book?

196
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,119
In light of the prosecutor's negligence
and the testimony you pointed out,

197
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,279
it is something
that we're keeping a keen eye on.

198
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,439
- As a suspect?
- It's a possibility.

199
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,839
Right now we're focusing
on finding the perpetrator.

200
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,999
The book won't be of much use to him.
It only contains car registrations.

201
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,719
He's wounded.
We'll catch him soon.

202
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,359
Then we'll hopefully also know
what's happened to Emilie Zeuthen.

203
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,919
Will Ussing be investigated?

204
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,599
We'll leave it to Special Branch
and the police.

205
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,279
Focus on our duel with Ussing tomorrow.
I'm not slinging mud without more intel.

206
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,239
You must admit,
things aren't too bad.

207
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,839
- Lebech would like to meet again.
- Bloody hell, is she serious?

208
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,119
The Centre Party have made their choice.
Will you check on the event tomorrow?

209
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,519
Yes.
I'll go in five minutes. See you.

210
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,399
Thank you for all your efforts, Karen.
I want you to know they mean a lot.

211
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,919
- It's my job.
- Yes, but anyway...

212
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,719
Do you have a minute?

213
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,759
No, not really.

214
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,399
I'm off to the Ministry of Justice
to check up on Mogens.

215
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,279
I'm sorry about everything
that's happened.

216
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,639
I understand if you don't
trust me any more.

217
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,039
Listen, I have quite a lot
to prepare for tomorrow.

218
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,479
I tried to keep things separate,
but I'm not as strong as you.

219
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,799
I've had pressure from all sides and now
there's the thing with my ex-husband.

220
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,599
But that doesn't change
how I feel about you.

221
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,999
I'd like you to understand that.

222
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
She was at the bridge. His boat
was found in Copenhagen harbour.

223
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,479
We'll look there.

224
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,159
The police have put in extra manpower
at the harbour and along the coast.

225
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,399
- They've checked all ships in port.
- Where have the police not been?

226
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,079
- They haven't checked the containers.
- Have them checked.

227
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,959
- Is that realistic? They're sealed.
- Contact the freight station chiefs.

228
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,879
Say we'll cover all the losses
that possible delays may cost.

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,639
But they're not all Zeeland containers,
and the contents are private property.

230
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,879
I'll get it started right away.

231
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,239
I'll ask our legal team
to handle the case.

232
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,319
Apart from that,
the Board wants a meeting.

233
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,279
You'll have to take care of it.

234
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,279
I left the living room briefly,

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,359
when I returned,
Carl had turned on the TV.

236
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,319
He was watching the news.

237
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,759
Don't listen to the things
they say about Emilie.

238
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,839
Mum and Dad are looking for her.
You can ask us anything you like.

239
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,799
- What if you can't find her?
- We'll find her, dear.

240
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,159
- When?
- Soon. We'll find her soon.

241
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,199
I've also looked for her. I thought
she was in the gap, but she wasn't.

242
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,079
What gap?

243
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,999
The place she goes
when she doesn't want to hear anymore.

244
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,839
- What doesn't Emilie want to hear?
- When you argue and stuff.

245
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,719
Let's go downstairs
and get a cookie. Come.

246
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,719
I've packed the basics for him.

247
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,279
We'll wait and see where
he wants to sleep. Any news?

248
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,879
Not yet.

249
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,639
Did Carl or Emilie ever mention
a place they call the gap?

250
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,279
No.

251
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,199
Special Branch insist

252
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,359
that their concern for the PM
and the notebook meant nothing.

253
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,839
We need all the information.
They must have a copy of the numbers.

254
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,639
The head of Special Branch will come
in the morning to explain.

255
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,599
- Did Borch say anything to you?
- No.

256
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,799
Any news on the perp?

257
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,119
We don't know
how he got your number.

258
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,839
He returned to Zealand
as a stowaway on a train.

259
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,879
We found blood matching his.

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,319
- Did no one see anything?
- No.

261
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,759
- But we have the lab results.
- Hi, don't turn on the heating.

262
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,639
The preliminary tests of the perp's DNA
indicate with 99% certainty,

263
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,159
that he's Louise Hjelby's
biological father.

264
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,199
I've set things in motion.

265
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,959
The father's unknown,
so dig up more on the mother.

266
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,239
She got pregnant in '96.

267
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,999
Who was she? Where did she work?
She must have talked to someone.

268
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,759
I brought the plants in. If the room
is too hot, they'll think it's spring.

269
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,679
- I'll call if we find anything.
- Yes, OK.

270
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,399
Let's hope for a period without frost,
or we can't plant them until spring.

271
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,639
I've made some pumpkin soup.

272
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,199
You didn't see it. Close it again.
The ultrasound images.

273
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,679
I'll heat the soup.

274
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,559
No, I'm not up for soup, candles,
and ultrasound images right now.

275
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,599
There's no need for you to get upset.
I'm only staying till tomorrow.

276
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,799
Did you speak to Mark?

277
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,559
Yes. All he said was
that he didn't know what to do.

278
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,199
I need to think about myself now...
and the baby.

279
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,639
I'll move in with a friend,
or move back to my parents.

280
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,959
That's likely to change
when the baby comes.

281
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,919
- You have the flat.
- No, that won't be ready.

282
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,119
Someone
stopped by to inspect the ceilings.

283
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,999
They say there's asbestos,
and that it'll all have to be torn down.

284
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,639
Well, if you could handle being
a single mum, I suppose I can as well.

285
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,039
I don't think I handled it
particularly well.

286
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,439
I thought I could give Mark a...

287
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,959
Well, I couldn't.

288
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,559
Things didn't work out with Mark's dad,
so, that was the end of that.

289
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,599
- Why didn't it work?
- Is there any more soup?

290
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,439
You were together
and you got pregnant.

291
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,079
I didn't love him.

292
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,199
There was someone else before who...

293
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,079
I also left him,
even though he was the one who...

294
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,359
Well, it wasn't to be.
That's all right now.

295
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,679
I need to take this.
You can stay as long as you like.

296
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,799
And I'd also be happy
to have a picture of...

297
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,999
- Yes, what's up?
- Why did you stop me?

298
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,719
Your Special Branch guy deserved to die.
You've seen what he's covered up.

299
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,519
Where is Emilie Zeuthen?

300
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,079
I need your help, Lund.

301
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,159
We know you didn't take her
to Jutland. Is she alive?

302
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,399
The book lists 12 black cars that day.
One of them picked up a little girl.

303
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,119
I need names and
social security numbers on the 12.

304
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,879
I'll take care of the rest.

305
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,799
No, give yourself up and give me Emilie,
then I promise to solve the case.

306
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,319
I'll call tomorrow night to get
the names and social security numbers.

307
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,679
I can't give you that.

308
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,079
Doesn't your daughter deserve
for the case to be solved?

309
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,479
Your blood matches hers.

310
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,639
I promise that her killer
will be punished,

311
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,879
but you need to give me Emilie.

312
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,639
I'll get a copy of the car numbers
in the morning and then I'll start.

313
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,479
OK?

314
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,279
OK. Don't disappoint me.
You don't have to wait till morning.

315
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,879
There's a copy on your doormat.

316
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,079
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15

317
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,479
We'll put Lund's address
under surveillance.

318
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,599
No, thanks.

319
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,159
I feel less safe with Special Branch,
so, we'll handle it ourselves.

320
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,999
I know how it looks,

321
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,679
but our task then was to make sure
the PM wasn't tarnished.

322
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,799
How do you know,
the PM wasn't involved?

323
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,559
It was his campaign car.
Chauffeur, staff and all.

324
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,439
If you think we've put pressure
on the public prosecutor, the answer is no.

325
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,799
That would've been a decent guess.

326
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,359
The prosecutor
also took us by surprise.

327
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,199
Borch has given you
correct information.

328
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,439
Except you knew about the case

329
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,199
and stole that book
from under our noses,

330
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,879
and you would never
have mentioned it yourselves.

331
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,479
Of course we would.

332
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,199
Borch confiscated it
so we could form a general idea first.

333
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,799
- Yeah, right.
- Being offended like a girl won't help.

334
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,039
No one knew that the case involved a
black car until we found the crime scene.

335
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,719
Which one of the 12 black cars is it?

336
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,919
The public prosecutor changed the date
to cover for one of them.

337
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,999
- Which one?
- If we knew that, we would have said.

338
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,919
- Is Ussing's car among them?
- Yes. Also a campaign car.

339
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,119
We're looking into the claim
that he knew Louise Hjelby.

340
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,519
It may have come from
a questionable witness.

341
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,999
- Then we'll have to question Ussing.
- Yes, but not to throw suspicion on him.

342
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,879
The girl was abused and killed
and thrown in the harbour.

343
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,879
If justice is all the perp wants
in exchange for Emilie, let's provide it.

344
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,799
- Or what?
- She's right. We have no leads on Emilie.

345
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,719
And we can't afford to adopt
the refined manners of Special Branch.

346
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,159
I gave him my word,
and I believe he'll give us Emilie.

347
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,879
- But we must move now.
- Yes, indeed.

348
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,479
You will search the harbour,
and Borch will assemble a team.

349
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,679
No, no, we'll take care of that.
You can take the damned harbour.

350
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,239
Well, now we seem
to be cooperating again.

351
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,599
He could have been
in Copenhagen harbour

352
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,719
two hours before he stole the car,

353
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,199
- and he had plenty of time to hide Emilie.
- Search everything again.

354
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,199
There must be a witness or a camera.
Someone must have seen something.

355
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,399
We're trying,
but Zeuthen's people are everywhere.

356
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,239
We're surrounded by security guards.

357
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,119
- Brix is trying to change that.
- OK, what about Borch?

358
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,599
Are you two OK?
I know he's the one who fucked up,

359
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,759
but he got us back on track
when we thought the girl was dead.

360
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,839
Call me if something turns up, Asbjørn.

361
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,119
It can't come as a surprise
that there are things I couldn't tell you.

362
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,599
- Don't be like that. I've been loyal.
- It's coincidental, I know.

363
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,359
It meant something to me,
what happened over there.

364
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,599
Shall we get going?

365
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,359
- Give me a quick briefing.
- The nursery had 70-100 employees.

366
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,559
Now it's threatened with closure,
and has debts of several million.

367
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,039
Thank you.

368
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,399
- Is anything wrong?
- No, no.

369
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,559
- Lebech has withdrawn from Ussing.
- Has Ussing commented on that?

370
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,119
He's probably about to.

371
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,999
I don't comment on rumours.

372
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,639
Would you like to hear
our job creation policies?

373
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,959
- It's a storm in a teacup.
- Yes, but as I said...

374
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,319
The organisers are asking us to answer
a few extra questions. What do you say?

375
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,679
As long as we talk job creation reform
and government abusing the benefit law.

376
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,519
- You can borrow mine.
- Thank you.

377
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,959
I'll just run through it
with my advisor.

378
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,399
It's a crude game you're playing.
If you think you can sneak a win,

379
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,279
with rumours from an unreliable witness,
you must be really desperate.

380
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,479
- There's more than just a witness.
- I'll explain myself, don't worry.

381
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,999
You prepare yourself for a libel suit.

382
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,599
- It's all right by us.
- Good.

383
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,159
Anders was called back to Christiansborg
to help the police.

384
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,919
- Unfortunately, it couldn't wait.
- What a shame.

385
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,439
No comment.

386
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,359
Now he wants them to solve an old case.
Why should I wait for that?

387
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,159
- Did you find anything?
- Searching the containers takes time.

388
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,159
- Then hire more people.
- It's not people we need.

389
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,279
We're still negotiating with a few
less-than-cooperative shipping companies.

390
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,999
- Just solve the problem.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

391
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,959
I've spoken to the Board.
Everyone wishes you the best,

392
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,759
but we have
no managing director,

393
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,079
prices are dropping,
rumours are rife.

394
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,319
They can voice their complaints to me,
otherwise, just do as I ask.

395
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,159
I'm paying you to do as I ask,
so, do it!

396
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,799
That wasn't necessary.

397
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,599
- Here's the TV script.
- Thank you.

398
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,519
Neither the nanny nor Carl and Emilie's
teachers have heard of the gap.

399
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,279
Isn't it just a game
they've made up?

400
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,759
- Are they ready?
- Yes.

401
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,679
The police called.
They advise against doing it.

402
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
No.
Come.

403
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,919
You can help save Emilie's life.

404
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,599
- I'm sure your voters will forgive you.
- I've already answered questions.

405
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,279
As you know, Emilie's kidnapping
is closely tied to an old murder case,

406
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,079
which your friend, Assistant Public
Prosecutor Schultz was responsible for.

407
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,559
I was appalled by the whole story,
but I have explained our meeting.

408
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,279
- According to a witness...
- The meeting was about Louise Hjelby.

409
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,439
Seifert is totally unreliable.
Is he really the cause of this meeting?

410
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,079
- So, you didn't know her, Louise Hjelby?
- Sorry.

411
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,319
On April 20th,
two and a half years ago,

412
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,519
you were in the vicinity of Gudbjerghavn,
the town where Hjelby was killed.

413
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,479
Here's a copy of the hotel guest list.

414
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,759
I was campaigning, it's my constituency,
so, of course I was around there.

415
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,599
- You drove a black car.
- A BMW 3 series.

416
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,279
It was spotted on the road where
Louise was taken. Same day, same time.

417
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,319
- I suppose I was at an election meeting.
- You suppose?

418
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,319
The girl was abused and killed.
Peter Schultz wrote it off as a suicide.

419
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,639
- So, be precise for your own sake.
- What did you speak to Schultz about?

420
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,279
And don't say you spoke of
the good old days at law school.

421
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,999
Bloody hell!

422
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,719
We used this girl
in one of our campaigns.

423
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,119
It was a campaign
in aid of foster children.

424
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,679
- Who are you?
- Per Monrad, political advisor.

425
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,359
The girl's foster family was an example
that our efforts out there bore fruit,

426
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,919
so, it wasn't good news
that she'd taken her own life.

427
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,759
An expensive campaign was binned
before we even got started.

428
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,679
How was the public prosecutor involved?
What did you need him for?

429
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,839
It was Peter's case. I just wanted to
make sure that this wasn't relevant.

430
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,559
What did Peter say about the case?

431
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,119
It was confidential.
I respected that.

432
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,479
- So, you actually did know the girl.
- That's not how it works.

433
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,679
They find someone, I show up for photos.
I wouldn't recognise her on the street.

434
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,479
So, you didn't give Louise Hjelby
a lift that afternoon?

435
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,759
Are you insinuating
that I killed that little girl?

436
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,959
- No, I'm just asking.
- This is Ussing's agenda for that day.

437
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,319
As you can see, we met with the PM
in Esbjerg during that time.

438
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,479
- Is that answer enough? Then we...
- No, it isn't.

439
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,399
I need all the material from your diary
and from that campaign.

440
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,319
If I don't have it by this afternoon,
we'll come back with a search warrant.

441
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,759
Thank you.

442
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,879
The advertising agency
confirm that they used Louise.

443
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,999
How the hell could Special Branch
have missed that?

444
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,399
They're sending us a copy of the film.

445
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,119
Do you know anything
about Ussing's private life?

446
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,759
Or perhaps you're not allowed
to talk about that either?

447
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,879
Well?

448
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,759
He divorced his Thai wife
five years ago.

449
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,679
They have two grown-up children
who he doesn't see very often.

450
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,319
He's hetero and sexually active.
Anything else you want to know?

451
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,679
I want to talk to his office staff
and his campaign staff.

452
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,359
The PM's department must be able
to tell us if his alibi holds water.

453
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
We're hoping that people will help us.

454
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,039
If anyone has seen something
or seen her, then come forward.

455
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,119
She knows that we're looking for her,
and we'll continue until we find her.

456
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,719
Anyone with information

457
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,199
which leads to Emilie being found alive,

458
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,039
will be offered a combined reward

459
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,839
of up to 100 million Danish Kroner.

460
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,359
This sum is close to the amount,
which the perpetrator rejected,

461
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,399
and without a doubt, the largest reward
ever offered in this country.

462
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,199
I thought you had Zeuthen
under control.

463
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,799
The press is all over Ussing. No one
would touch him with a barge pole.

464
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,479
The party's come to heel, the treasurer
wants to reconcile, and Lebech is back.

465
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,719
- Maybe Karen should set up meetings.
- You do it. Karen's helping the police.

466
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,679
They want files from the last election.
They're examining Ussing's explanation.

467
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,439
- Fine. I'll set something up.
- Stoffer...

468
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,199
I'm glad you came back to help
and that you reminded me,

469
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,119
not to do things half-heartedly.
We're sticking to that, right?

470
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,919
Yes, yes, damn it.
What's on your mind?

471
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,239
- What's Zeuthen doing? We made a deal.
- Zeuthen can't be controlled.

472
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,199
The network has crashed five times.

473
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,799
All the world think
they've seen something.

474
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,759
- And there are complaints from Ussing.
- Ussing was lying through his teeth.

475
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,199
I hope he doesn't win the election.
That would seriously slash our budget.

476
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,639
- Call me when you know more.
- Hello, Mathias Borch, Special Branch.

477
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,679
I need some information from the PM's
appointments diary for the last election.

478
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,439
Yes, I understand.
Have a seat.

479
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,479
Did you have a meeting with Ussing
on April 20th of that year?

480
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,039
- Yes, it seems they had a debate.
- And you're sure of that?

481
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,119
Yes, about the fringes of Denmark,
in a fish meal factory in Esbjerg.

482
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,839
Is there any possibility,
that Ussing didn't turn up?

483
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,919
No, I would remember that.
He's our main opponent.

484
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,399
Do you remember how Ussing acted?
Was there anything strange?

485
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,239
- No, I'm afraid I don't remember.
- What about the Prime Minister?

486
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,239
I'm just asking.
Did he drive on his own that day,

487
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,479
- or take a break in the ministerial car?
- That's not very likely.

488
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,999
That car is only available
in connection with the PM's office.

489
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,039
We have a bus and some campaign cars.
He doesn't take breaks and drive alone.

490
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,679
Excuse me, I have to take this.
Borch.

491
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,879
There's something here.
It seems that debate was moved.

492
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,079
How so? Ussing didn't take part
in the debate with the PM?

493
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,599
Yes, but a couple of days later.
Ussing requested to reschedule.

494
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,719
The candidates sometimes
juggle things around.

495
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,639
What reason did Ussing give? Were other
meetings rescheduled? Who instructed it?

496
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,799
I want to know everything there is.

497
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,719
I don't have it all here.
I'd have to go back to the archives.

498
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,839
Feel free to do so.
Thank you.

499
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,279
Here's my card.
That's my number.

500
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,159
Thank you.

501
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,799
That was the Worker's Bank.
I need to talk to Ussing again.

502
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,039
Then join the queue.

503
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,919
The calls are pouring in.
Something will turn up. How's Carl?

504
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,359
We've just come in the door.
I'll be there as soon as I can. Bye.

505
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,999
- Let's ride the bike to the gap.
- No.

506
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,599
I know where it is.

507
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,879
- It's in the garage, isn't it?
- No.

508
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,359
Then tell me.

509
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,999
Is it down in the basement?
Is it?

510
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,119
I don't feel like
riding up to the gap.

511
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,399
What do you mean by up?

512
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,199
- Carl, what do you mean by up?
- Emilie said not to tell you.

513
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,479
You're going to show me
that place right now.

514
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,599
MUM AND DAD

515
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,879
Does Dad know
that you come up here?

516
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,839
We don't want to tell anyone.
We're only playing up here.

517
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,719
This isn't Emilie's iPad. Her one is
downstairs. Where did this come from?

518
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,279
She said she got it from the man
with the cat down by the fence.

519
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,279
It's the one. It's the same car
that Ussing drove back then.

520
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,519
But it could take the technicians
several weeks to check every detail.

521
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,599
What the hell are you doing?
I don't have time for this.

522
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,799
According to the PM's department
the debate was called off by you.

523
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,119
So what?
That doesn't make me a killer.

524
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,759
I was campaigning. I couldn't have
moved my ears without someone noticing.

525
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,119
According to your driver back then,
you drove off for a couple of hours.

526
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,999
- It's possible. I need to go.
- Where did you go?

527
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,559
None of your staff knew where you were,
until you turned up at a hotel in Varde.

528
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,879
- Please move away from my car.
- You're a Worker's Bank board member.

529
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,879
Did you help the public prosecutor
with a bad investment debt he had?

530
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,479
- Where were you that day?
- We're talking about a lot of millions.

531
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,679
Did he do something for you in return?

532
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,479
- Answer the questions.
- You can contact my lawyer.

533
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,719
You recognised the girl and drove off
with her and the bike. Then what?

534
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,839
- If you can explain, now is the time.
- Give me the car keys.

535
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,559
Ussing, you're not going anywhere.
The car is going to be examined.

536
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,719
You drive me insane!

537
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,239
This is harassment! I don't know
what the hell you're thinking.

538
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,439
You'll be called in for questioning.
You can explain yourself then. What?

539
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,959
Solving the old case won't help.
Emilie didn't return to the harbour.

540
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,599
- We don't know if she's alive.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,079
We've gotten some pictures
from a camera in the harbour.

542
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,559
- Emilie isn't on the boat.
- That's impossible. She must have been.

543
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,599
I'm watching it now.
The perp arrives at 03.54 - alone.

544
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,799
20 minutes later he passes
the port guard in a red van.

545
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,559
- He must have put her down somewhere.
- There's no point staying here.

546
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,039
We'll go to the North harbour
where Louise Hjelby's mother worked.

547
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,319
It's a cafeteria called the Marigold.

548
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,399
- What?
- Are you coming?

549
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,599
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

550
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,839
Mogens and the treasurer
are coming now,

551
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,319
and Lebech
would like a meeting later.

552
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,119
Rumour has it that Ussing was involved
in financial transactions with Schultz.

553
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,199
The police have questioned him twice,
and now they're examining his car.

554
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,119
I'll join you later with Lebech.
I need to find that material for the police.

555
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,919
Very well, Karen.

556
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

557
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,239
The party committee send their regards.
They're up in the air.

558
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,719
We haven't had this much support in the
constituencies since the early noughties.

559
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,519
Wonderful.

560
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,679
I realise that your witness
wasn't completely wrong about Ussing.

561
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,639
I regret our confrontation.

562
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,039
Mogens has made a huge effort
to clear up the situation.

563
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,399
I hope you don't hold a grudge.
I've brought a little consolation.

564
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,239
It's a '97 Graham's Vintage Port.

565
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,159
I intended to open it
on election night but...

566
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,079
- We've been through a great deal so...
- Just leave the cork in the bottle.

567
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,719
Keep it for when I've appointed my
new Cabinet. You'll need it for comfort.

568
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,559
This is all a misunderstanding.

569
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,959
- Birgit knows she's made a mistake.
- It's not up for discussion.

570
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,319
The PM doesn't trust you anymore.
And that won't change.

571
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,559
Kristian...

572
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,399
The permanent secretary will prepare
the treasury for your dismissal,

573
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,159
when we've won the election.

574
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,799
That's the end of it, Birgit.

575
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,239
Goodbye and thank you.

576
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,239
It's OK, Mogens.

577
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,999
Nothing else will happen.

578
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,999
I've spoken to the party committee.
Even the reluctant ones are excited.

579
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,399
So, it's agreed. We can finally
point to you as Prime Minister.

580
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,999
I thought we could go for dinner.
We don't need to be so formal.

581
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,119
Let's deal with the formal matters.

582
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,319
There will be no alliance,
neither politically nor privately.

583
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,319
Not because you and I can't agree,

584
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,479
or because your ex-husband leaked
documents from the Ministry of Justice,

585
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,519
but simply because you weren't there
when I needed you.

586
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,359
What's up with the Treasurer?
I just met her on the stairs.

587
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,959
- Did the police get that information?
- Yes, but oddly enough some is missing.

588
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,999
- What's happening with Lebech?
- We're better off alone. Are you coming?

589
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,159
Pull it all out. When we're done here
we'll check the area by the ferry port.

590
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,039
They're almost done at the east station,
but there's a problem with customs.

591
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,039
- I don't care. Check all containers.
- Of course...

592
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,239
- What did the police say?
- I haven't heard from them.

593
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,359
- Everything's a bit chaotic.
- Tell them I want an answer.

594
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,559
Robert, I know how he contacted her
and how he could know those things.

595
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,759
Hi, and thanks a lot for the iPad.
I'm really happy with it.

596
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,359
My parents forbid me to have a profile
online, but they'll never find this one.

597
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,719
They don't talk together
and they don't know what I'm doing.

598
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,279
Thanks for the kitten photos.

599
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,119
I'm not sure
which one of the cuties I prefer.

600
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,919
When they grow up, you can bring
them along, so I can meet them.

601
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,359
If you feel like chatting tomorrow,
then write on my wall. Bye-bye.

602
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:25,359
Excuse me, I've spoken to the police.
Emilie wasn't brought to the harbour.

603
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,479
They found some pictures
from a camera.

604
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,919
They believe that she was
taken to some other place. Or...

605
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,919
The mother worked in the cafeteria,
but the whole area is practically derelict.

606
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,199
The homeless
are the only ones here.

607
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:06,279
Are you sure you haven't seen... Look.
Did you see this boat three nights ago?

608
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,159
I sleep at night.
You should go now.

609
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,439
Here's 200 Kroner. Think carefully.
Didn't you see anyone at all?

610
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,239
Listen. The only ones out here are me,
Mr T. Jensen... and the cat man.

611
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,479
- But you don't bother with him.
- Let's move on, there's nothing here.

612
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,679
- What cat man?
- The psycho who lives down the well.

613
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,599
He acts like he owns the place,
but his rent isn't any higher than ours.

614
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,719
He isn't here.
See what you can find.

615
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,719
Those are the clothes Emilie wore
that night on the bridge.

616
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,199
Winter boots and survival gear.
What the hell is going on?

617
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,159
Look at this.

618
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,079
What is it?

619
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,679
Container numbers, I think.

620
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,799
There must be several thousand.

621
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,439
No, he hasn't shipped her off as freight.
He couldn't have.

622
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,279
- Yes?
- I thought we had a deal.

623
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,279
We do have a deal, we're working on it.
Is it because of Zeuthen's reward?

624
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,639
I don't give a damn about Zeuthen!
You promised to solve that case.

625
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,639
- I think we're closing in.
- I read the news. Ussing is important.

626
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,519
- They're screwing you again, Lund.
- No, they're not.

627
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,759
- It's going to take some time.
- There weren't 12 black cars, but 13.

628
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,679
What do you mean?

629
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,519
Someone tore a page out of the notebook.

630
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,239
Most likely your friend
from Special Branch.

631
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,559
I'm sorry I didn't notice it earlier.

632
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,039
- I'll have to find the guilty myself.
- What car? Give me the number.

633
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,839
I promise you...

634
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,119
What bloody car is he talking about?
Did you tear out a page?

635
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,639
It's not true.
He's lying.

636
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,439
Yes, there's a page missing.
But he found the number.

637
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,199
You can see the imprint. AF 98208.

638
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,879
That's not possible.
It wasn't there.

639
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,439
Which one wasn't there?
Which one?

640
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,399
What are you talking about?
What is that number?

641
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,079
The Prime Minister's car.

642
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,279
But we knew that.
Special Branch checked it out.

643
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,519
No, that was the campaign car.

644
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,479
This is the ministerial car.

644
00:55:44,305 --> 00:56:44,499

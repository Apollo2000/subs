<i>Every sailor
is fond of the ladies</i>

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,121
<i>but my love
you can have faith in me</i>

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,244
<i>I've told you so many times lately</i>

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,251
<i>there is no other lady for me</i>

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,643
<i>except for Susannah
Brigitte and Hannah</i>

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,770
<i>and Laura and Anna
and Lisa and Liz</i>

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:13,482
<i>and also Belinda
Eliza and Greta</i>

<i>and Molly and Sis</i>

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,848
<i>every sailor
must travel the seas</i>

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,409
<i>but at night when
I'm steering the ship</i>

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,048
<i>I look at the sky
and I then see a star</i>

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,688
<i>that tells me you are not far</i>

THE KILLING Ill

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,370
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9

17
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,563
<i>So far the election has been marked
by the financial crisis“.</i>

18
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,648
DAY 1

19
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,001
<i>...which was emphasized this
morning by the latest index numbers.</i>

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,327
<i>The deficit continues to grow</i>

21
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:10,245
<i>and the number of companies
shutting dawn is still on the rise.</i>

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,649
<i>The PM maintains his optimism
and stresses the necessity</i>

23
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,924
<i>of reducing expenditure
in all comers of society.</i>

24
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,763
<i>The major topic of the day is
that observers claim to know</i>

25
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,284
<i>that the oil and shipping giant
Zeeland is moving to Asia.</i>

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,611
<i>This would be a serious setback
for the economy and the government.</i>

27
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,725
<i>But so far the PM and Zeeland
remain silent on the matter...</i>

28
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,811
- I'm looking for Sarah Lund.
- She's around somewhere.

29
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,091
- Sarah Lund?
- Try out back,

30
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,524
Maybe you can stop by
for dinner tonight?

31
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,128
No, I'd rather see you, talk a little
and meet your girlfriend.

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,801
- I can show you the house!
- Sarah Lund?

33
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,086
The garden isn't done yet.
I want tons of trees and bushes.

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,570
The nursery said I still have time
to plant it all before the frost sets in.

35
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,082
Yes, at six or five.
I can leave early.

36
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,489
I just want to see you.
It's been <i>so</i> long.

37
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,366
Great. What does she like,
your girlfriend?

38
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,164
I look forward to seeing you
and... Eva.

39
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,011
Bye-bye.

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,045
Hi. Asbjom Juncker.
I'm the new police inspector.

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,801
- I was told you'd show me the ropes.
- Yes.

42
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,847
Grab some coffee.
I think there's bread, too.

43
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,966
I'd really just like to get started.
The others seemed busy.

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,849
- Whose silver anniversary is it?
- Lund, congratulations.

45
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,329
I wanted to stop by earlier,
but I'll see you later anyway.

46
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,048
The whole house is busy with the
budget, so I'm in charge of the event.

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,721
- The new guy. Asbjørn.
- Juncker.

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,242
- Just call me Juncker.
- Good to see a fresh face.

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,365
- Any news about the OPA position?
- It will be decided today,

50
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,485
- The Chief makes the decision.
- Yes. Well, just as long as I get it.

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,003
Now that I have papers on my
25 years on the force, I've earned...

52
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,729
- Yes, so you say.
- Maybe you could say it, too.

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,844
He doesn't know me, and...

54
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,123
...someone may have given him
the wrong impression.

55
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,050
It would be a great help
if you'd put in a good word.

56
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,085
The Chief will attend the diploma
presentation. I'll try and catch him.

57
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,726
But show up yourself
and make a good impression.

58
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,968
Yes, I'll do that. Thanks.

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,243
I still believe
you've made the wrong decision.

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,725
- I know.
- Don't forget the uniform.

61
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,083
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

62
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,807
Congratulations on your anniversary.

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,764
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

64
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,726
So what are you gonna do in
Operative Planning and Analysis?

65
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,129
You plan and analyze things.

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,687
OPA is really interesting.
Watch that ﬂower bud.

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,842
Some call it SOFA, because it's sort of
light work, but I'm sure that's not true.

68
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,009
- Where were you before?
- At Bellahøj.

69
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,920
- I've been waiting to transfer here.
- Why?

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,206
- Because I want to make a difference.
- Make the world a better place?

71
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,487
Is that a problem?
You think I'm too young, don't you?

72
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,924
That's fine, but I'm better than anyone
who talks about pensions or a raise

73
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,931
for scratching their own ass.
You have nothing to worry about.

74
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,484
Great.

75
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,211
This place is a collecting point for
scrap metal. 1000 tonnes per week.

76
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,010
It's shipped off for recycling by train
or on container ships to the Far East.

77
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,809
- Where's the body?
- All over the place, more or less.

78
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,005
The crane operator choked on his
coffee, when he realised what it was.

79
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,284
The grab cut the body in half.
We have seven pans thus far.

80
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,166
Why haven't we stopped
the other cranes from running?

81
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,922
The foreman can't afford to stop them.
They're far enough away from here.

82
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,681
No ID?

83
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,486
Male. 4555. It's impossible
to put together his face.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,571
They've had trouble with
homeless people scavenging.

85
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,967
It's probably one of them.

86
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,085
- Cause of death?
- Forensics are working on it.

87
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,409
But this isn't exactly a safe place
to pass out drunk.

88
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,888
And no reports,
missing persons or witnesses?

89
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,811
Over there is the industrial harbour
with the Zeeland container terminal.

90
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,970
- No one reported anything.
- Okay.

91
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,970
Well, I just came to drop off Asbjørn.

92
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,005
Get photos of his distinctive features
and interview the homeless.

93
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,967
- Of course. Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,050
I don't think he was homeless.

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,881
He's wearing a gold ring,
and then there are the tattoos...

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,281
Look at that. If he just collapsed,
then why is his skin wrinkled

97
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,131
as if he'd been lying
in the dock several hours.

98
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,404
And the cuts on his wrist
can't be from the crane.

99
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,205
Right, you heard him.
Start with the homeless.

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,291
Ask Zeeland and the dock office
if they're missing a sailor.

101
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,927
What about the ships
and the rest of the dock?

102
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,331
No, but if you need fresh air,
feel free to go for a stroll on the dock.

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,444
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

104
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,123
- What do you want for this?
- A tenner for a round of beers.

105
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,002
- Is he ready?
- He's picking up the kids.

106
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,040
Emilie! Come on!
We'll be late!

107
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,320
Emilie!

108
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,925
- Why won't it talk anymore?
- Well, you let it ﬂy out the window.

109
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,046
When you let it ﬂy out the window,
it breaks. We've talked about that.

110
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,447
- There you are!
- When can I have a cat?

111
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,803
- What were you doing?
- You promised, Dad.

112
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,127
I did? I don't think so.

113
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,326
I promised to talk to Mum
about getting a pet other than a cat.

114
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,891
- Are your shoes wet again?
- That's okay.

115
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,288
No, it's not, Emilie.
We'll be late.

116
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,329
I saw it. Someone's preparing
for the board meeting tonight.

117
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,526
I've notified the Board of Directors
that you wish to convene immediately.

118
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,201
- The driver is ready.
- Find Emilie same dry shoes.

119
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,680
The children's mother just called.
The school meeting is now.

120
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,200
- I'll postpone the board meeting.
- Yes.

121
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,244
Hurry up, kids.
I'll take you.

122
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,486
Come, Call. Mum's here.

123
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,765
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

124
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,761
- I just want a word with Dad.
- Dad wants to ask you something.

125
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,124
- I'll ask Mum later, sweetie.
- No, ask her now, Dad.

126
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,370
My lecture in Toronto has been
rescheduled. I'm leaving tomorrow.

127
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,763
- So I had to reschedule this, too.
- Yes, so I gather.

128
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,248
If I had asked you first,
you would've said no.

129
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,647
Come, Carl.

130
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,731
Thank you for the playground.
The children love it.

131
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,643
- Good. I'd like to talk about Emilie.
- Yes, you are concerned?

132
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,651
Yes. She was with me all last week.
She doesn't seem happy,

133
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,683
She doesn't want to do stuff.
I think she's holding back something.

134
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,408
When I ask her about it, she doesn't
answer. What is she like here?

135
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,605
She was a bit quiet at one point.
Did you notice a problem, too?

136
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,881
<i>No.</i>

137
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,570
- And she hasn't said anything?
- No.

138
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,002
She seems happy.
Getting a cat really helped her.

139
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,167
- What?
- Nothing helps like a pet...

140
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,604
What cat? Emilie is allergic.
She can't be around cats.

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,368
It seems I got something wrong then.

142
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,845
We did these last week.
She took these with her phone camera.

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,682
- I didn't give her any cat.
- Then where did she get them?

144
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,010
She's under supervision 24-7 with me.
You'd better talk to your mother.

145
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,601
- Are there any more pictures?
- Yes.

146
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,807
<i>Reinhardt. The PM's staff
want a clarification of the article.</i>

147
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,083
<i>The Prime Minister wants it disproved.</i>

148
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,010
<i>- Tell them</i> we're <i>busy. The board?
- The Board is ready.</i>

149
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,691
<i>But there's something else.</i>

150
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,283
<i>The police found a body in the dock.
They ask if he's one of ours.</i>

151
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,564
- <i>Hopefully not.</i>
- <i>We're checking our crew.</i>

152
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,641
Thank you.
See you later.

153
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,481
I don't understand.
Did she say it was her cat?

154
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,481
- So, if that's all...
- Yes, well, it was a while back.

155
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,003
And I'm sure Emilie has an explanation.
Let me walk you out.

156
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,442
Robert, hang on.
I'd like <i>to...</i>

157
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,007
I'd like to talk to Emilie, before I leave.
Can I pick up the kids?

158
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,682
- There's no need. I'll handle it.
- But I'd like to talk to her.

159
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,522
There's nothing wrong. And if there is,
I'll handle it. Have a good trip.

160
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,883
In the last decade the government
has starved our society with a policy

161
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,800
that has only benefited the rich!

162
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,767
And yet, today's paper tells us
that not even the business sector,

163
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,646
which the PM's party caters to,
has confidence in this policy.

164
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,041
Zeeland, Denmark's largest company,
are joining the group of companies

165
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,882
who threatens to stick us with the
bill and ship their workplaces to Asia.

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,085
Our economic policy
is popular with Zeeland.

167
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,526
Yes, because you suck up to them
and give them discount on oil and taxes!

168
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,690
If anyone is sucking up to anyone...

169
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,364
If anyone is sucking up, it's you!

170
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,566
You and your party want us to believe
the crisis will be over

171
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,004
if we vote for you.
The problem is, that ifs not true.

172
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,285
I know it's hard on you
and on a lot of people in Denmark.

173
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,723
For far too long we've
been hearing about layoffs,

174
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,767
bankruptcies, private savings
disappearing into thin air.

175
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,407
If you want us to put on blinders

176
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,244
and pass on the problems
to our kids, then vote for Ussing.

177
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,331
But if you're willing to act responsibly,
vole for me.

178
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,603
Can the PM guarantee

179
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,328
that the rumors will not result
in more discount for Zeeland?

180
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,482
If the business sector has reasonable
conditions, workplaces stay here.

181
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,243
But there are limits. Everyone
must contribute. Including Zeeland.

182
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,568
I told you to rein in the rhetoric
about the article.

183
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,207
He kept on about the damn article.
Zeeland will have to deny it.

184
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,484
I left messages everywhere.
I think somethings up.

185
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,164
This can't disrupt
our proposal to the Centre Party.

186
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,203
The deal must be sealed.

187
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,688
We're working on it.
But now we're off to see the homeless.

188
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,327
I don't just want photo ops.
I want to talk to people.

189
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,603
There are no votes in the homeless
without pictures.

190
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,688
One second.

191
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,368
<i>I just saw you on TV. If! weren't
from another party, I'd vote for you.</i>

192
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,690
- Do it anyway.
- Will I see you before you leave?

193
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,926
It'll be difficult.
I need to make a deal with your party.

194
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,126
That's why I'm calling. The group
will point to you as Prime Minister.

195
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,370
- But are you on top of Zeeland?
- Absolutely.

196
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,646
Ussing is grasping at straws. It will be
denied later today. Where are you?

197
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,084
- At an election meeting.
- I'll call you later.

198
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,001
The homeless visit is cancelled.
There's been a homicide at the dock.

199
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,530
- A homicide?
- They sense a threat.

200
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,326
Special Branch is investigating
alongside the police.

201
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,446
We're not cancelling the homeless.
It would be a headline for Ussing.

202
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,361
If Special Branch don't find anything
concrete, we'll do it later today.

203
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,245
I'll have your brother check it out.
Who called?

204
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,364
My dentist.
I forgot an appointment.

205
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,849
<i>- Yes, hello?</i>
- <i>Juno/rec Forensics confirm homicide.</i>

206
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,010
The guy was smashed in the face
with a claw hammer.

207
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,921
- Talk to your <i>group</i> leader.
- We checked with Zeeland.

208
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,409
They have no missing people,
One of the homeless saw something.

209
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,320
It was over there.
I thought they were chasing a seal.

210
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,922
The individual was chased
by a speedboat.

211
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,884
They were moving towards
the junk yard which fits

212
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,848
with Lyngby Radio getting a distress
signal at 2:30 that was interrupted.

213
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,291
We need to check the ships
that arrived last night.

214
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,681
If the ship hasn't reported anyone
missing, it must have already left.

215
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,886
We can't know that for sure.
Special Branch is snooping around as well.

216
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,891
The guy in charge wants to talk to you,
and if they think it's important...

217
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,643
<i>Special Branch will have to wait. Talk to
the group leader and do as he says.</i>

218
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,724
...an important marker
of the quality of our work.

219
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,364
You're our backbone.

220
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,690
You are the toughness and strength
of the corps year after year.

221
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,089
You represent responsibility,
esprit de corps and presence...

222
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,126
I'm sorry to disturb you on a day
like this, but I've called several times.

223
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,042
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

224
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,370
Could we have a moment alone?
Thank you'

225
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,760
- Congratulations on everything.
- Thanks.

226
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,450
I'm on a case.
What do you have on the perpetrator?

227
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,282
- What case?
- The homicide. What do you have?

228
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,324
Nothing.
I don't have anything.

229
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,287
Nothing? You've searched the ships
and the rest of the dock?

230
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,610
Borch, I haven't seen you since
we said goodbye at the academy

231
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,169
and now you just show up and pull
me out here? I have to go back in.

232
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,729
- I'm in Special Branch. Didn't you know?
- No.

233
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,805
And with those words
I invite the jubilees to join me

234
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,924
and receive a diploma
for dedicated service.

235
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,841
It started two weeks ago
with a break-in at a Zeeland office.

236
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,000
It looked like a normal
theft of a computer and loose change.

237
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,044
Special Branch is informed
as a matter of routine

238
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,165
as the computer contained info
on Zeeland's security system.

239
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,806
What does that have to do
with the homicide'?

240
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,290
Strangely, no camera at the dock
registered what happened last night.

241
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,084
Aha...

242
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,682
Shortly after the distress signal,
all surveillance breaks down.

243
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,964
Let's stay in touch
in case we find anything worrying.

244
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,607
This doesn't sound worrying?
The breakdown of all surveillance?

245
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,849
And there's a dead man in the harbour
when it goes back on?

246
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,327
On the very day
the PM is going to visit?

247
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,047
We're in a financial crisis
and involved in two wars.

248
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,883
- So the PM isn't all that popular.
- I'll pass it on to the group leader.

249
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,688
Sarah, I'd like you to look into it now.

250
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,727
We've already ordered it started,
but I'd like you to be in charge.

251
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,081
No one is reported missing.

252
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,728
The victim was from a foreign ship.
The problem has sailed on.

253
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,320
I'd still like you to check it out.

254
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,444
You can get your certificate afterwards.

255
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,001
You look good.

256
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,601
<i>- How far</i> have <i>they come?</i>
- <i>Still no identification.</i>

257
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,361
<i>But we've made inquiries,
and he's not one of ours.</i>

258
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,367
<i>But we've launched our own
investigation of our ships.</i>

259
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,361
<i>Special Branch is involved, so I suppose
it's about the PM and a potential threat.</i>

260
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,247
- Against the PM?
- He was supposed to go there today.

261
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,682
Special Branch is talking about
a breach in our surveillance system.

262
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,010
So, our terminal operations
will be affected for the rest of the day.

263
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,842
Also, the PM's office is impatient
for our rebuttal of the article-.

264
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,760
If Special Branch questions our security,
please handle it personally'

265
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,850
Certainly. How about the Board?
Shouldn't I be there?

266
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,409
I'll handle it. Would you ask around
the house if anyone has seen a cat.

267
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,764
Maja worries about Emilie's allergies,
and I don't want any trouble.

268
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,123
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mum.

269
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,891
- You left your mittens in the car.
- Thank you.

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,688
- Can I have a few drawings?
- Sure.

271
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,165
- Here. You can have these.
- They're beautiful.

272
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,011
And this one.

273
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,966
- How are things at Dad's?
- Great.

274
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,765
What a cute kitten.

275
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,446
Where did you see it?

276
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,610
Al Dad's?

277
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,766
If it's a secret you share,
I have to know...

278
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,965
It's just a cat I saw one day,
I won't see it again.

279
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,324
Okay. Fine.
Enough about that, then.

280
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,363
Don't you like Dad anymore?

281
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,250
- Emilie, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

282
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,886
May I see your ann?

283
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,289
No, no, no.
May I see? Stand still.

284
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,481
Emilie! What is this?

285
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,128
Ladies, gentlemen, Kornerup...
Thank you for your patience.

286
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,962
We've discussed the items
and can get right down to business.

287
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,004
Yes, please.
I'd like to start with this.

288
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,202
ZEELAND LEAVES THE SINKING SHIP

289
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,847
- Where did this came from?
- Journalists are everywhere.

290
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,569
- We support the government.
- We also have a business to run.

291
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,811
- The crisis doesn't exactly help.
- Maja Zeuthen's on the line.

292
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,765
Robert Zeuthen is in a meeting.
They don't know when they're done.

293
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,604
The parliamentary group and the party
are nervous.

294
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,008
They want to know why Zeeland
doesn't refute the article.

295
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,808
- Don't we know someone?
- I left a message with someone.

296
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,127
Maybe this is him calling.

297
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,370
- Do you have a minute?
- We're working on the Zeeland thing.

298
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,929
- Are we ready for tonight?
- Yes. The final meetings are in place.

299
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,011
But I've spoken to Special Branch,
and the homeless visit is off.

300
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,010
- Can I have that?
- Sure.

301
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,602
Special Branch don't want us to reveal
why we're cancelling.

302
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,849
It'll look like we don't care about
the homeless. Ussing will love it.

303
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,760
- Screw him.
- Ussing is whipping up a storm.

304
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,647
It looks like I'm stealing from the poor
to give to the rich.

305
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,084
The crisis, the campaign and Ussing
bring out the lunatics.

306
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,965
We're getting some fan mail
that we could do without.

307
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,721
Yes, and that's why we have to show
ourselves among the homeless

308
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,923
and talk about real issues
and not just rumors.

309
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,767
- I doubt the article will be denied.
- Why not?

310
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,205
The board is trying to work around
Robert Zeuthen-.

311
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,042
He's new and the Board don't share
the family's patriotic feelings.

312
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,448
But Zeuthen is still
at the head of the table.

313
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,408
I won't waste time on a headline

314
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,491
when he's long since promised not
to move more of the company abroad.

315
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,721
My source insists that they will
sidetrack Zeuthen at the meeting.

316
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,969
And that makes his promise worthless.

317
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,890
We can't change
the whole campaign.

318
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,801
Without Zeeland, there is no plan.
It's not a street vendor, you know.

319
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,766
Stoffer, if this fails,
it could cost us the election.

320
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,282
Losing Zeeland will hurt the party.

321
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,803
Yes, but we're handing
the Centre Party to the opposition

322
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,211
if Zeeland gets special treatment.
And we need the Centre Pany.

323
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,644
If you ask the Treasury,
we need Zeeland more.

324
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,971
But you can't count on them?
My brother rebuilt the party!

325
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,883
Save it for the family reunion.
I'll check up on the board meeting.

326
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,483
We'll call a press conference
where you offer Zeeland a goodie.

327
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,164
That's exactly what Ussing wants!
Should I also write on the posters:

328
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,250
"Everyone should contribute
except the rich"?

329
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,569
We don't make a move
until we've talked to the Centre Party.

330
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,331
No, but we can't wait around
all day for them.

331
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,843
- Set up a meeting with Lebech.
- We're off to Danish Industry.

332
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,205
- I'll squeeze in a Lebech meeting.
- She's at an electoral meeting.

333
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,450
- How the hell do you know that?
- I heard it on the radio.

334
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,766
Set up the meeting

335
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,521
and put pressure on Special Branch
<i>so</i> I can meet the homeless.

336
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,009
Yes. He won't change his mind.
It runs in the family.

337
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,606
- Is the Chief still at the event?
- <i>I</i> don't/mow.

338
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,530
<i>What does Special Branch say
about the threat?</i>

339
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,486
Special Branch thinks the perpetrator
is up to something.

340
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,321
But the Chief must be told
why I wasn't there.

341
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,048
<i>I want full focus on the dock.
Collaborate with Special Branch</i>

342
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,084
Yes, okay. I have to go.

343
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,524
The deceased was found there,
and the homeless saw something here.

344
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,009
- We should examine the vessels.
- We did and came up empty.

345
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,251
The dock staff don't know anything.
Let's search the containers.

346
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,201
That's Asbjørn. He just started.
This is the list of ships from Zeeland.

347
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,247
If that's all, I've been called lo HQ.

348
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,684
There must be a spot
the victim swam from.

349
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,646
And it must be close by, because
the perp short-circuited the system.

350
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,889
Why would the perpetrator
be interested in a sailor

351
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,606
if he's after the PM'?
It doesn't make sense.

352
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,089
Don't his tattoos tell you anything
about who he is? Or his ring?

353
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,727
No. But did anyone check
what sailed by here last night?

354
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,970
Someone could have
let off a passenger...

355
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,243
Reinhardt, Zeuthen's assistant.
Did you find anything?

356
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,491
Not yet. I'm Mathias Borch.
This is chief inspector Lund.

357
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,767
Zeuthen is worried about the situation.
He's asked me to lend a hand.

358
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:17,606
- And can you recode your surveillance?
- We're on it. It takes time.

359
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,682
- Any crew problems lately?
- No, we never experience that.

360
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,690
Could a ship arrive here
without you knowing it?

361
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,488
The entire area is monitored around
the clock with sensors and alarms.

362
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,810
- Where could you go unnoticed?
- Nowhere.

363
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,367
Except perhaps
at the old dock by Stubben.

364
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,122
- But you can't load or unload there.
- Let's lake a look at it.

365
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,847
Certainly.
Follow me.

366
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,088
Follow us.

367
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,201
This area has been deserted for years.

368
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,406
We had grand construction plans,
but then the crisis set in.

369
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,448
- Who uses the area?
- Mostly anglers and bird watchers.

370
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,088
- But there are no ships here.
- What's that out there?

371
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,728
MEDEA, an old freight ship.

372
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,323
We sold it to a Latvian shipping company,
but they went bankrupt.

373
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,923
It's been lying at anchor ever since.
It'll probably end up as scrap metal.

374
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,123
- Is it manned?
- Yes, of course.

375
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,642
There are three men on board
just as the rules prescribe.

376
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,326
<i>- Burch.
- Have you spoken to the crew?</i>

377
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,526
Several times. Last night about the
distress signal and again this morning.

378
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,291
They reported
everything okay.

379
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,248
Okay. Yes.

380
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,771
I'll establish contact again,
if you want to go out there.

381
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,081
We would appreciate that. Right?
The dock police has a boat ready.

382
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,047
It was the dock office. A Russian
coaster sailed up the Sound last night.

383
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,404
So thanks for the offer,
but it won't be necessary.

384
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,571
Shouldn't we go out there
and check <i>if...</i>

385
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,763
- It doesn't explain the cameras.
- Asbjom, are you coming?

386
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,724
We still don't know
if he came from the coaster.

387
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,890
It takes days to find that out, and by
then the perpetrator has sailed off.

388
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,243
I don't need
to wait around for that. Bye.

389
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,522
We can reduce our cost
on the shipyard by 40%.

390
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,090
The rise in exchange rates
covers the cost of the move.

391
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,650
So all in all it looks quite feasible.

392
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,130
Nice proposal. But it was planned
for 10-15 years from now.

393
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,801
The final decision
lies in the hands of the Board.

394
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,170
The state of the market
doesn't change overnight.

395
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,241
If the government loses the election,
we'll have four years with a red cabinet.

396
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,002
Yes, and that's why we support
the government's plans.

397
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,566
Robert, I know how you feel.

398
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,968
The company has been
in your family for generations.

399
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,684
I said I didn't want to be disturbed.

400
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,322
I'm sorry, but Maja Zeuthen
has picked up the children from school.

401
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,284
She wants Emilie in treatment
for her allergies

402
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,246
and to take care of the children
for the next few days.

403
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,169
Thank you.

404
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,365
Robert, let's be honest.
This is what the Board wants.

405
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,249
If the PM caves in, fine.
Then we'll postpone it a few years.

406
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,367
We need to speed up the process
and signal that we're prepared <i>to...</i>

407
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,849
I have to leave.
We'll continue the meeting later.

408
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,209
Are you sure you don't want to go?
It'll pass in a few day.

409
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,927
I can't. I've been looking forward to it,
but it won't do.

410
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,650
I'll stay home, too.
We'll do something with the kids.

411
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,489
Look, ifs Dad.

412
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,888
Hi. Come, kids.
Get in my car.

413
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,927
- Come. Where are their things?
- No, come with <i>me...</i>

414
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,888
Come, Carl. Get in the car.

415
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,529
- If you think you'll get custody...
- She has a rash all over her body.

416
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,361
Either you're lying, or she's been
around a cat, and you're clueless.

417
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,769
I know what she's up to when she's
with me. And it's not like this is fatal.

418
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,565
It could actually be quite serious.

419
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,969
An allergic reaction left unattended...

420
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,010
- The children stay with me.
- Stop it. All you think of is the firm.

421
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,489
They are my children, damn it!
You left! You're not there anymore.

422
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,124
I saw the cat when I played at Ida's.

423
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,650
I don't want to live with you.
I only want to live with Dad.

424
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,961
<i>- Yes?
- Reinhardt.</i>

425
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,924
- Emilie, wait.
- Haw did the meeting go?

426
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,489
We're not done. I want
to meet with Komerup in one hour.

427
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,486
- We'll talk about it. Don't say that.
- I'll be home at 11.

428
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,764
You can be with the kids at the house.
I'll let you know when I'll be home.

429
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,121
Then you'll know when to leave.

430
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,445
They were really nice.
Thank you.

431
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,531
And good luck.
Okay. Bye.

432
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,567
So you made it after all.

433
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,209
I wish the circumstances
were different.

434
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,888
There are candles and mattresses.
Have Special Branch stand guard.

435
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,328
What?

436
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,082
There's a good chance the rumors
about Zeeland are true.

437
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,806
I may have to give them something.

438
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,331
How much special treatment
are we talking about?

439
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,321
Enough to make them think twice.

440
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,922
So everyone must contribute
except Zeeland?

441
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,442
I don't have to ask my party
to know that they won't accept it.

442
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,281
What if I offer you
a ministerial post?

443
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,370
In an area that has your interest.

444
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,529
Sure, if we're talking
about the PM's office.

445
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,804
This isn't what we've worked towards.
It goes against all our agreements.

446
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,687
They know they have the upper hand.
If Zeeland wants to pull the plug

447
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,125
there's not a damn thing we can do.
It goes against everything you believe.

448
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,086
- I'm hoping you'll change your mind.
- I won't.

449
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,846
I'll be right out.

450
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,283
- Have a good campaign.
- Thank you.

451
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,004
We don't need the Centre Party.
We can do without them.

452
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,321
It won't be a broad-based government,
but it's still better than nothing.

453
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,367
Sources in Zeeland confirm
that Zeuthen is on his way out.

454
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,884
Special Branch has called off the alarm.
We can visit the homeless now.

455
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,924
Prepare a text,
and let's get it over with.

456
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,605
The PM is calling a press conference
when we return from the dock.

457
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,609
<i>The Prime Minister will comment
on the matter after a visit to the docks.</i>

458
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,568
<i>He'll most likely reduce his demands
on Zeeland. Ussing isn't surprised.</i>

459
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,081
<i>We saw that coming.</i>

460
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,843
<i>Its in line with the social injustice
the government stands for.</i>

461
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,930
- I think the PM should...
- Yes, hi.

462
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,047
I thought you might get lost.
You tum left at the yellow house.

463
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,288
<i>Mum, we can? come.</i>

464
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,569
- <i>Oh...
- Eva's sick. We'll have to postpone,</i>

465
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,251
Okay. Is it serious?

466
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,046
<i>No, it's just the ﬂu.
See you some other time.</i>

467
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,530
Yes, that's fine.
We'll work something out.

468
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,126
Feel better, okay?
And take care.

469
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,242
<i>- See you'
- No, Maw...</i>

470
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,044
<i>Yes?</i>

471
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,971
<i>I know that...</i>

472
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,008
I know I haven't always been there
for you, and that...

473
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,968
I haven't always been good at...

474
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,405
I can see that now.

475
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,808
And I understand
if you're angry at me.

476
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,766
And I understand if you think
I did everything wrong.

477
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,360
- Because I did.
- Mum...

478
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,121
I'd just really like to see you
once in a while.

479
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,610
<i>- I don't have time right now</i>
<i>- Haw about tomorrow?</i>

480
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,044
<i>- Tomorrow's not good either.
- Say when. The “en day'?</i>

481
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,688
- <i>I'd</i> like <i>us to find</i> a <i>date.
- Well, we can't now.</i>

482
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,964
<i>If have to be another day, okay?
Hallo?</i>

483
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,130
Yes. That's fine.
Just let me know.

484
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,050
- <i>Yes,</i> see you.
- Bye-bye.

485
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,370
- Brix.
- It's Lund. Do you have a minute?

486
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,042
No, not really. And I gather
you got the job, so congratulations.

487
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,688
- <i>Are there still people at the dock?</i>
- <i>No. You</i> called <i>them</i> off.

488
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,682
<i>I want to examine a Zeeland ship.
I don't have time to ask permission.</i>

489
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,566
What ship is that? You said
there was nothing there of interest.

490
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,641
<i>And send a team out to Stubben.
There's a shed out there.</i>

491
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,081
<i>I think the perpetrator used it.</i>

492
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,443
- Lund, what's going on?
- I'll call back later.

493
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,927
What the hell is going on? Lund...

494
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,482
How sure are you?

495
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,444
The dock office contacted the ship,
but they never replied.

496
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,448
Damn it, I've given the go-ahead
to the PM at the dock.

497
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,724
You can change that, can't you?
We're heading there now.

498
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,371
Report back when you know more.

499
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,165
- We must go to the conference.
- Thank you.

500
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,206
Thank you all.

501
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,369
Special Branch is rushing us.
They want us out of here immediately.

502
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,568
'Everyone must contribute' is still
the theme, but somewhat adjusted

503
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,446
so that you can point to Zeeland
as a national ﬂagship.

504
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,849
- It's also a signal to Zeeland...
- I get it, Karen.

505
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,805
I hope Zeeland throws an extra
cheque in our campaign fund for this.

506
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,562
- What about Zeeland?
- This is not about Zeeland.

507
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,685
But Zeeland is a vital part
of the government's plan.

508
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,886
The PM will address your questions
at the press conference.

509
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,326
The most important issue...
is to focus on having a society

510
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,364
that helps those who need it.

511
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,882
That is only possible,
if everyone contributes.

512
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,325
So all the speculations about
giving Zeeland special privileges

513
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,522
are simply not true.

514
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,244
There are no special privileges.

515
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,969
When we say everyone must contribute,
we mean everyone.

516
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,405
We must pull together, if we're to help
this country out of the crisis.

517
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,604
<i>I am confident that Zeeland
understands that.</i>

518
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,530
<i>And I call on them
to show consideration.</i>

519
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,801
Good. Please make sure
it's taken care of. Thank you.

520
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,048
I apologise for the delay.

521
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,087
The security company
will stop by your house tomorrow.

522
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,606
They remembered that your system
is connected to the one at the dock.

523
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,521
My apologies. I had to see
what the PM had to say.

524
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,927
What an epitaph.

525
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,840
The usual voter clichés.

526
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,761
Which just makes it easier
for the Board to reach a decision.

527
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,771
Did you get a chance
to evaluate our proposal?

528
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,245
Yes, thank you.

529
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,728
I have no doubt
that we're doing the right thing.

530
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,320
Nor have I.

531
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,446
- I will stick to our 10-year plan.
- I don't understand.

532
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:09,010
You're relieved of your CEO duties
effective immediately.

533
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,806
Ever since I took over from my father,
you've steered your own course.

534
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,730
We no longer have faith in you.

535
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,525
Is this a joke?

536
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,169
- What is going on?
- The Board has been informed.

537
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,285
Your resignation will be officially
adopted at tonight's meeting.

538
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,483
You can't do that.
The Board will back me.

539
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,688
Not when they're asked to consider
that the newspaper has admitted

540
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,325
that it was your headline.

541
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,967
You must have forgotten that we're
the main stockholder of the publisher.

542
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,329
Your personal belongings
have been gathered.

543
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,011
Please leave the building
without further delay.

544
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,402
No. Contact the State Department.
They've waited long enough.

545
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,249
A crisis meeting has been called.
What happened?

546
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,408
Stop it.
He did the right thing.

547
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,208
It's pouring in. The Shipping Association,
Danish Industry...

548
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,006
It had to be done, if we didn't
want to alienate the Centre Party.

549
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,408
So what?
Who cares?

550
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,003
I wasn't hired to seore own goals.
I want to know what's going on.

551
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,886
It was a political decision.
You don't have to agree with it.

552
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,721
- We got word“.
- Have you fallen for Rosa Lebech?

553
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,970
- Karen, stop it!
- I want to know what's going on.

554
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,890
Yes, Stoffer. What?

555
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,970
Zeeland just denied the article.

556
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,564
The CEO is resigning.

557
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,685
They'll make a statement today
in support of your plan.

558
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,529
I'll draw up a press release praising
Zeeland's sense of responsibility.

559
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,803
Yes, and inform the Centre Party
immediately.

560
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:33,405
And leave a copy in Ussing's
pigeon hole with my warm regards.

561
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,967
- What was that? Rosa Lebech?
- I'll tell you later. Let's go.

562
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,926
Don't tell me
you're shagging Rosa Lebech?

563
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,724
I'm in love with her.

564
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,722
No way! We're in the midst of
a campaign. Have you lost your mind?

565
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,320
We're juggling Zeeland and a crisis,

566
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,488
and Special Branch
fear an attack.

567
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,763
And you fall in love
with the leader of our support party.

568
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,601
I'm on top of it. Rosa and the
Centre Party will point to me as PM.

569
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,806
There's no threat from Zeeland
or the dock. Let's go.

570
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,728
Hello?

571
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,803
- Shouldn't there be three of them?
- The third one is our victim.

572
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,081
Get hold of HQ
and have someone notify Borch.

573
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,841
There's no signal.

574
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,528
Why would someone come here
and go berserk because of the PM?

575
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,440
What the hell's going on?

576
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,407
Where are you going?

577
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,287
- To feed the hedgehog.
- The hedgehog? Now?

578
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,804
- Yes, it's okay with Dad.
- Okay. Wait up.

579
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,005
I'll bring Carl.
I just have to brush his teeth.

580
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,248
- <i>Hi,</i> I <i>didn't</i> leave <i>yet.
- I just wanted to check in.</i>

581
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,127
It's better today, but it must be daubed
every day until it clears up.

582
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,244
<i>I'll remember.
What are they doing?</i>

583
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,888
- <i>We 're off to feed a hedgehog.</i>
- <i>Yes, it's something she's</i> taken <i>up.</i>

584
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,402
- I assumed it was okay.
- Yes, of course.

585
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,127
We have to figure out
what pet to get her.

586
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,925
<i>Yes.</i>

587
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,807
Give them a kiss from me.

588
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,962
I will. Bye.

589
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,888
Tread lightly with the firing.

590
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,049
Kornerup
has friends on the Board.

591
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,767
- So do I.
- I know, but still.

592
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:45,367
- I checked out the cat thing.
- We already know.

593
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,123
The nanny said it was
on the other side of the security fence.

594
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,323
It was there one day
and then again the next

595
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,002
but the nanny had made sure
Emilie never touched it.

596
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,284
There's been a cat at the house?
Where?

597
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,803
Across the brook,
but outside the security fence. Why?

598
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,722
Emilie?

599
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,407
Emilie?

600
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,010
Emilie?

601
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,882
Emilie!

602
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,248
Emilie!

603
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,922
Emilie!

604
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,281
Emilie!

605
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,528
Emilie!

606
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,169
Emilie!

607
00:56:13,305 --> 00:57:13,397

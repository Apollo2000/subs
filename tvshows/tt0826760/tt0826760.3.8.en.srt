1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,799
The police are searching for Robert
Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,119
- What are you doing to find her?
- Speak to me.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,799
He may have spared Emilie
and hidden her on the boat.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,959
Give me the book,
then you'll live.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,479
How the hell could he get away?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,959
What have you found?

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,679
Louise Hjelby's crime scene.
He's trying to find the guilty,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,919
with a notebook he's acquired.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,359
I know how it looks, but our task then
was to make sure the PM wasn't tarnished.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,519
Which of the 12 black cars is it?
All he wants is justice, so let's provide it.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,079
- The bullets went through the bag.
- She's alive?

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,319
- We'll start a search right now.
- Where did this iPad come from?

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,759
- I know how he contacted her.
- Thank you very much for the iPad.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,799
- You had faith. I need that faith now.
- That won't bring Emilie back to life.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,639
The police have salvaged
what they thought was Emilie's body.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,079
I tried to keep things separate,
but I'm not as strong as you.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,799
- We can now back you as Prime Minister.
- I hope you don't hold a grudge.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,399
Keep it for when I've appointed my
new cabinet. You'll need it for comfort.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,719
- Didn't you see anybody that night?
- There's only me and the cat man here.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,639
These are the clothes Emilie wore.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,759
No, he couldn't have
shipped her off as freight.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,039
- There were 13 black cars in the book.
- That's the ministerial car.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,279
I'm sorry I didn't notice it earlier.
I'll have to find the guilty one myself.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,279
THE KILLING III

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,359
The PM's department was notified.
Nothing odd has been observed.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,279
- What do you think the man will do?
- We don't know. I want a list of staff.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,999
That's over 300 people. They've all been
vetted, and we have names and ID's.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,159
Are there other entrances
for journalists, workmen, cleaners?

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,719
No. With your limited description of him,
I'm sure everything's under control.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,919
Can I have that list?

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,839
No one in Special Branch knew
that the PM's car was in Jutland then.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,079
- Or that a page was missing.
- Well, it didn't tear itself out.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,039
- Can I have that list?
- We haven't touched that page.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,599
- It still seems to be about Ussing.
- Except the perp says it's not.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,759
There you are.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,199
What about CCTV? I'd like to see
who arrived within the last hour.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,439
- As I said, everyone's been checked.
- Good, but I want to see that footage.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,279
- Lund speaking.
- It's Brix. What the hell is happening?

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,479
Thank you and good luck
in the election.

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,319
All three are strong believers
in our crisis plan and the welfare state.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,239
Why didn't I hear about you sacking
the treasurer beforehand?

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,439
Because you wouldn't have agreed.
Did Stoffer go to the meeting already?

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,759
No, he's at some security briefing.
Even so, we could have discussed it.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,239
I can't have a minister who's against me.
Let's just find Stoffer and go.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,679
Going solo makes you very vulnerable,
and you don't need any further unrest.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,159
I don't want any more hitches.
We've finished with Rosa Lebech.

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,119
We're in a strong position. Ussing being
a suspect has knocked out the opposition.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,079
- We just need to get Emilie back home.
- There's also something odd going on.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,559
In the archives I noticed that
our driving report from then is missing.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,039
- What driving report?
- The one that outlines...

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,399
According to security, Emilie Zeuthen's
kidnapper may be here at Christiansborg.

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,719
- He's here?
- We need to get back to the department.

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,479
- Come on now.
- Honestly...

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,279
- We've checked everyone properly.
- This could take all night.

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,559
Maybe the perp conned you,
and he's out to get Ussing.

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,999
No, Ussing showed up at HQ
with his lawyer and is not a suspect.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,879
- I need the list for the last hour.
- What do you mean?

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,439
Apparently Ussing has an alibi
for when the girl disappeared.

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,199
He was at a hotel with a woman
on his staff, and she's confirmed it.

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,039
This is unacceptable. People need
to get home on planes and trains.

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,359
A photocopier service was here
for a few hours this afternoon.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,479
But 20 minutes ago, one of them returned
and showed his ID after working hours.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,359
All their staff are security approved.
They often come when things are quiet.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,879
His ID is also approved
for the PM's department.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,039
Where is he right now?

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,159
How do you play it forward?

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,239
He said he'd forgotten to change
a printer cartridge at the secretariat.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,199
- Is that the secretariat?
- That's the PM department's red zone.

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,399
What are they saying?
Why is Emilie Zeuthen's kidnapper here?

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,999
It's probably just a false alarm.
Shit, we'll be late for that meeting!

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,279
We'd like you in the safe room.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,959
- Let's go.
- Where's Karen?

74
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,839
A report had gone missing.
She's looking for a backup.

75
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,279
Excuse me.

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,039
Excuse me, can I help you?

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,119
Hello, I'm talking to you.

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,479
He's been spotted around here.
He's wearing a cap.

79
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,559
- I'll go that way.
- You two come with me.

80
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,719
I don't bloody believe this!

81
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,759
You saw him
meddling with the servers?

82
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,479
- Only his back.
- Why didn't you get him?

83
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,919
Stop. Let's get everyone out
except the technicians.

84
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,279
She's one of us.
The perp has stolen a hard drive.

85
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,999
- What's on that hard drive?
- We don't know yet.

86
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,719
First of all, why did
the perpetrator come here?

87
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,599
To find out who drove the ministerial car
on a certain date two and a half years ago.

88
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,759
Sarah Lund, CID.
This is Mathias Borch, Special Branch.

89
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,879
The ministerial car wasn't used
during the election campaign.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,199
A boy saw the car and wrote down
the licence plate on April 20th.

91
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,559
- The day the girl in the old case...
- But it couldn't have been that car.

92
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,279
Why is the perpetrator interested
in my car being in Jutland?

93
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,079
- Ussing is involved in this, not the PM.
- Ussing is no longer a suspect.

94
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,399
The perp kidnapped Emilie Zeuthen,
because the old case was never solved.

95
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,719
We have to investigate
every lead we get.

96
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,959
- So you think that we're involved?
- Not necessarily.

97
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,359
We know for a fact that
your ministerial car was over there.

98
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,919
We just want to know who drove it.

99
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,199
It's in your best interests to answer.
The perp took a hard drive,

100
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,639
containing every detail about your car.
Who drove it and where, GPS information.

101
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,279
So am I or anyone in my department
suspected of involvement in a killing?

102
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,999
- Let's sit down and talk about this.
- The conversation ends here.

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,639
You're wrong, and one thing's for sure,
the PM didn't drive that car on that day.

104
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,319
The page in the notebook
with your car on it was torn out.

105
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,079
- There's something you're not telling.
- Do you know who you're talking to?

106
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,039
Tell us who drove it. Someone pressed
a public prosecutor to drop the case.

107
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,959
If you know something,
now is the time to tell us.

108
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,719
We'll be in touch.

109
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,599
That was great.
Terrific!

110
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,479
We've now checked the harbour
and all the containers.

111
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,479
Unfortunately, we haven't found
any clues to where Emilie may be.

112
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,559
- Was the iPad sent to the police?
- Yes, but we haven't heard back yet.

113
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,479
They found a place in the harbour.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,959
The police say there are signs
that Emilie was there briefly

115
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,079
before he sent her on
and abandoned the boat.

116
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,279
- Signs that she's alive?
- They didn't say.

117
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,599
Sent on to where?

118
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,279
The police think she may have been
put on a ship going abroad.

119
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,679
Possibly in a container.
23 freighters were in Øresund that night.

120
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,719
The problem is,
that it was three days ago.

121
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,519
The ships have reloaded, and the number
Emilie could be onboard has doubled.

122
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,079
I want those ships
and terminals checked out.

123
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,439
- Several of the ships are at sea.
- Call them back. We'll foot the bill.

124
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,239
Robert, even if we pay for it,
that won't be enough.

125
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,079
We can't buy certainty.
She may have been put ashore.

126
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,719
All the calls about the reward -
was there nothing useful?

127
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,439
No, unfortunately, not yet.

128
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,759
Notify the freighters
and keep taking the calls.

129
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,199
Any news?

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,799
I'm calling Carl to say goodnight.

131
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,559
I just want to hear his voice.

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,639
It's not your fault.

133
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,279
I didn't know about the iPad...

134
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,559
...or that she was sitting in the attic
talking to the perpetrator.

135
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,879
She was angry with us -
with both of us.

136
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,519
You told me that we would find her,
so I know that we will.

137
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,999
OK?

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,919
OK.

139
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,919
If there are any more calls,
then forward them to me. Thanks.

140
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,279
People can't get through to the police.
Now they're calling Zeeland directly.

141
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,159
A reward of a hundred million
was sure to make people act like maniacs.

142
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,439
I see what's happening with Robert.

143
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,479
He's being the same man
that he's always been.

144
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,119
Unreasonable with you
and inattentive to the kids.

145
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,999
There's the cat, the iPad,

146
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,999
and Zeeland could be to blame for all
of this, because they're hiding something.

147
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,399
Robert and Zeeland are not to blame
for anything, and the police agree.

148
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,479
Hey...

149
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,439
...you know that I'd do anything for you.

150
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,559
- Maja...
- I'd like to go home to Carl now.

151
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,839
The chart and container number indicates
she was shipped off, but no specifics.

152
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,359
Send a copy to Zeuthen
when you're done.

153
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,959
Didn't she leave us any clues?

154
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,999
- If she was here, it was only briefly.
- Is there anything on the perp?

155
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,319
Lots of fingerprints we can't identify.

156
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,119
The homeless say he kept to himself.

157
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,879
And the connection with Louise's mother?
Any clues to who he may be?

158
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,879
He's kept a photo of her which was taken
long before she fell ill with cancer.

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,439
The perp stole a hard drive.
He needs a computer to see what's on it.

160
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,919
We'll start with libraries
and internet cafés. I'll call you back.

161
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,919
Someone has to know something.
What about the photocopier service?

162
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,959
The man broke into the company car
and stole clothes and ID.

163
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,199
The cameras show that he's limping.
It's impressive that you didn't get him.

164
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,639
Then what?

165
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,119
No news. The Prime Minister's department
will have to tell us what they know.

166
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,879
If anything. So far, it's just a claim
based on scribbles in a boy's notebook.

167
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,679
I wish I'd known about them 12 hours ago,
when you said you'd told us everything.

168
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,879
- We weren't aware of it.
- Clearly. Was the PM's car in Jutland?

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,999
You're not helping Emilie
by clamming up all the time.

170
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,839
The election didn't allow time to watch
the PM's car. His department rejects it.

171
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,279
The page with the ministerial car
was torn out which indicates...

172
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,599
That's speculation. It could have been
the public prosecutor or the boy himself.

173
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,879
We need to show the perp
that we want to solve the case.

174
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,479
- No, we need to find the perp.
- That's what we're doing, damn it!

175
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,759
Borch, come here.
Borch, come here.

176
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,839
Ask management to let us question and
search the Prime Minister's department.

177
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,239
A young boy collecting licence plates
won't convince management.

178
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,919
Then come up with something.
Otherwise we risk the perp never calling.

179
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,399
I've had the container numbers sent
to Zeeland. I'll go hear their opinion.

180
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,879
I've just received a complaint from
the PM's department. What's going on?

181
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,479
- There's a reason for what we've done.
- First the opposition and now the PM.

182
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,079
- We'll send them a sincere apology.
- Ruth... Ruth...

183
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,839
...we need to talk.

184
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,759
I want rid of these accusations,
and I want the ministerial car checked out.

185
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,919
The hard disk
and the driving report are missing.

186
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,959
I'm looking for the driver.

187
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,719
We've cancelled this evening's meetings.
I rescheduled the sponsors for tomorrow.

188
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,719
- What are the drivers saying?
- They'll call us back.

189
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,679
No, call them in. If Emilie's life
depends on it, I'll ask them myself.

190
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,079
There's no reason to talk to anyone.

191
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,439
I'm the one who took the report
this afternoon.

192
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,199
I didn't want the police to have it
before talking to you.

193
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,519
The ministerial car was driven then.

194
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,679
Who drove the car?

195
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,199
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It was your son, damn it!

196
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,559
It was Benjamin who drove the car.

197
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,199
A demonstration against the banks' part
in the financial crisis went sour.

198
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,879
Benjamin was recognised by police
as one of the troublemakers.

199
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,159
He was only 17. They called me
to get in touch with you.

200
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,719
I asked a driver to pick him up and
bring him to Jutland where we were.

201
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,239
When they arrived at the hotel, Benjamin
stole the keys and took off in the car.

202
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,039
The driver wrote as follows.
"April 20th. Passenger: Benjamin Kamper."

203
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,279
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't want you involved in it.

204
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,319
I promised Benjamin not to tell you.

205
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,839
He wanted to provoke. He was angry,
and he'd had a few drinks.

206
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,639
How long was he gone with the car?

207
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,039
I found him late at night.
He called me from some bus station.

208
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,239
He was feeling down
and he'd run out of petrol.

209
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,799
- And you still didn't say a word.
- Did he meet the girl?

210
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,559
No, he drove around until he broke down.
Then I sent him back to Copenhagen.

211
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,959
I want a full account of when he arrived,
what happened and when he was found.

212
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,559
- Anything else you've lied about?
- No.

213
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,079
You're telling it all to the police.

214
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,079
If this comes out, it'll look as if we
put pressure on the public prosecutor.

215
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,559
I don't give a damn. The police
need to know as soon as possible.

216
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,319
You'd better look at this.

217
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,839
We're investigating a series of events
in the Prime Minister's department,

218
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,599
and we'll continue until we get
some satisfactory answers.

219
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,159
- What's it about?
- I can't comment any further on it.

220
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,959
But we're not missing any opportunity
to get Emilie Zeuthen back alive.

221
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,359
I'll start answering phones
and preparing a press release.

222
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,199
- Then there's your ex, Benjamin's mum.
- Well, just leave that to me.

223
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,719
Would you please keep Stoffer away
from me? I don't want to see him.

224
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,879
Of course.

225
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,399
Chairman Gilsfort has heard about the
accusations against the Prime Minister.

226
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,999
He wants a briefing.
I'll handle that.

227
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,599
And there's someone here
from the police.

228
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,639
You know the one.
She says it's important.

229
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,679
Unless you know where Emilie is
we've nothing to talk about.

230
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,079
I understand, but did you look
at the container numbers I sent you?

231
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,359
You listed all the containers in port three
days ago. We've searched most of them.

232
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,039
We'll inform the police abroad.
Are some containers more likely to...

233
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,399
- No. And what about the iPad?
- The technicians are working on it.

234
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,839
- It offers an explanation...
- That was Maja. She's in the basement.

235
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,359
I need some information about former
employees. It'll only take a minute.

236
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,159
Unfortunately, we're all quite busy.

237
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,919
We still think the old murder case
is the key to finding Emilie.

238
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,679
The perp is the biological father
of the girl who was killed.

239
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,559
We have already provided
personnel records and photos.

240
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,119
He's no oil rig worker. The man we're
after has extensive technical knowledge.

241
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,119
He knows everything about the harbour.
It's also in Zeuthen's interest...

242
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,439
Don't tell me about Zeuthen's interests.
I know them better than you.

243
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,879
Then help me. We're looking for
an engineer or someone like that.

244
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,279
His employment must have changed,
when the girl died.

245
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,399
Two and a half years ago,
our staff turnover was high.

246
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,519
Why?

247
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,599
The crisis was biting.
Many in the business had gone under.

248
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,359
Zeeland took over a number of companies
and their employees,

249
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,319
but we lost some.

250
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,319
I need those personnel records
to see if anything stands out.

251
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,239
- Right. I'll put it in motion.
- Thanks.

252
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,519
Just so that we understand each other...

253
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,119
If Emilie loses her life
because of an old murder case

254
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,519
that you haven't solved properly,

255
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,399
it would be unbearable
for Robert Zeuthen,

256
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,599
and it would have consequences
that neither you nor I could imagine.

257
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,999
Hi.

258
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,319
Can we stay at yours
in the guest room?

259
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,239
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, dear boy.

260
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,639
Just until we find something else.

261
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
Of course.
Come, let's go home.

262
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,199
Thank you.

263
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,999
I'll get someone to pick up your car.

264
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,879
We've been briefed by
the Prime Minister's department.

265
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,239
They admit the PM's car was in Jutland
around the time of the murder.

266
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,159
It was the PM's 17-year-old son
who took off in the car.

267
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,599
- The driver's report confirms it.
- What was his son doing there?

268
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,239
A sad story about the son getting
upset with the dad and driving around.

269
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,159
The report supposedly just fell
behind a bookcase this afternoon.

270
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,919
How do we know that this is correct?

271
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,679
The PM's brother, Kristoffer Kamper
witnessed the episode.

272
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,839
He's willing to talk to us
tomorrow morning.

273
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,239
I'VE MOVED IN WITH A FRIEND.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. EVA.

274
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,839
- We need to bring in the son.
- Lund, you should try to keep up.

275
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,999
The son died.

276
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,879
The official story was,
that it was an accident,

277
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,399
but to the best of my knowledge,
it was a suicide.

278
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,639
It happened a few weeks
after Kamper won the election.

279
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,639
Special Branch doesn't believe that
it could be the son. We'll press on.

280
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,639
- We'll call the brother in for a chat.
- OK.

281
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,719
Keep your phone turned on.

282
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,279
Hopefully the perp calls you.

283
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,239
I've been outside for half an hour.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

284
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,479
If you've heard about the PM's son
then you know they're hiding something.

285
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,279
- Of course there's more to it than that.
- What do you want?

286
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,959
This is information on the PM's son.
I wanted to make sure you had it.

287
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,199
- I could have gotten it tomorrow.
- Yes.

288
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,319
I won't be there tomorrow.

289
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,359
They've taken me off the case.
I'm to stay away.

290
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,279
I'm sorry if I've been
a jerk to you.

291
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,199
I should have told you everything
from the beginning.

292
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,279
But I really don't know what happened
to that page in the notebook.

293
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,199
I hope you believe that.

294
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,359
The kidnapping of Emilie Zeuthen
is said to be tied to an old murder case.

295
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,439
Is it true that the PM's car
is part of the investigation?

296
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,759
- Hi. What's your name?
- Astrid.

297
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,599
I'm Kristian.
Shall we take a couple of pictures?

298
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,279
That's it. Thank you.
Take care of yourselves.

299
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,799
I'm trying to tell Zeuthen's assistant
about the situation we're in.

300
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,479
He hasn't replied.

301
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,039
Stoffer is with the police
and we're calling it a briefing.

302
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,879
- How long are we here for?
- First a tour with Ussing and the press,

303
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,839
and then you're having a chat
with the kids in the yard.

304
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,959
- There's something we need to discuss.
- It's obvious the school needs a boost.

305
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,639
Benjamin wasn't found until later.
He went missing for almost 12 hours.

306
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,679
He wanted to be alone.
Stoffer said there was nothing to it.

307
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,679
He took his own life
less than two weeks later.

308
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,519
- The police will link the two things.
- There is no connection.

309
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,639
- He had depression.
- Hello, welcome.

310
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,519
The kids are getting into their seats.
Would you mind waiting for a minute?

311
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,239
- Not at all.
- We can go in here.

312
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,839
Nice drawings. A splash of colour
on the walls brightens things up.

313
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,959
Certainly.

314
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,079
I was surprised to hear that your
ministerial car was in the spotlight.

315
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,159
- I won't use it here in the run up.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,519
But don't show me any consideration.

317
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,279
That's exactly what my staff told me.

318
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,359
I would be within my rights to, after
your move with that unreliable witness.

319
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,279
You'll have to take that up
with your own conscience.

320
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,439
I have to follow the fact
that the old case was covered up,

321
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,599
and now someone has a clear motive.

322
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,999
Your brother took his time
in coming forward with the truth.

323
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,639
Do his contacts in the state apparatus
include a certain public prosecutor?

324
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,559
- No, and you shouldn't say that.
- Of course you would say that.

325
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,479
Otherwise, things would look bad with
Zeeland and the Emilie Zeuthen case.

326
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,959
- Shall we get started?
- The police want to talk to you.

327
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,519
What about?

328
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,719
I'm sorry but I think they're
suspecting Benjamin of the murder.

329
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,159
Benjamin Kamper, A-levels,
mentally unstable,

330
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,559
and diagnosed as being bi-polar,
or manic-depressive.

331
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,599
Politically active on the far left,
associated with several red rags etc.

332
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,279
After the trip to Jutland
things suddenly go downhill.

333
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,959
He takes off from home again
and walks in front of a freight train.

334
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,479
Hi, this is Eva,
leave a message.

335
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,919
According to Kristoffer Kamper,
Benjamin wasn't anywhere near Louise.

336
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,599
- And the former Zeeland employees?
- We can't wait for them to send records.

337
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,799
Lund, the perp hasn't contacted you.

338
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,839
There won't be any room for us
at this particular address,

339
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,159
if we tear open the PM's personal wounds
for no reason during an election.

340
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,959
It must be him. That would explain
why a public prosecutor covered it up.

341
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,039
Yes.
I'll ask around again.

342
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,999
It's up to the Prime Minister himself,
if he wants to meet with us.

343
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,079
Even though the material is impressive,
you shouldn't trust Mathias Borch.

344
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,119
Is that understood?

345
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,679
We haven't heard from the places where
he could have checked the hard disk.

346
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,159
- What's happened to Borch?
- He's off the case. And Louise's mom?

347
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:06,999
Monika Hjelby lived by the yacht harbour.
I'm looking for a Birgit. About Borch...

348
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,959
Borch was taken off the case.
I don't know any more.

349
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,199
Was it down to you?

350
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,959
Were you pissed off
about what happened in Jutland?

351
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,079
Listen, I have no idea.

352
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,879
Then why the hell is his wife
sitting out there waiting to talk to you?

353
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,119
Hello.
Sarah Lund.

354
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,559
I'm on my way out,
so maybe you should have called.

355
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,199
He came home late last night.

356
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,679
He didn't come to bed.

357
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,279
I found him in the living room.

358
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,559
I thought it was the case that he was
so obsessed with, but it wasn't.

359
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,519
He says that he's in love
with someone else.

360
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,159
I assume that it's you.

361
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,079
Were you together
on that trip to Jutland?

362
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,599
Are you in love with him?

363
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,919
You may have been a couple once
and left things unfinished,

364
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,679
but we have two girls,
and he's their dad.

365
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,959
I want you to leave him alone.

366
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,439
Lund, let's go. The PM's department
has given us the green light.

367
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,279
We sympathise with you,
but we also have a business to run.

368
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,999
- Can we talk about this later?
- You can run it with good reason.

369
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,359
Uncertainty is spreading in the company.
We need to send out clear signals.

370
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,839
I'm asking you to drop the reins now
and let us appoint a managing director.

371
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,279
I have always counted on your support.
I can't accept Zeeland moving abroad.

372
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,959
- I'd reconsider in light of the press.
- We have a deal with the government.

373
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,599
Zeeland stays here.

374
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,599
The PM's department's
being investigated.

375
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,239
My managerial duties can be covered
by the other directors on the Board.

376
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,119
If that's not the case,
we've hired the wrong people.

377
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,599
Make sure it all works out.

378
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,519
I shall emphasise to Gilsfort,
that he is to leave you alone,

379
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,799
and communicate directly with me.

380
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,079
Is there anything else?

381
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,719
Emilie could be on board 15 freighters
and at six terminals around Europe.

382
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,999
How much is left to go?

383
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,959
Though we've paid, it's difficult
to get access to the last terminals.

384
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,079
Rotterdam, Hamburg, Stavanger
and St Petersburg.

385
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,399
The police can't step in.

386
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,439
I'll speak to the
shipping companies myself.

387
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,599
Have my plane prepared.

388
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,119
I'll go to Hamburg and Rotterdam.
You'll go to Stavanger and St Petersburg.

389
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,359
I didn't know that Benjamin
went to Jutland in the ministerial car.

390
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,799
My brother tried to spare our family.
I regret that. That's all I can say.

391
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,559
Your son took off in the car around
the time when a local girl disappeared.

392
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,879
She was raped and killed
in an old boat builder's yard.

393
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,959
- The PM is aware of the case, thank you.
- Your son was manic-depressive.

394
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,959
How was he feeling during the days
after the episode in Jutland?

395
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,439
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- Not that I can think of.

396
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,719
Were you in contact?
Did you speak?

397
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,959
Yes, of course I spoke to my son.

398
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,719
From time to time
he'd go into his own shell.

399
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,959
But neither my former wife or I
had noticed things getting worse.

400
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,279
- So you thought that he was depressive?
- He was depressive.

401
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,319
He had stopped taking his medicine,
and we found out too late.

402
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,919
Well, is there anything else?

403
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,919
We've looked into Benjamin's activities
in the weeks after the trip to Jutland.

404
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,879
His absence from school became marked,
he quit his part time job,

405
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,519
and according to his school friends,
was buying a lot of beer and spirits.

406
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:41,999
All symptoms that something was wrong -
and still you didn't find it unusual?

407
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,319
We assumed that it was his illness.
My former wife and I aren't doctors.

408
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,719
And I wasn't around much
at that time.

409
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,119
- Did he ever react like this before?
- The PM has already answered.

410
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,879
Benjamin had experienced something
that he couldn't live with.

411
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,719
The night before he disappeared,
he turned up at the psychiatric care unit.

412
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,479
He expressed deep anxiety
and asked to be admitted.

413
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,599
But staff informed him that as a minor,
he needed his parents consent.

414
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,039
Then he left, but he had repeatedly
told the psychiatrist on duty,

415
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,199
that "he had done something that
his father would never forgive him for".

416
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,759
The psychiatrist advised Benjamin
to go home and talk to his father.

417
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,439
Did he?

418
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,799
That particular evening
I came home very late.

419
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,719
I thought that everyone was asleep,

420
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,719
but Benjamin was awake,
and came downstairs to see me.

421
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,639
He asked if we could sit down
together in the kitchen for a while.

422
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,159
We hadn't done that for a long time...

423
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,639
...so it made me very happy.

424
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,759
He was struggling to express
the things he wanted to say,

425
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,999
and I was very tired.

426
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,839
In the end he said,
that it didn't really matter,

427
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,799
and then he went up to his room.

428
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,119
In the morning, I made breakfast
and went up to wake him...

429
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,519
...the bed was empty.
He was gone.

430
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,959
This may not mean anything.
He was often like that.

431
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,719
Unapproachable, restless.

432
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,439
If your son committed murder,
there'll still be traces in the car concerned.

433
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,759
Our technicians can find traces
that are several years old.

434
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,799
- He didn't do this. It's ridiculous.
- This is where it ends.

435
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,079
What did Benjamin say that night?
Did he confess or mention the girl?

436
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,839
Regardless of what Benjamin said,
it's trivial, because he's innocent.

437
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,479
The stolen hard drive was found
at an internet café 15 minutes ago.

438
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,839
It confirms that the ministerial car
was nowhere near the crime scene.

439
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,999
- What evidence do you have of that?
- The car's route is indicated here.

440
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,839
The car had GPS, and the information
was on the hard drive. I'm truly sorry.

441
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,759
We'll expect an apology. I trust
that you won't waste any more time.

442
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,639
What happened? Did you press him?
What did they say?

443
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,439
The ministerial car was nowhere near
the crime scene. The GPS proves it.

444
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,199
GPS? What GPS?

445
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,679
We have no trace of the perp
and no trace of Emilie. Nothing.

446
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,039
You're not giving up because of GPS.

447
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,399
- Did you ask about the boy?
- Yes, I did.

448
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,999
And If you doubt me,
feel free to go and ask yourself.

449
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,279
What about the perp?

450
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,919
Do you have the notebook?

451
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,639
We've checked all 13 black cars
from that day. There's nothing else.

452
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,479
Give me the notebook.

453
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,039
One of the owners is a lady who claims
her car wasn't in Jutland that day.

454
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,959
Maybe the boy got the date wrong.

455
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,199
Your wife stopped by today.

456
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,999
I don't want you to...

457
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,679
Don't ruin anything.

458
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,439
I'm standing outside the place
where we found the hard drive.

459
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,839
If the perp knows that the information
on it is useless, he won't be pleased.

460
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,919
I'll look for witnesses.

461
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,079
Birthe, who knew Monika Hjelby,
is at the harbour.

462
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,239
I've told her we'll stop by,
but I can't handle everything.

463
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,919
I'll borrow this one.

464
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,079
- I need to go now.
- The perp won't give up.

465
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,799
- And neither will you.
- I have to go now.

466
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,959
Did you see him by the computer?

467
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,479
Many people sit by the computers.
I don't know who they are.

468
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,639
He brought in a hard drive.

469
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,039
- Could anybody have seen him?
- What about the girl?

470
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,639
The perp was last seen here
an hour ago in a blue estate car.

471
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,599
Check if one has been reported stolen.
The man is injured and needs treatment.

472
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,079
Hospitals and casualty units.

473
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,359
- We're checking it all again.
- No, you'll wait for Special Branch.

474
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,959
- You gave the green light to go on TV.
- Now Special Branch sets the agenda.

475
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,199
You do as they say,
and get Sarah Lund under control.

476
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,879
Have her make coffee,
while I clean up your mess.

477
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,599
What are you looking at?
We'll keep going until we get it in writing.

478
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,519
The plane is ready.

479
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,279
I've informed the company
in Rotterdam of your arrival.

480
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,799
I'll go and visit Gilsfort
and then I'll go home to pack.

481
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,119
- Thanks, I appreciate that.
- Don't mention it.

482
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,279
Anette is staying in our house
in France with the girls.

483
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,759
I may as well be of some use.
I'll call you with any news.

484
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,359
Can I interrupt you for a moment?

485
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,719
We've been contacted
by a Swedish yachtsman.

486
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,879
I think he may have seen something.

487
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,239
We have him next door.

488
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,239
What did you see?

489
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,199
Four nights ago
I was out sailing in Øresund.

490
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,679
It was 3 o'clock at night and freezing cold
and I was sitting at the helm.

491
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,559
Suddenly I heard a motor boat
sailing by at high speed.

492
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,679
It didn't have any lights,
which I found a bit odd.

493
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,879
Shortly after, I passed a coaster,
and then I saw the motor boat.

494
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,239
It had berthed.

495
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:33,519
And then I saw a child
walking on board with a man.

496
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,439
Why did you come to us
instead of going to the police?

497
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,439
The police? I did try to contact them,
but I couldn't get through.

498
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,799
So you claim to have seen my daughter
while sailing Øresund on a yacht,

499
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,799
in 18-20 metres a second winds,
in the dark at three o'clock at night?

500
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,319
Yes.

501
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,839
Show this man out.

502
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,199
150 centimetres tall, 40 kilos.

503
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,959
Long blond hair.

504
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,159
Black trainers.

505
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,519
Blue rain clothes
and no life jacket.

506
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,759
I couldn't help seeing,
I was only 30-40 metres away.

507
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,559
They had a work lamp on,
so I could see clearly.

508
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,439
- I don't know If I should say this.
- What?

509
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,559
She appeared to be waving.

510
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,359
What was the name of the coaster?
What was the ship called?

511
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,919
I'd like to tell you but let's deal
with the practicalities first.

512
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,279
If you're telling me the truth,
you'll have the reward as promised.

513
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,999
I would appreciate it if I could
get some kind of guarantee,

514
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,799
in the form of a written contract,
and 2% of the reward up front, thanks.

515
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,039
We don't have any cash here.

516
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,839
I can wait.

517
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,359
I'll put it in motion right away.
Tell me more.

518
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,479
I'd rather wait.

519
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,919
Can I offer you anything?

520
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,719
Yes,
a cup of tea with milk, please.

521
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,839
Thanks.

522
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,519
Are you Birthe?

523
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,639
- Who's asking?
- Sarah Lund.

524
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,599
You knew Monika Hjelby,
Louise's mother.

525
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,959
I let a flat to her for ten years,
right up here.

526
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,759
Monika just turned up one day.

527
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,319
She was pregnant... and a bit posh.

528
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,679
She needed a place for three months,
but she ended up staying.

529
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,399
- Did you ever meet Louise's dad?
- No.

530
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,319
She went on about some guy,
but he never came.

531
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,439
Nothing new in that.

532
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,159
- Was she in contact with Louise's dad?
- No.

533
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,959
Did a man stop by at any time?

534
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,559
- Yes, someone came after she died.
- Who was that?

535
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,319
- He said he was an old acquaintance.
- What did he want?

536
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,999
He probably asked about Monika.

537
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,159
And...

538
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,639
I told him the truth.
She's resting at Amager Cemetery.

539
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,919
Did he ask about anything else?

540
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,119
No, I just told him that Louise
was in a children's home.

541
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,719
What did he look like?
Any particular characteristics?

542
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,519
I don't remember.
He was very ordinary.

543
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,479
He didn't seem to know that Monika
had a daughter. I never saw him again.

544
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,679
Hi, it's Eva Lauersen's midwife.

545
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,039
This is not a good time.

546
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,199
- Can you help me contact your son?
- Why?

547
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,599
Eva was brought in yesterday
with severe abdominal pains.

548
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,319
- She may give birth prematurely.
- Is it serious?

549
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,959
It's too early to say,
but we'd like to speak to Mark. Hello?

550
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,599
I'll try and get hold of him.

551
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,039
Thank you.
Goodbye.

552
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,599
I have to go. A colleague will come
and ask about the children's home.

553
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,799
All I know is that
it wasn't a council home.

554
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,719
- Monika had applied to a family fund.
- What family fund?

555
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,919
For some time before she died,
she could feel the end approaching.

556
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,319
She wanted to do
something good for Louise,

557
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,479
so I helped her write
a few applications.

558
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,599
We received a positive answer
from the Zeeland Children's Fund.

559
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,559
- She was very happy about it.
- What fund? Zeeland?

560
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,039
Yes, they help people like Monika,
who are on their own with a child.

561
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,679
The Zeuthen family may be filthy rich,
but I still feel sorry for them.

562
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,239
They've helped so many children,
and now they're dealing with this shit.

563
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,439
Thank you.

564
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,599
Voters need clarity on the government's
responsibility in the Zeuthen case.

565
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,039
We're neither responsible for the
financial crisis nor the kidnapping.

566
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,839
A crime was covered up. Does the PM
even want the truth to come out?

567
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,559
Would you turn that off?
Thank you.

568
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,119
I've just heard from Zeeland.
They seem to have confidence in us.

569
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,079
- They're still backing our crisis plan.
- Karen, that time in Jutland...

570
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,719
- Didn't you hear anything from Stoffer?
- No, he didn't tell me anything.

571
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,279
Why?

572
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,719
The police are right.

573
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,479
Benjamin did change after that.

574
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,199
I don't know
why I didn't notice.

575
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,199
Today, it's completely clear.

576
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,359
Isn't it always like that
with hindsight?

577
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,119
Don't worry about the police's
guesswork about Benjamin.

578
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,519
Kristoffer has told them
what happened.

579
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,119
You loved your son,
and I'm sure that he knew that.

580
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,439
I saw you on TV.
You did well with Ussing.

581
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,759
What happened in Jutland?

582
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,839
Something happened to Benjamin.
Tell me what it was.

583
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,679
Kristian, leave it alone.

584
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,559
What happened, damn it?

585
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,839
He called me from the bus station.
He was very upset.

586
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,719
- Did he do anything to the girl?
- No, but something had rattled him.

587
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,239
He drove around looking for you,
to cause trouble in front of the press.

588
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,279
He'd seen something
that he wanted to tell us about.

589
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,959
It was the usual left-wing nonsense,
that we were brown-nosing big business.

590
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,679
- Why didn't you sent him on to me?
- I wanted him to leave you alone.

591
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,559
He fucked things up for us.

592
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,199
You'd fought hard for that election,
and we couldn't let him ruin that.

593
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,799
- What did you do?
- He couldn't be around the microphones.

594
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,759
I put him on the bus back to Copenhagen
and told him to pull himself together.

595
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,799
He threatened to go to the press.
The boy was crazy.

596
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,039
What was it that he saw?

597
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,039
It was something about Karen.
She was in Zeeland's pocket.

598
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,799
She met secretly with them
behind your back.

599
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,359
What meetings?

600
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,039
Someone from Zeeland came,
and she had a meeting with him.

601
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,199
He didn't even know who it was.

602
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,519
The money is on its way.

603
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,519
Reinhardt asked me to tell you that
the meeting with the chairman went well.

604
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,599
- Where is he? I'd like to talk to him.
- He wants the money first.

605
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,719
We've checked him out.
Everything seems to be in order.

606
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,959
The police are here. Now we
can start questioning the witness.

607
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,239
- I don't believe I called the police.
- No, but we need to verify his story.

608
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,799
He described her blue rain clothes.

609
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,559
He couldn't have known about that.

610
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,639
We found the rain clothes at the place,
where she had a change of clothes.

611
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,879
- Where is he?
- He asked how to get to the basement.

612
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,079
- He was picking something up in his car.
- Close off the building.

613
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,279
Robert, what's happening?
Where is he?

614
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,519
- He went into one of our computers.
- We need reinforcements at Zeeland.

615
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,679
The perp may still be in the building.

616
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,119
- I was told you were here. I called.
- I'm on my way out the door.

617
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,919
We've sent you
the last personnel records.

618
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,039
I have a couple of urgent questions
about Zeeland's Children's Fund.

619
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,879
If we can do it
while I'm closing up...

620
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,519
The Children's Fund
is part of our CSR strategy.

621
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,879
We take on a social responsibility
and help the weakest in society.

622
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,959
We do good things for children
in several countries.

623
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,439
Why is this relevant?

624
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:21,479
Louise lived in a home called Majgården
sponsored by your children's fund.

625
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,719
- It was closed, there are no records.
- The fund must have had their reasons.

626
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,839
They want what's best for the children.
I need to catch a plane.

627
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,039
I think the perpetrator contacted
the children's home to see the girl.

628
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,439
There must be something in the old case.
Maybe even his name.

629
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,999
If your fund ran the home,
then they may have a copy of the case.

630
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,759
It's important. I need that case
if I'm to find Emilie Zeuthen.

631
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,279
- I'll see if I can find a contact person.
- Thanks.

632
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,839
- Yes.
- It's Borch.

633
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,439
We couldn't find the car

634
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,959
because the numbers
were written by a seven-year-old.

635
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,919
He's made a mistake.

636
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,959
He's reversed the first letter.

637
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,159
Instead of...

638
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,919
Instead of Z he's written S.

639
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,599
It's a licence plate,
we haven't checked yet.

640
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,999
And you won't believe this -

641
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,639
it's a Zeeland car.

642
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,799
According to the DMV
it belongs to Niels Reinhardt -

643
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,559
Robert Zeuthen's
personal assistant.

644
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,879
Do you hear me?

645
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,079
Niels Reinhardt
has been hiding behind Zeuthen,

646
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,319
and from the beginning he's known,
that he was the one we were after.

647
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,959
Here's a name and phone number.

648
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,479
Where are you? Sarah?

649
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,359
The head of the fund secretariat.
She may be able to help you.

650
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,439
Now, I really have to get out of here.

651
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,439
You knew about Majgården.

652
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,479
Or you've been there.

653
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,039
I'm the chairman of the fund.

654
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,479
I try to get out and wave the flag
as often as possible.

655
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,359
Did you know her?

656
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,159
Not that I remember.

657
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,959
Who is it?

658
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,239
Excuse me, it must be
an open window in the basement.

659
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,199
No, stay here.

659
00:57:15,305 --> 00:58:15,244

<i>The crane operator choked on his morning
coffee when he saw what he had picked up</i>

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,843
<i>The bucket tore the body to pieces,
we've found 7 parts so far.</i>

4
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:15,533
An no reports, missing persons, witnesses?

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:21,311
<i>The industrial port is on the other side, with
Zeeland's container terminals, and their ships.</i>

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,608
I'm with SIS now.

7
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,861
The deceased was probably from a
foreign ship and the problem has sailed on.

8
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,463
<i>I would like you to check</i>

9
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,005
<i>Our deal was 10-15 years. Not right now.</i>

10
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,871
The nanny has called, she said Maja Zeuthen
picked up the children from school.

11
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:36,620
Come kids, into the my car.
It's my kids.

12
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,665
- They are also mine.
- You left!

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,403
She has rashes all over.
You have no idea whats going on.

14
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,174
I know what she is doing
when she is with me.

15
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,865
<i>It will hurt the party for years to come if we
are the government who lost Zeeland</i>

16
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,089
We're in the middle of an election
campaign, trouble with Zeeland,

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,954
there is a financial crisis,
SIS is fearing the worst.

18
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:55,120
<i>And you fall in love with the
leader of our support party.</i>

19
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,096
<i>- What's that out there?
"Medea" - old cargo ship.</i>

20
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,477

23
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:37,814
<i>The police are still searching for Robert
Zeuthen's 9 year old daughter Emilie Zeuthen.</i>

24
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:42,822
<i>She went missing earlier in the evening, and
is believed to have been kidnapped.</i>

25
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:48,427
<i>A large forest area next to the shipowners
private residence has been cordoned off.</i>

26
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:53,150
<i>Extra manpower from the armed forced and
the home guard have been called in to assist.</i>

27
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,267
What about the brook,
you followed it all the way?

28
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,708
- Yes, we found nothing.
- Do it again.

29
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,645
- And bring the dogs!
- Right.

30
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:08,748
- What about those maps?
- Don't know, they said they'd call back.

31
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,233
Light a fire under them,
I need to see the area.

32
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:14,824
1084 come in, what's the
status of the map.

33
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:17,850
Lund, we need to get the
parents back to the house.

34
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,786
Tell them I need it now.

35
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:23,970
Lund, we've been here
three hours, there is nothing.

36
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:27,179
She could be here, the dogs
haven't been everywhere yet.

37
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:33,724
We've found tire tracks, wide track
spacing, possibly a box van.

38
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,374
And we found this.

39
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:37,919
Emilie!

40
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,577
Emilie!

41
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,393
Emilie!

42
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:56,108
- I'll have to ask you to return to the house.
- The forest continues on the other side...

43
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,498
They've found a bracelet with her
name on it, up at the highway.

44
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,460
Was she wearing that?

45
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:33,118
I'd like to assure you we are doing
everything we can to find your daughter.

46
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,571
But we need your help.

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,946
It's important you tell us everything
that might be relevant.

48
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:45,336
Because of your position and Zeelands,
SIS is also taking part of the investigation.

49
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:49,678
This is Mathias Borch from SIS's
branch for national security.

50
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:55,526
We've been told a neighbor saw a white
box van leave the forest earlier this evening.

51
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,852
Have you noticed
such a van?

52
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:03,469
No, but if you contact our security department
I'm sure the cameras caught something.

53
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:07,996
But your security system has been disabled
for a longer period, so nothing was recorded.

54
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:15,343
For how long has it been possible
for Emilie to sneak through the fence?

55
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:19,767
The fence is inspected frequently. Can't
remember if it's once a week, or every 2 weeks.

56
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:24,478
We've spoken to the nanny, and apparently
Emilie wanted to go out after she's seen a cat.

57
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:30,301
The cat started appearing about a week ago.
Did Emilie tell you about that?

58
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:34,082
Or perhaps a specific
person she's seen in the forest?

59
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:35,320
No...

60
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,071
She took some pictures of a cat
with her camera phone.

61
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:41,510
We discovered them today at her school,
but she didn't want to talk about them.

62
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:44,501
- Where is her phone now?
- Must be here someplace.

63
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:48,203
- Why didn't she want to talk about it?
- She knows we don't want it.

64
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:53,338
She's allergic to cats. She said she had taken
the pictures at a friends house, not here.

65
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,848
- Does she usually lie?
- No.

66
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,943
She knows what is right
and wrong, she is strong.

67
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:02,863
... but we've just divorced,
and she is angry...

68
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:09,155
Could we borrow this?

69
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,210
What about you? Any threats? People who
have behaved strangely towards you?

70
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:20,846
We have found a considerable amount of photos
of you, have you noticed someone with a camera?

71
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,130
What photos?

72
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:26,417
We found them on "Medea" your old
cargo ship at the roadstead.

73
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:30,715
It's likely the kidnapper used the
ship to plan Emilies abduction.

74
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:33,718
We've asked to have
it moved into the docks.

75
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:36,308
But the ship is manned.

76
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,394
Yes...

77
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,523
I'm afraid I have to inform you that
the crew of 3 have been fund murdered.

78
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:50,062
One at the docks, the two other
on the ship itself.

79
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:57,374
I don't understand...
you were at the docks..

80
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,515
I was told you had
finished your investigation.

81
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:05,375
Yes,but not Medea. The port authorities were in
contact with the ship, which reported all clear.

82
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,490
Though it now appears likely we
were talking to the perpetrator...

83
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:12,745
But what are you doing now?
What are you doing to find her?

84
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:17,547
- We've started a search for the box van..
- You said she's with someone who killed 3 people

85
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,214
Yes?

86
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:20,248
<i>Good evening. I'd like to speak to
the person in charge of the investigation. </i>

87
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:24,328
- Who is this?
<i>- Your rank and name please.</i>

88
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:29,360
- Sarah Lund chief Inspector, who is this?
<i>- The girl is fine.</i>

89
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:34,437
Naturally she is confused, and
frightened, but she is fine.

90
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,633
<i> I want to talk to her.</i>

91
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:42,048
That is not possible at the moment,
but don't worry.

92
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,877
- What is it you want?
<i>- I won't be making any unreasonable demands.</i>

93
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:53,601
I understand that times
are hard at the moment.

94
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,899
I am intending to recover a debt.

95
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,605
Debt? What is he talking about?

96
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,043
<i>I hear guests
have joined us.</i>

97
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:08,491
The question is how much you think
the girl is worth.

98
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,201
How much you will pay
for her return.

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,928
<i>I shall call again tomorrow afternoon.
On the this number. I await your offer.</i>

100
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:22,382
Fine, but I want to talk to...

101
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:31,035
All their phones will be
monitored from now on.

102
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:35,505
But this one was routed through the Internet,
so we have nothing at the moment.

103
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,164
- Any news on that box van?
- Nope.

104
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,695
But if he floored it he could
be 200 miles away by now.

105
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,374
- We've started checking speed cameras.
- Be quick about it.

106
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,815
Also check borders, bridges
and ferries.

107
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:50,612
- Everything.
- Right. I'll be going to the ship.

108
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:56,102
I've arranged with SIS that you and Borch
work together, and keep me posted.

109
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,257
You have a problem with that?

110
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,108
- No it's fine.
- Why didn't you examine that ship earlier?

111
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,443
- They had radio contact, all was fine...
- Right...

112
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,260
As long as you are still in my department
I expect you to do your utmost.

113
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:12,790
And I don't want to hear
more about OPA, until you've left...

114
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:17,650
- It was just as much my choice not to go.
- I suppose that is one way of collaborating.

115
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:20,373
But that guy on the phone
doesn't sound quite normal.

116
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:23,876
Zeuthen and Zeeland rank about
the same as the royal family...

117
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,622
That girl must be found as
quickly as possible.

118
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:30,613
It is most certainly in you own interest not
to make any further mistakes.

119
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:34,945
Hello, it's Brix?

120
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,889
<i>Just as prime minster Kamper has started his
election tour of the provinces,</i>

121
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,437
<i>we have received confirmation that Robert
Zeuthen's 9 year old daughter has been kidnapped.</i>

122
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,786
Robert Zeuthen is known as one of the governments
regular collaborators and supporters.

123
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:53,462
Only today Zeuthen's company Zeeland
has confirmed their support...

124
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:56,650
of the prime minsters economical
plan for the crisis.

125
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:01,992
The motive for the abduction is not yet known,
nor if it will affect the election campaign

126
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:07,396
- What is your reaction to the kidnapping?
- Excuse us, we have an election meeting now.

127
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:13,124
We have just received news of the misfortune
which has befallen the Zeuthen family.

128
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,776
On behalf of myself and the government I wish
to express our sympathy to the family.

129
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:27,011
And all necessary resources will be made available
so we can find the girl and bring her home again.

130
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,950
- Thank you.
- Will this affect the election campaign?

131
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:35,255
The family was just contacted by a man
who wants them to bid on her value.

132
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:38,117
And he was talking about a debt
he wants to collect.

133
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,602
Debt? What debt?

134
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:44,048
They don't know. The family will try to find
a number and he'll call again tomorrow.

135
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,635
Do they know if she
has been harmed?

136
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:52,136
What they know is that the perpetrator has been
staying at a Zeeland ship at the docks.

137
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,588
He, or they, killed the 3 man crew.

138
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,326
They have been preparing this
very throughly it seems.

139
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,724
Three men killed...

140
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,134
All of them foreign sailors.

141
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,621
That was the trail SIS had picked up
when they were at the harbor.

142
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:19,325
He may have been planning to use your visit
as a way to divert the police and SIS.

143
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:23,926
Someone has killed three men and snatched
a little girl and nobody knows anything?

144
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:25,962
Not at the moment.

145
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:32,069
Keep contact with the justice ministry and SIS,
extended all assistance.

146
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,853
Let Zeuthen know we are
doing everything possible.

147
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:40,477
Out of respect for the family and the girl I do
not want to debate Zeuthen or Zeeland.

148
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,965
Nor the kidnapping.

149
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,576
Arrange a meeting with Ussing
and Rosa later.

150
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,477
- Rosa is in Vejle, don't know where Ussing is.
- He's in Århus.

151
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't think he has canceled
anything to meet with you.

152
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,933
We have to cancel something then.
Tell him it's in his on best interest.

153
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,750
We have to determine what is
in our best interest.

154
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:03,632
Your statement before is fine, but you
should not get further involved.

155
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:08,627
- We don't know how it will turn out for the girl.
- 'stoffer this is not about an election campaign

156
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,904
It's about a family
and a girl of nine.

157
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,998
I'm just saying...
you should not get involved.

158
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,158
The most important thing is to get
the deal with the Center Party.

159
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,162
But that deal is done, Rosa will
make the announcement in the morning.

160
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:25,172
- Speaking of Rosa Lebech...
- Karen, I need some cues.

161
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:29,946
- the production workers...
- Great you've got a love life again.

162
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:32,683
But dam it couldn't you
have chosen someone else?

163
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,115
Karen... cues?

164
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:38,721
300 production workers. Afraid of losing
their jobs to technology.

165
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:42,780
- A good setup for our ...
- ... modernization with individual at the core.

166
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,758
Come on Karen, you've got to
agree this is insane.

167
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:51,142
You are entitled to your private life, I just
think it would have been better if you told us.

168
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:54,764
I keep it separate, I think
you should do the same.

169
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:57,732
But are you flirting,
is it temporary?

170
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:02,869
Keep the connection to SIS open
and give me a running update.

171
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,070
What about departure times, planes, trains,
ships, anything? Fingerprints?

172
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:11,765
He has burned it all. And
delete a lot of files on the computer.

173
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:15,728
There has got to be something. Bring it
all in. And remember it's urgent.

174
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,901
I think the guy from the scrap yard was tied
down here for a period of time.

175
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,787
They got provisions every 2 weeks.

176
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:37,710
In theory the perpetrator could have
surprised them right after.

177
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,726
They were told to strip.

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,455
Forced down..
beaten, abused.

179
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,434
Perhaps one by one...

180
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:52,307
Hey, wanna help me find a little girl
when you've finished on the floor?

181
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,328
Why the abuse...

182
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:01,560
The two of them were killed days ago, why
spend extra time on the last one....

183
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,441
He was first mate, they probably
wanted to know about the ship.

184
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,870
And he didn't die from boredom.

185
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,077
What do we know about him?

186
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:20,886
His name was Victor Matevski,
55 years of age, born in Latvia

187
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:24,733
Worked with the two others
for many years. Employed by Zeeland.

188
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:29,100
- Faithful, loyal, nothing out of the ordinary.
- Was he living here?

189
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:34,403
This was this last job for Zeeland. The ship
was going to scrap, and he was going home.

190
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,088
Did they go ashore recently?

191
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,880
I don't know Sarah.

192
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,993
I don't think Emilie Zeuthen
cares about that.

193
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,227
If you think I screwed up you don't
have to defend me in front of Brix.

194
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:52,582
I asked you if you had checked
those tattoos, and you said yes.

195
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,927
But all you could think about
was your anniversary and new job.

196
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,630
- You thought it was about the PM!
- What the hell are you going to do at OPA?

197
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:05,135
- That's what we used to make fun of once.
- I don't owe you any explanations. At all!

198
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:09,962
If we are supposed to work together, I need to
know that I can trust you. You understand that?

199
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:13,616
Damn it, we are talking
about a little girl.

200
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,037
Hi dear.... right.

201
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,017
A harbor address...

202
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:59,665
<i>"Sale by order of the court..."</i>

203
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,295
In SIS we'd usually check this.
Not sure what you'd do.

204
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,093
<i>- Juncker.</i>
- It's Lund, where are you?

205
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:09,404
<i>I'm on my way to Great Belt bridge
to check surveillance tapes.</i>

206
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:12,490
Asbjørn get to the harbor instead.
The address: Skudeløbet

207
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:16,334
<i>- Why the hell can't you call me Juncker...</i>
- Call me when you get there.

208
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,002
He could have gone anywhere,
but he returns to the harbor.

209
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:13,114
<i>It's Juncker, I need to run a license place
on a white Mercedes box van.</i>

210
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:19,414
<i>Registration number:
Foxtrot Kilo 3 6 0 0 9</i>

211
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:33,363
Thank you.

212
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:37,434
It's a company car, registered to a
company called Pleasure dome

213
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:41,257
- When was it stolen.
- That's just it, it hasn't been reported stolen

214
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:45,182
And I know the place, it's a brothel.
From when I worked at Bellahøj.

215
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:51,961
It's run by a couple of Serbs, they've been
known to import girls from eastern Europe.

216
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:55,526
But never large scale, and never
children as far as I know.

217
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,448
Send for more people.

218
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:01,880
- You got the address?
- Yep.

219
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:07,264
- So she's staying with you equally?
- Yes we have a written schedule.

220
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,544
We'll have to examine
your place as well.

221
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:12,833
- Yes of course
- Here is the list of employees.

222
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,760
I also need a list of externals, catering,
craftsmen etc.

223
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,025
I don't know that, I have to
talk to the housekeeper first.

224
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:22,663
- The lists are usually in the kitchen.
- I looked, they aren't there.

225
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,916
- He needs them.
- They are not there!

226
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,096
- In the basement perhaps?
- Mom...

227
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,790
What are you doing?
Where is Emilie?

228
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,457
- Come Carl.
- Why isn't she sleeping?

229
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,432
I'll find the lists. But if we could
have a look at Emilies room?

230
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:50,558
- What are you doing with Emilies clothes?
- Bringing it in for DNA ....

231
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,586
- It says here.
- It's routine...

232
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:54,444
- It stays here!
- Robert!

233
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,695
Is there anything
I can do to help?

234
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,561
I'll be on the mobile,
I want to know what happens.

235
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:07,974
Sleep well sweetie.

236
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,442
Let me know if there is
something I can do.

237
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,507
Maja...

238
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,268
What did you tell Carl?

239
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,458
Why didn't you let me
take her home.

240
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,242
The board asked me to
convey their sympathy.

241
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,255
The meeting has
been postponed.

242
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:58,434
The chairman and I will take care of the
day to day running of the company.

243
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,684
Until all of this has been settled.

244
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,797
I'm sure they
will find her soon.

245
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,226
Thank you.

246
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:17,169
Of course you can
have the clothes...

247
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,245
Lets go look at her room.

248
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,126
- What the hell are you doing?
- Are you Assim? Have you see her?

249
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,499
Girl of 9, kidnapped using
your van.

250
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,526
No hell i have not seen her.
Haven't done a damn thing.

251
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:50,209
Make sure nobody leaves the room,
and search upstairs.

252
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,276
- Can we sit somewhere?
- Yeah, over there.

253
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:58,939
I don't know what you are speaking about.
The car was stolen 3 days ago.

254
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,701
Ask some of the
damn girls.

255
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,430
- Why didn't you report it stolen?
- My choice.

256
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:07,303
- No sign of the girl.
- Told you. You ruin my business.

257
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,052
- Can't you just lave.
- I don't give a shit about your business.

258
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:16,172
You are facing charges for kidnapping and murder,
so you better say something convincing!

259
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,110
Come on, help yourself, where did
they steal the car?

260
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:30,494
- An empty shop in Amager
- What were you doing there?

261
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,756
New girls coming.
They needed place to live.

262
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,901
- I found them a good place.
- And empty repair shop?

263
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:45,276
Half the city is foreclosed, many fine
locations going unused all over.

264
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,072
- Why not use them sensibly?
- Go on.

265
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:57,668
We go out there, I did not think
about the back door was open.

266
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:01,109
Or boxes and a madras on the corner.

267
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:06,105
I should have done, next morning
all is gone - and my car.

268
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,409
- And who were there?
- How would I know?

269
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:15,173
But thats not permission for the
asshole to steal my van.

270
00:22:15,174 --> 00:22:17,462
Then why didn't you report it stolen?

271
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,819
My choice.

272
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,885
What was in it?
And don't say nothing.

273
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,428
Balance sheets, lists of places we use,
or have used, and keys to those places.

274
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:38,305
- Did you find any keys in the van?
- No.

275
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,100
Asbjørn...

276
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:45,531
I'll search the workshop, you bring
him and the girls in.

277
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,752
And I want a list of all locations they use.
Are you tired?

278
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:49,585
No.

279
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:54,795
All his places need to be searched, and bring in
any girls you might find as well.

280
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:03,286
I think it's important vi respect the situation,
don't start debating Zeeland and the kidnapping.

281
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:07,739
- Especially for the sake of the family.
- Why can't we debate Zeeland?

282
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,622
I thought you cared about them
not getting special treatment.

283
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,659
We must show support, it would
be tasteless to do anything else.

284
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,278
All of us should condemn this,
we'd be idiots not to.

285
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,572
I understand if the PM wishes
to hide a few things.

286
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:22,595
- What?
- Well it was Robert Zeuthen, ...

287
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,344
Who just managed to save
your bacon earlier today.

288
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:31,971
And the police spend the whole day running around
the harbor protecting you.

289
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:35,904
- And it ends up hurting your savior Zeuthen
- Don't you worry about that.

290
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:41,567
Fine, we won't talk about Zeeland. But I still
want a report about what happened at the harbor.

291
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,741
Oh give it a rest Ussing, you have no
right to demand anything.

292
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:47,876
Call it something else then.

293
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:54,669
We wouldn't want people to say that Rosa
and I were just blinded by your charm...

294
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,040
Right...

295
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:04,742
I want a document at least a few
hours before the TV debate tomorrow.

296
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,899
Thanks for the midnight snack.

297
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,510
He's trying to make you insecure.

298
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,102
He's talking nonsense.

299
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,554
I know.

300
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,104
But we have to postpone
the announcement.

301
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:30,635
My base won't accept endorsing you if there
is a risk Ussing implicates you in this.

302
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,471
Rosa, he can't.

303
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,152
He's just teasing.

304
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:38,782
Then give him that report. We can
make the announcement afterwards.

305
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:46,928
Postpone how?

306
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,003
She just wants to make
sure Ussing isn't causing trouble.

307
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:52,299
The press will
start to wonder.

308
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,908
Lets just get it started, we have nothing
to hide. Where is 'stoffer?

309
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:59,315
He had to drive in advance because
of the meetings we canceled.

310
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:03,437
- But Rosa Lebech will make the announcement..
- Yes yes.

311
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,773
- Any news from SIS?
- Yes.

312
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,450
They found the car the perpetrator used.
And are searching possible hideouts.

313
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,715
<i>Karen. Ah, good you that you called.
Yes, hang on...</i>

314
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,690
- Here is your tea.
- Thank you.

315
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,478
<i>You have one new message.</i>

316
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,390
<i>Hi. It's your mother.</i>

317
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:23,039
<i>I understand you were a bit grumpy
because Mark and his girlfriend canceled.</i>

318
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,976
<i>But they had their reasons...</i>

319
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,382
<i>Anyway... call me when you can.</i>

320
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,266
<i>And again, congratulations on your anniversary!
I hope you get that new job.</i>

321
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,716
<i>But eh... so long.</i>

322
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,938
<i>- Borch.</i>
- Lund. Is it a bad time?

323
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:01,857
<i>Moment, I just got in. Don't want
to wake the entire building.</i>

324
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,442
<i>Ok, any news? Did you
find something at the brothel?</i>

325
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:10,528
No.. but I was thinking,
that first mate,...

326
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:14,511
Didn't he have relatives or
friends here?

327
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,534
<i>Not according to my information.
Why?</i>

328
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:20,844
Did you check if
they had been ashore?

329
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:26,524
<i>Call Zeeland, if they aren't answering it could
be because it's in the middle of the night.</i>

330
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:29,482
<i>Goodnight Sarah. We'll find her tomorrow.</i>

331
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:39,671
Thursday, November 10th

332
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,212
Day 2

333
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:22,863
I've talked to the police, they
are ready for a meeting now.

334
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:27,027
- Any news?
- They found the van, and talked to the owner.

335
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:31,326
But they are certain the kidnapper
changed vehicles with Emilie.

336
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,460
- What, where?
- That's all they said.

337
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:38,529
But I think they believe she is close
to the city.

338
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,451
- Shall I call Maja?
- Yes please.

339
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:47,863
And we need to meet with the security department
as quickly as possible. And determine a bid.

340
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,437
Yes we'll speak to them presently,
and SIS will offer advice.

341
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:57,843
But usually in situations like this, it has
always been Kornerup who did the negotiations.

342
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:00,658
I've sacked him, I don't
want to see him again.

343
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,613
We'll deal with this
on our own.

344
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:07,738
- What about the families of the deceased?
- We are helping them.

345
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,519
Robert...

346
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:16,339
I realized...

347
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:22,544
Everything could had looked a lot different if i
had been quicker to report on the cat and nanny.

348
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,550
Don't worry about it.
We just need to get her home now.

349
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:34,333
To sum it up, the perpetrator has been hiding in
places which have gone bust and are abandoned.

350
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:38,659
He wanted to stay close, no more than 3 days
ago he was scoping out that workshop.

351
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,875
He can't know we have found the van, so there is
a chance he might use those addresses and keys.

352
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:48,847
Lund, Asbjørn, speak to me.

353
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:51,894
Erm, no, we didn't find anything
at the workshop.

354
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:56,058
That brothel guy had keys to about
20 abandoned buildings,

355
00:29:56,147 --> 00:30:00,786
- We are searching them, but it takes a ...
- What about the girls living there?

356
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:03,368
We are pulling them in
as we find them.

357
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,147
Ok, but lets get back to it, and hurry up
with the searching. It's the only lead we have.

358
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:15,479
The technicians have examine
the girls phone.

359
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:18,800
Lots of pictures, but nothing
we didn't know already.

360
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:21,490
- And tracing it?
- Turns out to be a problem.

361
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:26,274
It was an Internet call via a prepaid
calling card from a burner phone.

362
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:30,264
The closest we can get is
somewhere in the harbor area.

363
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:34,039
- And that alone took forever to determine.
- But what does it mean?

364
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,011
That we can't trace him fast enough.
We've got nothing.

365
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:40,127
Unless we find her. Or you persuade
him to take the money.

366
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,780
- Did she get the phone?
- When he calls again it will be to this one.

367
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:46,841
Keep it on you at all times.
And don't stray.

368
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:51,258
And don't aggravate him. Just agree with what
he says, and if he is not satisfied with ...

369
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,850
Yes, that is understood, but
why does he want a bid at all?

370
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:57,845
And what debt is he referring to?

371
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:02,695
We are trying to determine who might have been
negatively affected by Zeeland business.

372
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:06,038
It could be anybody, they have a
yearly turnover of 300 billion.

373
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,394
But if he is interested in money, why
doesn't ask for a number?

374
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,770
You could ask him
when he calls.

375
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:16,671
Regarding that first mate, I received
some information from Zeeland

376
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,955
He had disembarked, but only once
whilst the ship has been at the roadstead.

377
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:22,744
Doing what?

378
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:27,204
He told them he had been summoned
as a witness in some lawsuit.

379
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,875
- That list with...
- What lawsuit?

380
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,462
What lawsuit?

381
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,256
No idea. The list Sarah.

382
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:37,927
- The parents are coming in.
- Right.

383
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,150
Lund...

384
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,859
What?

385
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,402
Really...

386
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:00,190
We don't know so
much at the moment.

387
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:04,622
But we have reason to believe the perpetrator
have gained access to some empty buildings.

388
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,472
We are in the process
of searching these places.

389
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:11,378
We are questioning a number of people, but we
have nothing concrete at the moment.

390
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:14,650
But you found a car?

391
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:17,885
Yes... it was stolen
a couple of days ago.

392
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:21,007
We found it at the harbor.

393
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,372
Have you seen it before?

394
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:26,711
No..

395
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:33,121
We have found some clothes matching the
description you gave us of Emilie yesterday.

396
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,647
Is it hers?

397
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:51,811
It's normal for a kidnapper to change the
appearance of the abducted person.

398
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:58,340
Where are you searching?

399
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:02,181
- Well, as I was saying...
- I'd like you be specific.

400
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:05,115
Who was arrested,
where are you searching?

401
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,138
A number of people.

402
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,683
What we have uncovered seems to be
pointing at the prostitution scene.

403
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:17,951
But it may well turn
out to be unrelated.

404
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:22,777
But he has said he is prepared to return
Emilie if he is given money.

405
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:24,547
Yes, and when he calls...

406
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:28,795
You are not just sitting and waiting
for him to call? You stay out of this!

407
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,791
Right now you should
work together.

408
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,429
Work out how much you will
offer the perpetrator when he calls.

409
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,472
Have you received counseling from SIS?

410
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:49,071
It's in progress, and I'm going
to visit our security department.

411
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,256
We are going there.
I'm coming along.

412
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,959
Thank you.

413
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:02,439
We will of course let you know
the moment there is any news.

414
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,115
If I can help in someway...
if you need something...

415
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,364
Two items...

416
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:22,113
No records of the first mate having
been a witness at a trial.

417
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:24,880
But the public prosecutor
will look into it.

418
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:28,608
And your mother has called, she'd like
you to call back when you have a moment.

419
00:34:32,226 --> 00:34:34,399
- That good?
- Thank you very much.

420
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,242
Well?

421
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:43,645
The police are still
searching and interrogating.

422
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:46,112
Looks like a needle in a haystack.

423
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:51,866
- Did they finish the written briefing?
- Yes, it's been sent to Ussing and Lebech.

424
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:55,317
And as expect the press
are being troublesome.

425
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:57,572
They keep asking
to the alliance.

426
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:00,524
I hope it will be done today
so we can shut them up.

427
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,515
- Has Rosa given you a time?
- No. I'll call her in a moment.

428
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:08,144
Also, finance minster Eggert
wants to speak with you.

429
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:11,028
- No time for that, I'll call later.
- She is here.

430
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,677
Hi Kristian.

431
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:15,716
Birgit.

432
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:18,456
What a hansom campaign
your brother has made.

433
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,005
- Do you know the area well?
- I've visited quite a bit, yes.

434
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,978
But, what did you want to talk about?

435
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:31,221
This region was the ideal only a few years ago.
Business expanding everywhere.

436
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,756
And now it's all quiet...

437
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:36,435
But that is what we are trying
to do something about.

438
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:39,011
I know, and you are the right
one to do it.

439
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,911
You rebuild the party.

440
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,432
You had the visions.

441
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,537
You lifted us all up.

442
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,421
Thank you Birgit,
but I'm very busy.

443
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,769
We need a guarantee that
Zeeland is with us.

444
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:54,626
Without them the
ends won't meet.

445
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:59,522
It's a good thing you got his support before
that terrible incident with his little girl.

446
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:02,816
But we can't expect
to continue being so lucky.

447
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:08,944
And your statements at the homeless is seen
as a concession to the Center Party.

448
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:13,451
I think you need to explain to
the group that it leads somewhere.

449
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:15,024
It was not a concession.

450
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:19,432
It was our policies, which we have agreed
upon. They will steer us through this crisis.

451
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,371
I hope so.

452
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,897
But Rosa Lebech's hesitation doesn't
look too good either.

453
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:28,761
Rosa Lebech is not hesitating,
it's Ussing who is trying to trip us up.

454
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,184
- It will fall into place today. No problem.
- If you say so.

455
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:37,958
Though rumor has it it's not just Rosa's
political views you are interested in.

456
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:43,663
I don't begrudge you love, but please be
careful not to ruin all your hard work.

457
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:45,240
All <b>our </b>hard work.

458
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,362
- Hello.
- It's me.

459
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:54,038
Rosa Lebech is hesitant, she won't set a time
for the announcement until she has met with you.

460
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,691
I don't have time for a meeting, we'll
have to handle it via the phone.

461
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:59,400
I think you should meet.

462
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:03,165
Kristoffer has heard that Ussing has
made the Center Party a new offer.

463
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,165
Ok then, arrange it.  And get a hold
of Kristoffer as well.

464
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,822
- Yes.
- Thanks.

465
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:19,024
I hope you have everything under control,
a great deal of people are counting on you.

466
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:26,071
Right, I'll try that.
Thanks.

467
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,015
Anything from the interrogations?

468
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:32,681
Some tips for cheaper living.
Next!

469
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,400
I spoke to a secretary at
the public prosecutors, ...

470
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,320
The first mate was not testifying
in a case that day.

471
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:42,841
But apparently he had a meeting with
the deputy attorney general.

472
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:45,860
- I'll try to chase him down over at city court.
- Now?

473
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:47,165
What if he calls?

474
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,789
I'll just be quick about it.

475
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,096
<i>Hello darling!</i>

476
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,550
Sorry I'm just barging in like this.

477
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,564
- Mom, now isn't a good time.
- I'll keep it brief.

478
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,625
I promised you this gardening book.

479
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:05,592
You aren't exactly renowned for
your green fingers, eh?

480
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:07,926
We'll I never...

481
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,217
- It's Mathias isn't it?
- That's just who it is.

482
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:14,282
It's been forever, what are
you doing here?

483
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:17,696
I remember you two fooling
around at the police academy

484
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:20,461
For a while I thought you might
have been the one.

485
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,090
Mum, I'll call you later.

486
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,188
I don't want to interrupt, but
we have to talk about Mark.

487
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:27,142
What are you saying?

488
00:38:27,143 --> 00:38:29,841
It's so important that you two
don't fall out now.

489
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:31,841
You two, you and Mark

490
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,827
But I just invited him and his girlfriend.

491
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:37,705
He couldn't, but we'll
do it another time.

492
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:42,484
You have to consider his feelings, Mark was
just tiny when you were divorced.

493
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:45,448
You've been so focused on your work.

494
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:50,410
- And of course there have been many men...
- Exactly what is it you are trying to say?

495
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:53,471
Mark wants you to
leave him alone.

496
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:57,204
He will..contact you
when he is ready.

497
00:38:58,964 --> 00:38:59,997
Oh darling.

498
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,725
- See you later.
- Yeah...

499
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:04,490
Call me.
Later, right?

500
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:16,235
- Well, eh, I'll be running along.
- Right.

501
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,497
Excuse me, you are deputy
attorney general Peter Schultz?

502
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,259
- I am.
- Sarah Lund.

503
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,898
I've been trying to get a hold of you,
regarding a first mate from a Zeeland ship.

504
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,395
Yes, I got your message, and I'll be happy to
help if possible, but I'm needed in court.

505
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:46,297
I'm researching the abduction of Emilie
Zeuthen and the murders on the ship.

506
00:39:46,298 --> 00:39:49,217
I understand you met with him
about a fortnight ago?

507
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:51,175
Yes, that is correct.

508
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:55,902
He just appeared at the office
and wanted to talk.

509
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:57,700
What about?

510
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,747
Well, his English wasn't that good. But he
seemed to think he was owed money.

511
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:07,055
From a law case. But since it never made it
to court, he wasn't owed compensation.

512
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,458
I explained that to him.

513
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,120
So all he wanted
was to get paid?

514
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:16,745
Yes, I understood he was soon going back
home permanently.

515
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,083
But as I said, I couldn't help him.

516
00:40:21,444 --> 00:40:24,787
It's just strange, he gave another
reason to his employer.

517
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:28,078
- I wouldn't know about that. Anything else?
- No...

518
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:32,649
Thanks. Oh, what was the case he
had witnessed?

519
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:35,234
Look, I don't have
the details here.

520
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:39,511
Just a few keywords, I think the perpetrator
was very interested in these sailors.

521
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:42,210
I'm looking for anything
that might be important.

522
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:46,759
Well the case was about a child who had
run away from home, and then committed suicide.

523
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,285
The mate and a few others
had found the corpse.

524
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:54,858
Their role was minor, but they had been held
back to assist the investigation.

525
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:56,365
When was this?

526
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,562
You'll have to call later...

527
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:03,947
Erm, the two other crew members,
can you remember their names?

528
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,806
- Yeah, it's Lund
- We may have something here.

529
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,435
That one I just questioned said she
heard a child last night. A Child crying.

530
00:41:20,337 --> 00:41:21,126
Where?

531
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:24,525
An empty building,
at Vasbygade 55

532
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:29,896
We did check it today, but she said she
was sleeping, suddenly she hears a child crying.

533
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:33,910
Sound came through a ventilation shaft.
And then it stopped.

534
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:36,107
Ok, meet you there.

535
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,421
But SIS believes we should
restrain ourselves?

536
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,680
Yes, and our own department.

537
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:48,525
Experience shows that offering too much money
triggers... well greed.

538
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:50,102
So what is it?

539
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:51,426
How much?

540
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,036
As little as possible.
To begin with.

541
00:41:54,426 --> 00:41:58,229
He, or they, asks us to make an offer,
and if that is a tactical...

542
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,417
I don't give a crap what it is!

543
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:04,726
This only happened because of all
your money, and now you are being stingy!

544
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:07,900
- That's not what it's about Maja
- It's for your own good.

545
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,060
He asked for a bid, asked
how much Emilie is worth to us.

546
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:13,792
How much is she worth to you?

547
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:22,698
I want her back today. I don't care
what it's going to cost. I want her home.

548
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,011
We'll go with the largest amount
we talked about, if he wants more...

549
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,267
... we'll raise it. Inform SIS and the police.
And make sure the bank is ready.

550
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:34,104
So that's what I'm telling
him when he calls?

551
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:36,767
- Yes, but where the hell are you?
- Vasbygade.

552
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:39,449
Somebody had heard a child
crying late last night.

553
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,702
- Any signs of the girl?
- No, I'm coming back now.

554
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:53,038
What did you find?

555
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:55,781
Answer.

556
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,083
There is something behind this.

557
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,275
Do you see anything?

558
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:14,550
Someone put this up recently.

559
00:44:16,174 --> 00:44:17,770
Do we have any tools?

560
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,343
- It is Lund.
- Hello again Lund.

561
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:28,026
I want your offer now.

562
00:44:29,027 --> 00:44:31,903
The family is prepared
to pay you 10 million kroner.

563
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:35,243
Unmarked bills.
Can't be traced.

564
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,222
What is you answer?

565
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:46,767
You'll have safe passage, we are staying out of
it. The family just wants to get Emilie back now.

566
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:50,632
The question is, how does it compare
to the debt I wish to recover.

567
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:55,919
- What is this debt you are talking about?
- How much do you think the girl is worth?

568
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:03,496
Listen, you've placed yourself in a bad
situation. Soon there will be nowhere to hide.

569
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:06,733
I think this is the best you
are going to get.

570
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:09,001
Ok.

571
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,560
So how are we doing this,
where do we deliver the money?

572
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:16,590
It's more interesting who will deliver them.
And I'm thinking you should.

573
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:21,051
S-train from Nørreport station,at 17:23
Line A towards Farum.

574
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,456
Get on it.

575
00:45:22,457 --> 00:45:24,265
That's in 55 minutes...

576
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,720
If I see anyone else
but you... she dies.

577
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:36,555
Stay here. Search the place.

578
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:43,954
But they have contacted the perpetrator
who has agreed to a deal?

579
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:46,117
Yes they've settled on an amount.

580
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,987
Bloody good.
Marvelous.

581
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,924
It's from Ussing: "Truce is ok,
until something else comes up"

582
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,642
He always has to add that
little extra bit.

583
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:05,753
- When is the exchange taking place?
- They'll contact us when they leave.

584
00:46:06,988 --> 00:46:08,378
We need to talk.

585
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,483
You know her better
than me of course,...

586
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:14,230
But be careful with Lebech.

587
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:18,598
- Karen, don't sound like the finance minster.
- It's odd that she needs a new meeting.

588
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:23,368
If the Center Party is going back on the deal
now it will be a huge win for Ussing.

589
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,155
They are not going to do that.

590
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:28,682
Ok...

591
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:40,986
If we keep meeting like this I'll
have to buy a camper van.

592
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:45,933
Ussing just let me know that
a truce is fine by him.

593
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:47,668
Good to hear.

594
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,212
So...

595
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:52,944
When are you going to announce it?

596
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,756
Perhaps best during
the TV-debate tonight?

597
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,606
That's what I wanted to talk to you
about. I think we should wait a while longer.

598
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:05,339
The evening isn't a good time anyway,
the morning is a better time.

599
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,057
So the news has all day to travel.
And then there is the kidnapping.

600
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:11,916
It's stealing the scene.

601
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:16,033
Hopefully the kidnapping
will soon be resolved.

602
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:20,062
But if Ussing has been talking
to you I'd like to know.

603
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,155
Not me, but the deputy and a few
others from the group.

604
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:27,116
He made a new proposal,
old disagreements have flared up again.

605
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:29,859
Rosa, I need you now.

606
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,277
Ussing shouldn't be rewarded for
abusing a crime.

607
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:37,624
We've worked on this
for a long time.

608
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:40,460
It's important for the plan,
which you helped shape.

609
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:45,254
I need your answer now.

610
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:50,704
The Ministry of Justice has made an account
of the incident. There is nothing to criticize

611
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,549
You are right. I'll speak to the group and
cut through. Of course will support your bid.

612
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:58,216
Thank you.

613
00:48:17,704 --> 00:48:22,183
<i>The money is unmarked, we can't trace them.
You are sure we shouldn't add a GPS tracker?</i>

614
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:25,226
- Yes, we are not doing that.
- It's just the size of a...

615
00:48:25,227 --> 00:48:29,038
I do not want us to do anything that
might cause him to change his mind.

616
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,789
How will he deliver Emilie
to the central station?

617
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,540
We don't know yet, but we
have the area covered.

618
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,812
- You are welcome to stay here.
- No, I want to come along.

619
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:44,484
- Are you ready?
- Yes...

620
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:48,410
I think that deputy attorney general
knows more than he is letting on.

621
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:50,286
He's not answering the phone.

622
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:52,099
Later, we are leaving now.

623
00:49:47,348 --> 00:49:49,398
- Yes?
- Have you got the money?

624
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:53,772
Get off at Ellebjerg, get on line F
from platform 3 - you have two minutes.

625
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:55,665
I'd like to talk to...

626
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,178
Lund and Borch are riding from
Nørreport station direction Høje Tåstrup.

627
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,631
The destination
is Ny Ellebjerg

628
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:08,180
Borch, do you copy?

629
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,862
- Have we heard from SIS?
- No, not yet.

630
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:17,133
'stoffer is monitoring the situation,
I'm sure he'll call soon.

631
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,155
Do you have a moment?

632
00:50:19,265 --> 00:50:22,094
- Yes of course.
- I'll check when we are on.

633
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,923
So, wanna borrow a tie?

634
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,019
No, it's your so called
account of the kidnapping

635
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:31,511
- I'm in no way satisfied
- There is always something with you.

636
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:35,249
I am not going to accept a truce
when you are not telling me the truth.

637
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,117
Losing the Center Party has made
you bitter, I can understand that Ussing

638
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:44,338
If you want a truce I want your promise,
right now, to account for everything.

639
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:49,456
- I have been told...
- I don't have to promise you anything!

640
00:50:49,743 --> 00:50:52,955
You've got a lot more than
your position warrants.

641
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:58,518
Lets get in there and debate
the important things, right?

642
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:04,823
Her shoes were wet...

643
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:08,568
I should have realized she
had been down at the brook...

644
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,891
I should have let you take
her from school...

645
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:17,199
I'm sorry I didn't have time...

646
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:22,604
I know you are doing your best.

647
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,721
I'm sure we'll figure it out,
we just have to...

648
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:30,798
..practice...

649
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,135
...being divorced.

650
00:52:02,443 --> 00:52:03,181
Yes?

651
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:06,844
<i>Get of at Vesterport and get on
the train at the opposite platform.</i>

652
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:11,081
- How long until I get there?
<i>- The train leaves at once.</i>

653
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:15,024
<i>If you wanna save the girl...
you better be quick about it.</i>

654
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:55,563
Sarah...

655
00:52:58,597 --> 00:52:59,445
Hey...

656
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:02,971
Sarah...

657
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:23,203
- Sorry
- What happened?

658
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:27,071
It was my son...

659
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,442
It was my son.

660
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:34,602
We have a problem
I didn't catch the train.

661
00:53:34,603 --> 00:53:36,358
<i>You didn't catch the train?</i>

662
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:39,631
- What do I do?
<i>- Go to the tunnel.</i>

663
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:42,235
<i>Continue to the steel stairs.</i>

664
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:44,729
<i>You'd better hurry.</i>

665
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,178
I'll see if I can get
the track closed.

666
00:54:03,622 --> 00:54:08,720
<i>Fact is, the government plan is responsible.
You can't say the same about the opposition.</i>

667
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:14,146
The best way out of the crisis, as fast as
possible,  is best handled through a coalition.

668
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:18,021
Rumors have suggest your alliance with the
Center Party is under pressure.

669
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:21,281
Because you don't agree
on, for instance, Zeeland.

670
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:25,272
Because of current events I don't
want to comment on Zeeland,

671
00:54:25,273 --> 00:54:29,351
But my dialog with the Center Party
has been very productive.

672
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,818
But I think we should let Rosa Lebech...

673
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:36,301
There probably won't be an alliance when she
hears how you have tried to deceive us all.

674
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:41,905
After the unfortunate abduction of Emilie
Zeuthen, I asked for an account of the affair.

675
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:45,041
Instead I was given
a wishy washy briefing.

676
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,925
- It's very precise...
- It is grotesque...

677
00:54:48,226 --> 00:54:52,449
...that the PM is guarded in all manner of ways
whilst a little girl is kidnapped.

678
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:57,137
- But the important thing is what is missing...
- Ussing I thought we were going to spare ...

679
00:54:57,138 --> 00:55:01,825
It doesn't mention that your Minister of Justice
met with SIS several days ago.

680
00:55:02,488 --> 00:55:06,574
The topic of which was the possible
kidnapping of Emilie Zeuthen

681
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:11,277
This from an internal memo from
the Ministry of Justice

682
00:55:11,278 --> 00:55:13,586
A memo you didn't
want to tell us about.

683
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:18,828
And still, the little girl was abducted while
you were off chatting with the homeless.

684
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:22,839
- How are you going to explain that?
- I have no comment.

685
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:29,365
But prime minster Kamper, Ussing has made several
claims here, don't you have anything to say?

686
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:35,304
I will say that I'm confident the police
and SIS will bring the girl back safe.

687
00:56:09,898 --> 00:56:12,850
- I'm back up.
<i>- Do you see Bus number 14?</i>

688
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:16,089
- Yes..
- Hurry over there.

689
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:22,629
- Do I get on?
<i>- Throw the money inside.</i>

690
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:30,358
Where is the girl?

691
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,146
Where is the girl?

692
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:36,529
<i>Look at the courthouse.</i>

693
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,638
- What?
<i>- Look up.</i>

694
00:56:47,442 --> 00:56:49,492
<i>I thought I had asked
you to come alone.</i>

695
00:56:58,978 --> 00:57:04,786
Next time you consider paying for a girls
life with small change... remember this.

696
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:07,513
Noooo!

697
00:57:08,305 --> 00:58:08,401

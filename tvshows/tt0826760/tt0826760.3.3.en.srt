00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:00,833
Subs by IceHunter
Zealand and Zeeland - two different coins.

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:08,344
<i>Police are still looking for Robert
Zeuthen's 9 year old daughter Emilie.</i>

3
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:11,292
<i>Earlier in the evening
she went missing from her home.</i>

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,950
What are you doing to find her?

5
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:16,957
Sarah Lund, who am I speaking to?

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:20,249
The girl is fine. I am intending
to recover a debt.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,471
Question is how much
you think she is worth.

8
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:24,276
We found tire tracks.

9
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:28,579
Did she her? A girl of 9,
kidnapped in your van.

10
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,194
No hell i have not seen her.

11
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:35,851
I asked you if you had checked it, but
all you could think about was your new job.

12
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,248
We are trying
to save a little girl.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,104
Mummy, where is Emilie?

14
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,052
Maja, what did you tell Carl?

15
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:44,202
Why didn't you
let me take her?

16
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:47,113
He wants to return her for money.

17
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,751
- How much?
- At little as possible. At first.

18
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:52,862
- How much is she worth to you?
- We'll go with the high number.

19
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:55,143
Kristian Kamper a comment?

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,808
They have my deepest sympathy.

21
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,836
Nobody knows what's
going to happen to her.

22
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:02,465
'stoffer this isn't about an election
campaign, it's about a family.

23
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,207
We're in the middle of an election
campaign, trouble with Zeeland,

24
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,420
there is a financial crisis. And you fall in
love with the leader of our support party.

25
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,106
Of course we support you tonight.

26
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,884
Ussing, I thought we were going to spare.

27
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:14,030
It doesn't mention that your Minister of Justice
met with SIS several days ago.

28
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:18,024
The topic of which was the possible
kidnapping of Emilie Zeuthen

29
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:22,836
I will say that I'm confident the police
and SIS will bring the girl back safe.

30
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:24,451
Mom, we aren't coming.

31
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,173
I just want to see  you.

32
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,445
Mark wants you
to leave him alone.

33
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:32,246
I'm investigating the kidnap of Emilie Zeuthen,
and the murders on the ship.

34
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:34,809
- You met with the first mate?
- Yes.

35
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,923
What case was he a witness in?

36
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:40,228
Look, I don't have
the details here.

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,305
The family is prepared
to pay you 10 million kroner.

38
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:46,500
So how are we doing this,
where do we deliver the money?

39
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,570
It's more interesting who will deliver them.
And I'm thinking you should.

40
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,539
<i>The money is unmarked, we can't trace them.</i>

41
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,118
Sarah.

42
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:54,806
It was my son.

43
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,838
I didn't catch the train.

44
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:58,860
Throw the money on the bus.

45
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,383
Where is the girl?

46
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:05,635
Next time you consider paying for a girls
life with small change... remember this.

47
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:17,732
The deceased is 44 year old Peter Schultz.
Deputy Attorney General

48
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:23,553
The perpetrator must have surprised him
and hid in the building until it closed.

49
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,264
He used the loft, used a
lock pick gun on several doors.

50
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:31,814
Out on the roof via a window
on the... that would be the west side.

51
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,719
Move the press further away.

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,344
He must have escaped across the roof,
we've no idea where he is.

53
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,012
Description?

54
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:43,668
Nothing, he was wearing a hoodie.
Got in the same way he got out.

55
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,259
Only surveillance at
the entrance.

56
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:50,588
The deputy attorney general was last seen
and hour and a half before they closed.

57
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:53,945
He went to the toilet after the
hearing, and wasn't see again.

58
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,353
And the money?

59
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:58,302
Nobody touched them on the bus.
We've picked them up.

60
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,973
You talked to him, what's the deal?
Is he calling again?

61
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,668
- I need a car.
- Lund...

62
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,636
- What? Yes, I suppose.
. But you don't know?

63
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:08,090
Why were you
talking to the deputy earlier?

64
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:13,009
The first mate from the Zeeland ship, he and
the two other sailors had witnessed something.

65
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,117
- It's a case we should look into.
- Why haven't I heard about this before?

66
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,472
There wasn't time.

67
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,639
We are going to the place where the girl
was held last night. I need a car now.

68
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,706
You are not going anywhere
before I get the phone.

69
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:29,810
Give it to me.

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,450
And get the people working at
the deceased's office in for questioning.

71
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,904
He has to call again or
it doesn't make sense.

72
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:48,601
I spoke to him on and of for 90 minutes,
how could you not get a trace?

73
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:52,064
It's a new number, via the Internet
from an IP number in London.

74
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,936
If you had been quicker...

75
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:56,647
We couldn't know he would kick
a man of the roof.

76
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:00,268
And I didn't stop for a chat with
the family at the station.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,275
Soo, he is going to be a father.
Congratulations.

78
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,624
Why aren't they moving.

79
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:13,209
You getting that desk job at OPA might
turn out to be a good idea.

80
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,991
So you have time...
to be a grandma and all that.

81
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,626
Of course it's a bit strange
way to be told.

82
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,505
- May take a bit to get used to the idea.
- She was heavily pregnant!

83
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:29,043
It's probably her.
She doesn't want him to tell.

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,252
Yeah, probably her.
Couldn't have anything to do with you.

85
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:40,516
If there is a problem, why....  buy a gift,
go over there and congratulate them.

86
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,485
Why don't you just stick to what you know.

87
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:47,253
You don't know anything about me,
you don't know anything about my life.

88
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,707
I remember standing on a corner with a
van full of my furniture, and waited...

89
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:56,020
- Could have done with an explanation.
- Well, that was totally rushed...

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,478
Perhaps, but it's a bit late to figure that out
when we had made the initial payment.

91
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,037
So it's because I owe you money??

92
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:11,314
You do know, when there is something
emotionally taxing, you tend to run away.

93
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:14,565
Well, then it's a good thing
nothing came of it then.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

95
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:27,721
The minister of Justice and the head of SIS
are here already.

96
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:33,731
The place is a bankrupt bank, and SIS apologizes
but it was the only bug proof location nearby.

97
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:37,410
- Who was the deceased?
- 44 year old deputy attorney general.

98
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:41,407
The Ransom money weren't collected,
and they don't know where the girl is.

99
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,204
The finance minister wants a meeting.
And we should respond to Ussing.

100
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:48,270
- Kamper, I can explain.
- Better start talking then.

101
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:53,311
Zeuthen's daughter kidnapped,
deputy attorney general murdered.

102
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,242
And Ussing says you held
a meeting days ago?

103
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,455
The others will be
here momentarily.

104
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:02,909
If they have been watching TV I'm sure they'll
understand if we start without them.

105
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,755
I understand your anger, and we
are looking into it.

106
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:09,048
- Is it true?
- Well, if may be allowed to explain.

107
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,350
By all means.

108
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:14,852
I met with SIS because my ministry
received an anonymous document.

109
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:19,012
At our public mail address.
We couldn't trace the sender.

110
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:24,992
It's titled "An indictment", but turns out to
be long angry rant directed at the government.

111
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,901
Left wing rhetoric and
doomsday prophecies.

112
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:33,261
Government and state are the flunkies
of big business.

113
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:38,607
The writer concludes the guilty
should be held accountable.

114
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:43,232
- Is Emilie Zeuthen mentioned in it?
- No. But Zeeland is, several times.

115
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,310
That's why we
listed her name.

116
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,357
So you thought she was in danger?

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,048
No. SIS made a risk assessment of possible
targets and she was very low on the list.

118
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:56,479
Especially since the material was received
just after you had announced the election.

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,846
So we focused on protection
of the politicians, including yourself.

120
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,954
Of curse that could have been
the intent of the perpetrator.

121
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,038
We couldn't predict something would happen
to Emilie Zeuthen, or we would have acted.

122
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,988
Zeuthen is one of our supporters.

123
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:12,237
That doesn't explain how Ussing
learned of this and not me.

124
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:17,415
He claims someone had put it in his pigeonhole
at Christiansborg. We are looking into it.

125
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:21,513
And I couldn't tell you because only
just now did SIS determine,

126
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:25,560
that the message was sent from the
computer the offender used on Zeelands ship.

127
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,988
We knew earlier, but you were
at an election meeting.

128
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,673
- Which I stopped.
- What about the girl?

129
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,560
We don't know if the perpetrator will
initiate contact again.

130
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:39,891
But we are working with the police, following
several leads. Including links to an old case.

131
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,454
That's all I can tell you
at the moment.

132
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,309
Can you tell me more?

133
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,431
No no.. that, -.. this is news to me.

134
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,525
Well then I think you should
familiarize yourself with it.

135
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:52,041
We are looking bad now,
there was a threat.

136
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:56,515
Go through this with a fine tooth comb, and show
nothing indicated a plot against Emilie Zeuthen

137
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,094
- Agreed? Thanks.
- Of course, I have interrupted my election ...

138
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:02,445
... I'll go to the ministry...

139
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,135
The minister of Justice
will refute it?

140
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:12,859
Yes, a brief press release, nothing big
until he has cleared it with us.

141
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:17,554
- Did SIS know who Ussings source is?
- No, but they are investigating it.

142
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,188
But they think it could be related
to an old police case.

143
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,097
How so?

144
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,215
The minister of justice didn't know about it,
but is looking into it... don't we have toast?

145
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,844
We have to get focus back on
the election campaign.

146
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,636
I've told you to keep
toast stocked at all times.

147
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:38,352
As if the kidnapping isn't enough, the center
party has canceled all our  joint events.

148
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,520
You have to talk to Rosa Lebech,
she's not answer any of us.

149
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:45,306
There is nothing left to talk about,
we had a deal, she didn't show.

150
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,311
It's not about you two. She's in Horsens,
we'll have to drive over there then.

151
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:54,006
No. Hell no. I'm not crawling on hands and knees
to some party leader. Not after that stunt.

152
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:56,923
You'll debate in front of 2500 people tomorrow.

153
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:02,896
We need the Center Party,  you have to get
past your personal problems.

154
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,912
You've promised the electorate that
you'll fight for a wide coalition.

155
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,263
I can't let the minister of finance wait.

156
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,132
The other candidates need to
know where we stand.

157
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,958
Then the finance minister can get
on in Horsens, we'll talk on the bus.

158
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:20,099
The Center Party is the
most important thing right now.

159
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,930
Ok fine, we'll do that then.

160
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:24,340
Thank you.

161
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,329
But he promised we'd
get her back.

162
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,770
We are trying to determine
what went wrong.

163
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,606
But you don't know the
deputy attorney general ?

164
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:44,277
No. And I want to talk to somebody
who knows what is going on.

165
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,301
The perpetrator did not accept the money,
supposedly because it wasn't enough.

166
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:52,287
- He killed the deputy attorney general instead.
- When is he calling again?

167
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:56,766
We don't know. But we have found a place
where we think he kept Emilie last night.

168
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,784
- Where? What happened?
- We are examining the place...

169
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:03,479
We'll let you know as soon as we know more.

170
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,291
He will call Maja.

171
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:19,784
Sometime today.

172
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,432
Exactly. Thank you.

173
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,066
Yes, I'll call you back.

174
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:29,930
Can I help you?

175
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,775
You said you knew where she
had been last night?

176
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:36,714
We'll tell you more
once we are certain.

177
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,883
Mr. Zeuthen, I'm afraid
I'll have to ask you to leave.

178
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,498
You staying here is not
a good idea.

179
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,475
We've found hair.

180
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,700
Apparently she slept on the madras.
If she slept.

181
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,288
She's got something to eat,
and something to read.

182
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,222
Only light from a small lamp.

183
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,867
What about semen, finger prints?

184
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:21,234
They don't know yet.
Why didn't he accept the money?

185
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:25,276
He noticed we were closed
and made a quick getaway.

186
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,036
It's Borch. Yes?

187
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:34,642
She was scratching her name in the wall.
She must have been feeling totally alone.

188
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:41,487
Asbjørn, perhaps you should
go get a bit of fresh air.

189
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:44,126
Who the hell would
do that to a child?

190
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,572
The building across the street has
a surveillance camera,

191
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,379
Come on Asbjørn, lets
go take a look at that.

192
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:57,196
Lund! Robert Zeuthen is here, he refuses to
leave until he's spoken to someone in charge.

193
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:09,299
You have to leave, you'll get a briefing
once we have finished.

194
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,543
You said he had accepted my offer.

195
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,684
- We are still investigating...
- You must know why he changed his mind.

196
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,853
He used the phrase "small change"...

197
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:23,093
Is she still alive?

198
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,111
We assume so.

199
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:32,604
Do you know deputy attorney general
Peter Schultz?

200
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,342
No.

201
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:37,351
- What was she doing here?
- Have you met the 3 dead sailors?

202
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,173
- You don't know any of them.
- No.

203
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,759
Did he do something to her?

204
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,886
Not as far as we can see.

205
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,665
I want to see where she was kept.

206
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,036
I would like to see it.

207
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,059
She had light, and food.

208
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,829
He's given her something to read.

209
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:28,354
She's tried to write her name on the
wall, that's a positive sign.

210
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,238
Please don't touch anything.

211
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:38,079
<i>"Læsefidusen at the sea"</i>

212
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,574
She loves "Læsefidusen"...

213
00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:47,908
How would he know that?

214
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:52,556
Lund! Borch is ready with the video
surveillance.

215
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:54,828
Right.

216
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,138
Thank you.

217
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,215
The camera is filming the entrance.

218
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,662
Not a damn thing, and you can only
see half the building.

219
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,259
Stop there, go back.

220
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,885
No.. let me...

221
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:32,988
There...

222
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,514
What the hell is that... a car?

223
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:43,088
Can't see license plates. A transporter?

224
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,106
No, too tall.
It's a camper van.

225
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,666
Old make.

226
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,213
The lights look like something
from the eighties.

227
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,486
Do you recognize the brand?

228
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,436
No, but I'll find out.

229
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:06,111
We have increased surveillance
of bridges and borders.

230
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:09,254
And all precincts have been
instructed to stop camper vans

231
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:13,942
We still need to establish everything the
deputy attorney general did in the last 48 hours.

232
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,917
What's the status right now?

233
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,345
We've sent inquiries to Sweden and Germany.

234
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:22,097
We are checking all camper
vans from '80 to '95

235
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,894
Bring me a cuppa will you?

236
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:27,304
There are about 4000 left on the roads,
so it might take a while.

237
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:30,072
Though I think Asbjørn is zeroing
in on the model.

238
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:33,058
Did we get that case yet?

239
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,085
All those eighties models
look the same.

240
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,441
A bed recess camper, either Bürstner or Fiat.

241
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:42,208
Where do you hide
a camper van in November?

242
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:45,427
A caravan park, many of those places
are now open in the winter.

243
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:48,167
It's preferable to the street if
you have to give up your house.

244
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:53,094
Get moving then, where are they, who lives
there, anyone got a camper van this evening?

245
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,003
Ok, Sarah you spoke to the deputy
attorney general, what did he say?

246
00:15:57,176 --> 00:16:02,030
Only that there was a case, about a child found
dead at some provincial harbor.

247
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,951
That has to be the connection between him
and the crew from the Zeeland ship.

248
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,847
I requested the case files
hours ago.

249
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:12,007
And we need to talk about this...

250
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:17,660
My superior just informed me that the perpetrator
mailed that to the ministry of justice.

251
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,336
About two weeks ago,
did you know about that?

252
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:25,622
Yes of course. But we didn't know
it was from him until earlier today.

253
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,359
What is it, let me see.

254
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:30,110
Well read it, but it doesn't refer to
an old case.

255
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,678
Management is breathing
down my neck.

256
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:37,237
It wouldn't hurt if you and SIS
spoke up a bit sooner next time, ok?

257
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:41,876
Because of the cutbacks, all the cases from the
jurisdictions have been gathered in one place.

258
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,228
So there are problems finding that case.

259
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:48,246
However the clerk from deputy
attorney generals office just arrived.

260
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,946
Good, thank you.

261
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,960
What about the phone?
It has power, right?

262
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:58,575
Interview her now. Then I'll try to explain to
management what the hell happened tonight.

263
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:04,190
When was the last time you
saw the deputy attorney general ?

264
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:06,702
Peter was...

265
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,927
He left the office
a quarter past three.

266
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:13,716
To be ready for court.

267
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:17,711
He said he would come back,
so I waited for him.

268
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,284
Until six...

269
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:21,993
Perhaps a little past.

270
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:26,167
A few weeks ago the deputy attorney general had
a meeting with a sailor from Zeeland.

271
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:29,138
Victor Matevski,... from the ship Medea.

272
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,143
It wasn't a meeting.

273
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,857
- The man just showed up.
- Tell us what you can remember.

274
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,575
He was unkempt,
and ...

275
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:41,927
I told him he should
have called in advance.

276
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,223
But then Peter came out...

277
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:48,214
Even though he was really busy he
took the time to speak to him.

278
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:52,129
- And what did he want?
- Peter said it was about witness compensation.

279
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:55,537
Though it must have been more.

280
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:00,725
- Peter did say anything else.
- You were his secretary, you must know the case?

281
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,439
Then I would have
look it up in the files.

282
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,134
Peter Schultz said it was in regards to
a dead child found in a harbor.

283
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,763
The first mate and his crew found the body,
tell us what you know.

284
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,805
A little girls life is at risk, you have to
think, what did the first mate say?

285
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,040
I don't know anything, and I don't
understand why I have to be here.

286
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,275
This is important. Come on,
you must have noticed something.

287
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:33,270
He wanted compensation for an old archived
case, didn't you find that strange?

288
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,617
Yes...

289
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:38,007
But that is what Peter said.

290
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:42,143
- I can't know if I misunderstood the sailor.
- Ok, it's going down.

291
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,744
Misunderstood what?

292
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:50,096
When he came in he said he wished
to change his statement.

293
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,932
And then a lot of incomprehensible
stuff about his conscience.

294
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,143
- Change to what?
- I don't know!

295
00:18:56,444 --> 00:19:00,434
But when he had left, Peter said
it was about compensation.

296
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,246
And that was that.

297
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:11,983
He hung up.

298
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:24,386
Hello?

299
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:28,904
Next time you give the phone to someone else
I shall assume you don't care about the girl.

300
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:32,059
- Do you understand me Lund?
- Yeah, please excuse me.

301
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,162
I'll call tomorrow morning for a new bid.
I hope you take it seriously this time.

302
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,218
Did you have to kill him?

303
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,012
I wanted to recover a debt,

304
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,537
And not be fobbed off by what Zeeland
spends on fuel in a day.

305
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,453
But why him?
And the three on the ship?

306
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,730
Do you have children Lund?

307
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,401
I asked you if you had children.

308
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,876
- Yeah.
- Boy or Girl?

309
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:59,185
- How many do you have?
- A son.

310
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,768
Then you know the value
of a child.

311
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,927
- I'll call tomorrow.
- How do we know she is still alive?

312
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,610
<i>"Zeuthen's daughter kidnapped"</i>

313
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,149
... it's important. Where is she?

314
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:58,112
She has enough problems because of you,
you can leave a message with me.

315
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:06,230
<i>"Wedding Invitation"</i>

316
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,305
He called.

317
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,561
And he mailed a photo.

318
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:23,078
I've summoned some experts, they'll be landing
later tonight. Hopefully they can help.

319
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,253
- You said you'd seen where he kept her?
- Only briefly.

320
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,941
Just a room. Nothing special.

321
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,461
- How do they know she had been there?
- She had scraped her name on the wall.

322
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:41,089
Part of her name.

323
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,420
The first couple of letters; E m i

324
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,293
It seems he had a great deal
of knowledge of Emilie.

325
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:53,516
The police wants to know if we've
seen something unusual.

326
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,426
Or perhaps overlooked something.

327
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,828
You think we did something?

328
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:06,070
No. But I think we should go
over the procedure.

329
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,501
- Made sure that...
- Here they are. All the rules you force on us.

330
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,698
Item by item.

331
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:18,337
And of course your security guards come
running at all odd times of the day.

332
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,917
You've harassed us from day one.

333
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:26,791
We've done everything you've asked.
And now you screwed up.

334
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:30,511
- Then you dare come here and accuse Maja.
- Stop it Carsten.

335
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:33,828
No. That idiot has made you
cry so many times.

336
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,787
Not once has he listened to you.

337
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,378
You can't accept she left
your gilded cage.

338
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:43,884
And you have been
punishing her ever since.

339
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:46,809
I'd like you to leave.

340
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:54,579
They should be informed before they land.

341
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:58,638
You pick up them up at Copenhagen airport,
I'll deal with the rest.

342
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,690
Call me if there are problems.

343
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:07,118
Your security chief is having a conference
call with the English consultants.

344
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,400
Getting them up to speed.
They'll be landing in 4 hours.

345
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:14,808
The group who helped us in Somalia
last year are also coming.

346
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,381
They've mailed a few scenarios,
I think we should look at.

347
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:24,240
And we should talk about the investigation,
they press have been ...

348
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,154
Do you think...
I've treated Maja unreasonably?

349
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:32,704
No... why?

350
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:41,084
On the contrary, I think
you've been quite understanding.

351
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,831
She refused spousal support.

352
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,708
I wish it had turned out
better for you two.

353
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:51,998
But...

354
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:55,191
..she didn't quite accept
the company...

355
00:23:55,381 --> 00:24:00,013
Thanks. I'll look at the files on my own.
See you at the company in a couple of hours.

356
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:15,820
We need to get to the
bottom of this matter.

357
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:20,336
If the PM has lied to further his election
campaign, we need to know this.

358
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,567
We need to get the agenda changed before
the election meeting tomorrow.

359
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:31,801
- I have a conference call in a moment.
- It will only take a moment.

360
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:35,916
- You abused my confidence
- It's a mistake. Can we sit?

361
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:40,667
There won't be an alliance. Sorry I didn't
call you back, but I've been busy.

362
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:45,273
Ussing is jumping to conclusions. The minister
of justice is preparing a report for tomorrow.

363
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:49,727
- Does he do anything else but write reports?
- What did you expect?

364
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:54,292
A little girl has been taken, a sick
individual runs around killing people.

365
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:59,103
And you expect to get a running stream of details
because it would help your election campaign?

366
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:04,601
- Fact is, you tried to pressure me into...
- I didn't pressure you into anything!

367
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:08,084
We agreed on this policy,
and present it tonight.

368
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,210
Where were you?

369
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:13,389
- You could have trusted me.
- I did, but it doesn't work.

370
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,753
If we can't trust each other politically
how can I look you in the eyes afterwards.

371
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:25,984
Karen, could you give us a moment.

372
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,013
Of course, lets move outside.

373
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:41,519
What's going on?
The finance minster is here.

374
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,456
Seems to take longer
than expected.

375
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:48,783
We need do something, your brother
is too focused on the Zeuthen affair.

376
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:51,839
He's got it under control.
It's Lebech who's got you worried.

377
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,017
No, he's also canceling meetings left and right.
He is taking the abduction personal.

378
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,794
And we both know why.

379
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:03,723
I feel for him, but it must stop, you
are his brother, you have to talk to him.

380
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,545
Right?

381
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:10,166
How long have you been in love with him?
My brother.

382
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,452
How long have you
felt that way?

383
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:16,839
Erm, what are you
talking about, I'm not in love with him.

384
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,575
And we're off.

385
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,043
What are the police saying?

386
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:33,025
They have resumed the dialog with the kidnapper,
and received a picture of Emilie Zeuthen.

387
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:36,110
- She's still alive.
- Really, that's good to know.

388
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:40,404
But why haven't you told the
minister of justice to deny Ussings claims?

389
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,883
We have to be certain
of all details.

390
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:46,954
But he has said he didn't overlook anything,
we are suffering in the polls.

391
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:51,084
Birgit, he has called a press conference
in the morning, when all has been checked.

392
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:56,207
The longer we delay the worse it's going to get,
we are losing votes to the Center Party.

393
00:26:57,095 --> 00:27:00,991
Tomorrow is the biggest and most important
rally in the election campaign.

394
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:04,924
Listen: Rosa and the Center Party are still
prepare to form an alliance.

395
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:07,775
They are just waiting
for the report tomorrow.

396
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:10,630
- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yes it is.

397
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:14,515
- What did you have to give them?
- Well, nothing is free.

398
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,452
I didn't cut up the finance bill,
if that's your fear.

399
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,854
Ussing will be briefed
in the morning as well.

400
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,017
Ok... I'll let the party know then.

401
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:30,352
- How did he get out of that?
- And why isn't he wearing a tie?

402
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:39,773
Asbjørn is on his way to Slagelse. They've
checked all the caravan parks in Copenhagen.

403
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:43,888
Didn't you say they had improved their
ability to trace the calls?

404
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:48,282
SIS have dispatched a team to London
to go through the IP protocols.

405
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:51,212
- Where are you?
- Talk later.

406
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,116
Come in! It's open!

407
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,912
Hi. Sorry if we are too noisy,
we've are almost done.

408
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:29,666
- You live upstairs right? I'm Eva.
- Eh,no, I just wanted to speak to Mark...

409
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,150
Is he home?

410
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:35,086
No, he is just running an errand.

411
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:39,841
Are you Marks mother?

412
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:41,934
Yes...

413
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,399
Sorry. Sarah.

414
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,603
Do you know when he'll be back?

415
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:54,031
No, I don't. But why don't you stay.
You want something to drink?

416
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:55,737
No thanks.

417
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:58,428
We are busy renovating
the place.

418
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:03,551
It's cheap, the guy who owned
it went bust.

419
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:07,993
But they want to rent to someone
who can see the possibilities.

420
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,659
It's nice to meet you.

421
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,443
Mark hasn't said a lot.

422
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:19,295
You almost got a mystical aura,
not that he has said anything bad about you.

423
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:24,194
I've been wanting to meet you.
So you could see the bump.

424
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,785
He didn't feel the time was right.

425
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:30,324
And we've had
a lot to do.

426
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,469
- Eva.
- Yes?

427
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:38,257
Look what I found in the container.

428
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,105
Hi.

429
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:43,335
Hi...

430
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:48,640
- Did something happen?
- No, I was just in the neighborhood

431
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:54,101
What do you want?

432
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:58,057
Well nothing... I just thought
it's been so long since...

433
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:08,287
It's a big project you've started here.
If you need some help...

434
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,235
- Just let me know.
- Thank you, but it wont be necessary.

435
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:15,953
- You haven't talked to grandma?
- Yes.

436
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:20,495
Yes but she.., well she didn't say...

437
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:25,265
... you were expecting.
By chance I saw you at...

438
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:28,796
- But congratulations
- Thanks.

439
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:33,637
I just want to help,
with anything.

440
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,637
I think we've got
most things under control.

441
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,897
But we do need some place to sleep a
few days until the ceiling is done.

442
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:45,477
Yes, but, fine, just let me know when.

443
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:51,447
If I'm not home the key is under
the potted plant next to the door.

444
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:56,302
You can.. well, i should have moved it inside,
it doesn't handle frost..

445
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,663
Mom...

446
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:01,023
It's fine.
See you.

447
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,881
Your phone is ringing,
you better answer it.

448
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,617
It's Lund..

449
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,844
No camper van in Slagelse, or
any caravan park on Zealand

450
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:36,766
But that case has appeared. It was the Zeeland
crew who found that girl in a Jutland harbor.

451
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:38,725
It was a girl?

452
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:43,940
Yes, 13 years of age, orphan. Difficult life
with several different foster parents.

453
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:47,814
Then she runs away and is found
dead a few days later.

454
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:52,331
The local police invested the case
and concluded it was suicide.

455
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,591
And the deputy attorney general agreed that
the cased had been solved.

456
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,937
Is there an autopsy report?

457
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:02,636
Yes, but no mention of
physical violence.

458
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:07,033
Foam around mouth and nose,
water in the lungs.

459
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:11,591
It's signed by post-mortem examiner
Lis Vissenbjerg

460
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,234
Conclusion: Death by drowning.

461
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:17,056
Where did the autopsy take place?

462
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,052
The Institute of Forensic Medicine
in Copenhagen.

463
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,621
Bit odd for a corpse
from Jutland.

464
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:27,840
I agree. I'll send the report to you,
we'll talk to the examiner tomorrow.

465
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:33,171
What about you? Are you with your son?
Are you talking? Good friends?

466
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:35,636
See you tomorrow.

467
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:42,658
Friday November 11

468
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:46,163
Day 3

469
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,550
- So will it be a boy or a girl?
- Erm, we didn't get that far.

470
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,751
If the first mate wanted to change his testimony
he must have known or done something.

471
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:57,840
- Croissant?
- What? No thanks.

472
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,048
"Didn't get that far".
What does that mean?

473
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:06,186
You didn't talk about it at all? Wouldn't it
be an obvious topic of conversation?

474
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:09,940
- Time was short. Lis Vissenbjerg ?
- That way.

475
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:13,550
If I was becoming grandma,
or grandpa, I'd want...

476
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:17,026
Look, I know you mean well,
but it's all good.

477
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:23,130
Excuse me. Lis Vissenbjerg?

478
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:35,442
But you signed it, you
must remember something?

479
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:38,505
If I could have a moment
to skim the report.

480
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,587
Can you explain why they wanted her
autopsied here instead of in Jutland?

481
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,814
Come on, that's irrelevant formalities.

482
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:54,843
We are investigating if there is a connection
between this and Emilie Zeuthens kidnapping.

483
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:58,408
And the people killed may have
affected the closure of the case.

484
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:02,955
It might be the perpetrator is somewhat
upset at the outcome.

485
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,159
Well, it was a bit unusual.

486
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:14,940
Because of cutbacks in Jutland there were
bottlenecks, so I was asked to do it.

487
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:18,546
- Did you talk to the deputy attorney general?
- No, not at all.

488
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:20,341
The body was
very damaged?

489
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:25,170
All of it post-mortem, it had been in the
harbor for a while.

490
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:29,509
- But no signs of crime.
- And nobody contested that conclusion?

491
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,371
Somebody wanting revenge?

492
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:36,278
- You would have to ask the detectives.
- Well, I'm asking you.

493
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,780
As far as I remember the girl
was an orphan.

494
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:44,936
What about the three Zeeland sailors?
Did you get a DNA sample?

495
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:47,059
No, they weren't under suspicion.

496
00:34:47,278 --> 00:34:49,925
As I said, there were
no signs of a crime.

497
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,234
But you write here, that her hymen
was broken.

498
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,866
She was 13...

499
00:34:57,854 --> 00:35:00,977
If you have kids of that age
you know that can happen.

500
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:02,416
Excuse me.

501
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:09,397
You said there weren't any sign of
violence before her death.

502
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:12,115
What would you call this?

503
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:14,457
A measure of her state of mind.

504
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:18,263
And a possible reason for the suicide.
She was cutting herself.

505
00:35:20,297 --> 00:35:23,806
Asbjørn, excuse me,
Asbjørn has found a caravan park.

506
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:26,029
I think we should...

507
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:32,836
Thanks for your help.
Call me if you remember something.

508
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:14,308
Robert, we can't postpone this.

509
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:17,267
We have to reach a decision.

510
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,033
Everybody agrees the number
should be kept down.

511
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:39,531
Based on experience from
other abductions.

512
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:42,457
How is Carl?

513
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,769
He's asking for her. For you.

514
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:49,661
He may become greedy,
the negotiations will drag on...

515
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,658
We can't risk antagonizing
him again.

516
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:56,669
Which is why we should agree
on an amount before he calls.

517
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,189
I would give anything to get her back.

518
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:03,026
- But not unless you agree.
- I do.

519
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,583
If I'm understanding you correctly,

520
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:12,505
You are talking about an amount much larger
than what the experts have suggested.

521
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:13,141
Yes.

522
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:17,163
In that case I'll point out the
practical problems.

523
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:20,401
Our banks do not have that much
money in cash.

524
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:25,022
If he accepts my amount he'll
want it in another currency.

525
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,873
- We need Frankfurt.
- That will take time.

526
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:31,617
They might not want to insure
such a large amount.

527
00:37:31,758 --> 00:37:36,873
Take our plane and fly down there, then
the risk is ours. And it will save time.

528
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:42,293
So what is the amount
you are thinking of?

529
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:52,460
As you can see there was no basis for
believing there was a threat to Emilie Zeuthen.

530
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:56,456
Next time you find stuff in your
pigeonhole don't be so quick on the trigger.

531
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:59,343
Point of fact, there was a threat
and nobody reacted.

532
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:06,295
Optimistic of the minister to think we'll give
him a free ride as long as he publishes a report.

533
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:12,001
Unless there are more questions I think
we should move on. Not ruin tonights event.

534
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:14,522
What do you need answered?

535
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:18,101
The minister of justice spent
30 minutes investigating himself.

536
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:21,730
I understand the kidnapping has been
linked to an old police case?

537
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:25,960
- That is not mentioned.
- More from your pigeonhole?

538
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:29,209
I'm sure the police is doing all they
can to shed light on this.

539
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,525
How about we stick to
what we came for?

540
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:35,391
I want things brought to light,
this government has been hiding...

541
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:39,472
Listen! I've done all that I could to keep
you informed, from the very beginning.

542
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:44,053
If you really have so many problems
with the government you deserve each other.

543
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:51,559
I didn't spend years of governmental
cleanup only to listen to that.

544
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,771
We need to agree on the agenda
for tonights meeting.

545
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:56,284
You handle that.

546
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:59,997
SIS just informed me that Zeuthen
has settled on a large ransom amount.

547
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:03,432
They are not sure they can get that
much cash before the deadline.

548
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:06,342
Let them know we'll help,
lets just get out of here.

549
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,160
Kristian!

550
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:10,510
You aren't the only one who
has a lot riding on this.

551
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:13,279
If you can't find time to
talk about the inconsistencies...

552
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,677
- There are no inconsistencies!
- Of course we can find the time.

553
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:20,480
The ministry of justice will answer
any questions you might have.

554
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:23,409
Ok...

555
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:45,565
<i>You know the amount and what
you are supposed to say?</i>

556
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:49,249
Understood. Did you find the
investigator from the old case?

557
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:53,420
<i>We are looking, but right now it's important
that you focus on the caravan park.</i>

558
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:59,372
An old camper checked in late last night,
it fits the description.

559
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:02,194
But it left about two hours ago.

560
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:05,740
Why do we only learn this now?

561
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:09,186
The manager doesn't answer the
phone after 22 o'clock.

562
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:12,469
And we only realized this morning
that he's open during the winter.

563
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,651
- So what does he say?
- Sarah.

564
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:18,171
They traced the phone call,
and it originated here.

565
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:24,071
They are trying to identify the phone, but it was
a mobile call via the caravan parks wifi.

566
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,673
- Did Zeuthen chose a number?
- Yeah, they are offering 100.

567
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:31,346
- What did the manager say?
- 100 what? Million?

568
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,725
Yeah, if he is interested
in that at all.

569
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:38,550
What is he saying? They must have payment
information, passport, registration numbers.

570
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:41,372
He's a total slob, it's all a big mess.

571
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:48,805
I ain't spying on people. We've mostly sold out.
216 places, a mix of camper vans and caravans.

572
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,299
Plus 4 new cabins.

573
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:53,522
And no questions asked
is good for business, right?

574
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:56,492
I help people in desperate straits.

575
00:40:56,493 --> 00:41:01,336
Houses foreclosed, chased by the banks,
everything in the red..

576
00:41:01,337 --> 00:41:06,072
The person we are looking for checked in and out
with a camper van, someone must have seen him?

577
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:08,909
You can ask around.
He paid via the 'net.

578
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:12,994
And threw the voucher
in the mailbox.

579
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,697
Peter Schultz... he used the
deputy attorney general card...

580
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,102
Where was it parked?

581
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,061
Number 46... as it says on the voucher.

582
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:26,481
But you didn't see the driver,
or her?

583
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,161
And you have no idea
where they went?

584
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:33,054
Leave people alone.

585
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,779
That's my motto.

586
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,225
What have you got?

587
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:47,641
The family are willing to
pay 100 million kroner.

588
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:54,608
It's up to you how you want them paid out.
They just want her back.

589
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:59,254
Ok. I when them in Euro.
500 euro bills.

590
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:05,258
The should fit in max 5 suitcases.
And no GPS or cartridges

591
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:08,924
And how do I know
I can trust you this time?

592
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,039
You don't.

593
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:15,950
But be ready on route E47,
the bridge at ramp 16. At 16 o'clock.

594
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:20,819
I'm not sure they can
get the money that fast.

595
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,024
At 16 Lund.

596
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:34,345
He accepted the amount.

597
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:39,430
We have a bridge to examine, and see
if Brix and the others were listening in.

598
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,185
Wait.

599
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:44,077
No, we have a deal, we can't wait for you
to find him via London, or whatever.

600
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:47,538
They traced the call,
it was a straight GSM call.

601
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,925
He's within a 10 kilometer radius.

602
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:56,538
The report shows item for item all the meetings
the minster of justice has had with SIS.

603
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:01,412
- Before and after the kidnapping.
- I'd feel better if I got it from them.

604
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:05,612
But they helped prepare this,
they have no objections.

605
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:11,181
All the more reason to get it from them.
If you want to announce today you better hurry.

606
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,270
I'll see if they
can make it.

607
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:22,824
- Any news?
- They are trying again.

608
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:27,445
Zeuthen needs to raise a large amount of
money by a certain time, so fingers crossed.

609
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:29,772
It bothers you?

610
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,185
Yes, girl is only nine.
And her father isn't just anybody.

611
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:39,099
But it's more than that?
Isn't it?

612
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:41,624
You got a moment?

613
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:49,731
SIS did brief me.

614
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,850
Ussing just issued a statement.

615
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:55,795
Threating all kinds
of things after the election.

616
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:57,917
What does it matter.
Let him talk.

617
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,969
I checked on the
ministry of justice.

618
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:05,326
- That redhead from the Christmas party...
- 'stoffer I don't have time now.

619
00:44:05,452 --> 00:44:09,869
She thinks she might have
seen that old police case previously.

620
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:14,679
She wasn't sure, but when I mentioned
it involved sailors from Zeeland...

621
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,393
I did ask the minister, they
have no knowledge of the case.

622
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:22,894
Lebech is satisfied. We have to move
if we are to publish this before the debate.

623
00:44:25,013 --> 00:44:25,861
Right...

624
00:44:36,582 --> 00:44:38,857
Ok, let me know when you hear something

625
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:42,407
They call the area "the slush"

626
00:44:42,408 --> 00:44:45,913
Local police estimate 30-50 illegal
eastern Europeans live there.

627
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:49,043
They've tried to send them home,
but they keep coming back.

628
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:52,686
His mobile is still transmitting
to the mast so he must still be here.

629
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,154
Lets search the lot.

630
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,749
Brix says we stick to the plan and
wait for him to call.

631
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:01,385
But if the girl is there
we should get down there.

632
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:05,307
Brix is right, we don't know where she is.
We can't risk something happening to her.

633
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:08,277
Why would he suddenly call from an
easily traceable phone?

634
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:10,667
Who knows. You better get moving.

635
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:13,950
It makes no sense
I have to stand on a bridge if...

636
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,794
No. But you will do it.

637
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:18,823
And when he calls again
you'll say everything is going to plan.

638
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:21,214
We'll grab him when
he goes for the money.

639
00:45:21,215 --> 00:45:23,128
Sarah... get a move on.

640
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:32,563
- Any news from Zeuthen
- No.

641
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,699
Keep the Zeuthens at a distance.

642
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:34,328
- Wouldn't want them to get worried.
- Right.

643
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:37,476
Wear this.

644
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,521
We can't get too close.

645
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:43,566
But we will of course be listening.
Do what he says.

646
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,837
No matter what happens,
or what he says.

647
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:48,094
Did you talk to those
on the old case?

648
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:51,346
I talked to the guy responsible, and he
confirms the medical examiners testimony

649
00:46:51,347 --> 00:46:53,592
We'll have to try a
different approach.

650
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:55,343
We are ready.

651
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,012
Get moving Lund.
You have 2 minutes.

652
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,071
Look after the money, will you.

653
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:10,105
And yourself...

654
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:38,888
What's happening?
It's been 90 minutes?

655
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,736
He'll call, I'm going to have to ask you
to be patient and wait in the car.

656
00:47:44,438 --> 00:47:46,223
They are doing their best.

657
00:48:00,621 --> 00:48:03,343
- Lund
<i>- It's Lis Vissenbjerg, medical examiner</i>

658
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:06,134
<i>- Can we meet?</i>
- Now is not a good time.

659
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:08,004
Can I call back later?

660
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:11,257
<i>It's about the autopsy report.
It wasn't correct.</i>

661
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:15,581
<i>There were doubts.
The girl could have been killed.</i>

662
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:19,841
<i>But the deputy attorney general
wanted it removed. </i>

663
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:23,852
<i>He said he was being pressured, and I could
lose my job if I didn't comply.</i>

664
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:26,778
<i>I have some files
you should see.... hello?</i>

665
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:27,789
Yes..

666
00:48:28,692 --> 00:48:29,926
Where are you?

667
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:40,027
<i>The examiner just called me, she said the
autopsy report of that girl was falsified.</i>

668
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:44,097
She has something to show us, and
she wants to meet now.

669
00:48:44,098 --> 00:48:47,004
Right, we'll talk to her
when we are done here.

670
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:50,514
- Anything else happening?
- Nothing is happening.

671
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:51,848
He isn't calling.

672
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:54,878
We are wasting time,
he's on to us.

673
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:58,127
It's more important that
we meet with the examiner.

674
00:48:58,128 --> 00:49:01,592
Sarah. I'm hanging up now.
And you stay where you are.

675
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:06,276
Ok then.

676
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:26,897
- What's happening?
- Lund is leaving.

677
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:29,377
- She's what?
- She'll answer the phone if he calls.

678
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:31,960
She gave the money to
two colleagues at the bridge.

679
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:34,589
Get a female officer up there
as a replacement for Lund.

680
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,834
And find out what the
hell she is doing.

681
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:40,726
- Did he call?
- Not yet. Go back to your car please.

682
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:49,518
Yeah it's me. Lund left. No we don't know why.
You just stay at the ambush position, be ready.

683
00:49:50,014 --> 00:49:52,974
What's this about an ambush?
What is going on?

684
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:58,845
<i>The government is seeing renewed support
as the Center Party are clearly stating,</i>

685
00:49:58,846 --> 00:50:03,447
<i>they support Kristian Kamper in his
bid to be the next prime minster. </i>

686
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:06,618
The statement is seen as significant
victory for Kristian Kamper

687
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:10,350
shortly before the big debate
here at Messe Center Midtjylland.

688
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:14,584
Several of tomorrows editorials are saying
Ussing is trying to abuse the situation.

689
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:20,793
I'm sorry you were so upset earlier, I hope
you understand I'm just doing my duty.

690
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,361
That's fine.

691
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:27,209
- Am I starting, or is it you?
- You go ahead.

692
00:50:27,577 --> 00:50:29,406
Hi, nice to see you.

693
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:34,741
As I understand it, you will probably lose,
but as long as you understand it's not personal.

694
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:42,094
Well thank you. But perhaps you should
worry more about your own election campaign.

695
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:47,038
Well, it's not the first time you are
behind your minister of justice.

696
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,354
But congratulations on your alliance.

697
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:54,016
Let him dig his own grave,
don't let him provoke you.

698
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,004
But what the hell did he mean?

699
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,071
- Who knows.
- We've got to talk.

700
00:50:58,072 --> 00:50:59,659
- Later.
- No. Now.

701
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:02,599
The minister knew the case very well.

702
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:06,190
He asked for the case
during the investigation.

703
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:08,908
- Can't it wait.
- Wait, wait.

704
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:11,372
He personally signed the requisition.

705
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:15,265
He didn't speak up
when the sailors were killed.

706
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:18,488
He didn't speak up when
deputy attorney general was killed.

707
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:22,428
According to SIS he never explained
why he wanted the old police case files.

708
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:25,320
I've tried to get a hold of
him but no luck.

709
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:27,294
2500 people are waiting for you.

710
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:31,871
That's not all. SIS has a suspect
for the leaks to Ussing.

711
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:37,146
They are planning to interrogate a specific
civil servant in the ministry of justice.

712
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:39,239
Jens Lebech...

713
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,183
Rosa Lebech's ex-husband?

714
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:45,045
We can't run around out here,
we have to get back to Christiansborg

715
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:47,737
Not now.
You have to go in there right now.

716
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:52,830
We are canceling the tour, book a plane
and we'll leave as soon as this is done.

717
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:00,934
Where the hell is Lund?
What was she thinking?

718
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,997
Just focus.
We don't need her.

719
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:04,856
Excuse me, we have a problem.

720
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:06,744
The Zeuthen's are coming.

721
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:09,889
You've got to be kidding.

722
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:15,967
This wasn't part of the deal!

723
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:19,053
You are endangering the life
of your daughter. You have to leave.

724
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,480
Is she down there?

725
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:23,451
We have no guarantee that he will
hand over Emilie if we pay him.

726
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:26,603
Car incoming! Seems to be
heading towards the camper van.

727
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,770
I'm sorry, you have to get
back in the car.

728
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:33,978
Don't let them leave.

729
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:16,462
- Excuse me, Lis Vissenbjerg ?
- Eh, she should be around somewhere.

730
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:21,480
He doesn't care about the money,
this is about something else.

731
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:23,926
I'm going to meet the examiner.

732
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:27,406
I don't care what you are doing, as long
as you answer the phone when it calls.

733
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:29,305
A man entered the camper van.

734
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,647
He's not going to call
about that money, he doesn't care.

735
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:39,287
Keep him talking.

736
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:44,599
Lund.

737
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,469
<i> Please excuse the delay.
Do you have the money?</i>

738
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,458
Yes, I have them right here.

739
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:52,116
<i>I don't hear traffic, Lund?</i>

740
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:55,651
No, I just left for a moment,
but I'll be right back.

741
00:53:56,911 --> 00:54:00,034
<i>No, I changed my mind.
You don't need to waste your time.</i>

742
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:03,673
- No no, I'm on my way.
<i>- The deal is rescinded</i>

743
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,687
<i>I think there is a
better deal to be made..</i>

744
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:08,115
What do you mean?

745
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,491
I need to know if it's
the right van. Now.

746
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:29,096
- Niels damn it, come on. Is that the one?
- It is.

747
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:32,434
Where the hell is Zeuthen?

748
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:34,423
Where is Zeuthen?

749
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,871
It's the police! Stop!

750
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,514
Stay calm!

751
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:24,113
Borch? What's going on?
Did you find the girl?

752
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:28,960
<i>It was the right van, and some migrant worker
who didn't understand why it was here.</i>

753
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,239
<i>And a mobile phone which
relayed the signal.</i>

754
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:34,436
Sarah just a moment.

755
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,198
Sarah?

756
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:44,659
They tell me the trace leads to a
landline at The Institute of Forensic Medicine.

757
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,353
You'd better get outside.

758
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:47,706
<i>Now.</i>

759
00:55:48,305 --> 00:56:48,165

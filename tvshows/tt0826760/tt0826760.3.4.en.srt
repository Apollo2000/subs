1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,119
The police are searching for Robert
Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,159
who disappeared from her home
earlier this evening.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,439
- What are you doing to find her?
- Sarah Lund. Who is this?

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,799
The girl's all right. I'm collecting
on a debt. What's she worth to you?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,919
The next time you consider
paying small change for a girl's life...

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,359
then consider this.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,559
We're looking into a connection between
this case and the Zeuthen kidnapping.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,079
Those killed may have been
instrumental in closing the case.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,119
- Did you speak to the public prosecutor?
- Not at all.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,039
Robert, we can't postpone this.
We need to make a decision.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,319
- I'll pay anything to get her back.
- He used the words 'small change'.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,359
- Is she alive?
- We assume so.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,599
- Has he done anything to her?
- Not as far as we can see.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,319
We're struggling with Zeeland.
There's a financial crisis.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,559
- Is the girl alive?
- We're checking several leads.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,479
There's a possible connection between
the murders and a certain police case.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,999
- How did Ussing get the information?
- You need to speak to Rosa Lebech.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,639
They're going to question an official,
who may have a motive, Jens Lebech.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,159
Rosa Lebech's ex-husband?

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,079
When you're struggling with something
emotional, you tend to do a runner.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,599
She was heavily pregnant.
She probably doesn't want him to say.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,959
I asked to meet you. We could use
a place to sleep for a few days.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,679
Mum, we'll manage.
See you.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,359
The family is willing
to pay 100 million kroner.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,279
This is Lis Vissenberg from Forensics
calling about the autopsy report.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,799
It's not correct. The prosecutor said,
I'd lose my job if I didn't obey.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,119
The deal is off.
I can get more out of it than that.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,439
THE KILLING III

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,359
- What's your ETA at Forensics?
- A few minutes. We're on our way.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,119
- What is Lund's position?
- I can't get through to her. Hurry up.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,839
Roger that. We'll hurry.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,839
- We'll be there soon.
- He's gone. I've looked everywhere.

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,199
The coroner's been killed, but I think
I've found what she wanted to show us.

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,639
It's an autopsy report,
but not the one we've seen.

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,159
It's dated earlier.
It hasn't been stamped, so I think...

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,559
What?
Hello? Sarah?

38
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,759
Borch?

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,439
Drop the gun.

40
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,959
He won't have time to
pull the trigger, if you shoot.

41
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,479
Drop the gun, Lund.
I'm going to count to three.

42
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,119
- One... two...
- Sarah, shoot!

43
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,919
Three.

44
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,519
Why didn't you shoot?

45
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,599
Do you think, his life is worth more
than the girl's?

46
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,559
I'll give you one last chance, Lund,
to bring me an interesting offer.

47
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,359
One chance.

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,799
I'll call tomorrow.

49
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,559
She's been conscious but she was
sedated, and her blood has been tapped.

50
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,119
- Did he say this is our last chance?
- He'll call tomorrow. What about Borch?

51
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,359
You left 100 million without telling me,
so I hope you've found something out.

52
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,839
The coroner called to say that
she wanted to show me these papers.

53
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,759
That's the original autopsy report.
She's made various notes,

54
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,439
which could indicate that
the girl didn't commit suicide.

55
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,919
The assistant public prosecutor pressed
her into removing them from the report.

56
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,799
We need to talk to the officer
who investigated the old case.

57
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,559
So, it's because of this,
people are getting killed?

58
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,999
We also need to ask Zeuthen if he knows
anything about it. I'll check on Borch.

59
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,479
We talked to people. Nobody's heard
or seen anything at the camp site.

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,199
You need to find more than that,
or we don't have a damned thing.

61
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,479
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

62
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,999
- Were there any witnesses?
- No.

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,119
Why the hell didn't you shoot?
We had him.

64
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,999
- Why didn't you pull the trigger?
- The campervan's with the technical unit.

65
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,159
Go check it out right now.
We need something fast.

66
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,239
- You should have shot him.
- Then we couldn't have found the girl.

67
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
You're a good shot. You could have
hit him in the arm or the leg.

68
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,719
If you hadn't interfered,
I would have had him.

69
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,079
- You had him! I said I was OK.
- Yes, but I wasn't.

70
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,359
I don't understand...

71
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,039
You were standing there.
Is that so damn difficult to understand?

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,199
You were in the way.

73
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,039
So, I couldn't.

74
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,119
Don't move too much. It's a deep gash
and can easily open up.

75
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,319
The police confirm
that another person's been killed.

76
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,599
Supposedly a coroner.

77
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,919
- The kidnapper wasn't after the money.
- Why not?

78
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,639
I don't know, but he's called again
to arrange a new exchange tomorrow.

79
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,279
- Did he mention Emilie?
- No.

80
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,599
Did he say why
he didn't want the money?

81
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,079
No.

82
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,599
He apparently said, that this is
our last chance to interest him.

83
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,079
The 100 million is on its way
to the National Bank...

84
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,319
Let me out. I'd like to get out.

85
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,119
Stop the car.
I want to get out now!

86
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,639
Maja, stop!

87
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,999
We're not getting her back.
Don't you see?

88
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,479
- He's just putting pressure on us.
- She's probably already dead.

89
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,319
She knows we're coming for her.
We will get her back!

90
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,079
Why didn't you
let me take her home?

91
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,559
She just needed to go home.

92
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
I promise you,
that we'll get her back.

93
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,519
OK?
I promise you.

94
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,279
PM Kamper broke off his electoral tour
in Jutland to return to Christiansburg.

95
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,679
Leader of the Opposition,
anders Ussing,

96
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,639
accuses the government of negligence
in the case of Emilie Zeuthen,

97
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,399
who's now been missing
for three days.

98
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,399
Another person has been killed,
and a new attempt to retrieve the girl

99
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,959
was not carried through as planned.
The perpetrator's motive is unclear.

100
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,199
Neither the police nor Special Branch
have made a statement.

101
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,439
Ussing believes that the murders
could have been avoided,

102
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,879
if the Justice Minister, Mogens Rank,
hadn't ignored serious danger signals.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,439
I apologise
for not returning your call.

104
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,119
But now an official has informed me,
that we did know about the old case.

105
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,439
I was in a meeting about the exchange,
so I was hoping...

106
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,679
- Just tell me about the case.
- It was an uncomplicated case.

107
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,559
A 13-year-old girl was found dead
in a harbour in West Jutland.

108
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,199
The case also involved
three Zeeland sailors.

109
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
And that, of course,
is why the case went by my desk.

110
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,319
- Why 'of course'?
- I know how much Zeeland means.

111
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,559
But the girl had committed suicide,

112
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,839
so, from the sidelines, I ascertained
that the case was considered solved.

113
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,839
Last night you said that
you knew nothing about this case.

114
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,679
Yes, and I do apologise.
I had forgotten about it.

115
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,239
- Forgotten about it?
- Yes. Well... I had.

116
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,839
I'll have to ask my officials
for an explanation.

117
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,359
And when you'd received an indictment,
when the three sailors had been killed,

118
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,279
and later the public prosecutor,
who'd been involved in the case,

119
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,959
- still no bells started ringing?
- No.

120
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,079
No.

121
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,479
I didn't have that case present.
It was of no importance!

122
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,079
Have you at any time
been partial in this case?

123
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,319
- Did you intervene?
- Excuse me, what do you mean?

124
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,919
Of course not. And there was nothing
to suggest the case wasn't solved.

125
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,599
No, but there bloody well is now!

126
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,559
Emilie Zeuthen's life
is depending on this case.

127
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,879
The perpetrator has just told us, this
is our last chance of getting her home.

128
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,719
That I should have intervened
or kept secrets is absurd, it's outrageous!

129
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,359
And it's not my fault
that the case was leaked to Ussing.

130
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,839
If Special Branch are right in their
suspicions of a certain official,

131
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,999
who is Rosa Lebech's ex-husband,
you damn well can't blame me for that!

132
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,679
Until further notice you'll make
no statements in this case.

133
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,639
And answer your phone, when I call.

134
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,279
I don't trust Mogens.
We need to check his story.

135
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,439
I couldn't get sushi,
but you need to eat.

136
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,639
Have the secretary at the Ministry of
Justice check all minutes and journals,

137
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,359
from when Mogens received the case,
until it was considered solved.

138
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,119
The Treasurer wants a meeting.

139
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,839
Did you speak to
the head of Special Branch?

140
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,599
Yes, he's on his way.

141
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,439
They're questioning Jens Lebech now.
Eat, while it's hot.

142
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
I want all info from the police
and Special Branch,

143
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,079
when the Ministry of Justice gets it,

144
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,879
and Karen, set up a press conference.
The public has a right to be told.

145
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,919
I've muzzled Mogens, so I'll handle it,
and I want Zeuthen informed in person.

146
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,479
Wait!

147
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,559
We cancelled meetings in Jutland,
we agreed not to get drawn into the case.

148
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,559
If we'd stayed there, we'd have
been accused of dithering.

149
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,399
The press will make him the face of this.
What if it doesn't end well?

150
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,079
- We'll just make sure, that it does.
- Stoffer, it's time you said something.

151
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,759
Come on.

152
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,799
Karen's right. You're taking this
too personally, and I understand.

153
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,799
Emilie Zeuthen's disappearance worries
you deeply. Will she come home alive?

154
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,799
We want to help.

155
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,039
You may have personal reasons
to get involved, but you can't.

156
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,679
I know what I'm doing, thanks.
Set up that press conference,

157
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
and get things moving
at the Ministry of Justice, now.

158
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,319
He must have kept her in the campervan
when it was at the site.

159
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,239
But it was probably too risky
to bring her down to the gravel pit,

160
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,959
so he drove her somewhere else.

161
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,839
We haven't found any leads.

162
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,519
What the hell does he want,
if not 100 million?

163
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,399
Is this all you have?

164
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,319
- Is he just out to kill people?
- Tell me what you have.

165
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,439
We've found blond hair and bits of food
in the back of the cabin.

166
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,679
He probably put her in front of the TV
to watch her in the rear view mirror.

167
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,879
The camper was stolen
two weeks ago,

168
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,359
from a used car dealer,
who also knew nothing.

169
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,239
- Was she able to look out?
- A limited view through the windscreen.

170
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,719
The curtains are taped up.
There's no view out from the toilet.

171
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,519
Emilie's parents have arrived.

172
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,719
- Let Borch deal with it.
- Borch has gone to Jutland.

173
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,399
Brix and Special Branch wanted someone
to look into the old case.

174
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,079
You should've shot him,
when you had the chance.

175
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,039
We'll go through it all one more time.
There must be something here.

176
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,359
Everything suggests that Emilie
is getting enough food and drink,

177
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,999
and she's allowed to play.

178
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,279
Do these things
mean anything to you?

179
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,599
They're things she likes to play with.
He couldn't have known that.

180
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,119
He may have asked her, but I think
he's just trying to make her feel secure,

181
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,799
so that she'll cooperate with him.

182
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,559
But it's more likely
that he knew about these things before.

183
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,879
You've no idea...

184
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,479
No! How do you know he doesn't want
the money, when you ignored the plan?

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,799
Because he hasn't been
anywhere near it.

186
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,919
So far, he's just accepted the offers
in order to do other things.

187
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,959
Those killed were all involved
in the same police case.

188
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,119
A 13-year-old girl was found dead
in a harbour by three Zeeland sailors.

189
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,759
- I've told you, I know nothing about it.
- But it means a lot to the perpetrator.

190
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,119
- The girl appears to have been killed.
- How are you involved in this case?

191
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,879
I'm not. I've no idea
what you're talking about.

192
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,799
No, but if anyone at Zeeland
knows about the case, we want to know.

193
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,559
It may help save your daughter's life.

194
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,159
I'll have it looked into.
What are you doing?

195
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,639
- Where is she?
- We're still investigating leads.

196
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,359
So, you have no idea where she is?

197
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,119
When he calls again, you tell him that
we'll pay anything. There's no ceiling.

198
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,919
And you do as he says.

199
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,199
She scratched her name. She knows we're
looking for her. Maybe she's trying...

200
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,399
We've searched the campervan,
but we didn't find anything.

201
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,999
I want to see her room.
There must be a clue to what she knows.

202
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,399
- The police have already searched it.
- I don't care, I want to go, now.

203
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,999
He's been able to see her all the time.

204
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,759
I've been through the toilet roll.
There's nothing on it.

205
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,759
She's been able to look out here.

206
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,639
We need something dusted over here.

207
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,439
Top C. 03. KPS.

208
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,159
Top Camping.
She's written where she's been.

209
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,999
Ring Three. The ring road. That's the route
from the camp site to the gravel pit.

210
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,759
She's trying to tell us where she is.

211
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,199
You weren't aware of the old case?
The Justice Minister didn't mention it?

212
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,199
No. We would have liked
to have known about it earlier,

213
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,039
but the Minister is right in saying,
that on paper it doesn't seem important.

214
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,599
The Justice Minister is your employer,
so, I know you're weighing your answers,

215
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,999
but is there any reason to believe
that he actively intervened in the case?

216
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,839
He would have had to be in contact
with the dead prosecutor. No sign of that.

217
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,959
- But you have investigated it?
- Yes, we've asked for his calendar etc.

218
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,679
It's in his own interest.

219
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,239
I doubt he'd intervene
because of a few sailors.

220
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,079
What's his relationship
with Zeeland?

221
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,079
He has ties to Robert Zeuthen's father.
They went hunting, sailing and such.

222
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,319
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that he did anything illegal in the case.

223
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,479
No, I damn well hope not.

224
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,639
And no news about the leaked documents
from the Ministry of Justice?

225
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,719
No, Ussing claims he received
the information anonymously.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,879
But we're questioning Jens Lebech,
who's had both motive and opportunity.

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,639
For obvious reasons
I can't discuss that.

228
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,439
The priority is getting the girl back.
I assume you're doing all you can.

229
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,159
I promise you.

230
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,519
We're ready for the press conference.
Rosa Lebech wants a word with you.

231
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,559
Say I'll call afterwards, and tell her
not to worry about the alliance.

232
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,639
She's come all the way from Jutland,
so it's hardly just about the alliance.

233
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,639
Your estate agent has called about
some water damage in the old house.

234
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,039
- Would you deal with it?
- I already did.

235
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,879
What the hell is going on?

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,119
I had to go, but it's still too early
to pass judgment on the Justice Minister.

237
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,919
I'm not here to talk about him.

238
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,519
What are you and Special Branch
doing with Jens?

239
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,479
He was picked up at home
in front of the kids.

240
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,839
Sorry to hear that.
Special Branch have a suspicion.

241
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,399
Let's wait and hear what they say.

242
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,559
So, you knew they would pick him up
when we were on stage in Jutland?

243
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,039
I knew that they had a suspicion.
Confidential information's been leaked.

244
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,359
And you think it's him,
because he knows about us.

245
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,039
He's known for two weeks.
I didn't want to lie to him.

246
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,959
That doesn't give you the right
to suspect him of anything.

247
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,799
I do understand your concerns,
but if he's innocent, he'll be released.

248
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,719
I get into trouble all the time,
because everything is about you.

249
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,439
I have to defend you to my group,
and now to my family.

250
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,719
If your ex has leaked confidential files,
you have him to thank for this mess.

251
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,199
- He's innocent, so, have him released.
- I can't!

252
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,839
Can we meet later on today?

253
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,599
You can call my press officer.

254
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,839
The head of Special Branch
asked you to call.

255
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,559
I'll do it after the press conference.

256
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,959
According to the Justice Minister's diary
he had a meeting with a business group,

257
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,959
that included the public prosecutor,
while the old case was being solved.

258
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,759
What is Mogens saying?

259
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,559
He can't remember, but he says
he's never met the prosecutor.

260
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,359
It was the ring road. The campervan
passed here around 12.14.

261
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,519
- But he took exit 18.
- Shit. We just passed it.

262
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
- Then turn around.
- OK.

263
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,079
No, take the next exit.

264
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,319
That's where the camper came back
an hour later.

265
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,399
There's an industrial area
after exit 14.

266
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,879
We'll check it out.
I'll call you back.

267
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,199
- Eva Laursen has called several times.
- I don't know her.

268
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,079
She says she's your son's girlfriend.
She left a number.

269
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,879
The investigator has arrived.
Any news on that place, KPS?

270
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,999
No, not yet.
Any news from Borch?

271
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,919
No, he's just landed.

272
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,839
Why is he running around over there?

273
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,839
- It just doesn't seem justifiable.
- Let his wife worry about that.

274
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,639
I'd like to help, but I've already spoken
to your colleagues twice this afternoon.

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,599
Sorry, but do you remember if anybody
disagreed with the handling of the case?

276
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,399
- Who would have disagreed?
- Family, relations, boyfriends.

277
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,519
Not that I recall. The deceased
was in foster care and moved a lot.

278
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,919
There wasn't much to disagree with.

279
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,319
An autopsy report has turned up,
likely to be the original.

280
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,599
It suggests the girl
was the victim of a crime.

281
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,519
Some injuries seem to have happened
before she ended up in the harbour.

282
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,279
Can I have a look?

283
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,279
- You've never seen that report?
- No, I certainly haven't.

284
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,279
The coroner said, the public prosecutor
pressed her to write a false report.

285
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,959
Do you have any idea
what she meant by that?

286
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,279
- Pressed? What pressure?
- Was the case discontinued?

287
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,759
Were there any irregularities
in the investigation?

288
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,079
No, we did it by the book. The sailors
reported finding the girl in the harbour.

289
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,679
The autopsy report I received
said it was a suicide.

290
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,919
How did you find this?

291
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,479
The man who's taken Zeuthen's daughter
has killed several individuals,

292
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,839
who, like yourself,
are familiar with this case.

293
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,039
We can, of course, offer you protection,
if you feel threatened or vulnerable.

294
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,759
No, that's not necessary.

295
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,879
I'm going down the Police Association
to cheat at cards.

296
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,719
- I won't need much protection there.
- That sounds nice, but I insist.

297
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,039
It's not necessary.
I'm sorry I couldn't be any more help.

298
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,319
I think maybe you can.
Sit down.

299
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,599
Why are you in such a hurry to go abroad?
You booked a flight to Bangkok today,

300
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,359
leaving in a few hours.
Who are you afraid of?

301
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,799
- Do you know something?
- Is it illegal to travel?

302
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,279
Shortly after the case was closed,
you moved to Copenhagen. Why?

303
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,559
- Stress. Work related. I found a job...
- If you know something, then tell us.

304
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,119
Listen, I came here voluntarily!

305
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,799
Find a cell for our colleague here.
He knows his rights.

306
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,399
We have reason to suspect that
you're withholding important information.

307
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,239
The interrogation will begin soon.

308
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,119
I don't know anything.
What is this?

309
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,959
We've been through everything.

310
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,159
Maybe she's written something down.

311
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,119
Something that explains
how he got her to talk about those things.

312
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,319
The police have searched the place.
Maybe Emilie felt like talking to him.

313
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,919
She knows not to confide in strangers.

314
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,479
She knows to be careful
and tell her dad or me.

315
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,799
I checked if the firm had anything
on the old case, and I found a note.

316
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,799
The police contacted Personnel
to ask about the three sailors,

317
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,079
but their papers were in order.
That's all it says.

318
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,399
Who were the executives back then?

319
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,799
Could someone
have influenced the case?

320
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,479
I haven't looked into that.

321
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,919
Get a hold of the directors. I want to
make sure we're not hiding anything.

322
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,799
Hiding what?

323
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,999
Maja is looking for the smallest thing
that may bring Emilie back.

324
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,439
- Perhaps one ought to look elsewhere.
- The PM has held a press conference.

325
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,559
His people called but they're not giving
a satisfactory review of the situation.

326
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,039
What's happening?
Have you done something?

327
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,079
Has Zeeland?
Is that what this is all about?

328
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,839
- Borch.
- Hi, it's Lund.

329
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,719
Did you hear that we've
detained the investigator?

330
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,799
Yes. I was at the local police station
scanning reports. Did you get them?

331
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,879
I have them right here.
I'm convinced he knows something.

332
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,239
I'll grill him tomorrow morning.

333
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,519
What was that? Where are you?

334
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,719
The sheriff took me down to the harbour
to see where the body was found.

335
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,599
Could KPS be
a closed down company?

336
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,719
Yes, but we haven't found anything yet.

337
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,399
I have to go. I just want to say,
that I understand why you didn't shoot.

338
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,839
Oh. Yes. Good.

339
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,239
I probably didn't explain myself well.
I hope you don't...

340
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,559
That's all right
considering the circumstances.

341
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,039
Sarah? Hello?

342
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,199
Sarah?

343
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,119
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,039
Come, take a seat.

345
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,239
Breathe, take deep breaths,
all the way down to the stomach.

346
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,759
I've tried calling you.
You said we could just turn up.

347
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,519
- You told us where the extra key was.
- Where's Mark?

348
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,599
It's probably just me and the hormones
pumping through my body,

349
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,559
but I think he's having second thoughts.
We had a row.

350
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,359
I got upset and left,
and then I came here.

351
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,439
Does he know where you are?

352
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,839
I left a message,
but he hasn't called.

353
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,439
That doesn't mean
he's having second thoughts.

354
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,759
It gets to me, that the flat
hasn't been done up yet.

355
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,839
We have no money, and he keeps
coming up with things that aren't right.

356
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,319
I'm sure things will work out.
Mark has his apprenticeship.

357
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,839
No, he quit to drive a cab.

358
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,959
He doesn't earn much
even though he's working constantly.

359
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,039
I've said to him, we'll be all right,
but his mind wanders someplace else.

360
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,999
He only touches my stomach,
when I ask him to.

361
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,439
And we're not exactly acrobatic in bed,
as long as I've got this one.

362
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,759
So, it wasn't planned?

363
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,839
No, it wasn't.

364
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,519
Mark was so happy about it.

365
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,879
He said he wanted a real family more
than anything, because he never had one.

366
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,999
He didn't want to end up like you.

367
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,479
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

368
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,279
- That's all right.
- Would you like me to leave?

369
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,719
No, no.

370
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,759
- Hello.
- Are you OK?

371
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,759
Yes, I just had a visitor.
I have the papers in front of me.

372
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,479
There are several pages you should note
before talking to the investigator again.

373
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,559
- I've put crosses. I hope it's useful.
- OK, thanks. See you.

374
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,639
I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

375
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,039
You can sleep in my bed.
It's all right.

376
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,159
Thank you.

377
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,239
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12

378
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,799
We spent the night checking closed down
industrial areas and empty buildings.

379
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,799
- We haven't found anything yet.
- Did anyone see the campervan?

380
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,759
No. Maybe he misled us.

381
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,919
Maybe he knew
there were cameras on the ring road,

382
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,039
so, he sent us looking around exit 18.

383
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,879
I'll have someone search further out.

384
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,159
Also check towards the harbour.
Call me if you find something.

385
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,599
- Do you have the phone with you?
- Has the investigator said anything?

386
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,119
He's been here for ten hours
without saying anything of importance.

387
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,359
Lund, he's a colleague after all.

388
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,519
I'd like to have more on him
than a trip to Thailand, before we go in.

389
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,999
Good morning.
We're in a hurry,

390
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,079
so this is your last chance to answer.
After that, you'll be on your own.

391
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,479
You have nothing. Let me go
or put me before a judge.

392
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,239
You assumed that Louise Hjelby ran away
and drowned herself five days later.

393
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,439
During those five days nobody saw her,
and that didn't concern you?

394
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,039
- Have I understood that correctly?
- Yes, she wandered. She was a loner.

395
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,119
When forensics established that this
13-year-old girl was sexually active,

396
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,279
that didn't strike you as odd,
even though she'd never had a boyfriend?

397
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,999
Youngsters keep quiet
about those things

398
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,119
and by the way,
can we trust the coroner?

399
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,479
You readily concluded that the girl
weighed herself down in the water

400
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,279
with this concrete block, which she,
at 46 kilos, couldn't possibly have moved.

401
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,199
The block may already
have been on the pier.

402
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,479
You knew it was likely that the girl
was taken and sexually abused.

403
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,159
Then, while she was still alive, she was
tied to that and pushed in the harbour.

404
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,479
In a minute, I'll inform a judge
that you're covering up a murder.

405
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,399
Understood?

406
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,479
It could be your fault that we're dealing
with a kidnapping and several murders.

407
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,959
- Discuss that with the judge.
- I was just trying to do my job.

408
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,919
We suspected the three Zeeland sailors.
The ship had called at port.

409
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,119
The rest of the crew were discharged,
so they had the ship to themselves.

410
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,839
I didn't have anything solid on them,
so I waited for the autopsy.

411
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,039
Then the assistant public prosecutor came
with the report and called it a suicide.

412
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,799
- And you didn't object?
- Of course I did, but he pressured me.

413
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,079
- I had applied for the job as Chief.
- Did he explain the pressure?

414
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,959
Why would the sailors report finding her
in the harbour, if they'd killed her?

415
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,279
The rope on the concrete block
had become entangled in the screw.

416
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,399
- I assumed that to be the reason.
- But they didn't admit anything?

417
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,759
The mate said that all they wanted
was to help solve the case.

418
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,279
After speaking to the public prosecutor
they all clammed up and sailed on.

419
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,759
- Who knew about this apart from you?
- No one. I didn't speak about it.

420
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,759
And I got the job.
I broke down from stress.

421
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,479
Someone's found out.
Come on, you know something.

422
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,919
About a month after the case was closed,
a man turned up.

423
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,119
He didn't believe it was a suicide.
He wanted us to reopen the case.

424
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,199
What man?

425
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,839
In his 40s, Danish. I thought he
was family, but she didn't have any.

426
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,719
He left without telling me
who he was.

427
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,999
- And he only showed up a month later?
- Yes.

428
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,999
He was working on an oil rig.

429
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,279
Probably for Zeeland
who have lots over there.

430
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,719
- Lund, you have a visitor.
- Contact Zeeland.

431
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,679
Get photos of all the men who've worked
on their rigs in the North Sea,

432
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,999
around the time of the case.

433
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,839
Focus on men between 30 and 50.

434
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,359
What will happen to me now?

435
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,319
It was the public prosecutor
who gave the order.

436
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,959
- What the hell was I supposed to do?
- You should have said no.

437
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,079
Did you speak to Eva?
She slept at mine last night.

438
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,359
She's afraid that you have doubts
about the whole thing.

439
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,239
I told her to calm down,
and said that she could trust you.

440
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,639
- If it's about money, you can always...
- What if I do have my doubts?

441
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,159
It's probably quite natural
to feel a little confused.

442
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,959
But I'm not confused.

443
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,199
You must have had plenty of regrets,
when you were expecting me.

444
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,599
I thought if I just endured your mess
in my life, I could play happy families,

445
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,959
but what if
I'm just as fucked up as you?

446
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,759
I don't see how we could do
much better than you and dad.

447
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,039
So, what's the point in pretending?

448
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,199
- I have to take this call.
- All right, I'm leaving.

449
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,039
- No, Mark...
- I don't know why I bother with you?

450
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,519
Mark!

451
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,959
Lund speaking.

452
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,279
It's a shame you got a hold
of the investigator.

453
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,079
I had a big surprise for him
at the airport.

454
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,519
If he's guilty, he'll be punished,

455
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,079
and I can help you with that,
if you give yourself up.

456
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,239
I don't have much faith in the courts.

457
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,719
- But perhaps you've solved the case.
- I need more time.

458
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,319
How did you know
the girl and how did you find out?

459
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,439
I can't give you more time,
but I'd like to hear your story.

460
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,959
We're aware that an error
was made back then.

461
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,079
An error?
Did you really say that?

462
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,839
Can you call it an error
if a whole society fails when it matters?

463
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,679
Are you also the kind who complies,
when you see gold that glitters,

464
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,799
now that the crisis bites,
and the kingdom needs money?

465
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,519
What's Zeuthen offering this time?

466
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,439
Does he still think he's rich enough
to get his life back?

467
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,879
Are we talking 200 million?
500 million?

468
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,519
He's asked me to tell you
that he'll pay anything.

469
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,719
- There's no ceiling.
- Then he hasn't learned a thing.

470
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,479
I have a suggestion.

471
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,799
Special Branch say that Mogens didn't
speak to the prosecutor at that meeting.

472
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,959
- Are they sure about that?
- He made his presentation and left.

473
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,159
But the public prosecutor visited
the Ministry of Justice shortly after.

474
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,719
The public prosecutors were invited
for canapés and some legal information.

475
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,439
- Did Mogens speak to him?
- He couldn't remember.

476
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,079
- But they're looking into that now.
- Does that man remember anything?

477
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,359
No, I don't think so.
Neither do the newspapers.

478
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,399
The press conference didn't help.
Everyone doubts Mogens.

479
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,159
And Ussing claims that we've failed
and misinformed Zeuthen.

480
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,719
Try to set up a meeting with Zeuthen,
so I can explain the situation in person.

481
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,359
- Stop here.
- Why are we stopping?

482
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,719
It's about the water damage. I've made
an appointment. It'll only take a minute.

483
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,719
Why are you in here?

484
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,679
He didn't think that
this room was big enough.

485
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,559
We talked about him having
the big room down in the basement

486
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,879
with a separate entrance.

487
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,799
He spoke well for himself,
and the agreement was,

488
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,639
that we would move his things down,
as soon as my holiday started.

489
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,319
- Kristian?
- Yes?

490
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,599
I spoke to Zeuthen's
personal assistant.

491
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,919
You're welcome
in the holy halls later.

492
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,919
Any news on the girl?

493
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,159
No.

494
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,319
There's news from the perpetrator
and... it doesn't sound good.

495
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,319
What's Zeuthen offering this time?

496
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,079
Does he still think he's rich enough
to get his life back?

497
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,799
Are we talking 200 million?
500 million?

498
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,799
He's asked me to tell you,
that he'll pay anything.

499
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,159
There's no ceiling.

500
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,919
Then he hasn't learned a thing.

501
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,759
I have a suggestion.

502
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,719
If Zeuthen will pay anything,
then by all means let him.

503
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,039
He had nothing to do with the old case.
Give me more time.

504
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,839
A life for a life.

505
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,999
Don't you think that's reasonable?

506
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,839
I'll get Zeuthen,
and you'll get the girl.

507
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,599
If he loves his daughter enough,
then he will save her.

508
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,039
No one can agree to that.
You must know that.

509
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,799
I'll call back in four hours.

510
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,239
Have a car ready,
you and Robert Zeuthen.

511
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,599
It's a preposterous demand.
One that we can't comply with.

512
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,559
But we need to ask
if you still don't have any idea

513
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,239
what this is all about?

514
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,999
Anything?

515
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,039
Anything that may help us
catch him and find your daughter?

516
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,119
Don't you have the slightest idea,
who may be so resentful towards you?

517
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,959
Someone you've met,
or someone you didn't know?

518
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,719
No.

519
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,079
- Can't you trace the call?
- No, regrettably.

520
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,879
We'll give you a bodyguard
for the rest of the day.

521
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,159
We've been asked to provide photos
of our employees in the oil division.

522
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,119
- For what reason?
- A possible lead, and it's urgent.

523
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,279
- A former Zeeland employee?
- I'm on my way.

524
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,879
Asbjørn thinks he's found the place.

525
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,839
I would ask you
not to do anything this time.

526
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,759
We'll be in touch.

527
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,839
Let Maja know right away.

528
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,319
She's asked to go to the house
to pick up some things for Carl.

529
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,799
- Tell her that I'll come there.
- But we have a meeting with the PM.

530
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,879
I'll take care of it.

531
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,879
Special Branch have just released
Jens Lebech,

532
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,439
but he's still a suspect.

533
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,279
- Any news on the girl?
- Not since the last time you asked.

534
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,599
Robert Zeuthen is ready now.
I do apologise for the wait.

535
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,559
Let me take it.

536
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,479
- I'll step outside for a bit.
- My brother knows what he is doing.

537
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,239
If Mogens is involved in something,
then we have to know about it.

538
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,719
Yes, it's Stoffer.
That sounds good.

539
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,559
Do tell.

540
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,319
It's a difficult situation,
so I'll be brief.

541
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,559
I assure you, that the government and I
are doing everything in our power

542
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,839
to get your daughter back home.

543
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,239
The opposition have spread
a rumour to the contrary.

544
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,959
And I regret the kidnapping becoming
a part of the election campaign.

545
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,959
Personally, I think it's indecent.

546
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,999
I assure you that I and the government
support you and your family.

547
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,879
So, there's no truth
to what they're saying in the press?

548
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,119
No, any uncertainty or doubt
about the handling of the case,

549
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,279
will be cleared up.
That's my responsibility.

550
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,439
The police have informed me that
they know where your daughter is,

551
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,239
and that hopefully
she'll be back home soon.

552
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,959
Yes, I hope so.

553
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,079
Excuse me.
The police called.

554
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,159
They have searched the place
but unfortunately they didn't find her.

555
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,919
They will continue searching the area.

556
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,999
You'll have to excuse me.
Thank you for coming.

557
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,999
Good news.

558
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,159
Mogens wasn't at the Ministry,
when the public prosecutor dropped by.

559
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,519
He was called to Strasbourg that morning.
Now we've done our checking.

560
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,879
Special Branch haven't found
anything on Mogens either,

561
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,159
so it's reliable.

562
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,119
She must be here somewhere.

563
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,999
Maybe she saw the graffiti
driving past somewhere else.

564
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,839
KPS must mean something.
It's the last thing she wrote.

565
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,959
Yes.

566
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,159
Roger that.

567
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,679
How the hell could that happen?

568
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,759
We need to search the whole area.
She may still be close.

569
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,159
Find an officer
to stand in for Zeuthen.

570
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,039
Then we're covered
if we don't find her.

571
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,319
Did the investigator have a look
at the photos of Zeeland employees?

572
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,319
They were all sent to his cell.

573
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,919
But it didn't help much.

574
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,959
PM Kamper and opposition leader Ussing
locked horns in an election debate

575
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,919
where the PM answered the opposition's
criticism of the government,

576
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,159
and in particular of Mogens Rank.

577
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,639
Your smear campaign was based on lies,
and you haven't given us the source.

578
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,679
The Justice Minister knew about a case
that could have prevented a kidnapping.

579
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,759
There were
no discrepancies in that case.

580
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,599
I have confidence
in my Justice Minister.

581
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,839
Now, perhaps we should
start talking politics?

582
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,119
That's perfect. Good.

583
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,359
They want you on the news.

584
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,519
All the papers want a comment.

585
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,399
No tour in Jutland
would get this much coverage.

586
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,519
Did they find the girl?

587
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,759
It wasn't Special Branch.
I'll call on the road.

588
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,959
The Treasurer says all is calm
in the group. Everyone's happy.

589
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,519
Kristian?

590
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,679
I want to say that I'm sorry about all
the unnecessary trouble this has caused.

591
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,719
But you've handled the whole chain
of events fantastically well.

592
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,239
I'm sure that it will be reflected,
when it comes to counting votes.

593
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,319
I'm aware that things need
to be tightened up at my Ministry.

594
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,719
I've already taken such steps.
Well, I'll hurry back then,

595
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,439
and keep an eye on the situation,

596
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,399
so this whole thing gets the best
possible outcome... for everyone.

597
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,039
Mogens, one minute.

598
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,559
Regardless of what I just said on TV,
it doesn't excuse your forgetfulness.

599
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,319
People have been killed, a girl has been
taken, and you have done nothing useful.

600
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,919
You will be sidelined in this case,

601
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,079
and you do nothing without my consent.

602
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,199
And should we win the election,
don't expect any phone call.

603
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,319
Any questions?

604
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,799
Good.

605
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,559
- You can't sack him now. Are you crazy?
- We just got this under control.

606
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,959
If the girl isn't found, you've just
made sure that we'll foot the bill.

607
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,839
Do you know what that means?

608
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,159
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do you?

609
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,919
If you disagree, you can join Mogens
on the sidelines until after the election.

610
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,839
But I'd like an update from Special Branch
and the police right now.

611
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,199
- Yes.
- It's Jens Lebech.

612
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,359
As you know,
we have a lot in common.

613
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,359
We should meet
as soon as possible.

614
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,559
If you really are Jens Lebech,
there's no need to talk.

615
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,399
You've been telling Rosa,
that I'm to blame for all this,

616
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,599
but it doesn't hold water.

617
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,439
- How did you get this number?
- What's happening?

618
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:41,359
Regarding the old case, it's all about
who intervened, and even more so, why.

619
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,799
I'm going to hang up now.

620
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,959
No one would believe,
not even the Prime Minister,

621
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,959
that it was because a bunch of regular
sailors were involved, or would he?

622
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,519
Let's hope the Zeuthen girl survives.
You have my number.

623
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,079
OK.
Thank you.

624
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,079
- What did they say?
- They'll set the other thing in motion.

625
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,959
But they're still looking
and believe that they will find her.

626
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,079
I'm sorry that Carsten accused you.

627
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,759
I should have kept my mouth shut.

628
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,959
I know that you'd never do anything
to hurt our children.

629
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,519
I can't find the car.

630
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,919
It's my safari car. Maybe Emilie
took it with her on holiday.

631
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,359
Did you play with it in the garden?
You and Mum can go look for it.

632
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,199
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Come on, Carl, let's find it.

633
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,119
I'm pretty sure the maid brought
everything in from the garden.

634
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,159
Did you get a response from the firm
about the old police case?

635
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,399
I've requested it, but there are always
a few people who don't bother responding.

636
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,199
- Thank you.
- What do you have in mind?

637
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,159
Don't worry, we'll find the car.
Ask Dad.

638
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,319
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

639
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,399
What's Robert doing?

640
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,799
What about asbjørn, any news?
You found the place, right?

641
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,519
We're still searching. We may have
a photo of the perpetrator.

642
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,839
- There's not enough time to confirm it.
- OK, I'll be landing soon.

643
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:42,119
Try buying us more time when he calls.
He'd see straight through a stand-in...

644
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,879
I need to go.

645
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,799
He'd soon know that it isn't me.
And he said, this is our last chance.

646
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,039
We have an operational plan
and more people looking for her.

647
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,919
If I come along,
you'll be more likely to catch him.

648
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,559
Yes, OK.

649
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,399
Management refers me
to the Commissioner,

650
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,879
and he's vanished into thin air.

651
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,919
If they won't make a decision,
we'll have to do it.

652
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,799
I don't want Zeuthen
anywhere near the perp.

653
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,919
We haven't heard from Asbjørn.

654
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,799
If he asks to speak to Zeuthen
on this phone, what do I do then?

655
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,039
His instructions are clear, and we have
to follow them. We'll protect Zeuthen.

656
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,039
We can't find her.
Have you found out anything else?

657
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,439
Then go back to exit 18
and start over.

658
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,679
Prepare Zeuthen.

659
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,719
Are you coming or what?

660
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,719
Juncker, we need to go.

661
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,879
Hi, it's Mark, leave a message.

662
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,079
The car's ready.

663
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,839
- Yes, we're ready.
- Good, then let's get started.

664
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,479
You'll take the motorway south.
I'll call you back shortly.

665
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,639
And, Lund...
remember, this is our last chance.

665
00:57:13,305 --> 00:58:13,432

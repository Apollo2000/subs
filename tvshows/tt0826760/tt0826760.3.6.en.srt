OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN

3
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:33,812
Tell local police to start looking for the car,
and have personnel ready for when we arrived.

4
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:38,982
We suspect the perpetrator is either on his
way over there, if he isn't there already.

5
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:42,867
And have Brix call me
as soon as the meeting is over.

6
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:01,523
Are we there yet?

7
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,596
We just crossed the bridge.

8
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:12,140
Someone stole a red van from Copenhagen
harbor near where they found the boat.

9
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:17,718
As long as they haven't found
her she could still be alive.

10
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,242
How do you know Borch?

11
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:22,827
The academy.

12
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,599
He was a year below me.

13
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,599
Was he your boyfriend?

14
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,500
What's up?

15
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:35,086
Someone stole a red van
from the harbor.

16
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,585
Same area where they found
the perpetrators boat.

17
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:42,209
Tell me about the city.

18
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:48,850
Closed industrial harbor, was Zeelands
until they pulled the plug a few years ago.

19
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,018
A few thousand
residents at the most.

20
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,018
Their boast is that they are the
western most city.

21
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,741
- What time is it, why didn't you wake me?
- Can I have those crisps?

22
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,157
I thought you
could use the sleep.

23
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,628
Last time I fell asleep
with you at the wheel,...

24
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,434
...I woke up with back pains at some
picnic area in Norway.

25
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:11,757
- The road signs in Norway are really bad.
- I think you took a wrong turn.

26
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,637
- And your back pains weren't from sleeping.
- Yes it was.

27
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,859
No it wasn't.

28
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:21,601
Ok, what were
you doing in Norway?

29
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,566
I'll just phone
home and say goodnight.

30
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,027
- Where is everybody?
- We want to help...

31
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:01,907
We spoke to Copenhagen, who can't
confirm any kind of large scale search.

32
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,389
Hi Hans Erik

33
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,653
Nice to see you again. We are searching
for a criminal and after Emilie Zeuthen.

34
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,598
We need to start
at once.

35
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:16,532
Copenhagen believes she was killed
and the guy escaped the country.

36
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,204
- Look, it's a red van, license number...
- We haven't see anything.

37
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,030
As you can see traffic is fairly
manageable out here.

38
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,223
Presumably he wants to learn
about the dead girl in the harbor.

39
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,844
You can wait at the guest
house until we get orders.

40
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,392
Look, Copenhagen will
fall into place.

41
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:36,581
I just need you to
call everybody in.

42
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:40,631
- And why doesn't Copenhagen agree?
- I don't know, I'll fix it.

43
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:47,268
I have been opposing the stupid cutbacks
management have tried to impose.

44
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,306
And here is their chance to get rid
of me, and you know that very well.

45
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,547
- This is totally ridiculous.
- I am not part of management.

46
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,233
- I'm doing my job.
- As am I.

47
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:02,096
Some of the districts in west Jutland really
need to speak to you, and Mathias Borch...

48
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:05,213
Excuse me...
Brix is not available now.

49
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:12,929
Unfortunately your handling of the kidnapping
seems to have been misjudged.

50
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,062
I did the obvious.

51
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,340
It was your responsibility. And the
girl was killed. I suggest you resign.

52
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,771
I need a couple of minutes.

53
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:28,136
Sarah Lund, AsbjÃ¸rn Juncker and Mathias Borch
just popped up in Jutland.

54
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,390
- They are rounding up a lot of personnel.
- What for?

55
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,774
Apparently they now think the girl
might not be dead after all.

56
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,631
And that the kidnapper
is running around in Jutland.

57
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:41,182
The impression I've formed of this
department is very interesting.

58
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:46,136
I apologize.  I'll get
this case closed down.

59
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,741
Emilie Zeuthen's mother
wants to talk to you.

60
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:53,716
The ships who left the harbor last night,
any of them report anything suspicious?

61
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,458
- We haven't heard anything yet.
- It's Lund?

62
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,723
Talk to me Lund.

63
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:01,235
We think he spared her life and
hid her on the boat.

64
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:04,395
He then proceeded to here
in a stolen van.

65
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,893
Why spare her?

66
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:12,043
Because he learned that Zeeland probably
wasn't involved in the murder of the other girl.

67
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:14,841
But you have no proof?

68
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,324
Brix, she might be alive...

69
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:23,234
He isn't done until he is absolutely
certain of what happened then.

70
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:27,233
- We need more people now.
- Tell Lund to stop and come back now.

71
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,030
Brix?

72
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,514
- Lennart...
- Stay on it.

73
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:38,234
I'll let the other precincts
know they should help you.

74
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:41,027
- Well, I'll have to do it then.
- Ruth...

75
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,340
I don't have time for this nonsense
if there is a chance the girl is still...

76
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,940
I would really really like to
finish my job.

77
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,699
Your cooperation would improve
my evaluation.

78
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,304
I should cooperate why?

79
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,475
Nobody else in the building
gives a crap about cooperating.

80
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,256
Everybody are so busy
covering their asses.

81
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:03,904
But what do you plan on telling justice if
we didn't follow through on the investigation?

82
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,151
- Lets finish this shall we?
- We'll postpone the investigation 24 hours.

83
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,461
Just to make sure
we don't...

84
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:20,268
Put the boxes down. And check what
we learned at the harbor.

85
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,786
What should I tell the mother?

86
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,736
I'm sorry you had to wait.

87
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:31,687
I hope you have been told the
divers are doing their utmost...

88
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,804
...and you'll be told
once there is news.

89
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,598
What's taking
them so long?

90
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,067
We have found the concrete block which
may have weighted her down.

91
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:46,597
A rope was tied to the block, but the duffel
bag which was attached had torn lose.

92
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:52,063
- But you started looking at once?
- Yes, if she's there will find her soon.

93
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,364
Feel free to call me.

94
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,823
- This is my private number.
- Why are you saying if?

95
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:03,590
Why?

96
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,535
You said 'if' she is there?

97
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,248
Which is what we assume...

98
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:16,519
Our attention has been drawn to certain
occurrences which need further clarification.

99
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,361
But you aren't certain?

100
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,346
Yes...

101
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,334
It seems most likely.

102
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,330
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:30,723
But he sailed the boat to Copenhagen,
couldn't she have been on board?

104
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,262
I really don't know any more.

105
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,192
We will let you know...

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,301
We'll start with
the summer house area.

107
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,418
The rest will have to join us
when they hear from Copenhagen.

108
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,243
Did they find her here?

109
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:01,332
Yes. The ship with the Zeeland sailors
was over there.

110
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:05,124
- We have to go.
- If you wanted to fake suicide...

111
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:05,954
Yes?

112
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:10,297
You could just drive out here
and throw her in.

113
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,637
Sarah, you need to focus on why
we went all the way out here.

114
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:14,588
Come on.

115
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,455
If the foster family are correct...

116
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:21,260
...Louise Hjelby went missing one day
earlier than what's in the report.

117
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:25,022
If the deputy attorney general
had the date changed, ...

118
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:28,779
...then something important must
have happened on that day.

119
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,438
We've gotten the local radio
to mention the stolen van.

120
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:36,312
And I got the taxi company to ask
their drivers to keep an eye out.

121
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:39,484
We have to search a diameter
of 10 kilometers.

122
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:43,327
I'll start here.
You and AsbjÃ¸rn can start here.

123
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,848
I'll just talk to the
foster family first.

124
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,020
- Why, wait, what?
- I'll be quick.

125
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,814
We have 20 people
here... Sarah...

126
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,562
<i>Will the PM resign?
Rumors are rife.</i>

127
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:00,798
<i>The Emilie Zeuthen kidnapping
ended in tragedy last night.</i>

128
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:06,282
<i>The government and the PM have been met with
heavy criticism, especially from the opposition.</i>

129
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:10,332
We have to stand united
so we can have that regime change.

130
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,333
My voters need
something as well.

131
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:17,176
You have supported a government with skeletons
in the cupboard, leading to a girls death.

132
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:20,847
Excuse the interruption.
The prime minster wants to speak to you.

133
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:25,039
Well, that will have to wait.
Tell him I'll be over later.

134
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,748
Now Ussing.

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,692
I have no comments at
this point. Goodbye.

136
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:53,438
Ussing, you and I may not
have a lot in common.

137
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,864
But I assume both of us want
to finish this in a dignified way?

138
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,814
Oh yes, most assuredly.

139
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,956
So I think you should
get it over with.

140
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:05,800
Why didn't you tell anybody you had a
meeting with that deputy attorney general?

141
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:11,120
The same deputy you claimed was pressured
by my minster to change an old report.

142
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:15,420
- Says who?
- What were you talking about?

143
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,764
Is this on the record? If you suspect
something I think you should call SIS.

144
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:23,503
Oh, I intend to.

145
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:27,024
You had a meeting with him
on the exact same day two years ago.

146
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:30,282
You are not accusing me of putting the
pressure on the deputy attorney general?

147
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,834
Where were you talking about?
I just want to know.

148
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:37,573
I don't owe you an explanation. It was private.
If it was relevant I would have mentioned it.

149
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,628
Kamper, I think your behavior is very
human, and completely understandable.

150
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:46,160
Getting desperate just before closing time.
But this is beneath you.

151
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:51,364
Now I would like to continue
my meeting with Rosa Lebech.

152
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,249
Said it was private.
Not related to the old case.

153
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,610
Private? Right after the minister of justice
had had a meeting?

154
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,937
Karen look...
that meeting doesn't prove anything.

155
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,249
Why would Ussing
be involved?

156
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,315
I don't know, but if it had been a private
meeting he would have said so a lot earlier.

157
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:15,230
- It doesn't change anything Karen.
- Sure it is. It was during the investigation.

158
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,316
I said I won't fight
over Emilie Zeuthen tomb.

159
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,991
You may not have to.

160
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,368
The police haven't found her yet
even though they searched for 24 hours.

161
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:28,422
- And?
- Some of the police people went to Jutland.

162
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:31,418
The believe the kidnapper may
not be done with the old case,

163
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,121
And may have Emilie Zeuthen
with him.

164
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,952
They can't rule out that she
may still be alive.

165
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>During that last few days we have
been witness to a terrible kidnapping.</i>

166
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,471
<i>With terrible consequences
for the Zeuthen family.</i>

167
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:50,787
<i>Naturally I can not
go into details,</i>

168
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,110
<i>However it is obvious that the ministry of
justice and myself, </i>

169
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:58,091
<i>have been the target of massive criticism.
We will answer that, naturally.</i>

170
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,111
<i>However, there are several questions which
have yet to be answered. </i>

171
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,869
<i>I feel it's my duty to clean house,
and bring clarity.</i>

172
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,214
<i>The Zeuthen family
deserver that.</i>

173
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,422
<i>What unanswered questions?</i>

174
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,021
<i>There were rumors you
were going to resign?</i>

175
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:17,453
<i>We need to examine
everything exhaustively</i>

176
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:22,170
<i>I have asked the party leaders to join me
tomorrow for a meeting.</i>

177
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:25,979
<i>And I'd like to call on all to keep
the election campaign dignified.</i>

178
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,635
- Has anyone contacted you this evening?
- No.

179
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,533
Have you noticed a red van? Or seen
anything unusual?

180
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,520
Who are you looking for?

181
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,842
We are looking for someone who may
have known Louise very well.

182
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,070
We were all she had.

183
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,364
Nobody else.

184
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,256
We already told
your colleagues that.

185
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,242
There she is.

186
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,208
How did you become foster
family for Louise?

187
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,450
Louise lived alone with her mother.
In Copenhagen.

188
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,449
Until the mother died
from cancer.

189
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,585
Then she was placed
in an orphanage.

190
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,984
But then the crisis struck,
the orphanage was closed.

191
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:30,172
She was moved around,
different families in family care.

192
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,827
She couldn't really settle down.
That's why she was moved around.

193
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,637
But then... about three years ago...

194
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,344
She came to
stay with us.

195
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:54,585
She had no other relatives?
I understood the father wasn't known?

196
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:59,311
The mother had told her
he was a sailor.

197
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:03,920
...On the seven seas.
Like Pippi Longstocking's father.

198
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,316
Did she say more than that?
A name perhaps?

199
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,439
No...

200
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,237
And it sounded like a fairytale.

201
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:15,920
Louise was hoping that one day
he would come and get her.

202
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:18,765
But of course he didn't.

203
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,450
We tried to do what we could.

204
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:25,602
For her...

205
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,484
She seemed happy.

206
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:32,083
We thought we had succeed.

207
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,057
Until...

208
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,599
Well...

209
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,163
Until they found her.

210
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,533
I'm sorry to reopen old wounds,
but Louise didn't kill herself.

211
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,751
She was killed.

212
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,037
How?

213
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,728
That's what we
are trying to determine.

214
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:06,192
If you kept her things, I
would like to see them.

215
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:15,175
She rode her bike
to school as always.

216
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:20,281
We expected her home
in early afternoon.

217
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:25,447
She always took the same route.

218
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,209
Past the harbor, following the water,
past the pier.

219
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,570
And you are sure it was
Thursday, not the next day?

220
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,020
It's not the kind
of day you forget.

221
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,071
No... of course you don't.

222
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:42,604
Who was the last person
to see her that day?

223
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:45,879
Her class teacher.

224
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,066
She saw her with her bike,
heading towards the harbor.

225
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,189
- And nobody else?
- No.

226
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,338
Oh yes.

227
00:17:54,871 --> 00:18:01,077
Somebody though they had seen her on the
highway, but the police said it wasn't her.

228
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,226
What about her bike?
Was that ever found?

229
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:13,069
I don't know. I don't think
we were ever told.

230
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,391
Robert!

231
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:12,194
She always hated this picture.
She said it scared her.

232
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,119
- Robert!
- Help me damn it!

233
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,849
I didn't listen to her.
I was too busy to pay attention.

234
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,196
Damn it will you stop!

235
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:41,055
I  know this is unbearable, but you
must pull yourself together.

236
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:45,199
And it is my duty
to tell you that.

237
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,709
Have they found her?

238
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:49,746
No.... not yet.

239
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:53,941
Then we will do it.

240
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:56,571
Put together a crew and
send them up there.

241
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:01,067
The police don't want others to ruin
potential clues, you shouldn't interfere.

242
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:05,227
Did you hear from Maja, how
she wants the funeral?

243
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:09,259
I suggest we talk
about that tomorrow.

244
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,861
- I want it done with now.
- Yes, I can understand that.

245
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:16,901
But... Maja doesn't
want to talk about it.

246
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,866
I spoke to her earlier...

247
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,734
It feels like...

248
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:26,820
....she won't accept...
that Emilie is dead.

249
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,250
Yes, Carl is asleep.

250
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,365
Yes, see you soon.
So long.

251
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:40,742
My mother is coming soon,
then we can look for Emilie.

252
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:42,481
Where do you want to go?

253
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:46,252
We can take the coastal
road, down to the bridge.

254
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:51,331
It's dark outside, we'll
only be able to see the road.

255
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:53,739
She could be standing
by the road.

256
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,103
If he dropped her
of somewhere.

257
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,621
Oh, where are
there new batteries...

258
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,378
Hi.

259
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,610
You know the police haven't
changed their opinion.

260
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:21,770
Well, there is a chance she was on
the boat when it sailed away.

261
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,945
We don't really know
what happened.

262
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:27,891
Yes we do.

263
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:32,661
Because I was there, I saw it. He shot
her, and then threw her in the water.

264
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:36,684
It doesn't matter.
I don't feel it.

265
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:39,530
Is that what you think
we should tell Carl?

266
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:42,910
That she will be back and and all
will be as it was before?

267
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:44,979
Maja...

268
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,667
I need you to help
me with this...

269
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,959
Help me with the funeral,
help me with Carl...

270
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,856
Don't force me to believe
something which...

271
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,982
We are leaving as soon
as my mother gets here...

272
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,590
Where are you?

273
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:20,756
Almost finished searching the summer
houses, didn't find a damn thing.

274
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:23,661
I'll have some people search
the old bunkers.

275
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:25,535
Are the roadblocks in place?

276
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,638
Yes, if you are in a car you can't
get in or out of town.

277
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,212
What are you doing?

278
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:33,160
- Entering the school.
<i>- We've already checked it.</i>

279
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:37,931
Nevertheless, there is a teacher I want to
speak to. The last one to see Louise alive.

280
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:41,498
- Her Husband says she's here.
- You want us to check those farms?

281
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:44,446
Ok, I'm taking the kid and
we'll go look at pigs.

282
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,627
<i>I assume you'll rejoin
us when you are done?</i>

283
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,993
<i>Sarah, are you
paying attention?</i>

284
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:54,546
<i>Sarah?</i>

285
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,773
I think he is here...

286
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:19,096
A door is left open,
a window broken...

287
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:20,756
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

288
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:25,131
Sarah?

289
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,297
- You ok?
- Yes.

290
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:46,154
Yes, yes, it was just me...
sorry about that,

291
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:48,931
But I think he has
been here.

292
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:54,587
What exactly does The Security
and Intelligence Service know?

293
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:58,464
We still assume Emilie Zeuthen
was killed last night, it's most likely.

294
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,747
- But you are not sure?
- We still need to find the body.

295
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,839
- Indications are she's dead.
- Now matter how small the chance,...

296
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,538
...you and the police are
doing all that you can?

297
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,366
Naturally, we've asked
the minister of justice...

298
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:15,140
He is on sick leave until further notice,
you don't need to involve him.

299
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:18,037
- Talk to the permanent secretary.
- I understand.

300
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:23,547
Then there is Ussing, I asked him what
the meeting was about, but he's not saying.

301
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:29,213
But because of the deputy attorney general's
involvement SIS should look into this, no?

302
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:32,729
Indeed, and we have
investigated their connection.

303
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:37,645
Ussing and the deputy attorney general are
both Copenhagen University law graduates.

304
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,107
And old friends.

305
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:48,657
Still, it's strange they both meet during
the investigation of the old case....

306
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:51,545
...on the day the minister
of justice has his meeting.

307
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:53,772
Yes... or it was a coincidence.

308
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:57,064
They saw each other
several times a year.

309
00:25:57,898 --> 00:26:00,769
The minister of finance
would like to speak to you.

310
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,897
I want you to get to
the bottom of this.

311
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:07,857
And if something happens regarding
Emilie Zeuthen, I want to know at once.

312
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:10,844
Weren't you going to do
what was best for the party?

313
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,553
The situation has changed.

314
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:16,702
But if there is no concrete evidence against
Ussing you are courting trouble.

315
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:19,947
- Lets just make sure, Birgit, right?
- Kristian...

316
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,086
It's unworthy of you.

317
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:26,894
- I thought your judgment better that his.
- Birgit we have a lot to get done.

318
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,929
- Also your phone wants you.
- I can not endorse this.

319
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,860
And everybody in the party
agrees with me.

320
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,795
By the way, who did you have
in mind as my successor?

321
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,138
Well, people have
urged me to run...

322
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,564
But that's not the point!
We have to save the party.

323
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:47,322
Which is what I'm trying to do.
With your full support I'm assuming.

324
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:51,109
Get a hold of the Center Party

325
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,449
I want talk to Rosa before
I meet the other leaders tomorrow.

326
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,396
And 'stoffer needs to get right of access to
all documents relating to Ussing.

327
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:01,104
- I can't get hold of him.
- You've let message?

328
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:03,742
Yes, many times, it's like
he has disappeared.

329
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:11,567
So you haven't been contacted by
strangers or seen any in the last 24 hours?

330
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,619
- No.
- What about the broken window in the door?

331
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,016
Must have been the wind
I suppose.

332
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,584
- I was the one who opened that door.
- Ok, that's all I have.

333
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:25,013
You saw Louise Hjelby on the day she
disappeared. Exactly what did you see?

334
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:29,911
I saw Louise wheel her bicycle
going in the direction of her home.

335
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,910
Do you know if others saw her
after school that day?

336
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:40,138
I think, someone from her class who
supposedly had seen her on the main road.

337
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:43,259
I would like to speak
to all the students tomorrow.

338
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:49,134
Ok, but one of your colleagues called an
hour ago asking about the same thing.

339
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:54,445
- What do you mean.. who was it?
- He said his name was...

340
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:56,292
Mathias Borch.

341
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,418
Mathias Borch?

342
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,210
Yes, he was very sweet
and polite.

343
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,193
Thanks Mikkel, thanks.

344
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:11,911
Same method as his earlier phone calls,
they can't determine where the call was made.

345
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,537
- Did you search everything?
- Yes

346
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:17,571
But we'll expand
the area.

347
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:24,277
He wanted something
at the school..

348
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,831
No. He wasn't there.

349
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,022
I'm sure he was.

350
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:32,898
We are both trying to
find out what happened then.

351
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:37,375
No. You are looking for Emilie Zeuthen
and you are looking for the perpetrator.

352
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:07,507
Do we have a problem?

353
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:10,163
She knows that.

354
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:13,589
I don't think that's a good idea.

355
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:15,560
I think that...

356
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:19,765
I'll call you back later.

357
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:24,491
Hey.

358
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,800
Who were you talking to?

359
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,401
Oh that's just HQ.

360
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:41,334
I think your room is a bit further
down the hall.

361
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,813
I think you should
tell me what you know.

362
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,976
About?

363
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:48,746
Why the perpetrator
suddenly uses your name?

364
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:53,627
- How the hell would I know?
- Why would he use your name?

365
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,504
Unless he knows you...

366
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:01,714
Was SIS involved?
Were you on the case then?

367
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:06,402
You were here the day before yesterday,
what did you do?

368
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,390
Gathered information.

369
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:10,370
For you.

370
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:13,176
I did not work the
case back then.

371
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,694
Perhaps he heard my
name on the walkie?

372
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,000
Perhaps he wanted us to have this
cool conversation. How would I know?

373
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,139
No, why..
why don't you believe me?

374
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:27,376
WHY don't you believe me?
Why don't you ever trust anyone?

375
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:29,485
Why have you
always been this way?

376
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,381
- What are you talking about.
-  You always shut down.

377
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:35,347
You shut it all out, me,
us back then, your son.

378
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:38,674
You let nobody into your life.
Nobody!

379
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:39,625
Sarah...

380
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,143
- Somebody wants to see you.
- Not now.

381
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,429
- I don't have time now...
- I just spoke to a local police officer.

382
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,069
A journalist called this morning, and wanted
access to documents from the old case.

383
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,432
And they referred him to Borch, because
Borch had just been over here.

384
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,480
But the newspaper hasn't had any of
their journalists call.

385
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,878
It could have been
the perpetrator.

386
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,531
- Hi..
- What's up?

387
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:47,978
Well, I just heard that..
... I was just told that...

388
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,844
So well, it was
just me, who...

389
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:54,994
...I misunderstood,
...it was my...

390
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:29,509
Monday - November 14

391
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:31,885
Day 6

392
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,612
- Hello
- It's Brix. Where are you?

393
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,108
I...erm...

394
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,639
There's been a break in at the local school,
and you aren't at the scene?

395
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:04,919
I'm on my way.

396
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,108
Bloody hell.

397
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:13,983
- Has SIS reported on Ussing?
- No not yet.

398
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,749
I've talked to some people who was
at law school with Ussing and the DAP.

399
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,421
But they could only confirm they were
good friends, playing squash etc.

400
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,761
But hardly on Christiansborg.
Any news on Emilie Zeuthen?

401
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:26,629
No, they are still
searching.

402
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,744
But I spoke to Rosa Lebech, she'll be over
for a meeting before the others arrive.

403
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:34,277
But Kristian, it's important you get
Kristoffer back in the fold.

404
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,607
He needs to fire up his contacts if we are
to get more on Ussing before the meeting.

405
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,109
Right, see you later.

406
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,939
Emilie Zeuthen may still be alive.

407
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,417
We have proof Ussing met with the
deputy attorney general,...

408
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:54,348
...we just need to find out why,
in a hurry, ok?

409
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,483
If he is involved in the old case
we need to get that out in the open.

410
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:05,074
- 'stoffer are you listening to me?
- Yes.

411
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,021
I hear Ussing is getting away with
his dirty tricks.

412
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,401
And you are letting
him get away with it.

413
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:13,574
- I need your help.
- Yes.

414
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:18,753
You know everything about everybody, we
can't just let Ussing run away with it all.

415
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:22,321
But there is no "we", it's always you,
it's always been just about you.

416
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:26,147
Even when I'm clearly in the right, telling
you to focus on the election,

417
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:29,819
instead of that damn kidnapping.
That's why we have this problem now.

418
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,057
Frederik come over here will you.

419
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,459
Ok, you may have
a point.

420
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,114
I am right.
Can you hold that?

421
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:45,249
You went and slammed the door because I
wanted to resign. But I didn't resign.

422
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,832
And now I'm here,
asking for you to help me.

423
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,166
- I can take him to kindergarten.
- No. I'll do it.

424
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,133
Kristian is leaving now anyway.

425
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,216
Thank you for the offer.
But...

426
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:01,076
You got into this mess, and I can't help you.
I don't want to get dragged down as well.

427
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:03,989
- Bye bye uncle Kristian.
- Bye Frederik

428
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:16,196
- What happened?
- 'morning.

429
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,507
- Where the hell have you been?
- What?

430
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,853
- Where have you been?
- What happened?

431
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:23,560
The cleaners reported
a break in.

432
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:28,196
Nobody has seen anything....
we tried to call you at your room...

433
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:30,731
oh..well..
has Borch found anything?

434
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,849
Did you find anything Borch?

435
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,560
...well he's been through it all.

436
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:42,701
He stopped when he found
the material related to the girls class.

437
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,977
So it was him last night,
did he take anything?

438
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,232
We just need an overview first...

439
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:51,800
But as you can see a picture
of the class students is missing.

440
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,614
- We are waiting on a copy.
- You've got something here...

441
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:57,890
- ... toothpaste or something.
- Oh...

442
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,113
Hi honey.

443
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:06,615
Who is the girl
next to Louise?

444
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,477
That's Katja, Louises best friend.

445
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,479
I'd like to
speak to her.

446
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:17,922
I met him about 30 minutes ago, he said
he was from the police, just wanted to talk.

447
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,060
- Where did you meet?
- On KlitvÃ¦nget.

448
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:24,043
It's a small road outside of town,
leading down to the harbor.

449
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:25,540
- Should I...?
- Go.

450
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,628
What about her?
Have you seen her?

451
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:29,233
No, I only saw him.

452
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:31,859
What did he look like?

453
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,665
Ordinary type, bit shorter than you.
Dark hair.

454
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,271
What did he want?

455
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:40,510
He asked if I was the one who had seen
Louise on the day she disappeared.

456
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:41,789
And had you?

457
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:45,202
- You saw her?
- Yes, at the city boundary.

458
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:49,700
Up on the highway. I was on my
way to my riding lessons.

459
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:52,700
She was standing by the
road with her bicycle.

460
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:57,094
What was she doing there? It wasn't
her usual route home?

461
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:02,268
Her bicycle was broken, she was probably
on her way to the garage.

462
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:04,476
I assumed she got a lift.

463
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:06,408
A lift?

464
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:10,975
- Yes, there was a man with a black car.
- What man? Did you get a look at him?

465
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,990
No.. At first I thought it was someone
asking for directions.

466
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:19,802
But then he opened the trunk
and she put her bicycle in.

467
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:23,629
- They left before I got there.
- What kind of car was it?

468
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,807
It.. well.. it was black.

469
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:27,601
A black car?
What brand?

470
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,821
I don't know, an expensive one I think.
Not a local car.

471
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:34,699
- And you told this man the same?
- But do you remember anything more?

472
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:40,234
If we are to believe what you are telling us
you have to give us a credible account.

473
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:41,887
I don't know the brand!

474
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,319
I don't know....

475
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,906
Katja, do you remember where
they drove off? The direction?

476
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:51,683
I don't know...

477
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,236
I'm just making a call.

478
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,063
Louise would never kill herself.
And I told them that. I did!

479
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,876
You've been all over the
inlet a dozen times.

480
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:09,700
How long is
it going to take?

481
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:14,013
- The Navy and Air Force are assisting...
- Why the hell haven't you found her then!?

482
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:17,129
Emilie's mother has come to
believe she is still alive.

483
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,270
Yes...

484
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:20,478
I'm sorry about that.

485
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,870
And what about that
investigation in Jutland?

486
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:27,403
We have found nothing which suggests
your daughter is still alive.

487
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:32,870
- And not finding her isn't strange to you?
- No, it's not that unusual.

488
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,241
- Yes?
- It's Reinhardt.

489
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,653
I've made the church arrangements. And
the press will meet you later today.

490
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,674
You want me to try
and reach Maja again?

491
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,775
I'll do that.
Thank you.

492
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:53,121
If you don't find her today at the latest,
I will make sure it's done.

493
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,824
Hi it's me. I just wanted to let you know I'm 
going to see the priest, with or without you.

494
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:08,551
"Press 1 to listen again. Press 2..."

495
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,964
Why are you crying?

496
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,261
I will protect you.

497
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:33,859
I'll protect you.

498
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,086
Why are you sad?

499
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:59,661
Given the way it looked yesterday, I can
understand you talking to Ussing.

500
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:04,008
But right now I still need you
to support me for Prime Minster.

501
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:06,164
Why should I?

502
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:08,523
Well we had an
agreement for one.

503
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:10,184
Gave the voters
a promise.

504
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:13,115
Your minister of justice may
have been the cause of the kidnap

505
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:16,141
and murder of Emilie Zeuthen. And
you didn't keep me in the loop.

506
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:19,507
The investigation isn't over,
and right now Ussing is...

507
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,711
Yes I know, Ussing told me.

508
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:24,990
Aha.. and what
did he tell you?

509
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:29,751
He is shocked over your accusations,
that they are totally insane.

510
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,735
Why are we wasting
time on this?

511
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:35,316
- Karen we need a moment...
- We've debated God knows how many times.

512
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:38,131
And you always end
up believing Ussing.

513
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,266
Yes, because
it's not credible...

514
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:44,092
And you ex-husband has been
leaking documents all over the place.

515
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:47,161
- Karen, we'll deal with this.
- That hasn't been proven.

516
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,627
- No but it will..
- Thank you Karen!

517
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,197
I'll postpone my meeting with
the other party leaders.

518
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:57,680
Well really talk this
through, ok?

519
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:02,678
I have to follow Ussing.

520
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,300
I hope you understand.

521
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,459
Am I too early?

522
00:41:10,808 --> 00:41:12,478
We'll make do without her.

523
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:15,543
Perhaps not the brightest move
to involve her ex-husband.

524
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:19,300
She was never going to get of the pot,
we are wasting our time on her.

525
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:21,078
She doesn't trust you.

526
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,230
Karen.. that's enough. Ok?

527
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:29,316
By all means ignore me.

528
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,662
Where the hell have you been?

529
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:35,527
I don't have time for more
scolding at the moment.

530
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:38,884
Now, is one of those moments
where you should listen to me.

531
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:39,939
Why?

532
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,920
Because he's meeting one of
Ussings previous employees.

533
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,026
I'm not meeting anybody at all!

534
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:48,779
Hey, you wanna sit here all alone
and hug yourself, that's fine by me.

535
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,679
Ok, and you are going
through that?

536
00:41:57,513 --> 00:41:59,561
Thanks, see you Hans Erik.

537
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,203
They've been up and down the coast
and this main road. Nobody has seen him.

538
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:10,765
I just rechecked, no black car is
mentioned in Louise Hjelby's case file.

539
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:12,095
You got the map?

540
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:16,731
Perhaps the deputy attorney general asked
the investigator to disregard the testimony.

541
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:19,662
And because of that
they never found the driver.

542
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,111
Or the black car is
not important at all.

543
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:24,835
- Where did AsbjÃ¸rn go?
- Why wouldn't it be?

544
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:26,751
They covered it up.

545
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,923
Sarah, lets focus on the red van
right now. Deal?

546
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,043
You just keep going on ...

547
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:39,181
- Listen. If it's because of last night.
- No no.

548
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:42,198
You keep going on
about the old case.

549
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:45,263
Why then do we have to
argue over the black car?

550
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:47,023
It's not about last night!

551
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:53,436
- Open the door.
- The girl was found dead in the harbor.

552
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,972
A few days after
getting into a black car.

553
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:59,695
Right now the perpetrator is trying
to figure out where that car went.

554
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:02,282
- It should be obvious...
- Fine, fine Sarah!

555
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:06,263
- Look for your black car. Open the door.
- What the hell are you doing?

556
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,867
I'm just of the phone with a guy from a
nearby garage. We may have something.

557
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:14,609
- What garage?
- Somewhat further down the road.

558
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,109
- Follow me.
- We will.

559
00:43:17,372 --> 00:43:20,944
- We can't go anywhere...
- Would you open the door? I have the key.

560
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,574
You told me on the phone you kept
account of cars passing through?

561
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:30,870
Nope.

562
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,094
I said my son did.
You'd have to speak to him.

563
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,647
- He is the car nut.
- Where is your son now?

564
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,632
Be here in a moment.

565
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:43,597
But you think your son
knows about this?

566
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:47,006
- Take a look in the beauty.
- That one...?

567
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,059
Glove compartment...

568
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:54,757
It won't bite.

569
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:59,285
That's his "book keeping"

570
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,475
Loves car license numbers,
keep writing them down.

571
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:05,372
There he is, you can
ask him yourself.

572
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:06,491
Hey Jacob!

573
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,736
No, I'll do it.
You two check that out.

574
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:15,783
- Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:18,340
How long has he
been doing this?

576
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:23,389
For a long time. Look at the latest.
I guess that's what your colleague is doing.

577
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,093
What's important right now is if
you have seen a red van.

578
00:44:29,027 --> 00:44:31,834
- We are just chatting.
- Could it be this one?

579
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:34,993
- It's red?
- Yes.

580
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:38,290
- Where did you see it?
- At the summer houses, just a moment ago.

581
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,024
Thanks.
Lets go.

582
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,871
I want a closer look at your sons book,
someone will come and pick them up.

583
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,300
That was the policeman, dad.

584
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:54,491
What police man?

585
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:05,987
I was on Ussings staff. I was there the
day he met with that deputy attorney general.

586
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:08,109
I had to sign
some material.

587
00:45:10,115 --> 00:45:12,938
Could I ask why you no longer
work for Ussing?

588
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:19,485
Well... some money went missing... from the
campaign coffers, technically my responsibility.

589
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:22,903
It's not relevant,  just
listen to what he has to say.

590
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:26,402
- They were talking...
- Ussing had asked for the meeting, right?

591
00:45:26,403 --> 00:45:29,854
Yes, he had to rearrange
other meetings that day.

592
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:32,751
But I always wanted
to work for the PM.

593
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,250
But I guess there haven't been
a position available. So far.

594
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:40,786
- I have an MA in Political Science...
- Get back on track.

595
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,111
What, oh yes, of course.

596
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,333
It's not that I was listening, but they
asked me to wait just outside.

597
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:51,263
- So I couldn't avoid hearing them.
- What where they talking about?

598
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:54,663
Loud, lively, like the knew
each other really well.

599
00:45:54,736 --> 00:45:56,441
And specifically... ?

600
00:45:56,738 --> 00:46:01,111
Ussing wanted to talk about some case about
a girl who had died somewhere in Jutland.

601
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:07,438
The deputy attorney general was reluctant,
his confidentiality I guess.

602
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:10,627
- But Ussing insisted, strongly.
- Aha...

603
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:14,075
And why did he want
to talk about that case?

604
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:16,989
He wanted something
kept quiet.

605
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:24,400
Also, I should add I've worked i Brussels,
so I'm quite up to speed on EU matters.

606
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:27,142
What was it he
wanted kept quiet?

607
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:30,336
I think he knew the
girl personally.

608
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:34,369
Not that I know the details,
but he sounded upset.

609
00:46:35,027 --> 00:46:38,918
- As if he wanted something kept quiet.
- Did you hear anything else?

610
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:42,491
No, that's when
they closed the door.

611
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:46,748
I work as an independent consultant,
so I can start at a moments notice.

612
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:50,613
- Just call...
- Yes, thank you.

613
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:53,131
We don't have
any openings right now.

614
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:56,540
And SIS will want to speak
to you in a moment.

615
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,610
SIS? What the hell for?

616
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:03,349
Hey it's me. The minister of finance wants to
know if you have time for a meeting.

617
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,732
Hello Birgit, we just learned
something rather important.

618
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,905
Can it wait?
Walk with me.

619
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:15,093
There is a meeting of the party
committee in an hour.

620
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:18,368
- I didn't call a meeting?
- No, I did.

621
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,921
There is just one item on the agenda.

622
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:26,662
We will try to persuade you to
step down voluntarily...

623
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:30,764
And if that isn't possible we will
have to withdraw our support of you.

624
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:34,814
I'm really sorry, but you
leave us no alternative.

625
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,400
Nobody is above the party.

626
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:40,556
Not even you.

627
00:47:45,682 --> 00:47:47,559
It will be a quiet ceremony.

628
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,246
Only the family.

629
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,816
Have you given
thought to any psalms?

630
00:47:54,988 --> 00:47:56,473
That we should sing.

631
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,383
We sang one at her christening...
which was called...

632
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,208
Yes?

633
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,058
"LÃ¦r mig nattens stjerne"
(Teach me the star of night)

634
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,675
Yes, it is very beautiful.

635
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:22,832
As part of the ceremony I would
like to say a few words about Emilie.

636
00:48:23,977 --> 00:48:26,852
Is there something special you
want me to emphasize.

637
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:30,437
I'm also asking because I know
Emilie has a little brother.

638
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,882
I don't know
if he is coming?

639
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:38,934
But if he is, I would like to take that
into account. In my sermon.

640
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:45,747
We haven't yet decided.
If he is.

641
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:52,969
I would just like to say, that for some
children it can be a good way...

642
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:56,115
...for them to take their leave.

643
00:48:57,144 --> 00:49:00,967
And understand a little more
what death is all about.

644
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,451
It can be a very tangible
and beautiful experience.

645
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,639
- To put the flowers on the coffin.
- How can it be a beautiful...

646
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,450
.. how can it be a beautiful
experience?

647
00:49:13,905 --> 00:49:17,624
There is no...comfort.. which can
remove your pain.

648
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:22,229
You grieve because you have loved.

649
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:26,538
And you still love Emilie
even though she is not here.

650
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:30,002
That is also true for Carl,
who has lost his big sister.

651
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:32,714
And sorrow...

652
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:36,278
...one might say sorrow is
love dispossessed.

653
00:49:38,554 --> 00:49:39,776
And so it might,

654
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,773
be beneficial for him,

655
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:43,323
to see that you...

656
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:46,391
...stand together,  and try to..

657
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,204
Maja...

658
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,083
Why is the door locked?

659
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:08,136
- Maja, shouldn't we get this done...
- I want to get out!

660
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:12,173
Maja, it's time we
tell Carl...

661
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:15,862
No stop, I want to get out.
Let me out damn it!

662
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:37,017
We are at a summer house area, the
perpetrators car has been spotted.

663
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:40,482
- But we haven't found anything.
- Damn it Lund.

664
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,707
I'll call you later.

665
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,898
Brix.

666
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:54,569
If it's Ruth Hedeby tell
her I'm busy.

667
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:57,496
I just spoke to the salvage crew,
they found the girl.

668
00:50:57,497 --> 00:50:59,739
Or what was supposed
to be the girl.

669
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:10,859
He must be here somewhere.

670
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,166
What about AsbjÃ¸rn?
Has he checked in?

671
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:15,357
I haven't heard anything.

672
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,615
What about the map, could you
have overlooked something?

673
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,892
We've been through it all.

674
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:31,562
- Regarding last night...
- I know, it shouldn't have happened...

675
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:34,820
No it shouldn't...

676
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:44,612
Let me have the map.

677
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:50,027
- My problem is...
- You don't have to say anything.

678
00:51:50,028 --> 00:51:53,647
- It didn't mean anything.
- My problem is... I don't regret it.

679
00:51:58,958 --> 00:51:59,810
Sarah...

680
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,579
Where is that road leading?

681
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:23,130
And abandoned boat builder's yard,
but it has been checked.

682
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:26,061
After someone broke
the barrier?

683
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,745
He must have been here.

684
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:37,418
It looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.

685
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:05,256
Sarah...

686
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,848
This is where he took her...

687
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:24,143
Right... I'll look around.

688
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:38,427
- Yes?
- Hi, it's me.

689
00:55:38,428 --> 00:55:42,254
- I just got a call from the garage guy.
- AsbjÃ¸rn, we need some people...

690
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,424
Listen to me!

691
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:47,371
He said Borch had already collected one
of the boy's books in the morning.

692
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:51,129
- What book?
- One of the books with License plate numbers.

693
00:55:51,912 --> 00:55:56,871
And they claim it was Borch who interrogated
the boy when Louise Hjelby went missing.

694
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:58,661
Lund, do you hear me?

695
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:00,077
Lund?

696
00:56:03,412 --> 00:56:05,701
The red van is
out in the back.

697
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:09,790
Why is the boy's book important?

698
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:12,739
What?

699
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:18,566
It was you...

700
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,928
...and SIS who had information about
the black car removed.

701
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:27,149
- What are you talking about?
- Or you had deputy attorney general do it.

702
00:56:27,244 --> 00:56:30,773
You went over here a few days ago
to make sure it was all hidden.

703
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:34,393
- Oh will you shut up.
- Why did you take the book?

704
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:38,030
- I've had enough of this.
- Why is it important!?

705
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,066
Fine...

706
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:46,203
It's not what you think.

707
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:50,753
The boy had written license plate numbers
in his book when the girl disappeared.

708
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:54,265
One of them was special. We investigate,
and it was a false scent.

709
00:56:54,266 --> 00:56:57,132
- Who?
- We couldn't know who drove...

710
00:56:58,305 --> 00:57:58,859

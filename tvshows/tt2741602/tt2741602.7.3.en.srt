1
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,995
Remember, my friends,

2
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,839
the task at hand is not
an impossible one.

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,064
The Defiance is not rigged.

4
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,502
Mr. Paer has before him
every tool, schematic,

5
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:35,041
and safety precaution necessary
for him to save his own life.

6
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:39,378
Ladies and gentleman,
drink in the moment.

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,951
I want you to let the numbness
of life wash away...

8
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:48,821
even if only for tonight,
for this moment.

9
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,791
The love. The fear.

10
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:54,130
This is what it is to be alive.

11
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:58,998
This... is The Defiance.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,369
This is Les Fleurs du Mal.

13
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,840
I can't.

14
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,107
Please, you have to let me out of here.

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,142
I can't do this.

16
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,614
Are you listening to me?! Make it stop!

17
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,377
I can't!

18
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:39,638
Aah! I did it!

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,409
I did it! I beat the game!
I beat the game!

20
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,511
I did...

21
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,382
No. Wait, no!

22
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:21,027

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,424
Shoot.

24
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:32,958
Let me help with that.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,794
Oh, no, that's okay. I got it.

26
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,195
Nonsense. I insist.

27
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,329
No thanks. I got it.

28
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,332
Oh, do you want some coffee?

29
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,101
I was just going out for some.

30
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,855
Come on. I insist.

31
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,007
So happy we finally get a chance to chat.

32
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,209
Is Agnes at school?

33
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,012
Yeah, I just dropped her off,
and, uh, I was

34
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:55,681
on my way home and realized I didn't have

35
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:58,350
anything for dinner,
so I picked up a few things.

36
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,553
What do you do for work?

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,958
I'm a government employee.

38
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,737
What about you?

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,993
Me? Ha, I'm retired.

40
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,897
I moved here to be closer to my daughter.

41
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:16,535
We're estranged, but...
I'm hoping to get closer to her.

42
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:28,380
Agnes is in full-on princess mode.

43
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,583
What?

44
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,185
Oh! Right.

45
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:36,055
I know it's not very woke,
but she's irresistible.

46
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,190
No, fairy tales are very important.

47
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,492
They help children cope

48
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,994
with separation anxiety and loss.

49
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:44,897
Oh, and I love a fairytale.

50
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:48,767
Just not the part
where you got to get saved

51
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,436
by Prince Charming.

52
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,775
Um... that's work.

53
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,044
I'm so sorry. I got to go.

54
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,048
Have you seen my keys?

55
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,684
I could've sworn
I just put them right here.

56
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,820
Oh! Here.

57
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:09,722
I must have knocked them off the table.

58
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:14,293
Uh, keep the mug. Bring it back later.

59
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,694
I'm really sorry about this.

60
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:18,931
Don't be. I got what I came for.

61
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,336
"To creep softly like a coward

62
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,739
toward the treasures of your body,

63
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:31,377
to whip your joyous flesh
and bruise your pardoned breast,

64
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:38,617
to make in your astonished flank
a wide and gaping wound."

65
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,920
As a general rule,

66
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:43,889
I believe the sword is mightier
than the pen.

67
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,792
But in the hands of a free-spirited,

68
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:49,425
syphilis-ridden French dandy,

69
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,498
I'd say the odds shift considerably.

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,099
How's my grandfather?

71
00:04:57,605 --> 00:05:00,005
We saw him this morning.

72
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:04,621
He's still... critical.

73
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,714
And the woman who tried to kill him?

74
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:11,016
You know Baudelaire was prosecuted

75
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,522
for offenses against public morality?

76
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:14,835
The woman.

77
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:16,922
His words were so provocative

78
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:22,228
that six of his poems were
banned for nearly a century.

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,963
You said you had a lead.

80
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,798
I do. A secret society

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,434
named after Baudelaire's
"Les Fleurs du Mal."

82
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:29,868
Poetry lovers?

83
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,537
Thrill seekers.

84
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,709
People who go to extreme lengths
to offend public morality.

85
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,678
A society of decadent misanthropes.

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,515
People who have everything,
so nothing is special.

87
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,619
And this connects to the woman
who abducted you in Paris?

88
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,254
It does.

89
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:51,190
According to Reddington,
Les Fleurs du Mal is

90
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,158
our best chance of finding Steinhil.

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,528
Because whoever runs it contracted
him to create an illusion.

92
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,453
Well, whatever he did for them
can't top the illusion

93
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,391
he created for himself...
rising from the dead.

94
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,031
If we can get to him,
he can get us to the woman

95
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,095
who put Elizabeth's grandfather
on life support.

96
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,672
All right, I combed
through every database,

97
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:09,021
and there's nothing concrete
on Fleurs du Mal,

98
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:11,722
only rumors about a man given a knife

99
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,280
and locked in a room with a tiger,

100
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,215
a woman who fell off the Eiffel Tower,

101
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,517
and something about... piranhas.

102
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,286
You said Reddington had a lead.

103
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,988
A name. Charles Radcliffe.

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,322
According to Reddington,

105
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:23,957
he attended one of the society's events.

106
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,811
Ressler, Aram, go see Mr. Radcliffe.

107
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,364
See if he can I.D. these people
before they hurt someone else.

108
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,735
How's Agnes?

109
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,536
Uh... amazing.

110
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,040
She's sweetly oblivious
to the guards you have

111
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,009
sitting outside our apartment
to protect her.

112
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,611
If you need anything...
including time off...

113
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,780
Is that why you sent Aram instead of me?

114
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,349
I sent Aram because he needs
more experience in the field.

115
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,785
You are a single mom with a hard job.

116
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,320
I just want you to know

117
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,656
if you need to come in late
or leave early...

118
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:58,025
I don't. But it's good to know I can.

119
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,736
Thank you...

120
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,072
for everything.

121
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,468
Elodie Radcliffe?

122
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,938
Agents Ressler and Mojtabai, FBI.

123
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,213
I knew you'd come sooner or later.

124
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,509
You did?

125
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,178
Les Fleurs du Mal. That's why
you're here, isn't it?

126
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,080
Uh... how could you know that?

127
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,117
I thought you'd given up.

128
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,719
On what?

129
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,255
On my husband, Charles.

130
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,924
Well, if he's here, we'd like to
have a word with him, as well.

131
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:33,026
We have a lot of questions
for the both of you.

132
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,429
Charles can't help you.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,733
Because those people in Les Fleurs du Mal

134
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,435
all but killed him.

135
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,910
So, The Defiance... It's done?

136
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,712
You said this one was important.

137
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:54,948
And the Player
will be provided with tools?

138
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,784
Yes... as discussed.

139
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,156
Mm. All useless.

140
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:08,061
For the Player to survive,
he needs to be willing to, uh...

141
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:13,333
break his index finger
and dislocate his thumb,

142
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:18,189
work his hand into the cam slot,
and disengage the lock.

143
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,108
It's the only way.

144
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,009
So, one could survive.

145
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,945
Could? Yes.

146
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,281
Would? Incredibly unlikely.

147
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,016
But the narrow chance of survival

148
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:32,152
is the whole point, right?

149
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:49,380
Is this a diving accident?

150
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,015
An arterial gas embolism.

151
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:52,416
That's the lie they told me

152
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,018
to hide whatever they really did to him.

153
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,586
Did you go to the police?

154
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,422
And say what? I don't know what happened.

155
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:00,658
And even if I did,
these are powerful people

156
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,760
with the resources to protect themselves.

157
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:05,129
So, how did you find these people?

158
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,097
Charles found them.

159
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:10,367
It was a gift... for our anniversary.

160
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:12,670
Our marriage wasn't perfect.

161
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:14,505
We were bored, drifting apart.

162
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:16,774
Charles thought this might be exciting.

163
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:19,250
To... To watch people die.

164
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:22,212
Sharing an experience,

165
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:25,683
something so rare and raw
and extraordinary

166
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:26,984
that it can't be forgotten...

167
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,094
that it can only bring you closer.

168
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:30,954
They called it "The Defiance."

169
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:33,223
Sounds terrifying.

170
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,475
Which is why I didn't go.

171
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:37,995
Do you know how to make contact?

172
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,497
Y-You want me to talk to them?

173
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,733
Yes. Help us expose them.

174
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,302
And find out what happened
to your husband.

175
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,371
Mm, Charles had an e-mail address

176
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:49,840
for the man in charge,
Thelonious Prackett.

177
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:51,742
That's all I know.

178
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,720
_

179
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:06,256
Motya?! I'm sorry
to barge in unexpectedly,

180
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:07,725
but I've called repeatedly,

181
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,993
and there hasn't been
hide nor hair of you,

182
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:12,763
so I thought I'd come and check
to see if you're okay.

183
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:15,432
- Please go.
- And you're okay! Thank God!

184
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,568
I thought maybe Ed Broadfoot and his sons

185
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,204
had finally tracked you down
and dragged you off

186
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,272
to one of those gravel pits.

187
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,841
What do you want?

188
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:25,409
It's about the Townsend Directive.

189
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,311
I understand it's been reactivated...

190
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:29,179
that you and everyone else who bought in

191
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,582
are actively hunting for her.

192
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,251
Do you think I'm an idiot?

193
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:37,654
Motya, I need to take care
of this myself. It's personal.

194
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:38,997
Ah.

195
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,826
Do you know your conversations
with the Minister of Finance

196
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:45,763
single-handedly responsible
for getting my operations

197
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,097
pushed out of Kiev?

198
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,466
I lost millions in rail lines alone.

199
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,469
I lost my relationship
with contractors, politicians.

200
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,272
My own wife left me for the competitor.

201
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:58,375
To be fair, she'd been
screwing him for months.

202
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,550
Forget about The Directive.

203
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:10,403
Forget about Katarina Rostova.

204
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:13,157
I'm not gonna help you find her.

205
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,127
I'm gonna hunt her down,
and I'm gonna kill her myself.

206
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,196
And the next time I see your face,

207
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,431
I'm gonna shoot
before you can start talking.

208
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,868
Too soon, the comment about the wife?

209
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,337
Good talk.

210
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,376
I told you.

211
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:34,144
Yeah, you were right.

212
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,213
But we had to try.

213
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,282
And now he's forced our hand.

214
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,554
Sir. Sir, there is nothing
on Thelonious Prackett.

215
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:45,455
It's... It's got to be an alias.

216
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:48,258
But whoever he is,
he agreed to let Mrs. Radcliffe

217
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,477
- recommend a new member.
- Did you tell Ressler?

218
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,389
Prackett agreed on one condition...

219
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,585
that if the new member gets
invited to an event,

220
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:56,143
Radcliffe has to go with.

221
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:58,569
That'll be all right as long as
Ressler is with her the whole time.

222
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,804
Yeah, um, about that.

223
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,372
If, um...

224
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:05,554
If we're doing this,
I'd like to go with her.

225
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:06,754
Instead of Ressler.

226
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,012
We need to be a convincing
couple to have a connection,

227
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:13,350
and we have one...
I can relate to her loss.

228
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:14,818
Samar.

229
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,187
Not that what I went through
even compares.

230
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,055
You went through plenty.

231
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,325
I'm sorry I haven't asked you
about it more.

232
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,260
I'm fine.

233
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:27,497
Um, still a bit, uh, numb, I guess.

234
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,334
But, um, when the last real
feeling you had was devastation,

235
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,855
you're not super psyched
to get out there and feel again.

236
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:37,574
But... I'm good. I'm good.

237
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,209
I agree.

238
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,044
That I'm good, or... or devastated?

239
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,579
That you should go with her.

240
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,748
Work on your cover... you're going in.

241
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:49,152
Greetings!

242
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:51,121
Where are we going?

243
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,909
And why do I have to go with you?

244
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:55,092
Because you remain in my debt.

245
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,460
I saved your life.

246
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:58,128
Yes, after putting it at risk.

247
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,830
And I told you about Steinhil's contract

248
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,832
with Les Fleurs du Mal.
Why aren't you looking at them?

249
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,568
I've got people working on that.

250
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,970
I'm supposed to be at dinner
tonight at The Peppermill.

251
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,944
It's my wedding anniversary.

252
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:11,842
Congratulations!
That shouldn't be a problem.

253
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,543
You're holding me hostage.

254
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,778
I prefer to think of it

255
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,580
as looking out for my best interests.

256
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:19,149
Please, find yourself another seat.

257
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,785
Relax. Read a book. Watch a movie.

258
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:25,455
Do you like Truffaut?
We have the complete collection.

259
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,164
What did Stevenson say?

260
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,301
The room is being swept.
He can't get a camera in.

261
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:39,536
Someone from the hotel staff, then.

262
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:42,172
Surely we can incentivize a maid

263
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,908
or someone from room service
to take a photo.

264
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,077
They're only allowing
authorized personnel.

265
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,713
We're too late to get anyone
on the inside.

266
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,782
Can I ask you something?

267
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:55,399
- "Day for Night." Definitely.
- The photograph.

268
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,020
Oh, that's none of your concern.

269
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:01,191
If I got it for you,
would my debt be paid?

270
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,527
Conceivably.

271
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,429
We met at Ascot.

272
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,531
I had a horse racing
in the Dubai Shergar Cup.

273
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,066
And how did he do?

274
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:11,521
Fractured his left-front
pastern. Had to be put down.

275
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,507
Cost me $300,000 in stud fees.

276
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:14,705
Per stud?

277
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:17,641
40 studs a year,
that's $12 million... per year.

278
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,242
That must have been a dark day.

279
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,844
Until I saw Elodie.

280
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:23,981
Things brightened considerably
after that.

281
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,752
How is Charles?

282
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:32,990
The man I married is alive,
but my husband is gone.

283
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,292
And our role in that tragedy?

284
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,927
I don't hold you responsible,

285
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,729
if that's what you're asking.

286
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,430
He wanted the risk.

287
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:41,898
We both did.

288
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,668
Well, I know you did.
I'm surprised you still do.

289
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,737
I didn't.

290
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,773
For a long time,
I thought I never would again.

291
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,834
Then I met Shameel.

292
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,397
I was a guest in one of the royal boxes,

293
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,081
and she was three rows below,

294
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,285
and still the peacock feathers
in her hat blocked my view.

295
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,494
Ah.

296
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:09,698
Your interest is... unusual.

297
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,534
I don't see why.
I can buy anything I want.

298
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,470
So, naturally what I want is
something I cannot buy.

299
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:17,706
It's unusual because it coincides

300
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,742
with an upcoming event.

301
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,377
Why is that unusual?

302
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,248
Because we haven't issued
invitations yet.

303
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,520
Which makes your interest
an usual coincidence or worse...

304
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,323
not a coincidence at all.

305
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:37,450
I understand your caution
and why you need

306
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,594
to vet your guests as closely as you do.

307
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,997
I would expect nothing less.

308
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,298
But we've told you our story,

309
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,966
we've exchanged wiring instructions,

310
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:48,770
and I'm one text away from depositing
$1 million into your account.

311
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:52,910
The Defiance is an experience
money can't buy.

312
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,143
Of course not, which is why
I'm all the more happy

313
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,412
to pay for it. So, I need to know...

314
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,949
Are we in, or are we out?

315
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,066
Welcome to Les Fleurs du Mal.

316
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,795
I'm confused.
We have no idea where we're going,

317
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,464
who will be there, or how to get out.

318
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,198
I mean, we don't even know
how to get to this event.

319
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,791
Prackett said he'd send instructions.

320
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,411
- Which he hasn't.
- He will.

321
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:28,272
We sold our story well,
but if you're uncomfortable...

322
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,229
I am. Because I...

323
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,198
Look, I don't quite understand the plan.

324
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,067
Can we go over it again?

325
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:38,264
The location of the event is
a closely guarded secret.

326
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:39,307
Which means

327
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,639
you and Aram will be on your own.

328
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,575
When Prackett makes contact,
you'll follow his instructions.

329
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,843
Well, if you don't know
where we're going,

330
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,411
and you can't follow us,

331
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:47,913
how do you plan to find our location?

332
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:49,815
With an ELT beacon.

333
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:51,316
We'll smuggle the device in disassembled

334
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:53,285
so we can get it past security.

335
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,586
Disassembled.

336
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:56,121
You're going to wear the device

337
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,390
into the building in pieces.

338
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,493
Once inside,
Aram will assemble the device,

339
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:04,529
activate the signal, and it'll
give our team your location.

340
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,198
And once you get the signal...?

341
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,300
We'll come and get you.

342
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,335
Okay. I get it.

343
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:12,771
We literally have no idea
where we're going.

344
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,273
No. We don't.

345
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,508
It'll be okay.

346
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,710
I promise.

347
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:31,123
Miss Radcliffe, Mr. Aubeelauck, welcome.

348
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,425
If you would.

349
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:44,169
For The Defiance. Enjoy your stay.

350
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,058
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

351
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,827
Cheers.

352
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:11,997
Hmm.

353
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,000
Why do we need these again?

354
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,062
I have no idea.

355
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,523
Signal's clear. We're good.

356
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,726
I miss having children.

357
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,735
- I need to tie my shoe.
- Mm.

358
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,386
Hand me the antenna.

359
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:20,932
And what are you two up to?

360
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,400
What? Oh.

361
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:25,403
Uh... We, uh... Hmm.

362
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,539
We were, uh...
We were just, uh, talking about

363
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,976
how delicious those
little shrimp tartlets are.

364
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,644
Uh, he's quite a foodie.

365
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:34,045
- I am a foodie.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,448
I am... I'm such a foodie.
I'm... I'm a foodie.

367
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,623
Well, eat all you like.
Drink all you like.

368
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,622
Tonight is an event that
none of us will soon forget.

369
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:45,290
Have fun, my friends.

370
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,592
And... good luck.

371
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:53,498
"Good luck"?
Why would he say, "Good luck"?

372
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,301
I have no idea...

373
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,170
and I don't want to find out.

374
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:03,575
Let's keep moving, shall we? Okay.

375
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,181
That's Motya Morozov.

376
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:12,417
He's one of the two men
I need you to photograph.

377
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,052
But you already have his photograph.

378
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:15,820
I have photographs of both of them.

379
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,370
What I need is a photograph
of them together.

380
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,461
- Why?
- The other man's name is Fields.

381
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,531
Despite staying at the same hotel,

382
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,732
being seen together would be...

383
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,868
...quite damaging.

384
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,737
They'll take every precaution
to prevent that from happening.

385
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,945
How can I help you?

386
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,481
You see that tall drink of water
behind me?

387
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:46,318
I'm gonna ask him to marry me.

388
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,852
Good for you!

389
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,854
We stayed here once and had
the most incredible time.

390
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:53,682
In room 267.
Any chance it's still available?

391
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:55,327
I'll see what I can do.

392
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,067
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

393
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,930
The lobby is crawling with security.

394
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,046
I'm not surprised.

395
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:17,415
The FBI are not known
for their discretion.

396
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,051
That's who's scanning the room?
The feds?!

397
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:21,419
That's who doesn't want
a photo to be taken.

398
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:23,221
As I said, neither party...

399
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:25,156
You didn't tell me that one of
the parties was the FBI.

400
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,825
An oversight, admittedly.

401
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,360
I thought you were working with the FBI.

402
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:31,463
A small, select group of agents
are in my employ.

403
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:33,398
- Any of these guys?
- Unfortunately not.

404
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,367
I can see this was a mistake.

405
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,602
10 minutes. The valet line.

406
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:40,946
Be there with the engine running.

407
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,407
How are you gonna do it?

408
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,342
Ding-dong ditch.

409
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,212
Ding-dong ditch.

410
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:49,314
I loved playing that as a child!

411
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:56,554
May I have your attention, please?

412
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:01,059
The Defiance is here.

413
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,500
The spectacle we are about to witness

414
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:14,906
only has meaning
because each of us is invested.

415
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:17,909
The pledge we made is what binds us.

416
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:20,945
It's what lets us feel like we're alive,

417
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,348
even if only for one night.

418
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:32,724
Each of us has agreed
to embrace this challenge,

419
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:37,929
and yet only one of us will face it.

420
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:43,370
For that unlucky member,
may it be some small consolation

421
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:46,538
to remember... we ask no risk of you

422
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,841
that we have not taken ourselves.

423
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:54,345
With that, The Defiance
begins in one hour.

424
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:57,882
Good luck to us all.

425
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:08,359
Oh, my God. The Player.

426
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:11,062
They choose one from the guests.

427
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:21,792
I don't know what's taking so long.

428
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,416
It's online and transmitting.

429
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:25,752
So, why aren't they here?
Are we maybe out of range?

430
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,521
No, it doesn't matter where we are.

431
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,788
It's GPS activated.

432
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,257
Okay, so, where are they, then?

433
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:31,892
I don't know.

434
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,627
But the only thing
that could possibly interfere

435
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,796
would be... a sun-flare...

436
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,568
...a jammer.

437
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,136
So, the FBI has no idea we're here.

438
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,971
- I don't think so.
- So, now what?

439
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:48,285
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time.

440
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:53,246
Are you ready to meet the Player?

441
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,418
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

442
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,120
Oh, my God!

443
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,922
Okay, Elodie,
we're gonna figure this out.

444
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,390
We're gonna figure this out.
It's gonna be fine.

445
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,418
- It's gonna be fine. Just...
- No. No. Wait.

446
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,557
No, wait! Wait! Wait!

447
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,962
Hold on! Hold on, stop! Please don't! No!

448
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,730
I'm gonna come for you, okay?

449
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,800
Stop it! Please! Stop! Don't do this!

450
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:16,303
Him. That's Kirilenko.

451
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,904
Head of Russian Vor in America.

452
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:19,773
Get away from me!

453
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,841
Stop, you're hurting me!

454
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:23,743
FBI!

455
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,413
Stop her!

456
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,757
Oh!

457
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,894
- Oh, my...
- Wow.

458
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,531
Hi.

459
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,433
Nice noodle.

460
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,748
She's good... She is very good.

461
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,463
I believe this makes us even.

462
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,970
Dembe, we can tell Edward we'll
be ready for takeoff in 20.

463
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,006
Francesca.

464
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,340
Your husband, what's his name?

465
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,576
Paul... Paul Farwell.

466
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:32,060
Absent head winds,
in two hours, you and Paul

467
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:35,251
will be celebrating your anniversary

468
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:37,142
at The Peppermill as planned.

469
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,545
I recommend the corn chowder.

470
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:43,449
Oh, my! Ding-dong ditch.

471
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,707
Hey. Hey! We finally got something.

472
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,375
Bring up the map overlay.

473
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,986
End of the hall to the left.

474
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:57,856
Oh.

475
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:59,958
Connections are all solid. Oh.

476
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,795
What happened?

477
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:05,664
I don't know. We lost the signal.

478
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,000
But we got a location.
Scramble the HRT choppers.

479
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,835
You and Keen need to get there now.

480
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,373
Ladies and gentlemen,

481
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:19,711
after our brief interruption...
it's now time.

482
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:23,882
Welcome... to The Defiance.

483
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:32,925
Tonight, our Player faces
a most desperate challenge.

484
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:37,162
Using only the tools
left inside the chamber,

485
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:40,966
our Player must find a way
to save her life

486
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:47,773
by unlocking the device
and climbing free from her tomb.

487
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:52,177
But this device, this Defiance offers

488
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,381
an additional challenge, one involving

489
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,650
time.

490
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:01,987
Our Player not only has to get out,

491
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:06,491
she has to do so before she suffocates.

492
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,026
Player...

493
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,797
...give us a show we won't forget!

494
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,032
Stop it! I mean, stop it!

495
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,534
And good luck.

496
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:30,156
Please, don't do this!

497
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:31,991
I can't get this open!

498
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,761
I... I... I can't!
I don't know how to do this!

499
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,816
Come on, guys.

500
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,115
Is that stroganoff?

501
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,373
Yes!

502
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,042
Mmm!

503
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,244
I'm always hunting for a new recipe.

504
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,502
The woman. You sent her?

505
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:30,082
I did. After our last conversation,

506
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:33,986
I felt you needed
a soupçon of motivation.

507
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,822
I told you that
if you come back, I'm gonna...

508
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:38,424
Yes, I know, you'd shoot first

509
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,159
and not bother with the questions later.

510
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:43,896
But... But, quite a bit has
changed since then.

511
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,032
This photo prove nothing.

512
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,734
They prove you went to Miami

513
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:52,838
to meet in secret with the FBI.

514
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,441
I was told you were a snitch.

515
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:58,179
And unless you do as I instruct,

516
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:01,325
everyone else will know
the truth, as well.

517
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,849
Rostova.

518
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:06,418
When you get a lead, I get a lead.

519
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,584
When you get a location,
I get to go there first.

520
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,692
Mmm.

521
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:15,761
The nutmeg is nice.

522
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,697
Needs salt.

523
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:30,075
Please stop this!

524
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,845
The police! The FBI... they know.

525
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,713
They know all about you.

526
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:38,317
They're gonna arrest all of you.

527
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,252
Aram!

528
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:43,322
Aram, please, make it stop!

529
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,361
Please tell them!

530
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:51,163
Please! Please tell them.

531
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:53,199
Mr. Aubeelauck. I need you
to come with me, please.

532
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,073
- Make it stop!
- What? No.

533
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:56,808
Sir, I'm not asking.

534
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,254
Aram!

535
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,572
...could you, uh... could you just, uh,

536
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:03,042
- uh, give me a minute?
- Sir, we're leaving now.

537
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,047
Mr. Prackett's gonna be
very upset with you.

538
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,415
Upset with me for what?

539
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,366
FBI! Everybody on the ground.

540
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,435
Nobody move.

541
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,005
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

542
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:37,676
The jammer's back up.
They're not going anywhere.

543
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,578
Secure the east exit.

544
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,747
- Shh, shh.
- Check that door!

545
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:47,253
Where are your friends?

546
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,488
I don't know.

547
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,732
What was that for?

548
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:02,401
Thank you.

549
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,239
We have to keep moving.

550
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,403
Okay.

551
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,515
- We're almost there.
- Okay.

552
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,384
Aah!

553
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,988
- Welcome back.
- Let her go.

554
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,376
This really is a first.

555
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:47,902
I'm an FBI agent,
and you're gonna let her go.

556
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:52,751
You must know, if you're an FBI agent,

557
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:58,891
that we can't let you go
and expose our guests.

558
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,493
So, you're going to come with me,

559
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:05,423
you're going to tell my men
exactly what the FBI know,

560
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,705
and then we're gonna
take you to the water's edge

561
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:09,068
and drown you.

562
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,262
- No, wait.
- She had nothing to do with this.

563
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,466
- I'm the one you want.
- What's done is done.

564
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,881
- Kill them slowly!
- Drown them!

565
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:27,186
FBI!

566
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:29,621
- Go, go, go!
- FBI! Hands!

567
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:32,291
- Hands up!
- Let's see 'em!

568
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:36,562
Hands! Hands in the air.

569
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:43,235
Some Defiance.

570
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:48,899
You find this funny?

571
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,068
I think it's thrilling.

572
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,472
The other society members
don't share your enthusiasm.

573
00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:57,978
They're too busy turning on you.

574
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:01,311
So far, they've detailed six murders.

575
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:04,081
People want risk.

576
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,116
I give it to them.

577
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:08,618
The chance to feel... alive.

578
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,754
Is that what you gave Vance Palmer

579
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:14,057
when you locked him in a box
with a bomb he couldn't defuse?

580
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,927
If everyone's talked, why talk to me?

581
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,764
Snitches roll uphill. I'm on top.

582
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:22,586
Not quite.

583
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:26,803
Louis Steinhil.
I'm told you hired him once.

584
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,605
Never heard of him.

585
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,874
Well, that's too bad.

586
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:33,009
'Cause if you had, we could have
recommended to the D.A.

587
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,345
that he take the death penalty
off the table.

588
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,118
Then again, lethal injection

589
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,121
sure would give you a chance
to feel alive...

590
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,456
you know, before it kills you.

591
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:53,730
What... What's his name again?

592
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:56,733
Steinhil. Louis T.

593
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,603
It's an anagram for The Illusionist.

594
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:03,407
You said The Peppermill
didn't deliver the champagne?

595
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,741
They said there were no reservations

596
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:06,443
under Farwell or Campbell.

597
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:11,281
Francesca said she was married.

598
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,150
But according to Glen,

599
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,086
the DMV database lists her as single.

600
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,157
Hello?

601
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,894
When it's appropriate, I'd like
to engage your services.

602
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:25,595
I thought we were even.

603
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:27,664
We are. You're under no obligation,

604
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:31,529
but I could use a capable operative.

605
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,771
Do you need an answer right now?

606
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:37,874
Oh, my goodness. Oh, how rude of me.

607
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:39,576
It's your anniversary.

608
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:41,346
Did you make it to The Peppermill?

609
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,513
I did. We're here now.

610
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:46,398
And here I am talking shop. Go, have fun.

611
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,785
I hope Paul knows how lucky he is.

612
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:51,955
How could he forget?
I remind him every day.

613
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,062
Hello? Elizabeth?

614
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,970
Elizabeth.

615
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:09,606
Oh, hey, sorry about that. Um...

616
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:10,907
Give me one second.

617
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:14,277
Okay.

618
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:20,417
So, I was just calling to tell
you I got what you wanted.

619
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:23,653
- An address on Steinhil.
- Tell me.

620
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:26,602
Hmm.

621
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,502
_

622
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,694
Some people are so thoughtful.

623
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:33,591
Steinhil. Where is he?

624
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:36,066
They found Steinhil.

625
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,569
That's too bad.

626
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,872
I'd grown quite fond of him.

627
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,592
_

628
00:37:21,213 --> 00:37:24,314
Well, hello, young lady.

629
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:25,916
Thank you for the books.

630
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,384
You're very welcome.

631
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:29,553
Would you like to read one to me?

632
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:32,722
Oh, well, I'd love that.
Would you like me to?

633
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:48,438
You did well out there today.

634
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,008
Uh... eventually.

635
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,910
You did well.

636
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:56,780
I'm proud of you.

637
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,419
"Once upon a time,

638
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,287
there lived a little country girl,

639
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,924
the prettiest creature who was ever seen.

640
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:11,628
Her mother was extremely fond of her;

641
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,564
and her grandmother
doted on her still more."

642
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,696
How's Mrs. Radcliffe?

643
00:38:19,204 --> 00:38:22,534
She's, uh... She's okay.

644
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:25,335
You know, I think part of her

645
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,843
found all the danger... exhilarating.

646
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:31,681
It's crazy, right?

647
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,299
I've long since given up

648
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:38,388
trying to figure out
what excites people or why.

649
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,758
Yeah, and getting your kicks
from Les Fleurs du Mal is crazy.

650
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,605
But, uh, as a general rule,
I admire people

651
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:49,766
who insist on finding ways
to be exhilarated.

652
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,502
As opposed to being okay
with feeling numb.

653
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,373
You're not okay with it.

654
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,841
You're scared to feel again,
which is understandable.

655
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,679
But I want to encourage you to try.

656
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,872
Because as... hard as it is
to feel pain...

657
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,917
it's much harder to feel nothing.

658
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:18,590
"The poor child did not know
of the danger she was in."

659
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:27,070
Hey.

660
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,371
Hi.

661
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,440
Come in.

662
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:35,211
"'Grandmother, what big ears you have.'

663
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,647
'All the better
to hear you with, my child, '

664
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,149
replied the wolf."

665
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,718
I wanted to come by
to make sure you were okay.

666
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,221
I am... thanks to you.

667
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:48,591
I also, uh, stopped by, uh,
to say that...

668
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:51,561
that you shouldn't, um...

669
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,730
you know, feel badly about...

670
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,251
About what?

671
00:39:56,835 --> 00:40:00,003
Kissing me.

672
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,933
You shouldn't feel badly
about that at all.

673
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:04,808
I shouldn't?

674
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:06,810
Absolutely not.

675
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,953
"'Grandmother, what big teeth you have.'

676
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:20,533
'All the better to eat you
with, ' replied the wolf.

677
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:24,607
And, saying these words, the Wicked Wolf

678
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,866
fell upon Little Red Riding Hood
and ate her all up."

679
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,893
She's an angel.

680
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:41,811
How did it happen?

681
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,960
You becoming estranged
from your daughter.

682
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:50,988
All that matters now

683
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,623
is that I want to make amends.

684
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:57,461
I was estranged from my mother.

685
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:03,152
I would hope that she would want
to make amends with me, too.

686
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,803
I'm sure she does.

687
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,618
Well...

688
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,871
I hope it happens.

689
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:20,250
Ohh.

690
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,654
For a long time,

691
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:25,923
I didn't think that would ever happen.

692
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:29,193
Now I'm beginning to think it will.

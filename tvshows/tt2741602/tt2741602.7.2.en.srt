1
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:06,177
6,000 milliliters.

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,110
That's how much blood
an adult male of your size

3
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,648
has in his body.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,817
It's a little more than a gallon of milk.

5
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:14,652
76 over 54.

6
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:17,689
They say a man can lose
up to 40% of his blood,

7
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:19,190
but not much more.

8
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:20,758
You've lost 20%.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,161
That's why you're feeling
the palpitations.

10
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:26,664
Your heart can't fill with blood
before it contracts.

11
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,002
It's the beginning stage

12
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:31,974
of what doctors refer to
as exsanguination.

13
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,907
Raymond, please,
I don't want to hurt you.

14
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,176
This isn't easy for me.

15
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,778
Sorry you're having a hard time.

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,609
You can help me.

17
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,849
I've always helped you.

18
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:47,185
No. You pretended to help me.

19
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,109
You were never on my side.

20
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,558
I came to Paris to warn you.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,027
You came to Paris to control me,

22
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,096
to keep feeding me your narrative.

23
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:59,063
But I'm done hiding.

24
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,099
I won't do it anymore. I can't.

25
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:02,834
Not with Elizabeth asking questions

26
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:05,536
and telling ghost stories.

27
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:07,872
Nobody knows you're alive.

28
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:10,137
They're asking the questions.

29
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,139
That's enough.

30
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,559
I never betrayed you.

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,717
The Townsend Directive
is my death sentence.

32
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,921
Even with your help, I can't outrun them.

33
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,256
There's only one way to survive.

34
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,158
I have to give them what they want.

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,988
Tell me how.

36
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:33,577
I have nothing to tell you.

37
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,330
We'll see.

38
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,509
If you think those secrets
of yours are worth dying for?

39
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,193
Prove it.

40
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:56,827
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

41
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:59,323
What do we know?

42
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,325
We questioned everyone
who worked the con.

43
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,994
Steinhil used doctors, nurses,

44
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,862
ex-cops, intel agents. Smart group.

45
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,330
But not as smart as Steinhil,

46
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,632
who kept everything need-to-know.

47
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,100
None of them know the name

48
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,169
of the woman who hired him
to con Mr. Reddington.

49
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,771
Just why she did it... to ask
what he knows about my mother.

50
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:16,007
I'm less interested in the why
than in the where.

51
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,509
If Steinhil employed all these
people to create the illusion

52
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,378
that Reddington was in a French hospital,

53
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,813
where the hell was he when we got there?

54
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,981
Apparently, he escaped. Or tried to.

55
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,049
He got less than a block.

56
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,451
But the hospital gag was blown,

57
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:27,919
so they moved him somewhere else,

58
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,153
but we don't know where.

59
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:30,822
Let's start at the beginning. Paris.

60
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,291
Mr. Reddington went to meet with
someone he felt safe enough with

61
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,492
that he didn't bring Dembe.

62
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,427
Or he went alone to keep a secret.

63
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,362
From Dembe? That must be some secret.

64
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,898
What else? He was abducted in Paris,

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,101
then flown to Annapolis. Why?

66
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,335
Could be there's something there

67
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,037
that they needed Reddington's
help to find.

68
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,818
Something or someone.

69
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,945
Katarina Rostova.

70
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,843
I thought your mother was dead.

71
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,560
Maybe that's what she wanted us to think.

72
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:54,771
Even you?

73
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,347
Apparently, she's not the maternal type.

74
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,016
So far, I'm hearing a lot
of maybe's and could be's,

75
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:01,085
a lot of theory, almost no fact.

76
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:04,188
Here's a fact... creating
a French hospital in Annapolis

77
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,356
takes planning.

78
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,158
All the doctors, nurses, police,

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,926
they all were sent to the same location

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,495
to get fitted for their wardrobe.

81
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,762
You have a location?

82
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,631
Textile warehouse in Anne Arundel County.

83
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,999
Get there.
If they couldn't con Reddington

84
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,567
into telling them
what they wanted to know,

85
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,440
they're probably trying
to beat it out of him.

86
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:23,407
Agent Keen?

87
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,857
I brought Agnes home thinking
my mother wasn't a threat.

88
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:29,776
Now I'm not sure.

89
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:33,451
He's a tough old bird.

90
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,186
He'll give you what you want.

91
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,321
I don't want this.

92
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:39,123
It's the best of a bad situation.

93
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,893
I wouldn't be in this situation
if you'd done your job.

94
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,327
I told you I needed three months

95
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,096
to create the illusion
you were looking for.

96
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,430
You gave me three days.

97
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,499
The FBI, have they released anyone?

98
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,534
I spoke with Abigail.

99
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:50,568
How much do they know?

100
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,470
About me? Very little.

101
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,671
About you?

102
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:55,260
Absolutely nothing.

103
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:58,042
I never planned on killing him.

104
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,144
He'd find you if you didn't.

105
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,279
It's better this way.

106
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,015
Better. To kill a man.

107
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,551
This man. Once you've bled him
for what you need.

108
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,319
The nurse was with him when he escaped.

109
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,687
I trust her.

110
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,860
Then the only question left is,

111
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,228
should I trust you?

112
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,499
How long do I have?

113
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,185
Half an hour.

114
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,394
Maybe less.

115
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:36,259
I've met my share of killers.

116
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,951
I know who has the capacity

117
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:43,558
to take a human life.

118
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,657
I know the...

119
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,106
the look in their eyes.

120
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,265
You don't have it.

121
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,491
It wasn't my decision.

122
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,160
But it is.

123
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,207
If you help her...

124
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:10,147
if you do nothing

125
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,380
to stop her,

126
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:15,992
you're responsible.

127
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,260
You almost escaped.

128
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,182
- She blames me for that.
- Shh.

129
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:27,031
I can't take the risk. I'm sorry.

130
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:35,039
I'm afraid hypoxia has set in.

131
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,441
The drip, drip of your blood
taking with it

132
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:41,408
the oxygen your organs
so desperately need.

133
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:46,872
I'm told hypoxia can be
quite uncomfortable.

134
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,958
I know a little something about pain.

135
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,823
Belgrade.

136
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:56,214
Everything I cared about died that day.

137
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,695
I didn't want that.

138
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,788
I'd made a life for myself, a family.

139
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,613
You blew all that up.

140
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,870
I didn't know.

141
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,643
Dom promised me no one would get hurt.

142
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,276
Said he loved his child
and just wanted her to be safe.

143
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,378
Do I seem safe to you?

144
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,531
Hunted,

145
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,696
chased into the shadows.

146
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,566
I...

147
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,291
I can't give you what you want.

148
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:26,036
What I want

149
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:29,142
is my family back.

150
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,686
No one can give me that back.

151
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,058
Least of all you.

152
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,095
You can't give me what I want.

153
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:46,918
But you can give me what I need.

154
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,231
You want me to believe you had
nothing to do with Belgrade.

155
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,858
I didn't.

156
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,262
That you care about me.

157
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,448
Yes.

158
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,909
Then prove it.

159
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,955
Who's coming for me? How many?

160
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,857
And most importantly, the truth.

161
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,257
I can't.

162
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,607
What is it?!

163
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,523
Very well. Dom then.

164
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,860
That's right. I found him.

165
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,200
I know it's cruel
to go after the old man,

166
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,115
but you leave me no choice.

167
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,741
Something tells me
he won't hold up nearly as well.

168
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:54,509
Leave him alone.

169
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,178
Gladly.

170
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,190
If you give me what I need.

171
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,941
Goodbye, Raymond.

172
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,270
Shh. Be quiet.

173
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,640
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

174
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,675
I can't do this alone.

175
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,944
I need you to get in the car.

176
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,283
Hey, stop!

177
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,552
- I said stop!
- Don't. Please.

178
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,854
Please. I don't want to hurt you.

179
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,267
Excuse me.
Agents Ressler and Keen... FBI.

180
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,368
How can I help you?

181
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,404
We, um...

182
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,106
That is, are you okay?

183
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,507
Oh, this?

184
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,809
No, no, no. It's just... It's... It's...

185
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,763
The Kennedy Center's doing Phantom.

186
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:40,998
We're doing the effects.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,566
We thought you were a wardrobe house.

188
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:45,636
Wardrobe, effects...
whatever a production needs.

189
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,571
We're here to see Margaret Teague.

190
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:49,706
I'll let her know you're here.

191
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,213
Illusions. Cons.

192
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,982
People pretending to be
something they're not.

193
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:01,618
- Just like Reddington.
- Or my mother.

194
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,888
Look, Keen, you did the right
thing by bringing Agnes home.

195
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,358
But if she isn't who I thought
she was, if she's a threat...

196
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,027
- Then we'll deal with it.
- We?

197
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,830
Don't think Cooper, Aram, and I
haven't talked about this.

198
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:14,398
You've put your life on hold long enough.

199
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,301
It's past time you start
living it, and I...

200
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,869
I'm Margaret Teague.

201
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,871
Agents Keen and Ressler.

202
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:22,773
We're looking for Louis Steinhil.

203
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,208
I'm not familiar with that name.

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,377
He's a con man, sets up
elaborate illusions...

205
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:29,246
If you think I had anything to do with...

206
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,781
...the last one being a French hospital

207
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,583
in an Annapolis warehouse.

208
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:35,285
See, their doctors, nurses,
and cops who worked that con,

209
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,421
- you outfitted them.
- I'm a supplier.

210
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,823
What people do with my supplies,
I'm sure I don't know.

211
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,073
I don't care if you know or not.

212
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,604
I'm looking for someone I care about,

213
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:43,861
and in order to find that person,

214
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,096
I got to find Steinhil.
So lets cut to the chase.

215
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:49,299
What you provide, does he
pick up, or do you deliver?

216
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,400
I've never met the man.

217
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,469
- So you deliver.
- Yes.

218
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,656
To where?

219
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,775
Oh, my God. I just shot that guard.

220
00:10:58,777 --> 00:10:59,910
I didn't know what else to do.

221
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,145
I need your phone.

222
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:02,546
If he dies...

223
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,615
Mila.

224
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:06,650
Mila, your phone.

225
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,745
Raymond.

226
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,764
You're alive.

227
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:21,798
Barely.

228
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,667
I thought...

229
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,035
It's been a week.

230
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:27,638
I was going to enact
The Protocol. Where are you?

231
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,631
You have to get to Dom.

232
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:32,175
She's going after him.

233
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:34,778
He doesn't know he's in danger.

234
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,447
- She?
- Bring the cooler.

235
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,150
I need platelets,

236
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,819
frozen plasma... eight units.

237
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,621
Raymond, you sound bad.

238
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:46,323
Come alone.

239
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:49,426
If you won't make it to Dom's,
you need to get to a hospital.

240
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:52,862
If I don't make it, you...
you know what to do.

241
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:56,360
Raymond. Be safe.

242
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,895
I'll be there.

243
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,206
Who's Dom?

244
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:05,742
You need to get us to the highway.

245
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,010
You need a doctor.

246
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,170
No, no, no, no doctors.

247
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:10,814
Just the highway.

248
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,115
You are not okay, all right?

249
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,417
You're not gonna make it. You're sick.

250
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,999
If you don't make it to a hospital...

251
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,071
What are you doing?

252
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:35,405
Give me your arm.

253
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:36,974
- We need to get to Dom.
- Listen to me.

254
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,508
If we don't do this right now,
you're gonna be dead

255
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,877
before we get to wherever
you think we're going to.

256
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,872
I didn't save you
to watch you die in my car.

257
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,386
If we don't keep moving, they'll find us.

258
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:51,021
They already have. Hold still.

259
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,856
- W-What?
- Don't move.

260
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,458
What do you mean they already have?

261
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,926
You have to trust me.

262
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,313
Why did you help me?

263
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,948
Like you said, I'm not a killer.

264
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,779
And I have terrible judgement
when it comes to men.

265
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,287
Hello? Anyone here?

266
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,088
Morning.

267
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,957
You'd better have
a damn good excuse, darling.

268
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,793
Are you Dom?

269
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:09,165
_

270
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,501
Is he dead?

271
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:19,406
Tell me what she said.

272
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,075
Not your interpretation, her exact words.

273
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,978
I'm not interpreting anything.
She's coming for you,

274
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,515
and she made it very clear
she's closing in.

275
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,684
Nonsense. I'm off the grid.

276
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:31,718
Elizabeth found you.

277
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,053
You mind your own business.

278
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,822
There's no reason to risk it, Dom.

279
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:39,226
This is your house.
I know it won't be easy to go,

280
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,927
but there's nothing heroic

281
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,563
about dying when you don't have to.

282
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,165
This isn't "Rio Bravo."

283
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,933
For your information,

284
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,270
going out with a fight,
standing your... your ground,

285
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:52,105
dying on your own terms,

286
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,908
that sounds pretty good to a man 81.

287
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,344
81. Are you 81?

288
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,447
Secondly, nothing about this situation

289
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,749
resembles the plot of "Rio Bravo."

290
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,318
She knows you tried to kill her, Dom.

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,588
She wants answers,
but she also wants revenge.

292
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,790
You set her up, betrayed her...

293
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,092
Whose is this?

294
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,260
My daughter's.

295
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,829
Katarina. That's your daughter?

296
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,803
- Katarina Rostova?
- Put it away, please.

297
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:21,801
Your own daughter wants to kill
you because you betrayed her?

298
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,836
It's complicated.

299
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,805
I never betrayed Katarina.

300
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:26,907
She betrayed me.

301
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,941
Oh, come on. Enough.

302
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,409
Not just me. Our country,

303
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,279
our... our values,
our entire way of life.

304
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,480
The truth is, Mila,

305
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,082
you've stumbled headlong
into a family squabble.

306
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,352
And the Rostov family
can be rather eccentric.

307
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,654
She broke my heart.

308
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:43,089
Made choices I couldn't understand.

309
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:44,157
What was my response?

310
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,692
Wait, what did Tolstoy

311
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,794
say about unhappy families?

312
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,697
Despite all my anger, my frustration,

313
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,961
I did what I thought was necessary...

314
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:54,501
"Happy families are all alike,

315
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:58,505
but every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way."

316
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:01,274
Did I make mistakes? Yes.

317
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:04,177
Do I deserve to die for them? Eh, maybe.

318
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,948
If I die, at least I will go to my grave

319
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,717
knowing that I did what I did

320
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,019
to protect my own.

321
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,957
We found him.

322
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,124
Where?

323
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,026
A farmhouse a few hours north.

324
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,729
So I was right to trust you.

325
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,264
Will he give you what you want?

326
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:28,068
No. Just what I need.

327
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,603
I'll talk to my halawadar.

328
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,239
The balance due will be paid
by this time tomorrow.

329
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,180
He means a great deal to you.

330
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:41,526
He did.

331
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,402
Once.

332
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,053
If the situation were reversed,
would he show you mercy?

333
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,618
No.

334
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,576
Then you can't show him any.

335
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,001
Thank you.

336
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:01,701
For what?

337
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:04,304
It's my job to protect him.

338
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,592
I couldn't do that. You did.

339
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,143
He was supposed to be a bad man,

340
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,980
a criminal, a fugitive,
the worst of the worst.

341
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:17,684
That's why I signed up.
Not to protect him.

342
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,606
But to take down the Most Wanted.

343
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,225
In my experience,
who people are supposed to be

344
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,394
is rarely who they are.

345
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:32,178
Steven Biel. Contractor?

346
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,233
Call him.

347
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,348
Tell him Raymond sent you.

348
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,497
Why?

349
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,205
Raymond takes care of the
people who take care of him.

350
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,243
I didn't do this for the money.

351
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,883
No. You did it because
it's the right thing to do.

352
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,416
You give me too much credit.

353
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,179
Take the card.

354
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,807
It's not just money. It's protection.

355
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,284
You think she'll come for me.

356
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:02,732
Please thank him for me.

357
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,526
No thanks are necessary.

358
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,654
He seems so decent.

359
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,538
How is that possible?

360
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,475
Because he is decent.

361
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,664
I should go.

362
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,050
He said I'm not a killer...

363
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,591
Reddington.

364
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,722
He said he could tell
just by looking at me.

365
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,350
Then you're not.

366
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,833
He knows nothing about me.

367
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,120
He knows enough.

368
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:55,482
Cover!

369
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,252
- What was that?
- I don't know.

370
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,232
Show me your hands!

371
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,870
- Police!
- You go.

372
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,468
He was here.

373
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,344
I need help here! I've got something.

374
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:03,917
Someone inside. It's locked.

375
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,252
It's Steinhil. He's alone.

376
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,257
FBI. Open the door.

377
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,027
Steinhil, I said open the door.

378
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,414
Damn it! I could've sworn I had
another box of shells in here.

379
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,015
Dom, we can help you.

380
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,150
We'll take what we can.

381
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,384
I'm too old to run.

382
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:39,886
But too young to die.

383
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,254
Wh... Where would I go?

384
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,957
To the beach, the mountains.

385
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,225
How about the Tetons?

386
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,893
You really think she's close.

387
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,261
I think we have the day.

388
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,690
You don't.

389
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,099
What do you mean, "don't"?

390
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,300
You don't have the day.

391
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:56,135
You don't even have the hour.

392
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,004
She knows where you are.
She's been tracking us

393
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,439
since we left the safe house.

394
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:03,009
How? You took the chip
out of Raymond's neck.

395
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,878
Yes, out of my neck,

396
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,999
but not out of her own.

397
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,650
We didn't escape, did we, Mila?

398
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,185
No.

399
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,420
She ordered me to help you.

400
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,467
Hoping I'd lead her here,

401
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,552
to Dom.

402
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,639
How much time do we have?

403
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,798
Mila. How much time?

404
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,368
She'll be here in 20, 30 minutes.

405
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,304
I didn't have a choice.
She said she would kill me.

406
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:35,041
Dom, I suggest we find
that extra box of shells.

407
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,528
Who are you?

408
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,029
You've thrown your lot in with me.

409
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,598
I should at least know your name.

410
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,503
Francesca Campbell.
People call me Frankie.

411
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,758
Tell me, Francesca.

412
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:00,842
How is it that...

413
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:03,078
you turned out to be my guardian angel?

414
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,146
That is not what I am.

415
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,415
Are you really a nurse?

416
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,150
I'm a former combat medic.

417
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,052
That's why Steinhil picked me.

418
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:13,088
- Steinhil.
- He created the illusion.

419
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,491
Was part of it, too. Inspector Oban.

420
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:18,727
Tell me about it... the con.

421
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:21,429
- They'll be here any minute.
- Tell me.

422
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:24,566
All I know is Katarina Rostova
hired him because she thinks

423
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,234
people are trying to kill her

424
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:28,403
and that you might know how to stop them.

425
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,805
The plan was to con you, not kill you,

426
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,574
to get you to tell Inspector Oban

427
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:35,277
who the assassins are
and what they, or you,

428
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,280
might know about her sources
and safe houses.

429
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:40,448
You don't believe in assault rifles?

430
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,583
Open that.

431
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:42,984
Steinhil's smart.

432
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,153
He knew I'd be overconfident

433
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,522
after figuring out
the hospital wasn't real...

434
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,857
Carefully, carefully.

435
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:51,359
...that I'd think I'd solved the puzzle

436
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,794
when I'd only gotten one piece.

437
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,230
I believe in plastic explosives.

438
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,299
He knew I wouldn't see his fingerprints

439
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:58,700
all over the escape.

440
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,435
Everything was planned,

441
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,836
down to the last detail...

442
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,674
leaving you alone to die,
the car parked outside.

443
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,375
You shot the guard.

444
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:09,144
No, I didn't.

445
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:13,014
All that and the chip in my neck.

446
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,883
Inspired.

447
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,486
When this is over, I must see about

448
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:22,557
putting this Steinhil on retainer.

449
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,792
So...

450
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:27,681
you're not a nurse who's
afraid of her own shadow.

451
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,532
You're a soldier.

452
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,733
That's right.

453
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:35,470
And I'm not leading you or
anyone else into an ambush.

454
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:38,039
Four shotguns...
two pump action, two lever.

455
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,408
Three bolt-action rifles...
all single shot.

456
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,878
And a few souvenirs from home.

457
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:45,880
Let me help you.

458
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,198
Your help is what got us into this mess.

459
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,085
She'll kill me, too.

460
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,587
When she realizes
that you knew she was coming,

461
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,656
she'll know I warned you.

462
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,192
Raymond, we could use an extra gun.

463
00:23:57,194 --> 00:24:00,295
Not if it's pointed
at the back of our heads!

464
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:05,300
What do they call a combat medic
in the army?

465
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,103
68 whiskey.

466
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,338
Dembe, give the woman a shotgun.

467
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,956
I want a full autopsy.

468
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,236
No one accesses that body
until I get a solid I.D.

469
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:24,486
You got that?

470
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:27,255
They tricked him,
made him think he escaped.

471
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,590
Reddington escaped, but he didn't?

472
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,192
He was being tracked. They both were.

473
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:33,361
Both? What do you mean both?

474
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:36,031
One of the security guards
said there was a nurse on site

475
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,298
who befriended him,

476
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,801
made Reddington think
she was on his side.

477
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,569
She orchestrated the escape.

478
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,657
So they could track him. Why? Where...

479
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:45,240
Where did they think he was gonna go?

480
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,242
My grandfather's house.

481
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:49,277
- Your grandfather?
- Whoever took Reddington

482
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,547
was trying to find out
about Katarina Rostova.

483
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,250
If he wouldn't tell them,
maybe they think Dom will.

484
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:57,752
And if they do to him
what they did to Reddington...

485
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:59,387
We're not gonna let that happen.

486
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:00,822
They may already be there.

487
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:03,124
Keen. It's not gonna happen.

488
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,513
They're both here?

489
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:27,348
Reddington's recovering
in the downstairs bedroom.

490
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,683
He's not mobile.

491
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:30,285
The old man's working
at the back of the house.

492
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,586
- Anyone else?
- No.

493
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:33,888
Did everything you said.
It went all as planned.

494
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,925
You three, inside with her.

Dembe! Dom's hit!

526
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,636
Okay. One more step.

527
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,205
That's it. All right, sit.

528
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:07,141
Something for his head.

529
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:12,881
There you go.

530
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:17,051
Single round to the chest.

531
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:19,387
Please tell me he has a hemostat.

532
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:20,653
How bad?

533
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,690
Some Quick Clot powder? Celox?

534
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,859
- I don't see any.
- Gauze?

535
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:30,298
Oh, the... the plastic.
Give me the package, too.

536
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,505
All right. Get him up.

537
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,108
How bad is it?

538
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,043
How bad?!

539
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:50,885
That's it.

540
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,925
They're here.

541
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,668
Gentlemen, it's over!

542
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,939
Go to hell!

543
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:10,538
Seems you may get there first.

544
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,373
Raymond, I told you I want answers,

545
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,008
which means I need him alive.

546
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,513
Send him out, and I'll have
no choice but to save his life.

547
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:20,581
We open it, she'll kill the three of us

548
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,016
and eventually kill him.

549
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:23,952
He may not make it anyway.

550
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,290
Then we fight.

551
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:29,357
Open the door, Raymond,

552
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,327
or my men shoot their way to you.

553
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:37,231
Raymond, this is my last warning!

554
00:29:58,188 --> 00:29:59,620
Move up, move up!

555
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:12,233
- Clear!
- Clear!

556
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:15,670
Ressler, in here!

557
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:19,807
Dom? Dom, it's Elizabeth Keen.
Are you okay?

558
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,776
Elizabeth! It's us!

559
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,945
- Is it clear?
- It's clear!

560
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,684
Dom's hit. We need to get him help now.

561
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,619
That's it.

562
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,825
You have Reddington?

563
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,861
Yeah. Been through hell, but he's okay.

564
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,930
- Better than Rostova.
- Katarina?

565
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:44,300
No. Dominic... her father,
Keen's grandfather.

566
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:47,036
This, everything, it was
about getting information

567
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,062
on Katarina and the people hunting her.

568
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,437
Getting information for who?

569
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:53,042
Are we any closer to finding out
who hired Steinhil?

570
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,910
No, they were gone
by the time we got there.

571
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:59,315
And by the looks of things,
they came in guns blazing.

572
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,086
The nearest hospital's
in the opposite direction.

573
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:06,088
- Yes, it is.
- Then why are we going the wrong way?

574
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,350
Because we're not going to the hospital.

575
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:08,448
- What?
- What?

576
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,628
I'm sorry, but who are you?

577
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,570
He needs an operating room, a surgeon.

578
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:13,963
Yes, and I intend to get him
the best one available.

579
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:15,524
What if he dies before then?

580
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:17,399
He's a Rostov, Elizabeth.

581
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:20,069
If we take him to an emergency
room, questions will be asked,

582
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,238
questions he's not prepared to answer.

583
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,174
Please don't tell me she's the
nurse from the French hospital.

584
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,910
- She was very convincing.
- She was in on the con.

585
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:30,079
Yes, and now she's the best hope

586
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,681
your grandfather has to survive.

587
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,919
Dr. Stein and his team have
been alerted. They're en route.

588
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:39,989
Called Dembe on my way to Dom's,
and given my condition,

589
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:42,968
he felt it prudent to assemble
one of our triage cubes.

590
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,160
Turns out, it was.

591
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,097
- What's happening?!
- Tension pneumothorax.

592
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,988
Air's leaking out of the hole
into his pleural cavity.

593
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,375
We need to remove the seal,

594
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,158
or else the pressure's
gonna collapse his lungs.

595
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,409
It's not just air. He's bleeding
into his chest cavity.

596
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,044
We're losing him. How far out?!

597
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,279
Three minutes.

598
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,906
We're almost there.

599
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:08,117
So much to say.

600
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,486
And a lifetime left to say it.

601
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:32,941
GSW! White male, 80.
Sat-level... 76 and dropping.

602
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,710
Got it.

603
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:36,545
Hemopneumothorax. His lungs are drowning.

604
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:37,946
Which one of you is the surgeon?

605
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:39,248
- Doc's still in transit.
- ETA?

606
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,150
- Six minutes.
- He'll be dead in six minutes!

607
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:43,252
If we don't put a chest tube
in him in the next two,

608
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,684
both of his lungs will collapse.

609
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:47,331
- Then you do it.
- Me? I'm a field medic.

610
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,058
I don't care what you are.
Do you know how to do it?

611
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,592
- I've never done it before.
- Do you know how to do it?

612
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,006
Just do it. These people can

Why don't we start with who did this.

Not now, Elizabeth.

Yes, now.

636
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:33,306
Someone out there thinks
Katarina Rostova is still alive,

637
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:36,099
and clearly they think you know
more than you're saying.

638
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:39,812
- That isn't a question.
- Who grabbed you in Paris?

639
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:41,518
Who tortured you?

640
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,751
Why is my grandfather
dying in a lumberyard?

641
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,854
My question is, what the hell happened?

642
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,759
You did. You and Agent Ressler.

643
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,227
Excuse me?

644
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:57,563
How many times have I told you?
Leave it alone.

645
00:34:57,565 --> 00:35:00,033
I warned you. Even saying the name

646
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:02,268
Katarina Rostova has consequences,

647
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,436
and now you see.

648
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:06,439
Now you see what that name
will make others do.

649
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:10,109
These questions of yours
have gotten their attention,

650
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:13,413
and now they will crawl out of
whatever hole they were in,

651
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:16,449
and they will hurt whomever
they must just on the chance,

652
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:19,686
just on the notion that
she might still be alive.

653
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,186
"What happened?"

654
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,188

You raised an old ghost,

656
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:30,563
and that's why your grandfather
is dying in a lumberyard.

657
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,285
Reddington blamed you?

658
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:44,349
- He's not wrong.
- Of course he is.

659
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,611
None of this would've happened
if Ressler and I hadn't started

660
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,205
asking a lot of questions
he told us not to ask.

661
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,153
You wouldn't have had to ask them
if he'd been honest with you,

662
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,918
if he'd told you his real identity.

663
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,034
Have you decided whether
to tell Main Justice?

664
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,804
Not yet. But telling them
Reddington is really

665
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,506
a former KGB agent
whose name is Ilya Koslov

666
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:04,374
will cause a firestorm I have
no interest in dealing with.

667
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:06,960
What I am interested in
is you and making sure

668
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,194
you know that none of this is your fault.

669
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,997
Reddington wouldn't tell us
who abducted him.

670
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,965
And it's not like we can ask Steinhil

671
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,433
or whatever his real name was.

672
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:17,168
Aram's following up with the M.E.

673
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,337
If we can identify the body,

674
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:21,239
maybe we can work backward from there.

675
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,108
In the meantime, I've assigned
a security detail

676
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,342
to your apartment.

677
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,144
You think that's really necessary?

678
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,445
We don't know who took Reddington,

679
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:28,913
but she's asking about your mother

680
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:30,682
and has shown that
she's willing to go after

681
00:36:30,684 --> 00:36:31,883
anyone who may know about her,

682
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:34,652
so, yes, I think it's necessary.

683
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:38,923
I'm sorry my family is so...

684
00:36:40,494 --> 00:36:41,826
...messy.

685
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,352
Katarina Rostova is your relative.

686
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:46,297
We're your family.

687
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,334
And we're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

688
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,947
- Sir.
- Agent Mojtabai.

689
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,916
- Something wrong?
- Definitely.

690
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,260
I did what you said and followed up with

691
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,053
the Medical Examiner's Office,

692
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:10,655
and they didn't know
what I was talking about.

693
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:14,292
They don't have Steinhil.
I mean, they never even got him.

694
00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:15,927
Apparently, the call we made requesting

695
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,596
they respond to the scene was canceled.

696
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,799
Canceled by who? Well, the log says by

697
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:23,468
Special Agent Gerald Host.

698
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,770
G. Host, as in...

699
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,138
Ghost.

700
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:37,405
I've been trying to decide
what to do about you.

701
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:42,720
I suppose by warning us,
you saved our lives,

702
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,422
but you're also a large part

703
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:47,192
of the reason our lives needed saving.

704
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:50,028
The things you've done...

705
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,031
I've killed others for less.

706
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:58,036
I appreciate what you did for Dom.

707
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:01,172
It's the reason you're still alive.

708
00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:03,362
But to be clear,

709
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,934
it does not make us even.

710
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,747
Why didn't the FBI arrest you?

711
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:14,258
I intend to find the woman who did this.

712
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:18,052
You're number one on their list,
and they just let you go.

713
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:21,241
Perhaps you can help me find her.

714
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:24,242
Perhaps not. Time will tell.

715
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,538
But until we are even,

716
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:30,160
you're not going anywhere.

717
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,050
If you don't mind me asking...

718
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,547
how's he doing?

719
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:47,685
We don't know if his brain
was deprived of oxygen,

720
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:49,854
and if so, for how long.

721
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,492
If he ever does wake up,
he may not be himself anymore.

722
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,846
I didn't realize you two were close.

723
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,328
Ahh.

724
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:10,165
I've known Dom a long time.

725
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:15,044
Most of it's been...

726
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,517
unpleasant.

727
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,135
Still, something happens when you've...

728
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:25,190
when you've known someone that long,

729
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:29,827
when, after all of life's
twists and turns...

730
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:35,012
...you look over and there they are,

731
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:37,400
still in it with you, still...

732
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:41,806
yours.

733
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:49,954
I'm sorry my questions caused all this.

734
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:55,126
But they are questions
I deserve answers to.

735
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,856
Maybe not now.

736
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,626
Now it's too dangerous.

737
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:07,055
But someday, I'm going to
insist on answers.

738
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:11,243
And you're going to
have to give them to me.

739
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:25,883
When he gets better, you
should bring Agnes to meet him.

740
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,697
Shoes, shoes, shoes!

741
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,966
If we don't leave here
in two minutes, Agnes,

742
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:44,202
you're definitely
gonna be late for the bell.

743
00:40:44,204 --> 00:40:46,271
Wait! My headband!

744
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:51,445
Ears or no ears?

745
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,711
Ears!

746
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,651
Mom, that's not Mrs. Monzewski, right?

747
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:03,321
Oh, my goodness! I love those ears!

748
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:05,056
Uh, hello.

749
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:07,525
I'm Liz. This is Agnes.

750
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,294
Maddy Tolliver. Your new neighbor.

751
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,963
It's funny. Mrs. Monzewski's
lived there forever.

752
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:13,884
I didn't know she was thinking of moving.

753
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:16,096
She didn't. I'm just subletting.

754
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,802
It all happened very quickly.

755
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:20,338
The woman who showed me
the apartment said something

756
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,640
about her going to Pittsburgh for a while

757
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:24,071
to be closer to her grandson.

758
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:25,677
You're pretty.

759
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,879
Thank you, sweetie! So are you!

760
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,981
You remind me of my granddaughter.

761
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:33,017
We have to run, but it was
nice meeting you.

762
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,385
So nice to meet you both.

763
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:36,728
I'm sure we'll be seeing
more of each other.

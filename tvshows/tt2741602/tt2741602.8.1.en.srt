1
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:12,706
Hello?

2
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,275
What?

3
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:16,177
I'll be right there.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,549
Excuse me, sir.
Your business?

5
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,051
Hotel Medical Services.

6
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,425
We received a call from a
guest with nausea and vomiting.

7
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:28,689
I've got a federal defendant
under house arrest.

8
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,865
We have orders to monitor
all activities on the floor.

9
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:34,027
Oh, this guest is a UN
investigator who thinks

10
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:36,663
he may have been exposed
to nuclear materials.

11
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,472
Hello?

12
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:51,412
Oh, my God.
He's on fire.

13
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:53,247
This guy's prodromal.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,981
So you're saying he was exposed?

15
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:56,817
He needs a hospital!

16
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,188
Agonal respirations.
Thready pulse.

17
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,789
You're gonna need to ventilate.

18
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,392
You coming? It's
contagious, right?

19
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,495
Yeah. Like the giggles.
If the giggles could kill you.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,198
We're in.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,074
Advertise your product or brand here

22
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,584
What the...
Who the hell are you?

23
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,094
I'm here to get you out.

24
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,096
Who sent you?
Coates? Bryson?

25
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:44,431
We need to go now.

26
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,032
I hope you're not
afraid of heights.

27
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:55,276
Step in.

28
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:58,089
EMI-shielding. So the feds won't
know we removed your ankle monitor.

29
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,356
So how do we get past the cops?

30
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,563
No one goes in or out of this
room until it's decontaminated.

31
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,565
Got it?

32
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,106
Hey! Hey!

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,845
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

34
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,252
Stop right there!

35
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,413
When did it happen? A
little over two hours ago.

36
00:02:58,425 --> 00:02:59,747
Two hours?
I didn't want to call you

37
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,174
until I knew the news was good.

38
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,509
It's good.
How good?

39
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:03,677
I think it's safe to say

40
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,812
he's back to his
same old chipper self.

41
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,815
Hello, Dom.
You've been outflanked.

42
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:10,150
Katarina's been

43
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:11,618
surprisingly formidable.

44
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,555
Ah, like France guarding
the Maginot Line

45
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,823
during the Blitzkrieg.

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,525
She still hasn't found
what she's after.

47
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,961
She captured
and nearly killed you.

48
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:22,896
She put me in a coma.

49
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:24,898
Anything else?

50
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:27,701
Or on the seventh day
did she rest?

51
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,002
You should rest.

52
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,004
So there is more.

53
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,006
The seizures are gone,
but the doctor says

54
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,207
keeping it that way

55
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:37,344
requires you to be
calm and rested.

56
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:39,513
It's Masha now,
isn't it?

57
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,351
She knows I'm not Ilya.

58
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,855
So, she knows I lied to her.

59
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,425
Elizabeth is here.

60
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:58,532
We want the same thing.

61
00:03:58,618 --> 00:03:59,933
With her help, we'll get it.

62
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,570
I want Masha's trust.
I had it.

63
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:06,573
Thanks to you, I
don't have it anymore.

64
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,016
How's the patient?

65
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:20,354
Tired. He just...
Needs more rest.

66
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,659
We have a case to discuss.

67
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,395
Roanoke? He makes
people disappear.

68
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:30,297
Like Maddy Tolliver.

69
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,539
Is that what
her banker told you?

70
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,866
She contracted him?

71
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:35,235
At her instruction,
the banker wired money

72
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:36,937
into a Philadelphia account

73
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,605
controlled by Roanoke.

74
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:41,708
Your tremors are gone.

75
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:44,378
They are.

76
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,714
But not the underlying
condition.

77
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:52,586
I need you to focus on
Roanoke, not on me.

78
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,488
Can you do that?

79
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,326
General Kony gave
combat-ready troops

80
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,594
the slip in Uganda.

81
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,929
Achemez Gochiyayev

82
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,566
killed 293 people
in the apartment bombings

83
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,234
that triggered
the Second Chechen War

84
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:09,636
and then was never seen again.

85
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:12,305
Both vanished,
escaped capture

86
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,640
with the assistance of a man

87
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,241
who calls himself Roanoke.

88
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,244
Roanoke. Like the lost colony
that mysteriously vanished.

89
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,914
Cute. We have a name?

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,283
We don't know his name
or location

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,185
or even if he's still alive.

92
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,855
Reddington says Roanoke was
thought to be dead or captured,

93
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,258
but a recent extraction in
Pennsylvania proves otherwise.

94
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,661
We believe this is Roanoke.

95
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,062
I know this guy.

96
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:37,931
He was arrested after 9/11

97
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,874
for getting Al-Qaeda
loyalists out of the country.

98
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,573
If he's in our system,
we must have an ID.

99
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,103
We have his prints,
his DNA.

100
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,972
We know he has a distinctive
scar on his right cheek.

101
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,108
What we don't have is a name.

102
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:51,578
The authorities at Qincheng
Prison got a series of aliases

103
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,480
but nothing authentic
before he escaped.

104
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,948
He escaped Qincheng?

105
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,841
Tell us about the
extraction in Pennsylvania.

106
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,951
Lev Pasternak.

107
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,986
Russian oligarch.

108
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,288
Disappeared from
a Philadelphia hotel room

109
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,325
where he was on house arrest
pending trial for murder.

110
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,435
Then let's get a team up
there to start looking for him.

111
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,771
You should know that the reason
Reddington gave us this case

112
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,500
is because the next person
Roanoke is supposed to disappear

113
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,301
is Maddy Tolliver.

114
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,138
What? Uh...
I thought she was dead.

115
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,873
Yeah, no.
She's not.

116
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,010
Why didn't you tell us?

117
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,179
Because she's also
not Maddy Tolliver.

118
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,281
She's my mother.

119
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,119
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, hang on a second.

120
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,022
The woman from
across the hall is your...

121
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:39,726
That means you got to spend time
with your mom after all these years.

122
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,962
Yeah, she was pretending
to be someone else

123
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,771
and trying to kill a lot of
people you care about,

124
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:44,965
but, still, that...

125
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,233
I mean, that must
have been, you know...

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,169
Uh, meaningful?

127
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,845
Does Reddington
understand he's asking you

128
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,405
to try and capture
your mother...

129
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:56,009
And if you do, she might
get the death penalty?

130
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,878
Yeah. I think he does.

131
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,847
And so do I.

132
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,383
Really?
Because Park's right.

133
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,197
Your mother's life
may hang in the balance.

134
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,318
And if we do this,

135
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:10,023
your allegiance
has to be to us, not her.

136
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:11,525
Can you promise me that?

137
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,394
Yes. I can.

138
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,062
Okay, then.

139
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,531
Roll out.

140
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:21,921
How could you tell him that?

141
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,436
Because it's the truth.

142
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:24,912
You're not gonna
tell your own mother

143
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,091
that we're hunting her down?

144
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,008
I don't have to.
She knows.

145
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,643
Wait, how?
Who told her?

146
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,579
She had the chance to keep
Reddington from meeting her banker,

147
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,780
and she didn't take it.

148
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,549
Why would she do that?

149
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,484
I have absolutely no idea.

150
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,086
Because it makes her
easier to be found.

151
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:50,396
Who's the mastermind
behind getting me out?

152
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:51,732
Roanoke.

153
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,735
Whoever that is, I'm gonna
make him filthy rich.

154
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,904
The only reward he wants
is for you to stand right there.

155
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,273
Okay. Sure.
What happens right here?

156
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:03,308
Oh, no. No.

157
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,687
I noticed it too late.

158
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,189
Two EMTs went in.
Three came out.

159
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,490
By the time I got down there,

160
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,059
Pasternak was in the ambulance.

161
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:20,702
Can you ID
the guys who took him?

162
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:22,495
ID 'em? I thought I shot 'em.

163
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:25,265
You didn't shoot anyone.
Maybe you missed.

164
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,434
Maybe. But I did two tours
in Afghanistan as a sniper.

165
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:29,603
I don't miss.

166
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,976
Aram just sent this over
from the hotel security feeds.

167
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,680
Ballistic glass.
Yeah. And armor-plated.

168
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,481
Look how low it rides.

169
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,483
An armor-plated ambulance.

170
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,097
I told you I don't miss.

171
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,589
Whoever did the retrofit
probably did it for Roanoke.

172
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:50,090
Could be he knows
how to find him.

173
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,725
I'll text the man in the hat.

174
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,601
If anyone knows who makes
armor-plated ambulances,

175
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,961
it's him.

176
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,671
What is the meaning of this?

177
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:05,885
W-Who do you think you are?

178
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,240
Fun fact...

179
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:10,476
Li Qing Yuen ate wolfberries

180
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,212
every day of his life

181
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:17,517
and was said to have lived
to the ripe old age of 256.

182
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:22,555
From 1677 to 1933.

183
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,358
Imagine!

184
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:29,495
He could have had dinner
with both Newton and Einstein.

185
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,197
Separately, of course.

186
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:36,002
Elizabeth texted something
about a custom armor-plate job.

187
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,605
Give her Eduardo's number
and tell her she may need

188
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:42,075
to incentivize dear Eddy
to get him to talk.

189
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,810
To immortality.

190
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,480
Ahh.

191
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,517
My associate spoke
to the doorman

192
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,219
on his way into your building.

193
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,722
And the doorman said
a downstairs apartment

194
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,024
recently sold for four-six.

195
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,926
And there's another
one on the market.

196
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,195
But I doubt the board will
approve your application.

197
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:05,398
I'm surprised
they approved yours.

198
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,734
Or did you fail
to mention your role

199
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,937
in helping Roanoke
escape captivity?

200
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,940
I suppose a lot of
Park Avenue apartments

201
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:15,842
are owned by your countrymen,

202
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,445
but I doubt any of them used to be
superintendent of a Chinese prison.

203
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:21,915
What do you want?

204
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,886
Ahh. What do I want?

205
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,255
Years ago,
I was in a taxi

206
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:33,259
on my way to a rendezvous
in Kowloon City.

207
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,929
This must have been
around '98, '99.

208
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,464
They'd just closed
Kai Tak Airport,

209
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,834
and everything
was going in and out

210
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,470
of the big, brand-new
Hong Kong International.

211
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,773
The place was gigundous.

212
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,076
Largest passenger terminal
in the world at the time.

213
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:52,713
I'd come in on a cargo flight,

214
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,482
and it was absolute madness
over there.

215
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,786
My ground transport had gotten
screwed up, so I grabbed a taxi.

216
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,062
I was running about an hour late

217
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,456
and was a little out of sorts,

218
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,029
so I'm sure
I put the driver on edge,

219
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,193
although he seemed
pretty unflappable,

220
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,329
and he had a hell
of a heavy foot.

221
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,665
Anyway, we're doing
our best. Traffic is terrible.

222
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,367
The guy's bobbing and weaving,

223
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,137
and I'm trying to relax
with one eye on the clock.

224
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:22,308
Meanwhile, Jerzy's been sitting
at the Lucky Duck for 45 minutes,

225
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,945
so given his usual
15 minutes a drink,

226
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:29,015
Jerzy's just finished his third gin
and tonic with a fourth on the way.

227
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,451
Now, I think the world
and all of Jerzy,

228
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,954
but at his best,
he's a bit stroppy,

229
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,322
and after four or five G&Ts,

230
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,691
he's starting to look around
for someone to mess with.

231
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,761
So I'm feeling a little...

232
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,064
Vulnerable.

233
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,332
I'm looking out the window.
We're stopped at a light.

234
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:50,136
And all of a sudden,

235
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:52,038
right there in the middle
of the intersection

236
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,907
is this scrawny little cat.

237
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,042
A kitten, really.

238
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:00,680
Crying, meowing, scared to
death, and traffic everywhere.

239
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,282
I mean everywhere.

240
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:03,817
Four lanes.

241
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,151
And I just...

242
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,056
And then the cat looked at me.

243
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,827
Stopped crying.
Closed its mouth.

244
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:14,960
Blinked.

245
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,164
And just stared at me.

246
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:20,967
Like...

247
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,873
Like it knew me.

248
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,878
It took a couple
of steps forward.

249
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:34,180
I started to open the door.

250
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,549
And phooph...
The taxi took off.

251
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:37,784
And there we went.

252
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,988
And there went the cat.

253
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:50,696
Jerzy was fine.

254
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,665
Drunk. Angry.

255
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,702
But he was fine.

256
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,474
Ahh.

257
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,209
What do I want?

258
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,446
I want that cat.

259
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,583
And Roanoke.

260
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,997
I wish I could help, but he
didn't say where he was going.

261
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,087
A name then.

262
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,189
I don't know his name.

263
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:17,590
The name you provided him with.

264
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,492
The passport.
The driver's license.

265
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:20,793
I want that name.

266
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:23,596
And the cat.

267
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,734
Santiago Vega.

268
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,477
A name he may
or may not be using.

269
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,938
And you don't know where he is.

270
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,639
Not yet. But I will.

271
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:37,210
Heddie, I need you to reach
out to your contacts at the IRS,

272
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,980
dig into his financials,
see if you can help us

273
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,447
track this guy down.

274
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:44,150
All right. I'll talk to my
people and circle back.

275
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,651
Even if he's using an alias,

276
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,988
sooner or later, the IRS
is gonna find him.

277
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,856
Like Joe Louis to Billy Conn,

278
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,958
"You can run,
but you can't hide."

279
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:55,061
The Brown Bomber. I look for
him in my dreams every night.

280
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,663
Don't worry, Raymond.
I'm on it.

281
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,636
Eduardo Martinez?

282
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,372
Can I help you?

283
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,441
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.

284
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,444
We're looking for a man
who customized an ambulance.

285
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,013
I'd have to check my records.

286
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,781
That's a pretty heavy door.
Armor-plated?

287
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,284
Yes. A custom job
for a Thai executive.

288
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,054
The ambulance we're talking
about was armor-plated.

289
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,688
Like I say,
I have to check.

290
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,357
You do that.
And we will, too.

291
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,859
Make sure all your, uh,
work visas are in order.

292
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,029
Hey. I-I pay my taxes.

293
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,704
And you employ a lot of people.

294
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,933
Look. We don't wanna mess
with that. And we won't...

295
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,235
If you tell us who hired you

296
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:38,438
to armor-plate that ambulance
and where to find him.

297
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:41,174
There's a warehouse.
3rd and Windham.

298
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,954
These are the plans for the
hotel where they took Pasternak.

299
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,322
Roanoke was definitely here.

300
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,425
Which means we're one step
closer to finding him,

301
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:02,128
and Reddington's one step
closer to finding my mother.

302
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,570
Well, you said
she wanted her banker

303
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:05,231
to tell Reddington
about Roanoke.

304
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,233
Okay, but how did she know.

305
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,887
Reddington was meeting
with her banker?

306
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:09,969
Who tipped her off?

307
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,471
It was you, wasn't it?

308
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,173
Yeah. I warned her.

309
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,841
But she ignored your warning.
Why would she do that?

310
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,043
I don't know.

311
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,312
So you have picked
a side. Hers.

312
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,646
Over his. Yeah.

313
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,115
And over ours?

314
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:23,683
What do you mean?

315
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,856
You told Cooper that we
have your allegiance. Do we?

316
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,258
Keen. Do we have
your allegiance or not?

317
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,734
You lied to me.

318
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,070
You told me Roanoke
was your escape plan.

319
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,039
He is.

320
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,175
Then why is he surveilling the warehouse
where my grandfather's being kept?

321
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,211
The only way I can be safe

322
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,413
is if Dom tells me
everything I need to know,

323
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,722
and that won't happen unless I
get him away from Reddington.

324
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,916
Roanoke can do that.

325
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,384
Abduct my grandfather.
Yes.

326
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,387
So your mother can survive.

327
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,392
I think it's time
you tell me everything.

328
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:16,569
Let's start with Dom and
why you want to abduct him.

329
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:19,005
All you can see is
what I want to do to him.

330
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:22,775
What I want you to see
is what he did to me.

331
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,477
In the West,
you tell your young men

332
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:27,380
to stand up for their country.

333
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:31,051
In Russia, young women were
told to lay down with the enemy.

334
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,418
That's how you showed loyalty.

335
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,588
As the daughter of
a domineering spy master,

336
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:37,457
I never had a voice
in my future.

337
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,593
I was 15 the first time
they ordered me

338
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,428
to sleep with a young
American soldier.

339
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,837
Dom was the man who ordered me.

340
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,735
That's awful.
I'm so sorry.

341
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:52,738
One reason I gave up
my little girl,

342
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:57,277
arranged for you to
grow up in this country,

343
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,811
was to spare you my fate.

344
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,147
And because
you had to disappear.

345
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,648
Which I never could have done,

346
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,017
or would have done,

347
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:06,519
if you weren't safe.

348
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,057
And you were safe, Masha.

349
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,661
Until that man who calls
himself Raymond Reddington

350
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,530
pulled you into the middle
of everything

351
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,965
I was protecting you from.

352
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:21,367
I don't know who Reddington is,

353
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,002
but I know he betrayed me.

354
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,871
Reddington, along with
my father and my best friend.

355
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,808
The secrets you're looking for?

356
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:31,244
They tried to murder me
to bury them.

357
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,246
What secret could be so powerful

358
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,715
that a father would be willing
to murder his own daughter?

359
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,853
What do you know about N-13?

360
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,257
N-13? I don't know
what that is.

361
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,025
Not a what.
A who.

362
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:47,893
N-13 is an operative.

363
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,463
The "N" stands for
"neopoznanny,"

364
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,465
the Russian word
for "unidentified."

365
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:56,236
13 represents the 13 packets
of intel he stole

366
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,703
from Lubyanka Square in 1990.

367
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,505
You're talking about a KGB mole?

368
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,874
One whose identity
remains unknown.

369
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,344
A turncoat who was
never proven to exist.

370
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,712
Thirty years of hunting,
and still no one knows.

371
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,815
N-13 is still active?
Depending on who you ask.

372
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:13,386
The CIA, MSS,
MI5, the Mossad,

373
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,455
all believe he continues
to cypher

374
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,223
some of their
most damaging intel.

375
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,591
From other governments?

376
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,092
Why? To what end?

377
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,027
To build a compromising file.

378
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,929
The Sikorsky Archive.

379
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,931
You said it's a blackmail file.

380
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:29,469
One that started with 13 intel
packets over 30 years ago

381
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,437
and has been evolving
ever since.

382
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,439
That's why there was
a bounty on your head.

383
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,573
Yes.

384
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:37,443
Because Dom set me up.

385
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,080
He leaked to the KGB
that I was N-13,

386
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,254
that the dossier Ilya asked
me to deliver that night

387
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,550
was the elusive Archive.

388
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,386
They framed you.

389
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,562
And tried to murder me
before the truth could be known.

390
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,656
Why? Who were they
protecting?

391
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,558
What?

392
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,527
You think Reddington is N-13?

393
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,529
Or Dom.
Or both.

394
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,631
I believe Dom framed me

395
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,833
so everyone would
stop looking for N-13.

396
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,171
Had I died that night,
they would have.

397
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,608
But you didn't.

398
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,276
That's why you're
still on the run.

399
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,546
Wrongly accused.

400
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,182
Hunted for a crime
I didn't commit.

401
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:17,650
So N-13...

402
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,953
Reddington... Is a mole.

403
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:26,559
Who has manipulated you to
gain access to top U.S. intelligence.

404
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,462
Masha, Reddington
didn't choose you.

405
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,497
He needed you.

406
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,467
He traded on the questions
you have about your past

407
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:35,868
to gain immunity.

408
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,803
He gives you criminals,
and in exchange,

409
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,440
he learns the names of
every high-level official

410
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,008
working in American justice,

411
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:45,077
law enforcement,
and intelligence.

412
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,312
So this whole time.

413
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,547
Reddington's been using me,

414
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,114
the Task Force

415
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:51,984
has been this Trojan horse

416
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,754
he's been using to
obtain classified intel.

417
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,822
A father figure is
trying to manipulate you

418
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:58,624
the way my father
manipulated me.

419
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:01,494
Dom is lying about me.

420
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,628
I am not N-13.

421
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,129
I do not have the Archive.

422
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:06,131
But unless I get him
to tell me who does,

423
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,200
to give me proof that
I can show the world,

424
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:10,835
I will be killed.

425
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,173
I get it now.

426
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,442
Why you let your banker
meet with Reddington.

427
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,245
Why you wanted Reddington
to have us chase after Roanoke.

428
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:23,215
So we would find the
warehouse, find the photo.

429
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,685
Warn Reddington that
you are going after Dom,

430
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:29,289
while he's convalescing
in a well-guarded warehouse.

431
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,023
But if they think
it's under attack...

432
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,726
Reddington will move Dom,
and while he's being moved...

433
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,060
He's a soft target.

434
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,430
That's quite a plan.

435
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,865
And it could work.

436
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:43,135
It almost has worked
in every way except one.

437
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,674
The FBI didn't find
that photo. I did.

438
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,178
Which means my fate
is in your hands.

439
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,448
As well as my grandfather's.

440
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:57,082
And Reddington.

441
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,419
Someone who killed
the man who raised you,

442
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:00,761
who's responsible for the death

443
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:01,821
of the man you loved,

444
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:04,089
and who is so manipulative,

445
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,527
he was willing to let you
believe he was your father.

446
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,566
You wanted the truth.

447
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:16,936
I've given it to you.

448
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,707
It's up to you
what you do with it.

449
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,166
And I'm supposed to believe you?

450
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:42,962
Of course not.

451
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,431
I'm a criminal.
Criminals are notorious liars.

452
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:47,533
Everything about me
is a lie.  Why me?

453
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,868
I wish the answer

454
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,670
were as simple
as the question seems.

455
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,304
Are you my father?

456
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,639
No.

457
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,817
Hey. Thanks
for calling me back.

458
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,352
I need to talk to you.

459
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,355
No. In person.

460
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,164
We have a break in the case.

461
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:23,936
Tell me.

462
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:26,939
I will. But I need you
to tell me something first.

463
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,776
When my mother abducted you
in Paris, what did she want?

464
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,779
From you.
Dom. Dembe.

465
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,681
She's been on a rampage.
I want to know why.

466
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,821
He's a tough old bear.

467
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,759
I know you're angry with him,
but for what it's worth,

468
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:49,128
you inherited the best of him.

469
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:53,198
That's it.
That's your non-answer.

470
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:55,968
I've given you my answer
every time you've asked.

471
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:59,839
That you don't lie,
you just withhold.

472
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,775
That I have things that are mine

473
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:04,977
and no one else's.

474
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,215
So, what's the break
in the case?

475
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:17,189
I found this at Roanoke's
last known location.

476
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,725
Dom is his next target.
Her next target.

477
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,199
Dom.

478
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:28,400
I can't lose him.

479
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,203
Not like this.

480
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,206
She's quite determined.

481
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:36,876
You'll have to be, as well.

482
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,422
You okay?

483
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:54,292
No. I'm not.

484
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,864
I realized my mother
can't be trusted.

485
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,067
Are you to be trusted?

486
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:04,336
Yes.

487
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,574
Good. I'm glad.

488
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:11,477
And a little curious. What
did you find out about her?

489
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,080
My mother's not using
Roanoke to get away.

490
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,583
She's using him to get
to my grandfather, Dominic.

491
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,951
What proof do you have?

492
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:22,254
I found this where Roanoke
planned his last job.

493
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,264
It's the building where my
grandfather's being treated.

494
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:26,191
Your grandfather.
So, wait. Are you saying

495
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,845
your mother's target
is her own father?

496
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,995
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's a long story.

497
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,731
That she hired Roanoke
to abduct him?

498
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,904
She's looking for something.

499
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,542
Scorching and burning
anything that stands

500
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:36,869
between her and getting it.

501
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:38,103
Including her father.

502
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,437
Have you spoken to Reddington?

503
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:41,741
Yes. He agrees.
Her next target is Dom,

504
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,234
and she could attack
at any minute.

505
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:45,444
He wants to move Dom
to a new safe house.

506
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:48,948
I offered one of the plain-wrap
medical vans from the FBI fleet.

507
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,921
Done. We'll
coordinate with Reddington.

508
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,158
Put a TAC team in the warehouse.

509
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,719
Once we get Dom out,
we'll be ready

510
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,287
for Roanoke to walk
into our trap.

511
00:24:58,376 --> 00:24:59,700
Where are you on Santiago?

512
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:00,860
In San Juan.

513
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,094
Puerto Rico?
Mm-hmm.

514
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,395
Short story long,

515
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:06,498
I was able to use
the IRS to identify

516
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,734
fourteen Santiago Vegas.

517
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:11,270
Seven were deceased.
Two were minors.

518
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,940
And one has a current
address in San Juan,

519
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:19,111
and, according to an old photo
in the local newspaper,

520
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:22,181
he's got the same exact scar
on the right side of his face.

521
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,684
I have a contact in Bayamon.
We'll organize a team.

522
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,186
No need.
I just spoke to his sister.

523
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:30,522
I was gonna tell her that
her brother has a tax refund.

524
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,858
Heddie. The man's hiding
in Puerto Rico to hide.

525
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:35,060
He's certainly not going
to come out of hiding

526
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,362
to claim a refund
on taxes he never paid.

527
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:40,299
That's what Tony said, which
is why I went with his idea,

528
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,803
and I told her I'm with
the Mail Recovery Center,

529
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,245
which is just
a fancy way of saying...

530
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:46,906
The Dead Letter Office.

531
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:49,208
Right. I told her
that I have a package

532
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,011
that's been searching for him
for over four years,

533
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,046
but that only he can
take possession

534
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,682
and that he had to sign himself.

535
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:58,618
Told me Vega was shacked up

536
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,921
in some resort
on Parque Isla Verde.

537
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,488
I'm following her there now.

538
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:06,859
Neither snow nor rain nor heat
nor gloom of night.

539
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:07,992
Bless you, Heddie.

540
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,528
Call me when you know more.

541
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,041
Four flat-free tires.
As ordered.

542
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,484
And the name of a guy who will
be able to expedite a work visa,

543
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:25,745
as requested.

544
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,512
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

545
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,714
No one's the wiser.

546
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:30,048
It's like you were never here.

547
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:36,588
I got it, I got it.
Leave me alone.

548
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,590
I might've known.

549
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,993
The minute you tell me I'm safe,

550
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,729
the candy stripers go on attack.

551
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:46,732
I should've crawled out of
here the moment I woke up.

552
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,068
I assure you
the situation's in hand.

553
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:51,804
But sometimes plans
require changing.

554
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,739
Just like your bedsheets.

555
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,779
I don't like this. He's
in a very fragile state.

556
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,552
His life depends on...
His life depends on

557
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:04,950
staying alive. That means
getting him out of here.

558
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:08,754
So, please, just try and
do your job as best you can

559
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,255
without making mine
more difficult.

560
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:11,857
I've got him for that.

561
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,503
We've uplinked the
CCTV feeds in the area

562
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:18,739
and got the snipers on the roof.

563
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,232
All right.
I want to be informed

564
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:21,675
the minute you have
Roanoke in custody.

565
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,568
You and Ressler will
take point on the escort.

566
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,045
Raymond and I will be
in the follow car.

567
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,906
- Copy that.
- I'm sorry.

568
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,182
I have to be the one behind
the wheel of that transport van.

569
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:33,645
Why? Is this some sort
of FBI insurance thing?

570
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:37,516
More like "an FBI agent demanding
to protect her grandfather" thing.

571
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:39,451
Uh-huh.

572
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,653
We'll go check the vehicles.

573
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:51,630
You're angry with me,
and I don't blame you.

574
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:54,166
I misled you.

575
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,467
I'm used to it.

576
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:59,638
I know you have questions.

577
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:02,775
You know what, Dom? I really
only ever had one question.

578
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,409
Why?

579
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,278
If he's not my father,
then why me?

580
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,948
I asked you,
and you told me

581
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,482
his real identity
was Ilya Koslov,

582
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,650
which it is not.

583
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:12,818
Another lie.

584
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:14,820
Are you really telling me

585
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,790
you're ready to dive
into the truth now?

586
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:21,861
I'm in...

587
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:24,830
An impossible situation.

588
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,119
Yeah, that's about
what I thought.

589
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:31,170
Okay, guys and gals.

590
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,773
Can we please load
the patient into the van?

591
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,041
We're frittering away time here.

592
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,510
We're all set.
TAC Team's on standby.

593
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:41,046
Soon as you roll out, cameras
go up and we lay in wait.

594
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,548
When Roanoke strikes,
we'll be ready.

595
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:46,718
Don't look so disgruntled,
Agent Fredrick.

596
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,287
I don't bite.

597
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,355
Unless you ever utter my name.

598
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,557
In which case,
I'll gut you like a fish

599
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,026
and feed you to the lobsters.

600
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:57,796
Good pep talk.

601
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,066
What's our destination?

602
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,203
I've secured a lodge
on Deep Creek Lake.

603
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:08,173
High on a bluff, easy to
defend. Views for miles.

604
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,775
And the route?

605
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:12,544
We'll take back roads to 135,

606
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,637
then it's a straight shot
all the way to the lake.

607
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,082
- You get that?
- Yes.

608
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,225
I can't believe she's actually
going through with this.

609
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,724
How did you get her
to wear the wire?

610
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,556
A daughter's need
for her mother's approval

611
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:27,359
is nature's most powerful force.

612
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:31,596
Move your team out.

613
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:04,695
What is it, Raymond?

614
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:09,134
Just thinking.
About?

615
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:13,238
Roanoke's extractions
are all inside jobs.

616
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:18,143
He succeeds by putting
his people on the inside,

617
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,381
or buying the loyalty
of those already there.

618
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,990
Do you believe he may have
turned one of our men?

619
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:25,250
No.

620
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:27,686
They know the consequences
of betrayal.

621
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:33,258
Still. It's... troubling.

622
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:39,231
Can't stay angry forever,
you know.

623
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,599
I'm not so sure about that.

624
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,201
I only misled you

625
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:44,369
because I wanted you
to have some resolution.

626
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:45,604
It didn't help.

627
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,973
Yeah. Well, I tried.

628
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,107
No. You lied.

629
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,350
You made up an elaborate story.

630
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:52,244
It wasn't all a story.

631
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,247
Enough of it was
because not you,

632
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,782
nor Ilya Koslov,
nor Raymond Reddington

633
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,484
want me to know what you know.

634
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:00,685
Well, guess what,

635
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:01,820
I know.

636
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,022
I know enough.

637
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:04,656
And I'm gonna prove it.

638
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,867
- Sitrep on the convoy?
- Transport is moving

639
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:10,495
unimpeded west through
Catharpin on highway 234.

640
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:13,232
What's this? The truck approaching
Reddington's warehouse.

641
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,208
Running the plates now.
Team Bravo, you have eyes?

642
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,535
That's affirmative.

643
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,044
Hold your position until we
know what we're dealing with.

644
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,504
What's going on, Masha?

645
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:22,041
Just enjoy the ride,
try and relax.

646
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:24,109
Stop telling me to relax.

647
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:26,145
What's going on?
What're you up to?

648
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,316
Okay, that dumpster is valid.

649
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,818
It's part of the DPW
fleet. Ward five.

650
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,155
Bravo Team, stand down.
We're clear on the vehicle.

651
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,322
All quiet here.

652
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,291
Yeah. Too quiet.

653
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:40,859
I don't like this.

654
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:41,993
What are we missing?

655
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,840
Santiago?
It's me. Lana.

656
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:58,843
We brought you some mail.
Thought it might be fun for you.

657
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,446
Boss, hey,
we got a problem.

658
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,748
What is it?
Vega.

659
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,684
I found him,
but it's not good.

660
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,519
He's sick, Raymond.
Real sick.

661
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:09,488
Dementia.
Parkinson's.

662
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,923
Whoever pulled that job,
whoever's looking for Dom,

663
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,258
it ain't Vega.

664
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:14,559
Somebody's playing you.

665
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,537
Soon as you got behind the wheel

666
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,298
I thought you were
up to something.

667
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:20,932
I gave you a chance, Dom.

668
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,767
Just like I gave
Reddington chances.

669
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:24,736
I gave him seven years
worth of chances.

670
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,739
I had good reasons for
telling you what I told you.

671
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,874
Oh, so help me God, if
another person in my life

672
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:31,943
tells me they lied to me
for my own protection.

673
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,079
You don't understand
the position I'm in.

674
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,780
You're right.
I don't.

675
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,183
Whatever you're doing,
don't...

676
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,236
His heart rate's climbing.

677
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,797
Please, stop.
We have to keep him calm.

678
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,742
Yeah.

679
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,977
It's a set-up. We need
to get off this highway.

680
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:08,947
There's a turnoff on the
right about a half a mile ahead.

681
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,482
I'll be gone by then.

682
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,916
But don't worry.

683
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:13,051
Dom will be safe.

684
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:15,420
She promised me that much.

685
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:18,190
Elizabeth.
What have you done?

686
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,690
Everything
will be okay. Just breathe.

687
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:58,063
So we've been conned.

688
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,531
Us and Mr. Reddington.

689
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,633
But not Keen. She did
the con. She and Katarina.

690
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,926
Well, it all makes sense now.

691
00:34:02,954 --> 00:34:04,303
Why Katarina wanted Reddington

692
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,076
to think that she was
going after Roanoke.

693
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,713
Why she wanted him
put on the Blacklist.

694
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:09,208
Except there is no Roanoke.

695
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:11,476
Just the shell of a man
living in hospice.

696
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,490
Katarina couldn't hire him,
so she imitated him.

697
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,780
Had her people
abduct Lev Pasternak,

698
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,423
then leave breadcrumbs
to make Reddington believe

699
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:18,883
it was the work of Roanoke.

700
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,893
She wanted us to believe
that he was still active,

701
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:23,488
that she had hired him to get
Dom out of that warehouse.

702
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:25,422
Which was a tactic
designed to scare us,

703
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:27,392
which only made him
more vulnerable.

704
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,495
So, you know,
kudos to us.

705
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,836
We need to find them, Harold.

706
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,505
I'm searching in my world.
You need to search in yours.

707
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:41,840
They must be found.

708
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,675
Elizabeth doesn't
want to be found.

709
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,976
By either of us.

710
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,419
Forgive me,
but at the moment

711
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,580
I'm not interested
in what she wants.

712
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,715
At the moment, or ever?

713
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,784
All Agent Keen wanted
from you were answers,

714
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,686
about her past, her parents.

715
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:56,455
And you refused to give them.

716
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:59,691
What I have given her
is an education.

717
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:02,261
On how people think.

718
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:03,562
What they want.

719
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,899
And what they're
willing to do to get it.

720
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:09,434
We'll find her.

721
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:13,438
But not so she can
continue her "education."

722
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,840
We'll do it because
we're concerned about her

723
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,909
and because she broke the law.

724
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:20,245
I'm angry with Agent Keen,
but I'm livid with you.

725
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:27,486
Seven years ago she was kind,
enthusiastic, decent.

726
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,322
Under your tutelage she's
become someone I fail to recognize.

727
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,623
Oh, I think you do.

728
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,760
You may not want to.

729
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:39,731
You and I both may
not like what it looks like.

730
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:42,066
But we both recognize it
for what it is...

731
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,570
Her destiny.

732
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:50,475
We will get her back.

733
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:51,910
We, not you.

734
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,278
What are you saying, Harold?

735
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:55,414
This is an internal matter now.

736
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,827
Your assistance is not required.

737
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:01,753
It may not be welcome, but
it is most definitely required.

738
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,731
Forgive me
for not seeing you out,

739
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,326
but I need to address my team.

740
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,594
Don't be cheeky, Harold.
You've never seen me out.

741
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,505
A manhunt.
For Agent Keen.

742
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,708
With all due respect, sir, isn't
this a bit of an overreaction?

743
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:25,544
- To abduction.
- Of her grandfather.

744
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,846
A lying,
deceitful KGB goon.

745
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,689
I must've missed the part
in the criminal code

746
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,116
that says we only care
when nice people are taken.

747
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,785
I get it.
You don't want to do it.

748
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:35,119
I don't wanna do it either.

749
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:37,021
But Agent Keen
has betrayed this agency

750
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:39,358
as well as everyone
in this room.

751
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:42,527
She is responsible for the
abduction of Dominic Wilkinson

752
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,270
and is now in league
with Katarina Rostova,

753
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:47,266
who may be her mother,
but is also a wanted fugitive.

754
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:50,134
They don't need jail time.
They need family therapy.

755
00:36:50,222 --> 00:36:52,589
I mean, shouldn't we wait
for her to reach out to us first?

756
00:36:54,992 --> 00:36:56,816
Sorry. Of course we'll do
what you tell us, sir.

757
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,042
But personally?

758
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,644
This feels wrong.

759
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:04,015
I suspect we all feel
the same way.

760
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:06,651
But we have a job to do,
so, let's go do it.

761
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,611
What do you want?
Time.

762
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:34,413
To figure things out.

763
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,080
A favor.
That's what you want.

764
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:39,518
After lying to my face
you expect a favor.

765
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,720
I didn't know why she
wanted us to go after Roanoke.

766
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:45,097
You have no reason to
believe me, but it's true.

767
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:47,191
And Dom.

768
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:48,893
She needs to talk to him.

769
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,529
She's gonna torture him.

770
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,564
Bleed him like she
bled Reddington.

771
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,865
Are you okay with that?

772
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,600
I would not let that happen.

773
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:57,902
I want answers.

774
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,405
You sabotaged
an FBI investigation.

775
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:03,708
And you shot the man
responsible for your father's death.

776
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:06,311
I guess family just has a way
of bringing out the worst in us.

777
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,447
No. This is different
and you know that.

778
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:11,249
I was a teenager.
I didn't have anyone to go to.

779
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,385
But you do.

780
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,420
Liz, come in with me.

781
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,121
We'll talk to Cooper.
I'll back you,

782
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,557
no matter what comes.

783
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,353
You saying that...

784
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:26,598
That means the world to me.

785
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:30,469
It does,

786
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:31,936
but I know things now.

787
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,638
Things I need Dom to confirm

788
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,274
about the Sikorsky Archive
and N-13.

789
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,343
N-13?
I need time.

790
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,111
Katarina needs time.

791
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,346
Not to hurt Dom,

792
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,448
to convince him
to tell us what he knows.

793
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,750
What Reddington knows
and refuses to tell me.

794
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:50,722
Yes, I need a favor,
but I need it.

795
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:55,727
And I need you
to keep believing in me.

796
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:14,779
I won't give up on you.

797
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:18,016
But I still need
to do my job, Keen.

798
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,319
I know you do.

799
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,158
Damn it.

800
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,795
You didn't trust me
when we first met.

801
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,066
We've come so far

802
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:37,001
just to end up
right where we started.

803
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:46,209
That's right... Keen.

804
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:48,279
K-E-E-N.

805
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:52,517
First name's Elizabeth.

806
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:20,378
I just spoke
to Dr. Clemons.

807
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,792
They reached the new safe house.

808
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,584
Dom is stable
and resting peacefully.

809
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,695
You did the right thing.

810
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,098
Yeah, it doesn't feel that way.

811
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,214
I just walked away
from the only friends I have.

812
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:53,678
You did what you did
to protect them. And me.

813
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:54,879
And yourself.

814
00:40:58,536 --> 00:40:59,884
Dom.

815
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:02,086
We're not gonna hurt him.

816
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,388
Neither of us want that.

817
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,592
So how are you gonna
get him to talk?

818
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,893
I'm not.

819
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:11,462
You are.

820
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:27,912
Raymond?

821
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,693
I lost her, Dembe.

822
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,628
We lost her.

823
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,667
I lost her.

824
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:49,968
We knew this day might come.

825
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:53,104
We talked about it.

826
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:56,808
This was always a possibility.

827
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,944
Yeah. I knew, but...

828
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:07,151
And I let it happen anyway.

829
00:42:08,305 --> 00:43:08,600

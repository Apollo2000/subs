1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,271
Previously on The Blacklist...

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,672
I found something.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,807
A fingerprint on the corner
of the imam's desk.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,942
Belongs to a man who's been
in prison for 15 years.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,444
Arturo Ruel.

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,513
- About my chart.
- I didn't look at it.

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,914
I'd appreciate
if you didn't mention

8
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,483
anything about it to Elizabeth.

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,185
Who are you?

10
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,188
How about you let me ask
the questions?

11
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,289
Raymond!

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,841
Why do you
trust the words
of men so faithfully.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,644
They weren't mere men.
They were prophets.

14
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,113
They gave us the word of Allah.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,182
How do you know Allah
has anything to do

16
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,184
with what's in that book?

17
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,452
Faith.

18
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm also a person of faith.

19
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,024
I have faith in myself.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,694
Faith in false prophets

21
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,663
is worse than no faith at all.

22
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,800
We're both innocents

23
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,204
caught in someone else's
web of deceit.

24
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,772
Raymond Reddington's.

25
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,108
How could you know that?

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,245
The same way I know who you are.

27
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,580
Dembe.

28
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,081
You're his father confessor.

29
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:24,418
Which is why I will
never betray his confidence.

30
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,019
Even to save my life.

31
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,424
I don't know how to do that.

32
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,560
No. But Dembe does.

33
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,163
And if he's confided
in you...
I am bound to secrecy.

34
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,599
Even if it kills me.
That's what your
faith requires?

35
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,735
My faith requires me
to pray for you.

36
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,838
Your faith is a death sentence!

37
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,608
Why should I honor your faith
if it doesn't honor me?

38
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,479
You honor faith because
without it, you are lost.

39
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,418
Is Dembe faithful?

40
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,754
He is.

41
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,624
I wonder.

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,961
Clearly the prospect of my death

43
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,263
doesn't shake your faith.

44
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,372
How about we see
if the prospect
of yours shakes his.

45
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,811
Why don't you pray on that?

46
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,824
Vitals are... okay.

47
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,493
Pulse.

48
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,464
You need an MRI
as well as a CT-scan.

49
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,472
Raymond.

50
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,307
Hey. Are you listening?

51
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,710
Maybe you can get him
to listen to reason.

52
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,546
That's unlikely, but I will try.

53
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,282
Try hard.
His life depends on it.

54
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,692
What?
Everyone knows
wine is dehydrating.

55
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,294
If you won't get help
for yourself...

56
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,162
Sakiya.
Did she find something?

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,298
Then get it
for the people
who love you.

58
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,933
Does she have a lead?

59
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,503
She does.
But it makes no sense.

60
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,973
We were wrong.
I was wrong.

61
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,810
Imam Asmal
was not abducted
by extremists

62
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,680
or because he's involved
with extremists.

63
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:37,217
Dembe knew that,
and I ignored his counsel.

64
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:41,389
I can only hope that won't
prove to be a fatal mistake.

65
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,956
You say you have a lead.

66
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,427
One of my cleaners
went back over the scene
of the abduction,

67
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,496
and she lifted DNA

68
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,500
from a fingerprint she found
on the imam's desk.

69
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,735
Aram, if you would be so kind.

70
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,205
Meet Arturo Ruel.

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,775
His resume includes
two stints at Wallens

72
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:06,447
for carrying out
targeted kidnappings
in the US and Mexico.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,048
What's his connection
to the imam?

74
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,283
None.

75
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,219
We can circle back to the why
after we figure out the how.

76
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,522
The two stretches at Wallens?

77
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,256
He's doing one of them
right now.

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,060
Ruel is in prison.
In complete isolation.

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,365
It does provide us
with quite an engaging riddle.

80
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,734
Maybe the print
was planted to throw us off.

81
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,602
Why plant a print
that belongs to a man

82
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,103
who has an ironclad alibi?

83
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,973
Yes, I love
a good locked-door mystery!

84
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,577
Where the victim
is killed inside a room
no one has access to.

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,711
This is one better.

86
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,080
The criminal is inside a room
no one can get out of.

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,182
Ressler, Keen,
get over to Wallens.

88
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,417
I'll reach out to the warden,

89
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,952
let him know you're coming
to speak with Ruel.

90
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,087
I'd like a list
of all the prisoners

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,358
who have been housed there
in the last six months.

92
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,260
Ruel may not have
had a connection
to Imam Asmal,

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,995
but perhaps someone else does.

94
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:56,930
Consider it done.

95
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,667
How is this even possible?

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,234
That's exactly what
we're trying
to figure out.

97
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,537
And you're sure
it's his DNA?
Without a doubt.

98
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,674
Arturo Ruel has spent the last
three years in isolation.

99
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:10,010
He's 23/7. He don't talk,
he don't see the sun,

100
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,412
he's like a vampire.

101
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,781
His DNA would suggest otherwise.

102
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,848
Maybe he was framed.

103
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,650
For all we know,
he morphed into a bat

104
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,951
and he flew to the crime scene,

105
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,453
but we're not
gonna know for sure

106
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,455
until we talk to Ruel himself.

107
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,956
Well, then, by all means,

108
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,258
let's go get
the little critter
out of his cave.

109
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,298
Mr. Ruel, thank you
for agreeing to speak with us.

110
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,567
Who says I'm talking?

111
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,969
I'm here for the view.

112
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,972
Yeah, I know I'm pretty,
but you're not my type.

113
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,941
So how about you tell us
why we found your print

114
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,143
at a crime scene
less than 48 hours ago?

115
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,045
Don't know.
What'd I do?

116
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,047
I don't think you did anything.

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,417
I think you were
in that little
concrete box of yours.

118
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,718
So I'm free to go, no?

119
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,352
You're free
to be charged
with kidnapping.

120
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,488
And depending on
where the victim is,

121
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,323
and what condition he's in,
you could be looking at

122
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,726
anything from assault
to murder by the time
we're through.

123
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,894
Oh... Well,
put it on my tab.

124
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,697
So why don't
you just tell us
who set you up?

125
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,400
May I?

126
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,472
Tell you what.

127
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,708
This is my agent in Tepito.

128
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,444
Call and ask why his cartel

129
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,713
is letting me rot here
in the States.

130
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,682
Once he answers that,

131
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,484
well, I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know

132
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,854
about my prints and wherever
you think they were found.

133
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,523
But until then, well...

134
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,428
tuck tail and go.

135
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,503
He can laugh all he wants,
but the kid's gonna help us.

136
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,438
Why do you say that?

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,876
It seems like our friend Ruel

138
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,611
knows how to get
through a locked door.

139
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,949
Trial started two weeks ago.

140
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,285
I thought our people
would have it taken
care of by now.

141
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,120
Tell me about the girl.

142
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,155
Case rests on her testimony.

143
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,858
She saw it happen.

144
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,094
State plans to call her up
first thing Monday.

145
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,697
Not enough time.
I understand that.

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,198
And I was under
the impression that we could

147
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,500
handle this on our own,

148
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,934
but that's not the case.

149
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,604
This lady, her testimony,

150
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,972
it's about a lot more
than a murder.

151
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,241
Who's the kid?
Collateral damage.

152
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,309
They're keeping the two of them

153
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,611
at a federal safe house.

154
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,045
Heavily guarded.

155
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,680
It's too fast.

156
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,215
Which is why I came to you.

157
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,850
I got less than 48 hours.

158
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,785
I have it on good authority
that doesn't matter.

159
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,421
I heard you have access
to people...

160
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,624
People with special skills

161
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,859
who can help
in short situations like this.

162
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,460
Can you do that or not?

163
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,096
You and I need to talk money,

164
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,265
but, yeah,
we can take care of the lady.

165
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,901
First we take care of the money.

166
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,753
A list of prisoners
in and out
of Wallens Ridge

167
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,187
in the last year.

168
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,657
Hmm. Where are you
on Arturo Ruel?

169
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,193
He's willing to talk.
We're working
on immunity now.

170
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,096
New hangout?
The chef is a friend.

171
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,665
He needed an investor,

172
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,968
and I need his pumpkin
pepper vichyssoise.

173
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,737
You bought a restaurant
so you could eat vichyssoise?

174
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,640
I bought a restaurant
because I can.

175
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,909
A privilege you will soon enjoy.

176
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,111
I don't like vichyssoise.

177
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,746
Plus the name is terrible.

178
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,047
It sounds like
a Nazi collaborator.

179
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,950
Chicken soup then.

180
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,652
Lobster bisque.

181
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,121
Whatever you'd like
wherever you'd like it.

182
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,657
As soon as
the transition is complete.

183
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,860
What transition?
Of assets.

184
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,062
From me to you.

185
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,164
I think it's almost time.

186
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,134
Yeah, that's not happening.

187
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,670
There are quite a few people
to be taken care of.

188
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,706
Dembe and others.

189
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,808
It's a fairly substantial list,

190
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,542
but arrangements have been made.

191
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,244
Protocols put in place.

192
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,413
Most things
will take care of themselves.

193
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,148
But there are a lot of assets.

194
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,017
Billions of assets.

195
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,253
Of which,
to a great degree,
you'll be in control.

196
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,222
Of a criminal empire?

197
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,724
I'm an FBI agent!

198
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,426
You're also the daughter
of Katarina Rostova.

199
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,394
Believe me,
it's not what
I had hoped for,

200
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,797
or what I had planned for.

201
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:27,234
But as the good book says,
man plans. God laughs.

202
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,403
If it's not what you planned,
why do it? What changed?

203
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,372
Destiny. Fate.

204
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,507
Me. You.

205
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,343
Marvin Gerard.

206
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,245
Your lawyer.
He's at Wallens?

207
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,380
Got out three months ago.

208
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,115
Haven't spoken since.

209
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,418
Perhaps it's time
to mend that fence.

210
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,456
I got your message,
what's going on?

211
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,924
Situation with Ruel.

212
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,761
No, Ruel
kept his mouth shut.
That's what I thought.

213
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,195
But we caught this
on surveillance.

214
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,903
Talk to the boys.

215
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,237
Take care of it.

216
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,075
Marvin, nobody abandoned you.

217
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,409
I went to prison.

218
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,445
You were in prison
before I broke
you out of prison

219
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,613
to come work for me.

220
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,582
The only reason
you were walking free

221
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,984
is because I got you out.

222
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,419
Three years, Raymond.

223
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,254
Three years I'll never get back.

224
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,323
Marvin, what do you
want me to say?

225
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,194
Becky hit menopause
while I was
in that bird cage.

226
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,097
We wanted kids,
but if you must know,

227
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,633
I had performance anxiety
during our conjugal visits.

228
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,569
Do you have any more
Fun Foam Putty?

229
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,805
I need it in blue.

230
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,973
Uh, all of our Fun Foam Putty
is at the end of that aisle.

231
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,642
Yeah, I didn't see blue.
Then we're out.

232
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,945
You wanna check in the back?

233
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,413
No, I don't want to check
in the back, ma'am.

234
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,881
I just told you
it's at the end
of the aisle.

235
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,516
If you don't see it,
we're either out

236
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,184
or you're not looking
hard enough.

237
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,756
Marvin, listen,

238
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,625
you went to prison,
you kept my relationship

239
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,460
with the Task Force to yourself.

240
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,696
I appreciate that.
I am in your debt.

241
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,964
Is that why you're here?

242
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,468
No. I'm here because
I need information

243
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,303
about the prison
where you served.

244
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,073
Wallens Ridge, something's
happening inside those walls,

245
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,141
and I need to...

246
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,608
I'm afraid I gotta stop you
right there, pal.

247
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,477
I can't assist you.

248
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,645
Why not?

249
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,647
Because I am working
in a toy store!

250
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,649
I'll give you money.
Whatever you need.

251
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,153
This isn't about money,
it's about my law license.

252
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,856
When they locked me up,
I was disbarred.

253
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:29,957
I've served my time,

254
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,725
petitioned the state
to be reinstated,

255
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,326
and passed the exam,

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,528
but the DC Office of
Disciplinary Counsel

257
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,031
is opposing my application
on the grounds

258
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:41,568
that I don't possess the moral
character to practice law.

259
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,203
You're a lawyer.
What the hell does
moral character

260
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,704
have to do with anything?

261
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,173
Tell me about it.

262
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,576
But this guy...
Paul Wynn is his name...

263
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,511
He's a real prick.

264
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,014
And he's the one guy
who gets to decide

265
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,084
if I pass the ethics review
and get my license back.

266
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,388
Marvin, I'd love to help you,
and I will, but this...

267
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,223
I'm putting my foot down.

268
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,825
You're holding me hostage.

269
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,693
It's called a negotiation.

270
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,362
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

271
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,765
Just talk to this guy.

272
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,734
Try and move the needle.

273
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,004
You want me to threaten
the Disciplinary Counsel

274
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,940
so he'll certify
your moral fortitude.

275
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,776
Sounds about right.

276
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,258
Code Three, Code Three!
Everybody down!

277
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,394
Code Three, Code Three!
Everybody down!

278
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,064
Code Three, Code Three!

279
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,799
Call it in.
We've got one stabbed.

280
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,539
Hold on,
he's been stabbed?
Stabbed when?

281
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,641
Just now. I don't know...
We're just getting word.

282
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,777
Any idea his condition?
You know as much as I do.

283
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,613
Sir, CRT has commands.
What do you want to do
with the A and B blocks?

284
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,383
Lock 'em down. If C's clear,
get the medics in now.

285
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,819
All due respect, sir,
this is a federal
investigation.

286
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,354
We're gonna need
to assist you in questioning

287
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,922
any of the inmates
or prison staff.

288
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,458
Fantastic. You can have access
to anyone you want.

289
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,093
I want the truth
as much as you do,

290
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,962
but right now,
I got a prison to lock down.

291
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,238
Look at you.

292
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,308
Look. At. You.

293
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,609
Hey!
Al.

294
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,244
Good to see you.

295
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,080
Dembe. How are things?

296
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,448
Ah, better for seeing you.

297
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,484
How long has it been?
Must be close to a year.

298
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,253
That dinner at Le Coucou.

299
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,489
The red deer and chestnuts.
And the crepe suzette.

300
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,291
The crepe suzette.

301
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,994
And that fantastic,
crazy bassist

302
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,462
from Dizzy's
with the shoes and the hair!

303
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,964
Oh, my God, what a night!

304
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,332
What a morning.

305
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,967
Ah, honestly, Al, our schedules

306
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,435
couldn't be more out of sync.

307
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,637
Imagine the trouble we'd find

308
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,406
if you could stay up past nine?

309
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,042
You are the devil
on my shoulder, Ray.

310
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,510
What... What's going on?

311
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,312
I... I came as soon
as I got Dembe's text.

312
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,114
I'm in a bit of a sticky wicket.

313
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,781
The Bulgarians?
No.

314
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,151
This time it's a friend.
A lawyer...

315
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,121
Well, he was a lawyer.
You remember Marvin Gerard?

316
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,255
How could I forget
Marvin Gerard?

317
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,025
Oh, my gosh,
those Hawaiian shirts.

318
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,260
And his voice...
They were louder the shirt.

319
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,095
I know, I know.

320
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,364
Ah, so is he okay?

321
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,333
Eh, you know, he...
Hello?

322
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,669
Indiana Avenue
between 2nd and 3rd.

323
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,404
One hour or he dies.

324
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,807
How do I know
he's not dead already?

325
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,309
I'm looking for information.

326
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,011
He wouldn't give it to me.

327
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,447
I'm betting that
to save his life, you will.

328
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,482
Let me talk to him.

329
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,085
If I see Reddington,
if he's involved in this
in any way,

330
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,321
the imam dies
whether or not you tell me
what I want to know.

331
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,357
Understood?
Understood.

332
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,292
Please don't let your imam down.

333
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,094
I've grown quite fond of him.

334
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,308
Arturo Ruel was murdered.

335
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,410
Do you know anything about that?

336
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,711
I don't know.

337
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,046
Don't know or can't say?

338
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,714
Can't say if I know or not.

339
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,584
Your cell is next to Ruel's.

340
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,419
Any idea how his fingerprint

341
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,721
ended up at a crime scene
over 20 miles away?

342
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,123
You're asking the wrong guy.

343
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,893
When it comes to fingerprints,
I'm not expert.

344
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,030
Imam Sadiq Asmal.
Ring any bells?

345
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,098
I'm a Buddhist.

346
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,233
Ruel ever mention anything
about Muslims to you?

347
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,735
You're a hacker. Banks.
Insurance companies.

348
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,039
I am a security consultant
only in reverse.

349
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,141
An insecurity consultant.

350
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,110
And Ruel works in K&R.

351
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,578
Only instead of getting
people back, he took them.

352
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,048
Cool. Maybe I should check
his LinkedIn page.

353
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,449
You're both known criminals.

354
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,617
A getaway driver.

355
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,918
An explosives expert.

356
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,986
Glorified leg-breaker.

357
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,154
And yet you're in isolation.

358
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,255
What's your point?

359
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,091
My point is people
with rap sheets like yours

360
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,161
don't usually end up
in the isolation cell block.

361
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,730
And yet here you are.

362
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,965
Why is that?

363
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,635
I'm just not a people person.

364
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,005
It's weird, right,
the records of the
inmates we spoke to.

365
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,873
They didn't merit isolation.

366
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,742
Could be the warden
uses the isolated block

367
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,144
to get them to toe the line.

368
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,146
I mean, it explains
why they wouldn't talk.

369
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,547
Didn't wanna cause any trouble.

370
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,716
Hmm, could be.
But trouble for whom?

371
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,118
Who are they protecting?

372
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,453
Maybe Gerard knows.

373
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,155
I mean, if that mouthpiece
knows anything,

374
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,622
Reddington'll get him to blow.

375
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,662
Reddington wants to hand down
his empire to me.

376
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,565
You seem surprised.

377
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,732
What did you think,

378
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,101
he was just
gonna give it to charity?

379
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,602
I didn't think about it,

380
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,604
and I'm not going to accept it,

381
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,007
but it's a little odd
that he would bring it up now.

382
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,944
He found out I hired a PI
to shadow Ilya Koslov.

383
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,681
So he knows that you know
that's not his real identity.

384
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,384
Yeah, and instead of
confronting me about it,

385
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,486
he decided to try

386
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,853
and hand down
the keys to his kingdom,

387
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,789
and there's got to be a reason.

388
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,058
What about mortality?

389
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,394
His life is always
in mortal danger.

390
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,329
Yeah, from criminals
who don't scare him.

391
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,830
But this is different.

392
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,466
What do you know?

393
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,469
You remember when
Reddington reconnected
with Spalding Stark?

394
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,339
You haven't mentioned
my blood panel results.

395
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,940
- You've been too busy.
- Yeah.

396
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,310
You said that was
for an investment purpose.

397
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,777
I told you what
he asked me to tell you.

398
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,880
But the truth is,
when I was in Stark's lab,

399
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,682
I saw Reddington's medical file.

400
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,485
What did it say?
I didn't read it.

401
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,721
But it was the size
of a telephone book,

402
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,490
and clearly he didn't want me
to see what was in it.

403
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,825
I let it go,

404
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,660
but if he's thinking
about his successor,

405
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,595
my guess is that's why.

406
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,200
Paul can be a prickly guy,

407
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,701
but... But he's a good man.

408
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,203
As is Marvin.

409
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,539
Prickly, and a good man.

410
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,806
Paul's smart as a whip.

411
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,408
I haven't been with him
that long,

412
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,909
but I don't want
to lose him as a lawyer.

413
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,211
Guy's a shark.

414
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,213
You won't lose him.
Trust me.

415
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,048
He doesn't wanna
lose you as a client.

416
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,217
Oh, speak of the devil.
Excuse me.

417
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,618
Paul.

418
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,457
I should go, Raymond.

419
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,593
Chuck and Morgan will cover
while I check on imam's wife.
She seemed worried.

420
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,861
Of course, take your time.

421
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,729
Tell her we're doing
everything we can.

422
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:24,837
Paul, I... I'd like you
to meet Ray and his
friend Marvin.

423
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:25,938
What the hell's this?

424
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,240
A meeting of the minds.

425
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,741
Why is he here?

426
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,643
You know Marvin,
you know why he's here.

427
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,545
It's about his license
to practice.

428
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,913
That's never gonna happen.

429
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,548
Think again,
you evergreen dip spit.

430
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,716
The hell'd you just call me?

431
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,784
You heard me, counselor.

432
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,486
I swear to God I'll have
your nuts in a Cheerio.

433
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,954
Really?
Okay, all right,
everybody just calm down.

434
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,457
Look, Paul,
like it or not,
Ray is a friend.

435
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,758
A dear friend.

436
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,228
And you get to decide
if his friend Marvin

437
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,629
gets his law license back.

438
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,564
Al, come on.
Not here.

439
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,500
Okay, all right,
just hold on a minute.

440
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,901
Let's sit down, let's listen.

441
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,674
Mr. Wynn, say what you will
about Marvin Gerard,

442
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,477
and God knows
there's a lot to say.

443
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,213
But the man has suffered

444
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,315
a great deal
of hardship in his life,

445
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,251
and through it all,
he has remained resolute

446
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:15,455
in his advocacy for
and dedication to his clients.

447
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,490
His principles
and sense of justice

448
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,660
have always remained intact.

449
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,264
Now, his personality,
his demeanor,

450
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,433
that's another subject entirely.

451
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,769
That being said, Paul,
you're the
Disciplinary Counsel.

452
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,071
You run the ethics committee.

453
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,673
So let me pose
an ethical question...

454
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,975
Is it so wrong
to reinstate a man

455
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,145
with a questionable character
in exchange for, say,

456
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,948
keeping a client
with an unquestionable one?

457
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,650
You wouldn't leave me.

458
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,353
Reinstate him or I'll walk

459
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,955
and take my guaranteed
contract with me.

460
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,022
You wouldn't.

461
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,358
Oh, dear.

462
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,192
Listen, for what it's worth,

463
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,128
I once lost a bundle to Al

464
00:19:56,162 --> 00:20:00,800
thinking he was bluffing
during a hand
of seven card stud.

465
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,170
He has the sweetest,
most child-like face,

466
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,640
but my guy Al is as serious
as a heart attack.

467
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,742
But please,
don't take my word for it.

468
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,411
Talk it over with your client.

469
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,680
See what's happening
in his neck of the woods.

470
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,014
I understand the committee

471
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,149
is meeting this afternoon.

472
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,398
Get in.

473
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,141
Harold, are you there?

474
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,209
We're here.

475
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,346
Ha! So, I'm here
with an old friend

476
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,915
who may have some helpful intel

477
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,184
about Arturo Ruel
and his mysterious
fingerprint.

478
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,354
More of a hunch, really.

479
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,356
Is that Marvin Gerard?

480
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,757
Aren't you supposed
to be in lockup?

481
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,559
Hello, Agent Keen.

482
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,827
Who's Marvin Gerard?

483
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,862
Let me start by saying
I have no conventional proof,

484
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:07,634
but I suspect
Ruel's fingerprint wasn't
lifted or moved,

485
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,537
but ended up
in the office of Dembe's imam

486
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,272
because Ruel
was there in person.

487
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,642
How's that possible?
Someone let him
out of prison?

488
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,176
I won't pretend to know
the details...

489
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,278
I was in an entirely
different cell block.

490
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,048
But people like to talk
in prison,

491
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,351
and what they say is
that in this prison,

492
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:28,087
there is a small,
but trusted group of inmates

493
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,289
who get special favors.

494
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,724
Well, that's true
for every prison.

495
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,626
Yes, but in Wallens,

496
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,930
the warden frequently puts his
favorite inmates in isolation

497
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,300
just for looking
at someone the wrong way.
Why would he do that?

498
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:44,837
Well, there's no better alibi
than being in isolation.

499
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,939
It only requires
a small crew "on the take"

500
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,741
to say you're there
when you're not.

501
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,978
And the leader
on this crew
is Vincent Martin.

502
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:55,081
Longtime prison guard and
warden Cain's right hand man.

503
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,450
You believe
they're putting inmates
into isolation

504
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,819
so they can let them out
to commit crimes?

505
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,388
Well, what Marvin is suggesting

506
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,922
is that something fishy

507
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,157
is going on at Wallens Ridge,

508
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,559
so if we're trying to understand

509
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,161
how the DNA
of an incarcerated man

510
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,564
ended up at a new crime scene
while he was in jail,

511
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,133
we need to start
by looking at Vincent Martin.

512
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,436
He's the one
ultimately responsible

513
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,038
for the vanishing of Imam Asmal.

514
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm telling you,
dollars to donuts,

515
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,243
this guy is up to something,
and it's not good.

516
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,178
Aram, pull what we have
on Martin.

517
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,847
Keen, Park, get eyes on him.

518
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,281
Let's see
where he might take us.

519
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,123
That's the guard?
Martin?

520
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,758
Yeah, that's him all right.

521
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,438
Where's he going?
His shift doesn't end
for four more hours.

522
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,474
No idea, but that's
what we're gonna find out.

523
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,724
What do you think?

524
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,392
I don't know.

525
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:16,228
Call it in, see if Aram
can give us any details.

526
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,465
Where are you going?
For a closer look.

527
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,753
It's them.
The inmates from Wallens...
Guys we interrogated.

528
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,889
Heavily armed.
Armed for what?

529
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,824
Okay, Agent Keen,

530
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,693
the address you gave me
isn't in the system.

531
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:47,760
It's an unknown.

532
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,295
Aram, we need to roll
units here now.

533
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,563
The inmates...
Inmates? Wait...

534
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,198
From Wallens.
They're on site

535
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,300
with enough military grade
equipment to start a war.

536
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,569
No lights or sirens,
have 'em set up
a two block...

537
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:59,238
Whoa! Hang on.
Hang on? Why?

538
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,140
What's going on?
Aram,
they're on the move.

539
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,843
Get units here now.
We're in pursuit.

540
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,778
Sir, Marvin Gerard was right.

541
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,581
Evidently, Martin
smuggled several
inmates out of Wallens.

542
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,216
They're heavily armed
and on the move.

543
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,784
- On the move where?
- That's unclear.

544
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:12,885
Roll assets their way.

545
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,089
What the hell are they doing?

546
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,562
I got the ones with the ladder.

547
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,534
Aram?
2318 Central Ave.

548
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,335
Four unsubs.
All armed.

549
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,537
Okay, I have units en route.

550
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,076
I got something else...
A car with government plates.

551
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,478
Surveillance.
This could be a sting.

552
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,947
DC plates...

553
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,082
Aix-bravo-six-delta-five-
November.

554
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,817
Copy. Part of
the Marshals' fleet.

555
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,786
You think that's...
It's a protective detail.

556
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,922
Reach out and see what you
can find out about operations.

557
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,091
Whatever's about
to happens here
is gonna happen fast.

558
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,359
Copy.

559
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:56,996
Cameras are down.

560
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,230
Copy that.
Here we go.

561
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,438
All right, we're in place.

562
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,608
Forty-five seconds.
Go. Go.

563
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,313
Don't even think about it.

564
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,583
Agent Keen.

565
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,150
I just hung up
with the Marshals,

566
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,286
and they're holding a witness
named Sarah Wims.

567
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,121
Now, she's the lead witness
in a murder trial

568
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,991
and is being held next door
to the address you gave me.

569
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,626
Next door?

570
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,360
Marshals are getting word
to their teams now
and has units on their way.

571
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,536
FBI! Stop right there!

572
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,939
Freeze!
Get to the target!

573
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,541
The park is
literally across the street.

574
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,410
Maybe just 20 minutes?

575
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,183
The building next door
is housing a witness...
Sarah Wims.

576
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,952
That's the target.
What?

577
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:53,986
What do you mean next...

578
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,827
What was that?
What was that?
Get in the bedroom.

579
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,094
Stay and don't come out.

580
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,364
Shots fired!
We need help!

581
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,354
We have shots fired.

582
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,622
Notify base
and seal the perim...

583
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,106
Please. No.

584
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,440
Please don't. Stop!

585
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,276
FBI! Hands!

586
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,879
Drop your weapon.

587
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,523
You okay?

588
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,726
It's over.

589
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,127
Thank you.
It's gonna be okay.

590
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,796
Thank you.
I promise.

591
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,448
Hello, Mr. Zuma.

592
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,752
It's time to find out

593
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,520
with whom your loyalties lie.

594
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,864
Tell me how it worked.

595
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,702
We're given targets.

596
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:51,603
We?
Yeah.

597
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:55,107
Me, Waats, Fingers,
and, uh, Cisco.

598
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,009
Who gave you these targets?

599
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,780
Was it the guard, Martin?

600
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,214
Did he let you
in and out of the prison?

601
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,820
Tell me about
today's target.
Sarah Wims.

602
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,656
We don't get names.
Or reasons.

603
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,924
Just targets.

604
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,292
And she was
an extraordinary target.

605
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,594
No one would blame you
if you chose not to testify.

606
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,464
After this,

607
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,733
nothing could keep me
from testifying.

608
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,369
She'd agreed to testify
against the Doyle gang.

609
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,337
Mobsters who traffic
heroin and cocaine.

610
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,341
Imam Sadiq Asmal.

611
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,746
I told you.
I don't know names.

612
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,015
You took him from his mosque.
We need to know where he is.

613
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,383
I don't know.

614
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,885
Well, who does?

615
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,686
Martin? Does he know?

616
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,190
They take care of my family.

617
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,224
All our families.

618
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,426
They look out for us.

619
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,699
Right now,
I'm the only one
looking out for you.

620
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,769
And I can't do that unless
you give me a reason to.

621
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,070
Like a name.

622
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,308
It went sideways.

623
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,010
How?
The FBI, that's how.

624
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,411
Calm down.

625
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,146
We got to Ruel
before he could
say anything.

626
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,148
They got Tank.
The others escaped.

627
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,217
Tell the others
to go to the safe house.

628
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,519
I'll meet them there.
You get back to the prison.

629
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,254
Discover the jail-break,
issue a BOLO.

630
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,123
Follow protocol.

631
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,258
It's the warden.

632
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,893
The inmates
he puts in isolation,

633
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,528
he takes care of their families.

634
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,196
And they take care of him.

635
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,565
He's the man with the key
to the locked-room.

636
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,035
He tells them what to do,
and it's very need-to-know.

637
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,903
And they don't know
where the imam is?

638
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,238
No. They don't.

639
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,909
We're clear then.

640
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,811
You know the information
I'm looking for

641
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,612
and what will happen
if you refuse to give it.

642
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,715
Yes.

643
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,385
Talk it over with
your spiritual advisor.

644
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,753
After all...

645
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:51,590
It's his life
that hangs in the balance.

646
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,907
Are you hurt?

647
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,476
Only by the thought
that you could be.

648
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,014
You are devoted to two men

649
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,050
and are being forced
to betray one for the other.

650
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,621
A man's life
is more important
than a man's secrets.

651
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,027
Some lives are built on secrets.

652
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,930
And when they are revealed...

653
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,432
The life they're built on
ends as well.

654
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,237
Are you trying to confuse me?

655
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,308
I'm trying to help you see
there is no easy answer.

656
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,710
That either choice
carries a burden

657
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,778
I wish with my whole heart

658
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,915
that you didn't have to carry.

659
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,520
If I let you die
to save Raymond's soul,

660
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,288
how will I ever save my own?

661
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,125
This is not your fault.

662
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,359
Hmm?

663
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,263
Do you hear me, son?

664
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,998
You are not to blame.

665
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,001
You are not to blame.

666
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,669
You are not to blame.

667
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,374
You are not to blame.

668
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,487
What are we doing here?

669
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,888
We're doing
what we're told to do.

670
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,190
The op was blown.

671
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,192
The warden will
take care of us.
He always has.

672
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,694
The warden has got no juice
left after this.

673
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,828
What do you say we should do?

674
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,097
We're escaped prisoners.

675
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,398
I say we escape.

676
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,700
That's one option.

677
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,205
I'm not going back.

678
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,840
No, you're not.

679
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:49,942
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

680
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,078
We're on your side.
All right? We're a team.

681
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,112
We were.

682
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,515
A damn good team.

683
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,862
My doctor told me
to stay away from
grapefruit juice.

684
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,600
Who are you?

685
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,735
He said something about statins

686
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:22,708
and how grapefruit affects
the metabolic this or that,

687
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,110
I don't know.

688
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:27,946
But whatever the risk,
ruby red is worth it.

689
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,215
Please, sit.

690
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,157
Hands.

691
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,598
My name is Raymond Reddington,

692
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,603
and as a general rule,
"innovative" is not a word

693
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:55,641
I would use
to describe
a prison warden.

694
00:32:55,674 --> 00:33:00,412
The indignities that
the men in your charge
are subjected to

695
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,349
are cruel and often inhumane.

696
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:05,784
But you...

697
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,688
You found a way
to monetize that cruelty.

698
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:14,626
I imagine your clients
pay top dollar

699
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,330
for you to commit
the perfect crime
on their behalf.

700
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,500
Street crimes using men
who are off the street.

701
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,803
I'm curious how
you landed on the idea.

702
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,573
The light-bulb moment.

703
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:31,143
I love hearing about
light-bulb moments.

704
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,245
Do tell.

705
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,815
That's an order, not a request.

706
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,988
I inherited the business
from my daddy

707
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,256
and his daddy before him.

708
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,061
My great-great grandpa
used to catch freed Blacks

709
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,763
and lock 'em up down in Angola.

710
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,532
Then he'd lease 'em out
to the highest bidder.

711
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,602
They'd work
people's fields,
timber.

712
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,036
There's no reforming 'em.

713
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,608
They come through my gates,
they ain't people.

714
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,810
They're broken.

715
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,412
Might as well
put 'em to some use.

716
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,085
I guess that just about
says it all, doesn't it?

717
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,456
Imam Asmal.

718
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,659
Who hired you to abduct him?

719
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,298
Time is of the essence.

720
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,601
The name is Maddy Tolliver.

721
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,340
Think again.

722
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,108
About what?

723
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:38,076
You asked me who...
Maddy Tolliver is dead.

724
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,279
She wasn't dead two weeks ago.

725
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,780
I swear to God she wasn't.

726
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,083
Where did she
have you deliver him?

727
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,854
If I tell you that,
are you gonna let me go?

728
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,889
Where.

729
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,502
I see you've prayed
on your decision.

730
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,148
Release him,

731
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,118
and I will tell you
what you want to know.

732
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,131
Let's record this
for the world to see,
shall we?

733
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,909
I need an answer.

734
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,446
I'm not waiting.

735
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,685
Ma'am, you gotta go.
Right now.

736
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,606
He sold you out.

737
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,841
Where is she?

738
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,376
Did you hear what I said?

739
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,410
He talked.

740
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,547
No, he didn't.

741
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,114
If he had,
they'd be dead already.

742
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,685
I got him.
You're not
going after her.

743
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,119
I'm here to make sure of that.

744
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,290
You got him?

745
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:34,360
We're just gonna stay here
and have a nice chat.

746
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:46,972
Did you tell her anything?

747
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,540
No.

748
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,043
But I was going to.

749
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,421
Got the call a couple hours ago.

750
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,691
It's two gunshot wounds
to the torso at close range,

751
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,893
based on the GSR
and the stippling.

752
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,962
That's him.
I'll call off the hunt.

753
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,964
We're almost done here.

754
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,300
I'll get the autopsy filed

755
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,234
to your Task Force
by this time tomorrow.

756
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,781
Sir, just got off with the DA.

757
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,149
Sarah Wims testified.

758
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,051
Looks like guilty on all counts.

759
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,286
And the man
who contracted the warden?

760
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,688
Colin Anglim.

761
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,591
You're under arrest
for the attempted murder
of Sarah Wims.

762
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,760
Sarah who?
Like I'm supposed to
know who that...

763
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,495
It was in Warden Cain's ledger.

764
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,397
Which is good, since he's not
around to tell us about it.

765
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,900
The warden's dead.

766
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:49,968
His ledger gives us

767
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,403
the people who hired him

768
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,271
and Imam Asmal was safe.

769
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,240
I think we can
close the books on this.

770
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,442
Well, I looked over the ledger,

771
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,444
and it gives us
every name but one.

772
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,913
The person who hired him
to take the imam.

773
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,650
- And the imam won't say.
- I spoke with him myself.

774
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,286
He says it's a private matter
between him and a congregant.

775
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,899
I've missed you.

776
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,006
Hmm.

777
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,243
You think he had
a binary choice.

778
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,447
I think he had no choice at all.

779
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,949
We always have a choice.

780
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,787
Hmm.

781
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,922
If you have situational ethics.

782
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,156
He doesn't.

783
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,226
There is a right and a wrong.

784
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,328
And you were right,
and I was wrong.

785
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,998
Oh... You and I were

786
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:57,335
irrelevant to his struggle
for spiritual discipline.

787
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,639
Dembe and I have
done this dance before.

788
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,008
I made it clear
there wouldn't be an encore.

789
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,977
Jihad doesn't start and stop.

790
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,914
It is constant.

791
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,450
For him. For me.

792
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,952
And for you.

793
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,289
What do you know of my struggle?

794
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,160
I know we all have one.

795
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,895
Every day.

796
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,499
Today, my struggle
was whether to

797
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,368
tell the FBI
who had abducted me.

798
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,739
Tomorrow it will be
why I didn't.

799
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,210
Dembe asked you not to.

800
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,712
Yes, he did.

801
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,316
He left me no choice.

802
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,021
Whether I liked it or not.

803
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,426
Dembe's imam.

804
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,829
Was that really necessary?

805
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,565
You mean he's not in the game.

806
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:02,000
A bystander.
I mean was it necessary.

807
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,535
In the situation I'm in,

808
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,738
in the situation
Reddington put me in,

809
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,540
there are no bystanders.

810
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,744
Does he know?

811
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:14,112
That you're alive?

812
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,248
He does now.

813
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,885
I don't know what you did,

814
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,754
but whatever it was, thank you.

815
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,856
Thanks can wait.

816
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,792
I need you to do
something for me.

817
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,261
Um, thanks cannot wait.

818
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,063
I was about to be disbarred.

819
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,665
One conversation with you

820
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:36,668
and I'm suddenly
a paragon of legal ethics.

821
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:37,936
You're welcome.

822
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,872
You're going after
the people I care about.

823
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,542
I'm not going after them.
I'm giving them a choice.

824
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:44,876
Dembe made the right one.

825
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:46,878
If it comes down to it,

826
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,547
one day, I hope you will, too.

827
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,050
I thought I already had.

828
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,084
You did.

829
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,887
And it saved me.

830
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:59,424
It's about my will
and my various trusts.

831
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,561
Seeing as how
she's the primary beneficiary,

832
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:06,732
I'd like you to set aside
a time to review them
with Elizabeth.

833
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,434
You're giving a cop
the keys to your kingdom.

834
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:10,969
Regrettably.

835
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,470
But there will be...

836
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,642
More choices for you to make.

837
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,345
Between you and him.

838
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,647
Why do it?

839
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,750
Because where she's going,
she'll need it.

840
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,620
And where, pray tell,
is our plucky heroine going?

841
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,790
To a very dark
and dangerous place.

842
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,458
I don't think one of us can live

843
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,260
while the other survives.

844
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:39,364
She doesn't see it,
or can't accept it,

845
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:43,434
but her path is undeniable.

846
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,403
You make it sound
like she has no choice.

847
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,174
What did you say?

848
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:53,779
I said
you make it sound like
she has no choice.

849
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,414
I guess that is what I'm saying.

850
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,488
Sometimes there is no choice.

851
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:11,396
And I think the outcome
is in your hands.

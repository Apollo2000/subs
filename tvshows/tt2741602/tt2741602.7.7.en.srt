1
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,098
You know how I feel about playing games.

2
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,475
Drop the knife.

3
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,420
How could you think about escaping today?

4
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,185
It's the big day.

5
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:55,122
You and I are giving one lucky man...

6
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:58,025
the gift of a lifetime.

7
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,428
Either that, or we've
completely ruined his life.

8
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,530
I'm not sure which.

9
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,900
But I, for one, cannot wait

10
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,436
to find out what happens
when he wakes up.

11
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:34,428
Aah!

12
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,530
Yeah, Mason, it's me. It's really me.

13
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,632
Where have you been? It's election day!

14
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,866
Half the state is searching for you!

15
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,101
I can't get into that right now. Just...

16
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:15,903
I need you to come pick me up.

17
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,038
I got to call the Secretary
of State, cancel the election.

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,007
- Hopefully it's not too late.
- Mason!

19
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,076
Forget the election. Just pick me up.

20
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,343
Alone.

21
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:26,286
I'm at a storage facility on...

22
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:27,915
Kenilworth Avenue.

23
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,617
Kenilworth Avenue.

24
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,055
Richard, what happened to you?

25
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,257
Not now.

26
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,759
Just get me out of here.

27
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:41,195
Yes, Governor. Whatever you need.

28
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:53,548
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

29
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,146
Hmm. Something's missing.

30
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,688
- I love peanut butter!
- Shh!

31
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,990
It's a secret ingredient.

32
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,459
All magical concoctions need one.

33
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,461
But you can't tell anyone.

34
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:17,064
- Pinky promise.
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,299
You only have to watch Agnes
until 3:00 today,

36
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,502
and then she has a play date
with her friend Shelly.

37
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,936
Thanks again for all your help.

38
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,740
Hello?

39
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,909
I just heard from our MI6 friend.

40
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,712
The information you wanted?
He's got you covered.

41
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,480
He wants to meet at
Rock Creek Park in an hour.

42
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:35,015
Yes. That sounds fine.

43
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,850
So, what's the plan today?

44
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,453
Well, it's a nice, misty morning.

45
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:43,290
Feels like a perfect day for
mud pies at Rock Creek Park!

46
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,992
Mud pies!

47
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,426
Yeah!

48
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,829
She is always two steps ahead of me.

49
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:51,010
I cannot figure out how.

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,843
Well, things may be turning around.

51
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:54,845
I found Patrick Masuda.

52
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:56,814
Ohh, you're not only my oldest friend.

53
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,983
Today you're my favorite.

54
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,918
He's a young man
who now lives in Baltimore

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,486
under a new last name.

56
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:05,256
Two years ago, the kid was dying
from a rare blood disease.

57
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,025
He's now in full remission
because she paid Norman Devane

58
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:10,728
a fortune to devise a cure for him.

59
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,363
Why? Who is he to her?

60
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,266
I don't know. Been in and out
of jail since his teens.

61
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,969
But maybe, if we get to him,
he can get us closer to her.

62
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,038
You've got to be kidding me.

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,075
You're just in time! Campers' breakfast.

64
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,778
Onions, peppers, potatoes,
last night's roast beef...

65
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,514
all draped with an egg basted easy.

66
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,550
I'll pass, and I'll say a little prayer

67
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,785
for your digestive tract.

68
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,454
Elizabeth, meet Frank.

69
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,429
Morning, ma'am. I was just going.

70
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,162
You know, I never took you for a camper.

71
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,564
Oh!

72
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:50,000
I acquired it after a rogue wave
in the East China Sea

73
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:53,337
swept a shipping container
full of baby formula

74
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,605
right off the stack.

75
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,274
Chinese mothers don't trust
the domestic stuff.

76
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:58,442
Purity issues.

77
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:01,612
So I sneak in America's finest
at a small markup.

78
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:05,850
Zhou Jiaxuan was so mortified
that he lost my shipment

79
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,552
that he offered me his little
home away from home

80
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:10,421
as partial recompense.

81
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,557
Your life is so weird.

82
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:17,261
What do you make of Governor
Sweeney's sudden reappearance?

83
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,764
I'm relieved. The FBI
has been looking for him

84
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,465
since he disappeared three months ago.

85
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,733
We thought he was dead.

86
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,902
And now he just walks
into a local hospital

87
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,305
on the very day of a special
election to replace him?

88
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,441
Richard. Thank God you're alive.

89
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,143
Have you had a chance
to speak with Patty?

90
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,545
Of course, but, Janey, look.

91
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,547
Look what they did to me.

92
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:40,417
The Bureau believes
the Cironato crime family

93
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,419
had him abducted because he was planning

94
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,755
to oppose a casino bill they favored.

95
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,090
The Bureau is wrong.

96
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,726
The Cironatos don't abduct
politicians they disagree with.

97
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,061
They buy them off.
The person who did this

98
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,164
is plotting something
far more interesting.

99
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,032
Is plotting?

100
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,934
The governor's back. It's over.

101
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,569
Then why isn't he talking?

102
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:02,239
No politician returns from
a harrowing abduction

103
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,709
and says nothing, not unless
the person who did it

104
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,144
still has their hooks into him.

105
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,780
The abduction was categorized
as an act of terror.

106
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:12,116
Well, call it whatever you want.

107
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:15,986
But whatever it is,
it hasn't fully happened yet.

108
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,922
All right. I think we're ready.

109
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,957
A governor is abducted.

110
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,960
No demands are made for his
return, no blackmail, no ransom.

111
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:26,197
And then 100 days later, he
wakes up in a self-storage unit

112
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,632
with no one guarding him
and walks to freedom.

113
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,035
- Why?
- To force a new election.

114
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,336
Get someone else in office

115
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:33,838
so the Cironatos get their gambling bill.

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,673
Reddington said they weren't involved.

117
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,541
And you don't think he was just
saying that to protect them?

118
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:39,977
We've learned that, on balance,
the good he does

119
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,212
outweighs his self-interest.

120
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:42,713
In time, I think you'll agree.

121
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:45,115
Aram, I want you and Agent Park
to see what you can find

122
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,350
at the storage facility.

123
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,751
Keen, Ressler, I've made arrangements

124
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,753
for you to interview Governor Sweeney.

125
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:53,891
I know it's hard to believe,
but the world really is

126
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,759
a safer place because of what he does.

127
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,127
You should've told me.

128
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,230
- Told you what?
- That you're his daughter.

129
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:02,333
I never would have trusted you
if I knew he was your father.

130
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,467
If I'd have known,

131
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,669
I never would've told you
about Anchorage.

132
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,873
Alina, your secret's safe with me.

133
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,951
And then after the second procedure,

134
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,120
they locked me in a recovery room.

135
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,756
The only time I saw anyone
was when they came to feed me.

136
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:28,292
Monsters. They need to be in jail.

137
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:31,061
No. If this ever gets out...

138
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:35,132
my career, my life, it's... it's over.

139
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:37,968
I will never repeat that story to anyone.

140
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,937
- Then you're letting them win!
- I don't care.

141
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,040
Our focus right now should be
in stopping that election.

142
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,742
That is your seat they're auctioning off.

143
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,710
We have a more pressing problem.

144
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,746
The FBI are on their way here.

145
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,348
If you want to keep your name
and your reputation,

146
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,150
then you don't speak of anything

147
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:56,053
that happened to you
after your abduction.

148
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,502
Nothing.

149
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,424
- Nothing at all?
- No, it's just a blank.

150
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,126
I think they kept me drugged.

151
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,360
Sure had one hell of a hangover

152
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,095
when I woke up in that storage room.

153
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:07,064
The guards at the state capitol
building said you were

154
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,066
in your office the night
of the abduction.

155
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,567
What do you remember from that night?

156
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,970
I like to work late. You know,
for the peace and quiet.

157
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,572
Only, when you're the governor,
it's rarely peaceful.

158
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,008
My life's a symphony of
phone rings and door knocks,

159
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,110
so sometimes when the guards
aren't looking, I like to sneak

160
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,012
out to this little Oriental
place across the street.

161
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,781
They know me there.
They take good care of me.

162
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,316
They shut the place down,

163
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,785
let me enjoy my egg-drop soup
in heavenly bliss.

164
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,887
And that's where you were
the day of your disappearance?

165
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,388
Yes, ma'am, just like usual.

166
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,290
Only this time, when I walked
out the front door,

167
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,758
a bag dropped over my head.

168
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,527
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up to that hangover.

169
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,962
Any idea why you were taken?

170
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,897
Everybody knows the Cironatos
had it out for me

171
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,699
after I wouldn't play ball
in that casino deal.

172
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,467
I suppose they probably
wanted to sideline me

173
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,302
till after the election.

174
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:48,272
Hmm. Almost three months?

175
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:50,441
It's a long time to keep a man comatose.

176
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,142
I'm surprised you can even walk.

177
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,278
Well, I am a bit wobbly.

178
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,380
Listen. I'm sure you can understand.

179
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,515
I want whoever did this
found and punished.

180
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,217
So if there's anything else I can do,

181
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:01,452
you be sure to let me know.

182
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,020
Matter of fact, there is.

183
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,488
The restaurant you were abducted from...

184
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,226
the, uh, little Oriental
joint... what's it called?

185
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,126
What kind of person is
sick enough to do this?

186
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,261
It doesn't matter now.

187
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:46,296
You know what you have to do.

188
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:49,133
Richard, don't back down now.

189
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,224
Stand up for what you believe.

190
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:00,041
So, uh, what'd the governor say
when he walked into your office?

191
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,036
Asked to use the phone. I said
no at first. Company policy.

192
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,462
But then he said he'd been
drugged and locked in unit 12-B,

193
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,731
- so I figured, what the hell.
- Who rents that unit?

194
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,833
Fellow named Simon Peter
rented it last June.

195
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,601
Paid a full year in advance, cash.

196
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,970
Tried the phone number,
but it's been disconnected.

197
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,438
- I'll run a search.
- Don't bother.

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,541
Simon Peter's an alias.
He's one of the 12 apostles.

199
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,410
When Jesus was arrested, Simon Peter

200
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,978
denied knowing him three times.

201
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,820
He's a symbol of false faith.

202
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,525
Festive.

203
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:39,629
So, um... are you religious?

204
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:40,964
Is it a problem if I am?

205
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,501
No, I, uh... I-I love it
when people have values.

206
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:47,337
Eight weeks of Bible camp every summer.

207
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,905
My dad wanted me to grow up with morals.

208
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:52,108
And since he didn't know
how to model them himself...

209
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,579
If the governor was drugged,
I can understand dumping him

210
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,415
in a safe room until he wakes up.

211
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,750
But why go to all the trouble
of decorating it?

212
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,485
Check this out.

213
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,456
A little blue pill.

214
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,025
Maybe Sweeney was having
sex parties in here

215
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:11,628
and lied to cover it up.

216
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,198
Not with this.

217
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,283
My mom takes these.

218
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,994
It's an estrogen pill.

219
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,103
The restaurant confirmed

220
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,693
Sweeney was there
the night he was grabbed.

221
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,248
But no one saw it happen,

222
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,201
and their security footage
gets erased monthly.

223
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,069
But the bank across the street
erases its footage annually,

224
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,437
and they had this.

225
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,872
Linen delivery van was clocked

226
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,473
leaving the area at 10:39 p.m.,

227
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,576
around the same time Sweeney
was grabbed. We ran plates.

228
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,612
The van was registered
to a Wendell Willis.

229
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,146
Any connection to the Cironatos?

230
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,749
No. Willis works freelance I.T.
in Virginia.

231
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,785
But get this... there is no
Speedy Linen Supplies.

232
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,084
We think he put a fake decal on his van.

233
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,856
Find Willis. By the time you get there,

234
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,825
I'll have a warrant waiting.

235
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:08,142
Raymond. Masuda's on the move.

236
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,411
Oh, my goodness.

237
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,823
Quality sleep on a stakeout.

238
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,952
Oh!

239
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,554
How did we never think of this before?

240
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,746
Well, this is just
a bunch of gangbangers.

241
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,782
You think Masuda is one of them?

242
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:51,786
No. He's trying to make a deal with them.

243
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:52,954
Negotiating.

244
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,189
The guy in the tragic camouflage,

245
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,158
he's the killer in the bunch.

246
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,060
Huh. Deal's closed.

247
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:02,830
Raymond, Masuda may have
just hired them for a kill.

248
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:05,099
And there's only one person I am aware of

249
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,368
who Katarina wants dead right now.

250
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,274
What do you want in your mud pie?

251
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:17,611
Ohh! Some dried leaves, please.

252
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:22,049
And some pebbles for added protein.

253
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,996
My mom doesn't like me getting dirty.

254
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:27,555
Well, that's why I
brought a fresh change of clothes.

255
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,291
And there's a sink in the
restroom where you can wash up.

256
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,226
So you be as messy as you like.

257
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,995
Here you go, honey!

258
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:36,163
You keep working on this, sweetie.

259
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,733
I'm gonna say hello to a friend.

260
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,434
Just take a couple of 'em!

261
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,942
Did you find him?

262
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,977
Didn't come easily, luv.

263
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,247
The intel you gave me from
Keen's apartment was a start,

264
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,320
but took a few dustups
to locate the real goods.

265
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:02,323
The location for the KGB agent
formerly known as Ilya Koslov.

266
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:03,891
This is an old photo.

267
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,794
Yeah. But the address
is current and local.

268
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,730
You could take care of business
right now and be back for tea.

269
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,669
For a surcharge,
I'll even watch the cherub.

270
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,771
Something the matter, luv?

271
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,374
Black SUV at two o'clock.
You were followed.

272
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:22,543
Aw, bugger all.

273
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,722
How do you want to handle it?

274
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,016
I don't know yet.

275
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,622
Hi, honey. Are your parents home?

276
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,359
- I live with my mom.
- Okay, can we talk to her?

277
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,431
Mom!

278
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,599
I have exciting news for you.

279
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:49,103
We've just made first contact
with your next victim.

280
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,639
James Robson?

281
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,274
No?

282
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,710
Wouldn't surprise me if you both
belong to the same country club

283
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,647
or shared a hedge-fund manager

284
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,116
or, I don't know, shoot rhino together.

285
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,585
Mom, someone's at the door!

286
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,954
Help! Somebody, help! I'm a prisoner!

287
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:10,324
I'm in the basement!

288
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,665
Can I help you?

289
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,100
Hello, ma'am. We're with the FBI.

290
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:21,669
We have a warrant to search this address.

291
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,205
- May I ask why?
- We have reason to believe

292
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,373
this property contains
evidence of a crime.

293
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,342
Do you live with a Wendell Willis?

294
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,479
Wendell? I'm Wendell's landlord.

295
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,614
He rents a studio apartment out back.

296
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,806
I could unlock it if you like.

297
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,454
- Wendell Willis.
- Mr. Robson.

298
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:41,989
Such an honor to meet you, sir.

299
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,224
And I am honored by your

300
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:45,226
volunteer service commitment, young man.

301
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,560
I believe in your motto...

302
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:49,196
"Faith, family, and freedom in America."

303
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,297
Amen!

304
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,633
And welcome to Robson Research.

305
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,580
Thanks. We'll let you know
if we need anything else.

306
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,082
I hope Wendell's not in trouble.

307
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:11,385
Honestly, he's a model tenant.

308
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,039
Thank you.

309
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,558
Yes, ma'am. For $20, you can support

310
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,693
our abstinence-focused
education campaign.

311
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,662
We teach young people the skills required

312
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,664
to avoid sexual activity,
build character,

313
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,633
and develop healthy relationships.

314
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,870
Excuse me, ma'am. Can you hold
for one second, please?

315
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,774
- I'm inside.
- Get out. You've been burned.

316
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,442
The FBI is searching your apartment.

317
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,644
But I'm in.

318
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,078
It's too late. We'll find a new target.

319
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,813
No. We've all worked too hard for this.

320
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,749
We can't let this opportunity
go to waste.

321
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,123
You hated me when we first met.

322
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,491
I didn't hate you.

323
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,727
I didn't like you, and
I definitely didn't trust you.

324
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,898
Well, I think Park feels the same way.

325
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,967
Well. I should certainly hope so.

326
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,335
Thanks a lot.

327
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:03,204
No, any normal person's gonna wonder what

328
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,805
Reddington's obsession says about you.

329
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:08,509
It takes a while to figure out
that it says absolutely nothing.

330
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:10,377
So just give her time.

331
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:13,147
Like a year. Or seven.

332
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,424
Check it out.

333
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,058
- Who's he?
- That's James Robson.

334
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,859
He runs a conservative advocacy group.

335
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,728
He's a lobbyist.

336
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,531
Aram, you and Park need to
get out to Robson Research.

337
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,618
We know who our next victim is.

338
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,503
Katarina! Ooh! This looks delicious!

339
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,417
But I believe they could use more twigs.

340
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,578
I'll be right back, Agnes.
You keep working.

341
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,747
Stay at the table.

342
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,555
Do as we say, and you won't get hurt.

343
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,658
Turn slowly. You're coming with us.

344
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,683
Sutherland! The driver!

345
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,720
We've got to get out.
Help me with this one.

346
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,073
What happened to that man?

347
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,642
He's just a little tired, sweetie.

348
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,377
Let's let him sleep.

349
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,646
We can wash up by the creek, okay?

350
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,322
Why are you so worried?

351
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,758
I'm worried...

352
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,893
I'm worried about if you
tell your mother about

353
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,696
the sleeping man, she won't
let us play together anymore.

354
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,532
I promise I'm not telling my mother.

355
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:18,168
- Pinky promise?
- Pinky promise.

356
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,420
Yo!

357
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,689
Yo, what the hell, man?!

358
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:40,791
What the hell's the matter with you?!

359
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,694
Nothing an honest answer or two
can't cure.

360
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,267
Whoa, whoa.

361
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,679
Tell me about yourself.

362
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,236
What do you do for a living?

363
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:50,938
What do you care what I do for a living?

364
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,906
I just watched you negotiate a deal

365
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,474
with a gang of gangbangers.

366
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,843
What you saw was my business.

367
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,979
Well, I-I-I don't mean it like
it's none of your business.

368
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:03,116
I mean, it's my business, literally.

369
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,818
I do custom installs.

370
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,087
When I put in high-end units,
I clone the vehicle's

371
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,222
wireless key code so I can
steal the stereos back

372
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:10,824
and resell them.

373
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,092
You're a thief?

374
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,194
You do what you gotta do, right?

375
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:18,565
What I got to do is understand
why Katarina Rostova

376
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,302
would pay to cure you
of a fatal blood disease.

377
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,670
I don't know who you're talking about.

378
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,006
Constance paid for that. She's my friend.

379
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,209
Of course. Constance Drucker.

380
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,446
What do you say we take a little drive

381
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,615
so you can tell me more
about dear old Constance?

382
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:42,389
I've got to deal with a...
emergency at work.

383
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,425
You be good for Nana and Papa, okay?

384
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,669
You know I love you, right?

385
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,204
Yes, Mommy.

386
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,673
I always have.

387
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,410
And I always will.

388
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,749
Wendell Willis was
a recently hired volunteer

389
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,083
at Robson Research.

390
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,152
I sent Aram and Park to apprehend him,

391
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:13,653
but they were too late.

392
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,256
This is Willis' van leaving
the parking structure

393
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,494
just before they arrived.

394
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,393
We believe Willis abducted Robson

395
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,428
from the parking lot
when he went to lunch.

396
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,531
Why would a freelance I.T.
worker abduct two unrelated men?

397
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,266
Has Governor Sweeney talked yet?

398
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:27,768
No, and he's not governor anymore.

399
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,970
The media called a winner
in the election.

400
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,139
It was Sweeney's opponent.

401
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,174
You said the victims were unrelated,

402
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,742
but that's not entirely true.

403
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,478
A victim profile reveals
they have a lot in common...

404
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,713
powerful men,

405
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,249
socially conservative,
politically active.

406
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,717
It made us wonder if any other

407
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,386
recent kidnap victims fit that profile.

408
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,456
Andrew Darvis.
Pastor of one of the largest

409
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,891
Baptist congregations in America.

410
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,260
He went missing for two months last year,

411
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,595
resurfaced in the middle
of a massive manhunt,

412
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:58,398
said he'd gone on an unannounced
spiritual retreat,

413
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,634
and apologized for alarming anyone.

414
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,469
Okay. We have a pattern.

415
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,770
Let's just hope Pastor Darvis

416
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,225
has more to say than Sweeney does.

417
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,508
I couldn't help but notice the identical

418
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,178
circumstances between
you and Richard Sweeney.

419
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,879
And now James Robson.

420
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,383
Three men with similar
political ideologies.

421
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:19,319
I know James. Good family man.

422
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,488
I respect the work
he does for this country.

423
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,857
Pastor Darvis, were you
really on sabbatical,

424
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:27,928
or were you abducted
like Robson and Sweeney?

425
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,830
I checked the case files.

426
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,165
You're unwilling to provide
the authorities any details

427
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,568
about how and where you disappeared.

428
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,270
There are reasons
I've maintained my silence.

429
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,140
Now, I-I don't know Governor Sweeney,

430
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,477
but I suspect he would
very much appreciate

431
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,612
his privacy in this moment, too.

432
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,414
Blood looks good.

433
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,383
CVS tests show no abnormalities.

434
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,254
As long as you continue
on the drug regimen,

435
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,423
you should be able to ride this out.

436
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,493
I don't want to ride this out.
I want you to cut it out. Now!

437
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:02,095
I have no clue what
happened to you or Sweeney,

438
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,830
but James Robson was kidnapped today.

439
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,867
And if you have any information
that can prevent harm to him,

440
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,369
it's your responsibility to talk to me.

441
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,172
How long ago was James taken?

442
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,473
Two hours.

443
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,476
Probably too late to
stop the first procedure.

444
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,882
But maybe you can prevent the second one.

445
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,381
What kind of a procedure?

446
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,850
That crazy woman wanted to test my faith,

447
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:26,319
so she perpetrated the most invasive,

448
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,157
ungodly action humanly possible.

449
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,259
But I did not break.

450
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,561
I stood true to what I believe.

451
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,863
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

452
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,666
If I take out what they put inside you,

453
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,321
I could spend the rest
of my life in prison.

454
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,739
That's a law you passed.

455
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,907
For God's sake, Janey.

456
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,176
If ever there was an exception,
this is it!

457
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,644
Oh, my hands are tied.

458
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,123
Once a heartbeat's been detected...

459
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:57,284
Mama, could you come in here
for a second, please?

460
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,919
And bring Luke.

461
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,724
Hello.

462
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:05,959
Now, who's this?

463
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:10,530
This is my child. Luke.

464
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,099
All this to hide an unwanted pregnancy?

465
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,501
Who's the mother?

466
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,303
There is no mother.

467
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:19,172
I gave birth to Luke myself.

468
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,812
How you doing, son?

469
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,033
I'd like to say how grateful I am

470
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,335
to all of you for your support.

471
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:41,038
But you need to know
the FBI are looking for us.

472
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,508
If you leave now, maybe
your name stays out of this.

473
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,843
If you stay...

474
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,312
all bets are off.

475
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:50,881
We're with you, Dr. Hayes.

476
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:52,649
We want to see this through.

477
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:56,754
Who are you?

478
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,157
What are you doing?

479
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,893
No less than you did to me.

480
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,262
You and others like you.

481
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:06,964
You hijacked my body...

482
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,967
...and forced your beliefs on me.

483
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:14,538
Now I'm gonna force them on you.

484
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,241
You're gonna take
a little nap, Mr. Robson.

485
00:25:17,243 --> 00:25:21,145
And when you wake up,
you'll be a new man.

486
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,514
New and improved.

487
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:26,150
No. No. Let me go!

488
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,951
Let me go! No! No!

489
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:30,687
No! No! No...

490
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,862
How can a man give birth to a baby?

491
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,564
The technology's been around for years.

492
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:43,233
It's just nobody's ever tried
to perform it with a man.

493
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:45,969
You're telling me that
Richard Sweeney has a womb?

494
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,771
With an uninvited passenger.

495
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:49,173
That's why he isn't talking.

496
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:51,475
The victims undergo two
involuntary procedures.

497
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:53,510
First, a uterus is
transplanted from a donor,

498
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,679
and the patient is
put on immunosuppressants.

499
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,849
Once the organ takes, a
fertilized embryo is introduced.

500
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:02,019
And after that, the kidnappers
wait for a viable heartbeat

501
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:03,320
before they release the victims,

502
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:05,622
at which point the baby can't be aborted.

503
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:08,292
The men live in states with
restrictive abortion laws.

504
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,127
What purpose can any of this serve?

505
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:12,459
Pastor Darvis believes
it's an object lesson.

506
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,964
The kidnappers target men

507
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,433
who advocate for government
control of women's bodies.

508
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,969
Then they take control of the
men's bodies in the same way.

509
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,537
Pastor Darvis provide any information

510
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,272
on the people who did this to him?

511
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,608
No, their faces were hidden by
medical masks the whole time.

512
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,378
But their leader was a female
surgeon, blond, maybe 40s.

513
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,350
And the son of a gun had a
C-section and kept the baby.

514
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:33,754
That's a man with the courage
of his conviction.

515
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:35,819
This one... This one's a genius.

516
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,221
I mean, I thought I was smart,

517
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,256
but I'm telling you,
she is off the charts.

518
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:40,691
Slow down. What happened?

519
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:42,526
Okay, so, I found a pill
in the storage room

520
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,094
where Governor Sweeney was dumped.

521
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,264
And, well, you tell them.

522
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:48,899
The pill is conjugated estrogen,

523
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,435
generally prescribed as part
of a hormone therapy program.

524
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,337
- That makes sense.
- Why?

525
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:55,405
The blacklister is impregnating men.

526
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,241
- That's incredible.
- That's disgusting.

527
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:59,309
The drug... is there a prescription?

528
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,512
No, but the FDA requires drugs
like these to have a unique

529
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:03,347
lot number in case
they need to be recalled.

530
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,449
So we traced that lot
number to a local medical clinic

531
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:07,584
that ordered this particular batch.

532
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,952
We have an address.

533
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:10,421
Then what are you waiting for?

534
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,131
I was 6 when it happened.

535
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:24,234
I was watching TV
when we heard Constance...

536
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:26,103
Sorry. What did you say
her real name was?

537
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,638
Katarina.

538
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,440
We heard Katarina fighting
with a man in the hallway.

539
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,676
Mom and Dad ran out of
the apartment to help,

540
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:33,977
but the man...

541
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:37,055
he had a gun, shot my parents.

542
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,350
Gave her a chance to get away.

543
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,154
A month later, she approached me
on my way to school.

544
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,789
She said what happened was all her fault,

545
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,525
but she knew she couldn't
make up for my loss.

546
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,861
She swore she would do
everything in her power

547
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:53,430
to look out for me, and she has.

548
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:56,199
Anytime I needed money, she was there.

549
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:57,743
When I got sick...

550
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:00,996
she sent a man with custom medication.

551
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,832
I'm in remission.

552
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:06,476
Tell me, Patrick.

553
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,839
With these advantages
you've been given...

554
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:14,284
why are you boosting car stereos

555
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,186
and consorting with riffraff?

556
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:19,289
It's still hard sometimes. I guess.

557
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,892
A young boy robbed of his parents

558
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:25,162
and all of the comfort and security

559
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:29,566
that is every child's divine right.

560
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,488
You'd think that's as bad
as life could get.

561
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:39,243
And here your fairy godmother
promised to keep you safe.

562
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:42,788
Well, we're gonna put
that promise to the test.

563
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,585
Hey. How'd the park go?

564
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:52,222
I got what I needed, but so did Morozov.

565
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,691
His people were tailing Sutherland.

566
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,159
I killed one of them.

567
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:58,128
But they still took him.

568
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,563
Did the kid see anything?

569
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,897
She did.

570
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,165
What if she tells Keen?

571
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,503
She won't.

572
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:05,135
Our problem is Morozov.

573
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:06,670
He now has the source of our intel.

574
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:08,805
It's only a matter of time
before he extracts

575
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:10,649
the location of Koslov.

576
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,444
I'll ask again.

577
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:16,613
What did Katarina Rostova want?

578
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:18,815
The punishment will continue
until you tell me this.

579
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:22,986
Oh, well, it's horses
for courses, I suppose.

580
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,188
Oh, well.

581
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,339
We've got a problem.

582
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:44,608
The FBI is outside our front door.

583
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,144
It's too soon. I can't let them take me.

584
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,512
I need to get to him.

585
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:50,914
Don't worry. We'll delay them
for as long as we can.

586
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:53,583
Go! Finish what you started.

587
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,066
It's not a good time.

588
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,701
Well, that's not exactly
what you want to hear

589
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:20,303
from your fairy godmother.
Well, what do you expect?

590
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:23,373
Over the years, it's a tough
job, fairy godmothering.

591
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,808
And sometimes the old wings

592
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,611
just can't get you there
fast enough, like right now.

593
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,115
Patrick's not a part of this.

594
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:31,214
And Dom's been retired for years,

595
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:33,516
but that didn't prevent you
from shooting him, did it?

596
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:37,420
I want a meeting face-to-face,
or I'll return the gesture

597
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:39,655
and put a bullet or two in dear Patrick.

598
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,031
Raymond.

599
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,459
There are rules.

600
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:44,660
Which you've ignored.

601
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,596
Dom was a player in the game.

602
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:49,632
His game ended long ago.

603
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:51,867
Well, mine hasn't!

604
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:54,337
I'm still being hunted.

605
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:57,206
And it's not gonna end unless I end it.

606
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,208
This is about what the man
in the park told me.

607
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,210
Morozov told you about that, didn't he?

608
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,013
That's why you want to see me.

609
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:06,082
You want the address I bought.

610
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:08,651
I'm not interested in an address.

611
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:11,754
I'm interested in you coming to me.

612
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,856
If this delightful young man

613
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:16,225
means as much to you as it seems,

614
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,527
you'll start flapping
those decrepit old wings

615
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,563
and flutter on over here.

616
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:26,002
Tell Patrick I love him. Like a son.

617
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:32,475
And I'm sorry.

618
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,315
I did my best...

619
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,752
but I am done with
men controlling my life!

620
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:51,460
Punishment is the crudest
form of education,

621
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:54,771
but it's the only one
that woman understands.

622
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,670
No. Please.

623
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,972
Raymond.

624
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:11,414
Seems you have more than one
fairy godmother.

625
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:15,000
Go on. Get out.

626
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:19,622
And make something better of yourself.

627
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
That was the right thing to do.

628
00:32:24,962 --> 00:32:26,962
I did it because we have a new lead...

629
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,699
one she had no intention of giving us.

630
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:41,944
FBI. Open the door. We have a warrant.

631
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:44,180
There's no need for all that fuss.

632
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:46,282
We're in the back. Follow me.

633
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,233
Why are they making this so easy?

634
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:05,901
Call for emergency medical support.

635
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,369
Cuff 'em. Cuff all of 'em.

636
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,505
Pastor Darvis said the leader
was a blond woman.

637
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:12,041
We got a runner!
She's headed toward the garage!

638
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,776
It's a diversion.

639
00:33:24,455 --> 00:33:26,956
- I got a plate.
- Move, move, move!

640
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:35,498
Agent Park, have you got eyes?

641
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,066
No, but I got a hit on the plate.

642
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,202
It's Hannah Hayes.

643
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,104
Made headlines seven years ago
while she was

644
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:45,241
a surgical resident
and was raped on campus.

645
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:47,610
It resulted in a pregnancy.

646
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,345
Looks like Hayes decided
not to keep the baby.

647
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:51,680
Says here that Hayes tried to
defy late-term abortion laws

648
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:54,350
and was... wow... sent to prison.

649
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,552
Her daughter was born behind bars.

650
00:33:56,554 --> 00:33:58,220
We've got a home address.

651
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:01,023
No need. I've been there.

652
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:25,915
No! Wait! Please! Don't!

653
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,817
Hannah, no!

654
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,152
No, no, no, no, no. Think.

655
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:31,720
Think?

656
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:36,292
What do you imagine I've been
doing for the last seven years,

657
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:38,727
every waking hour,

658
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:40,162
every time I gaze

659
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:43,833
into the loving face
of my beautiful daughter?

660
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,501
You'd think the miracle of life

661
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:47,336
would erase the violent act
that produced it.

662
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,538
That's what they'll have you think.

663
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,706
They're wrong.

664
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:55,110
This is the man who raped you.

665
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:58,214
He got out early. Prison overcrowding.

666
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,149
And you know the first thing he did?

667
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:02,451
Filed for parental rights.

668
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:05,120
And you think I'm crazy.

669
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:07,489
Fortunately, I had room
for my own prison.

670
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,225
She is crazy. You got to stop her.

671
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:11,827
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hannah, don't!

672
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:13,762
Don't. Come on.

673
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:15,798
Your little girl wouldn't
want you to do this.

674
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,235
What kind of example would
I show Daisy if I don't fight

675
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,503
those who demand control over me?

676
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:24,273
My decisions. My body.

677
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,075
And I'm not alone.

678
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:27,710
It was easy to find people to join me,

679
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:30,246
and we decided
the best way to change minds

680
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,747
is to make those responsible

681
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:33,482
experience the same rape that I did.

682
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:35,684
Wait, wait. Are you telling me

683
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:39,121
that this guy's the father
of those men's babies?

684
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:40,756
Well, why else would I keep him around?

685
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:45,261
Hannah, I think it's safe to say
that you've made history,

686
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:48,430
but it's over now.

687
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:51,901
No. No, it's not over.

688
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,370
No matter what happens here,
you're gonna lock me up,

689
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:56,899
and this creature
will continue its petition

690
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,498
and end up with my daughter.

691
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,598
Yeah, but if you shoot him,

692
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,310
you're never gonna be a free woman again.

693
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,812
Daisy will.

694
00:36:03,814 --> 00:36:06,064
She's with my parents.

695
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:09,776
And they're gonna raise her
with love and compassion...

696
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:13,196
in a world where everyone will know...

697
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,393
actions have consequences.

698
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:19,662
- Hannah, don't. Don't.
- Wait! No!

699
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:23,365
Hands!

700
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:27,303
Get on your knees now. Don't move.

701
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,005
Motya. I found it prudent
to follow your lead

702
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,273
and shoot first.

703
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,175
The only question is who to shoot second.

704
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:45,010
Calm down. I was just...

705
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,979
I guess we know who's third.

706
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:50,715
I instructed you to contact me

707
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:55,118
the instant you had
a location on Rostova.

708
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:56,965
_

709
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,391
You're nobody to instruct me.

710
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:01,593
I didn't become who I am
by taking orders.

711
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:05,664
Who you are is an aging
leg-breaker with psoriasis.

712
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:08,934
I assume you found the lead on Katarina

713
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,669
but, instead of calling me,

714
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,370
attempted to bring her in yourself,

715
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:15,340
hoping to relive your glory days

716
00:37:15,342 --> 00:37:17,175
and sell her to the highest bidder

717
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:20,011
to keep you rolling in
potato vodka and herring

718
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,913
for the rest of your life.

719
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:25,163
You're not the first one
to underestimate that woman,

720
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:29,621
which is why it was imperative
that you call me.

721
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:31,356
There is silver lining.

722
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,792
I can't imagine.

723
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:43,835
This one was with Rostova.

724
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:47,172
Sold her information,
but he wouldn't tell me what.

725
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:57,782
As I live and breathe! Skip Sutherland!

726
00:37:57,784 --> 00:37:59,251
Dembe, look at Skip.

727
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:01,553
Skip, whose side are you on these days?

728
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:04,656
The wrong one. Apparently.

729
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:07,592
Morozov, there's a reason
you can't break this man.

730
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:10,079
Because he has something
you'll never have.

731
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,501
Backbone beats wishbone every time.

732
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,446
Let's cut him loose.

733
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,341
I assume you denied Morozov
the information he sought

734
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,310
because he was gonna
shoot you either way.

735
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:26,611
And you were good and right.

736
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:29,514
But you know me, Skip.
So here's the deal.

737
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,449
I'll provide you the best
medical treatment

738
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:33,351
and protection money can buy,

739
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:37,689
provided you tell me what
I need to know, right now.

740
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:41,010
What did she hire you to do?

741
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:45,697
She wanted the whereabouts
of an old KGB operative.

742
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,475
Which one?

743
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,371
Ilya Koslov.

744
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,876
Well, that certainly changes everything.

745
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,879
We need to get him some help and
get the hell out of here fast.

746
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,769
How soon can you do it?

747
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,371
As soon as you sign the consent forms.

748
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:02,574
But as I understand it, coming
to New York to get an abortion

749
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:04,642
is still a crime in your state.

750
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:06,644
Your own attorney general
could charge you

751
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,380
with conspiracy to commit murder.

752
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:10,183
I know the damn law.

753
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:12,350
I wrote it.

754
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,320
And yet here you are.

755
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:18,790
I was raped.

756
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,862
As I said...

757
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:26,131
all I need is your consent.

758
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:40,145
We closed this case quickly
and efficiently...

759
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,679
in good part, thanks to you.

760
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,782
Why did Reddington give us this case?

761
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:46,484
Probably because it was
the right thing to do.

762
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,991
You were right. I should have told you.

763
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,160
About my relationship to Reddington.

764
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:58,329
You're a part of the team now,
and you deserved to know.

765
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,109
I'm sorry. It was an oversight.

766
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,902
But your secret is safe with me.

767
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:07,238
In fact, I'm gonna share
a secret of my own.

768
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,325
Reddington is my father.

769
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:14,145
Or he was. Before he died 30 years ago.

770
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:18,516
The man we're working with
is not Raymond Reddington.

771
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,318
Then who is he?

772
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,687
He's a former KGB agent.

773
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,423
Formerly known as Ilya Koslov.

774
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,392
The address is current and local.

775
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,637
Hello, Ilya.

776
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,372
Been a long time.

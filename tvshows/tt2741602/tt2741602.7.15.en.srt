1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,818
No, Glen, it's fine.

2
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:02,888
We're already here.

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,650
Yes, it's right up the street
from Cher's hotel.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,719
Yeah. We get the ice, pick up the diva,

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,488
and in a half-hour,

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,724
she's serenading Trudy with
"If I Could Turn Back Time."

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,042
Best retirement party ever.

8
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,362
Yeah. No, Glen.

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,498
I told you, it is what it is.

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,034
There's no, all of a sudden,
requesting "Half Breed."

11
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,502
All right.

12
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,237
Okay, thank you. Bye.

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,794
Yes. Fine.

14
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,198
Do you have any of
the really big bags of ice?

15
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:34,993
Miss?

16
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,379
Excuse...

17
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,749
Sorry to pry you away from your
text or tweet or "twhatever."

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,354
Are you all right?

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,189
It wasn't a tweet.
It was... It was an e-mail.

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,225
I just... I just got accepted
into college.

21
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,994
Oh, my God!

22
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,662
Dembe! Look!

23
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,297
- Chapel Hill?
- Yeah.

24
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,832
Wow, congratulations.

25
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,335
Your parents must be so proud.

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,104
Yeah, my father passed
last year, but my mother act...

27
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,673
I actually have to call my mom,
but the ice is in the back.

28
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,775
Thank you. Congratulations.

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,610
Thank you.

30
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,380
Oh, my gosh.

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,188
This is a moment that woman
will never forget.

32
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,079
We should buy her something to celebrate.

33
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,126
I got accepted.

34
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,102
Put the phone down.

35
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,269
Now.

36
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,437
Come on.

37
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,272
Now give me the money, okay?

38
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,497
Um...

39
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,113
Come on. Move.

40
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,316
Hey. No alarms.

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,966
Hear me?

42
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:52,856
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,852
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

44
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,191
I said no alarms!

45
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,088
Raymond.

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,992
Raymond, we have to go.

47
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:56,838

...You don't have to do this.

49
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,437
I'm afraid I do, love.

50
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,272
The plan.

51
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,374
Tell me what you remember
about that plan.

52
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,276
- Frank?
- Stop. I need to bring him out.

53
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,332
No! Frank!

54
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,279
What?

55
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,915
You're looking at the cars again.

56
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,183
What?

57
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,440
There's nothing out there.

58
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,521
The blue car is back.

59
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,533
Frank! Frank, stop!

60
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,949
Frank.

61
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,103
The blue car!

62
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,771
- Frank...
- It was back! It was right there!

63
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,573
Frank, come inside.

64
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,041
Please!

65
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,142
Come on.

66
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,577
Come on.

67
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,445
That's it.

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,385
An armed robbery at a mini mart.

69
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,555
The clerk was shot and killed.

70
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,391
That's the case...
a shooting at a mini mart

71
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,526
that left the clerk and one of
the robbers dead at the scene?

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,595
Well, there was only one robber.

73
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,297
The police suspect he was killed

74
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,981
by an accomplice who wanted
the cash for himself.

75
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,135
They're wrong.

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,436
And how do you know that?

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,938
Because I shot him.

78
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,562
We shot him... Dembe and I.

79
00:04:57,948 --> 00:04:59,241
You were there.

80
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,647
She'd just been accepted to college.

81
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,504
The girl, Sofia.

82
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,819
Had her whole life ahead of her.

83
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:14,112
All the good and all of the bad.

84
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,792
The triumphs and mistakes.

85
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,482
Gone.

86
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,520
Like a story erased.

87
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,002
You know how he was killed
because you killed him.

88
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,304
We killed the man who
committed the crime,

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,962
but not the man I hold
responsible for it.

90
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,231
And who might that be?

91
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,511
Fine Caliber Arms International

92
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,115
is a 100-year-old gun
manufacturer run by Gordon Kemp,

93
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,484
who inherited it from his father
eight years ago

94
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,187
and promptly started making
the FineCal 9.

95
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,322
The gun of choice for
violent young criminals

96
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,457
in Chicago and Atlanta.

97
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,791
And dozens of other cities.

98
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,194
It's the cheapest 9mm on the market.

99
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,096
A gun with no collectible value

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,697
except that it's a readily available,

101
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,899
affordable weapon for
street-level criminals.

102
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,635
So, what, Edward Martell,

103
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,503
a 19-year-old with a long rap sheet,

104
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,205
murders a clerk with a FineCal,

105
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,307
and Reddington puts the company
that legally manufactures them

106
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,541
on the Blacklist?

107
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,710
Reddington put Kemp on the Blacklist

108
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,013
because police have seized more FineCals

109
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,016
than every other
semiautomatic weapon combined,

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,874
and Kemp keeps flooding
urban markets with them.

111
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,644
There's been a local shooting.

112
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,891
Victim had just been accepted to college.

113
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,993
Press is working that angle,
as well as the rising number

114
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,785
of deaths connected to
the FineCal this year.

115
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,431
Get the team.

116
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,733
I want the narrative changed.

117
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,402
By lunch!

118
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,038
Reddington holds Kemp responsible

119
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,340
for the death of Sofia Salgado.

120
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,743
For some reason, seeing her die
really got to him.

121
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,612
We're supposed to believe
Reddington's after Kemp

122
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,447
because he's emotionally affected?

123
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,617
Or because Kemp sells guns?
Mr. Reddington sells them, too.

124
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,218
Maybe he's targeting a competitor.

125
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,524
No, as far as know,

126
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,689
Reddington only sells weapons
for military use.

127
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,924
Of course, that includes
armed insurrection,

128
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,893
but military nonetheless.

129
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,028
Okay, but he's asking us
to target a company

130
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,863
that's not committing any crimes.

131
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,400
It's okay to flood high-crime
neighborhoods with cheap guns?

132
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,768
If you want my personal opinion,

133
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,004
buy me a drink after work and we'll talk.

134
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,739
Or you can have my opinion now.

135
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,075
This is a crime problem,
not a gun problem.

136
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,910
The Task Force investigates crimes,

137
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,179
not legal conduct we disagree with.

138
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:20,372
It's a crime to knowingly
sell a gun to a criminal.

139
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,218
Does Reddington have a good-faith basis

140
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,686
to believe that's what Kemp is doing?

141
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,555
Maybe. He gave me a lead on the man

142
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,224
who sold Edward Martell
the murder weapon.

143
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,692
He says if we find him,

144
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,127
he'll give us all the good faith we need.

145
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,795
James Dalman.

146
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,431
Eh, I don't think I know you, chief.

147
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,065
No, but I know you.

148
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,990
Take a walk.

149
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,327
It's okay, baby.
This will just take a minute.

150
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,006
Here's what we know.

151
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,942
You have felony convictions
for assault and burglary.

152
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,276
You're hooked on Oxy,

153
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,811
and you make ends meet trafficking guns.

154
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,279
Is this about child support?

155
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,515
Sofia Salgado was murdered
by Edward Martell

156
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,839
who used a FineCal 9 he bought from you.

157
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,253
So this isn't about child support.

158
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,888
We know you sell FineCal 9s.

159
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,857
With your record, we know
you don't buy them yourself.

160
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,793
What we want to know is
who you get them from.

161
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,261
Look, you're going to prison.

162
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,118
This is your one chance to help yourself.

163
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,206
Give us a name.

164
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,736
Can't do it.

165
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,440
I think you just did.

166
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,479
We issued a press release
condemning the shooting

167
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,415
and made a $100,000 donation

168
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,650
to the NRA's Safety Education initiative.

169
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,485
Make it $250,000.

170
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,121
And leak our agenda for our
sit-down with Senator Jennings.

171
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,090
To discuss sensible gun legislation

172
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,758
to curb senseless gun violence.

173
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,327
Clever. Sensible. Senseless.

174
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,662
Use that in the release.

175
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,731
And where are we with the ex-boyfriend?

176
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,133
We're not sure that's something
we should leak to the press.

177
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,402
Research uncovers that
the victim dated someone

178
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,870
with a connection to a local gang,

179
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,505
and we're not going to leak that?

180
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,374
The connection was secondhand at best.

181
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,976
Right now, we have
broad industry support.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,878
We could lose it
playing that kind of hardball.

183
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,849
This girl's death was a tragedy
that we are not responsible for.

184
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,651
If it requires playing hardball

185
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,820
to keep us from getting blamed for it,

186
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,488
then that's what we're going to do.

187
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,857
There's a gun show in the county
where the shooting occurred.

188
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,515
Maybe you should go, keep our
talking points in the press.

189
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,199
Ilya. What's going on?

190
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,801
I've got a shadow.
He's outside my place right now.

191
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,418
Who's outside?

192
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,372
The guy in the Chevy Malibu.

193
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,841
He's been out there for over an hour.

194
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,709
Listen to me. Stay where you are.

195
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,333
I'm gonna send Dembe.

196
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,347
For all I know, he's not alone, Raymond.

197
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,671
There... There may be others.

198
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,052
It may be her.

199
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,854
Ilya, Dembe will be there soon.

200
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,813
Just keep your head down.

201
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,159
Is he having another episode?

202
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,561
Yes. Blue Chevy again.

203
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,600
Just drop me at the Post Office.

204
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,724
You go make sure he's okay.

205
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,560
When I'm finished with Harold,
I'll call you.

206
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,563
Raymond, why are you doing this?

207
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,243
Doing what?

208
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,201
Speaking with Harold,
giving him this case.

209
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,132
She was an innocent.

210
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:15,046
So many for so long have been innocent.

211
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,642
I'm sick of it.

212
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:24,682
She bought 30 FineCal 9s
at a gun show in West Virginia

213
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,718
from the booth run by Judson Firearms.

214
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,219
Federally licensed dealer.

215
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,655
Passed the background check
with no problem.

216
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,700
Apparently, she told him she was
starting a personal collection.

217
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:36,961
And she gave all 30 to Dalman,
the boyfriend.

218
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,519
Yes. He turned around
and sold them on the street.

219
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,901
She can't be more than 23, 24.

220
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,825
She's a classic straw purchaser,

221
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:47,172
and we can definitely charge her.

222
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,506
Her?

223
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,775
I'm interested in more than her, Harold.

224
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,477
You need to take this up the food chain.

225
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,971
And how do you suggest we do that?

226
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:57,382
For starters, you can make
a case against Judson Firearms

227
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,051
for selling guns to a buyer
they should have known

228
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,053
would put those guns in criminal hands.

229
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,289
You know how hard a case
like that would be to prove.

230
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:05,757
I disagree.

231
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:08,360
A young woman with an address in the city

232
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:11,663
who's suddenly decided to collect guns...

233
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,598
30 identical guns.

234
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,900
30 of the cheapest guns on the market,

235
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:18,370
which just happen to be the most popular

236
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,972
among young, violent criminals?

237
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,440
She passed the background check.

238
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:23,808
How did she pay for them?

239
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,932
- Cash.
- Harold.

240
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,048
Her age isn't enough.

241
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,039
I'm not sure the volume
of the sale is, either.

242
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:37,388
Now, if there were a second sale...

243
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,524
If Judson sold to her again

244
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,560
only a few month after
she bought 30 guns,

245
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:45,597
there's no way they'd think
it's because she's a collector.

246
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,866
You want to send her back in,
this time, on the record.

247
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,609
And tell her to buy another 30.

248
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,936
For her "collection."

249
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,482
You were my friend.

250
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,650
There are things about this

251
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,419
you can't possibly understand.

252
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,888
Oh, but I want to understand.

253
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,189
In fact, I insist.

254
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,514
Linda?

255
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,634
Honey?

256
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,213
Hunted like an animal.

257
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,721
Why won't you help me?

258
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,023
- You go to hell.
- You need to stop.

259
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,592
- Reddington.
- It's me!

260
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,260
Whoever he is, he's still out there.

261
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,428
Answer me! Why!

262
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,897
It's me! Ilya, it's me!

263
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,499
Dembe.

264
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,177
Dembe.

265
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:40,879
I know what I saw, Dembe.

266
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,747
You're tired. You should lie down.

267
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,390
It's her, I know it.

268
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,585
Why don't I get you something to eat?

269
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,402
You know I'm not making this up.

270
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,696
I know what I saw.

271
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,156
Raymond.

272
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,500
Yes, he says he needs to speak with you.

273
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,747
Are we concerned? Of course.

274
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,181
But I think the public understands

275
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,816
we can't be held responsible

276
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,108
when violent individuals
commit crimes with our weapons.

277
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,277
Com check... Everyone read me?

278
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:25,924
I'm here.

279
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,925
Affirmative.

280
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,026
Loud and clear.

281
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,160
We hear you, Agent Ressler.

282
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,812
We could use a visual.

283
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,765
Camera's up.

284
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,266
Everyone seeing what I'm seeing?

285
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,069
It's Gordon Kemp himself,
sweet-talking the press.

286
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,460
Let him. One big fish at a time.

287
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,108
I've got eyes on Carly.

288
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,199
She's approaching now.

289
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,647
Excuse me?

290
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,749
Hey. I know you.
We've done business before.

291
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,151
No problem with the last sale, I hope.

292
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,552
No. No problems.

293
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,321
The opposite, actually.

294
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:59,857
I liked them so much, uh,
I was thinking I'd buy more.

295
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,659
Really? Uh, how many more?

296
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,429
Uh, I was thinking another 30.

297
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,965
I'm sorry, remind me your name?

298
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,633
Carly Ambers.

299
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,169
Are you feeling okay, Carly?
You don't look so well.

300
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,837
- He knows something's wrong.
- I'm fine.

301
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,839
He has to know she's not
a bona fide collector.

302
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:16,975
She's a wreck. He'd have to
be blind not to see it.

303
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,409
The 30 you bought last time,

304
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,278
that was for a personal collection?

305
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,180
Yes. I just want to get more.

306
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,048
All right. No worries. We can do that.

307
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,350
Look, I've got the cash,

308
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,818
if that's what you're worried about.

309
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,952
No, no, I just need to get
a little more information.

310
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,354
I can buy from someone else.

311
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:30,655
You're not the only one
that sells FineCals.

312
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,056
There's no reason to raise your voice.

313
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,858
Kenny. Can I grab you for a moment?

314
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,460
Heads up, that's Kemp.

315
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,754
Stay with them. Agent Keen,
adjust your position.

316
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,731
What's going on?

317
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,165
I got a few red flags.

318
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,667
She bought 30 FineCals a few months ago,

319
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,102
and she wants 30 more.

320
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,737
- Agent Keen, we can't hear.
- I don't like it.

321
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,105
- They're too far from the mic.
- She's from the same area

322
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,506
where that mini mart
shooting just happened.

323
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,475
If she's passing them on
to somebody else...

324
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,243
Unbelievable. Did you catch that?

325
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,300
Did he just warn Kemp that
this might be a straw purchase?

326
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,348
I'm sorry. It's so loud in here,
I didn't hear all that.

327
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:58,850
- Oh, he heard.
- Damn right, he heard.

328
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,551
What? I couldn't make that out.

329
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,420
I didn't hear what you said,
but I don't really see an issue.

330
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,222
She's a collector. It's your job to

331
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,823
run a background check
and if she passes...

332
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,026
- I agree. I just...
- Kenny.

333
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,410
Make the sale.

334
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,263
I say we take them both.

335
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,631
You can't arrest them unless they know

336
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,066
they're selling to a prohibited buyer.

337
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,300
Kemp doesn't want to know.

338
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:17,769
Agents Park? Ressler?

339
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,604
Sounds like Kemp's the one driving this.

340
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,105
You pick up a gun manufacturer,

341
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,874
you better be ready for
the heat that follows.

342
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,208
To hell with the heat.

343
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,199
I'm asking if you think Kemp's guilty.

344
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:27,912
Yeah.

345
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,914
Then take him. But do it quietly.

346
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,154
Gordon Kemp.

347
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,722
Agents Keen and Ressler, FBI.

348
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,123
You're under arrest.
We need you to come with us.

349
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:40,758
I'm sorry? Did you say FBI?

350
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,894
Keep your voice down.
We'd like to do this quietly.

351
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,629
- No, I won't keep my voice down.
- We need to do this quietly, sir.

352
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,164
FBI! It's a raid!

353
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,166
They're undercover posing as
part of the crowd.

354
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,367
You got a search warrant?

355
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,397
If not, you got no right to be here.

356
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,770
Listen, you're gonna be arrested
for obstruction, so back up.

357
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,206
Friends, calm down.
There's no need for this.

358
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,908
They don't have a case.

359
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,876
Let's not them provoke us into violence

360
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,979
to justify attacking us
and taking our guns.

361
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,841
We are not the lawbreakers, they are.

362
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:09,962
We have you on video advocating
a sale of 30 semiautomatics

363
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,766
to a 24-year-old woman you had
to know was a straw purchaser.

364
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,268
I had to know?

365
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,470
You guys are agents, right? Not lawyers.

366
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,940
It has to bother you that
a young woman like Sofia Salgado

367
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,842
was murdered using one of your guns.

368
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,577
I feel terrible about Ms. Salgado

369
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:25,484
and every victim of gun violence

370
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:28,255
killed by my weapons or any weapons.

371
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,223
I make guns.

372
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,993
I don't get to choose
how people use them.

373
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:34,494
Nobody goes after the carmakers

374
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,397
when a driver intentionally
runs someone down.

375
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,733
Is that your vision for
the world, Mr. Kemp?

376
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:43,025
That we only care about people,
about human life,

377
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,006
when the law explicitly
tells us we have to?

378
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,508
Oh, sorry, I thought I was with the FBI,

379
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,610
not The Brady Campaign.

380
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:51,978
Look, I'm a member of the NRA,

381
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,313
and I believe in the Second Amendment,

382
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,881
but what you do,

383
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,150
pouring more and more weapons
into high-crime areas...

384
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,953
that has nothing to do with
keeping a well-regulated militia

385
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,755
and everything to do with making a buck.

386
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,758
And I make more of it every time
a shooting goes viral.

387
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:08,862
Not only am I not stopping,
I'm ramping up production.

388
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,965
In fact, I just ordered shipment
of 6,000 FineCals

389
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,466
from my factory in Atlanta

390
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,124
to my distribution center in Chicago.

391
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:18,205
We're done here.

392
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,308
Mr. Kemp's attorney just secured
a hearing on his arrest.

393
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,547
Is this a great country, or what?

394
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,751
You watch the cars.

395
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,621
All day, Raymond, that's what he does.

396
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:35,589
He watches the cars.

397
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,724
I know what I saw, Raymond.

398
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,392
She's watching.

399
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,094
Nobody's watching, Frank.

400
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:42,963
This isn't happening.

401
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,064
Tell him.

402
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:46,234
There was no car when I came.

403
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,935
Ever since that woman
broke into our apartment

404
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,561
and dragged him off and tried to
access his memories...

405
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,975
I mean, whatever they did to his...

406
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,309
Linda, stop.

407
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,703
It's okay.

408
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,781
Things in our life were normal and quiet

409
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,606
and ordinary before you came back.

410
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,853
And I know the two of you share a past

411
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,177
I can't even begin to imagine,

412
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,192
but Frank and I had a life, too.

413
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:13,719
Together.

414
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,652
Our life was good.

415
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,432
It's his life with you that's troubled.

416
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:21,201
Is it fair to blame Raymond?

417
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,937
Listen to your wife.

418
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,005
You're sick, Frank.

419
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:29,109
Something is wrong,
and we need to get you help.

420
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,569
She's right.

421
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:33,513
You need help.

422
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,348
There are people I know who...

423
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:36,503
Raymond.

424
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,952
You don't understand.

425
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:42,081
We need to do this on our own.

426
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:03,076
I'm sorry I ever dragged you into this.

427
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,483
I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:18,959
You did the right thing, Raymond.

429
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,227
Too little, too late, I'm afraid.

430
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,997
I never should have
involved him, let alone her.

431
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,666
A whole...

432
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,170
I'll be damned.

433
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,805
Good for you, Ilya.

434
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,040
There's someone in the driver's seat.

435
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,885
I wonder what the hell this means.

436
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:42,248
Thank you for joining us,
Director Cooper.

437
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,950
Before making record in open court,

438
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,419
I thought it best to have
a private conference.

439
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,743
- Your Honor...
- Not you.

440
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,390
I'm here to hear what he has to say.

441
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:51,925
Director Cooper, I assume you knew

442
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,293
this arrest would be controversial,

443
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:54,527
and yet, you did it anyway.

444
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,729
- Reluctantly.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,297
Because I believe Mr. Kemp knew

446
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,132
Ms. Ambers wasn't the actual
buyer of those guns.

447
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,600
He was conspiring to sell them

448
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:02,235
to someone prohibited from buying them.

449
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,837
My client had no way to know that.

450
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,139
You've seen the video.
Carly Ambers is 24,

451
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:09,075
a pawn being used by her
boyfriend, a two-time felon.

452
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,377
She was visibly nervous...

453
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:12,145
Is that the legal standard now?

454
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,981
Is my client supposed to assume
customers who seem nervous

455
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:16,850
are buying their weapons
on behalf of criminals?

456
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,284
She was paying in cash,

457
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:20,120
a classic indication of
an illegitimate purchase.

458
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:23,189
Your Honor, my client is a
manufacturer, not a mind reader.

459
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,859
Bottom line, Carly Ambers
can pass a background check.

460
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:28,194
He's not obligated to
investigate who her boyfriend is

461
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:29,796
or anything else about her.

462
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,531
His arrest is all over the press.

463
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:33,033
This is outrageous.

464
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:36,069
What's outrageous is Mr. Kemp's
disregard for reality.

465
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,038
Your Honor, you know what happened here.

466
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,939
Carly Ambers didn't wake up one morning

467
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:42,642
and suddenly decide to collect
60 identical guns

468
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,110
over the span of four months.

469
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:46,079
That is unreasonable to believe.

470
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:47,514
She doesn't own any other guns.

471
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,049
She doesn't know anything about guns.

472
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:51,751
Objection. She's not required
to own other guns,

473
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,821
and Mr. Kemp is not obligated
to test her knowledge.

474
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,423
The dealer knew there were red flags.

475
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,558
He warned Mr. Kemp that
she might be a straw purchaser.

476
00:21:58,582 --> 00:21:59,859
It is not apparent what was said.

477
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,361
The audio is poor.

478
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,797
And my client clearly didn't
hear that warning.

479
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,365
That's for the jury to decide.

480
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:06,900
Well, I'm not even sure you get to a jury

481
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:08,890
with the facts before me now.

482
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,971
Oh, okay. I see what's going on here.

483
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,973
You called us into chambers
because Your Honor

484
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:16,443
didn't want the public to see
you toss a valid arrest.

485
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,944
- Watch it, Director.
- Watch what?

486
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:19,312
We're off the record.
What are you afraid of,

487
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:21,181
incurring the wrath of the gun lobby?

488
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:23,349
Mm-hmm. I've heard enough.

489
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,651
All right, get out. All of you.

490
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,252
I will review the evidence

491
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:28,343
and let the parties know
when I have my ruling.

492
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,807
We are on the record.

493
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,309
So, let me be clear...

494
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,211
It is not for this court to tell the FBI

495
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,979
how to do its job or who to arrest.

496
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:41,216
But I do note, however,
that the U.S. Attorney's Manual,

497
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,785
FBI Handbook,
and Justice Department policy

498
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,187
says that no prosecutor will bring a case

499
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:47,622
that he does not have a reasonable belief

500
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,190
- that he can win.
- We believe we can win.

501
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:51,348
Yes, but you face
an extremely high burden.

502
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,663
You need to prove that Mr. Kemp knew...

503
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,564
or he should have known...

504
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,099
that he was actually selling those guns

505
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,168
to a prohibited buyer. Hmm?

506
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,870
And don't get me wrong,
straw purchases...

507
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,505
serious problem in this country.

508
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,873
There may be more than 30,000

509
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:06,508
attempted straw purchases every year,

510
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,043
but the seriousness of the problem

511
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,611
does not change the requirements

512
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,668
for what the government needs
to make its case.

513
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:17,152
Well, Ms. Ambers' age and
the volume of the purchases...

514
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,688
they're facts that
certainly give me pause,

515
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,189
but are they enough to conclude

516
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,991
that Mr. Kemp and his associates

517
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,915
committed a federal criminal offense?

518
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,795
I think not.

519
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,031
I find the evidence insufficient
to sustain the charges.

520
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:33,601
Therefore, in the interest of
justice and judicial economy,

521
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,437
this case is dismissed without prejudice.

522
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,439
- May I address the court?
- No, you may not.

523
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:39,274
You have my ruling.

524
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:40,575
The matter is sealed,

525
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,599
and the defendant will be released.

526
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:44,913
We are adjourned.

527
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:46,937
Hey, I respect you for trying.

528
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,883
It's not just about passing new laws.

529
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:50,919
We should be doing more to
enforce the laws we have.

530
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,487
Murderer!

531
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,389
Selling the gun that killed her
wasn't enough?

532
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,691
Now you have to lie about
her being a gang member?

533
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:59,227
We don't make the facts, Mrs...

534
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,299
That's assault.

535
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:05,934
Aren't you gonna arrest her?

536
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,936
Get your client out of here

537
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,238
before someone does something even worse.

538
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:26,777
Drive.

539
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,160
You heard Judge Borns
dismissed the case against Kemp?

540
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,329
Yes. Elizabeth brought me up to speed.

541
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,263
Then I assume she also mentioned
Kemp's next shipment?

542
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,432
She did.

543
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,734
I know Agent Keen is frustrated.
We all are.

544
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:41,870
But the law says
Kemp can ship those guns.

545
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,405
How did Dickens put it?

546
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,796
If the law says that,
then the law is an ass.

547
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:49,699
I want your word that you won't
interfere with that transport.

548
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,770
Frankly, Harold, the thought
hadn't even occurred to me.

549
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,383
But now that you mention it,

550
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,253
that sounds like a rather splendid idea.

551
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,355
Listen to me. I know
we've looked the other way

552
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,049
or even helped blur the lines

553
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:03,880
from time to time
in the interest of justice,

554
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:05,593
but going after a legal shipment

555
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,529
because you personally believe
it deserves to be stopped

556
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,831
is over the line, and I won't allow it.

557
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,166
Well, how are you going to do that?

558
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,423
By sending me to my room without supper?

559
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:15,325
By stopping you.

560
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,861
Touché.

561
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:24,030
Heddie, I need you to reach
out to Chuck and Morgan

562
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,413
and some of the boys.

563
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,981
I believe we have a job to do.

564
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:30,819
You can't be serious.

565
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,287
You expect me to trust you?

566
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,722
We understand your reservations,
but the fact is,

567
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:36,791
the last time we met,
we were just doing our jobs.

568
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:38,493
And that's what we're doing now...

569
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,562
informing you of a threat made
to your next gun shipment.

570
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,063
What kind of a threat?

571
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,531
The FBI has credible intelligence

572
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,800
that your next transport
from Atlanta to Chicago

573
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,302
will be hit in transit.

574
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,536
What kind of intelligence?

575
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,427
We're not at liberty to say.

576
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:52,474
You're not at liberty to...

577
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:54,843
Oh, I see what's going on.

578
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,211
You think you can scare me

579
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,946
so I'll give you details of my shipment.

580
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,614
If you can't stop me,

581
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:01,416
this way, you can track
where the guns are going.

582
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,809
Mr. Kemp, we're here as federal agents

583
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,854
because your shipment is in jeopardy.

584
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,857
Personal feelings aside,
we're here to assist you.

585
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,625
Pass. I have my own security.

586
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,293
Of course, if you refuse,
we can get a court order

587
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,262
- and stop transit altogether.
- On what grounds?

588
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,664
Our intel makes transporting
the guns on a public highway

589
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:17,832
inherently hazardous.

590
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,300
Look, you can fight us,

591
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:21,169
or you can accept our assistance.

592
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,707
What a waste of tax dollars.

593
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,775
So glad the Bureau could be of service.

594
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,620
What do you think?

595
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:39,287
It's a bold plan.

596
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,556
You're gonna need to keep your distance.

597
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,325
Agreed. I'll hang out on the jet.

598
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,784
Edward's gonna make a run
to this restaurant he loves...

599
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:50,098
China Moonlight...

600
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,534
for some of that tea-smoked duck.

601
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:53,935
You should look at the menu.

602
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,303
If everything goes as planned,

603
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,172
we'll be in and out by dusk

604
00:26:57,196 --> 00:26:59,685
and have dinner on the flight home.

605
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:02,689
- Are we ready?
- Good to go.

606
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:05,367
I've got three routes mapped out
and agents are on-site.

607
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,080
Talk to me.

608
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:09,144
We're looking at three identical trucks.

609
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,746
Is this really necessary?

610
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,481
Unless you want your shipment
hijacked, it is.

611
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,150
Can't you just protect
the one with the guns?

612
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,651
We roll all three.

613
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,621
Two haul empty containers,
only one carries the guns.

614
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:20,756
Each truck will take
a different route to Chicago

615
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,292
and be led by an FBI vehicle
with four armed agents.

616
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:26,429
Fine. Just let me know which one is real,

617
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:28,598
and I'll tell my people to load it up.

618
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,499
I can track each route via satellite.

619
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,934
Just need to know which one's real.

620
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,370
Keen, I want you chaperoning
the real shipment.

621
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:37,039
Agents Park and Ressler
will escort the decoys.

622
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,875
Perhaps Reddington will be more reticent

623
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:40,765
about hijacking the vehicle you're with.

624
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,312
We have a problem.

625
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:45,603
The Task Force is escorting the shipment.

626
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,901
Harold couldn't leave it alone.

627
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,454
No matter. We stay with the plan.

628
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,956
There's more. They're rolling
three identical trucks.

629
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,391
We're only prepared to stop one.

630
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:56,826
We'll have to guess and get lucky.

631
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,228
Lucky? There's no luck
in Three Card Monte.

632
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:01,731
- It's a sucker's game.
- And we're the ones being hustled.

633
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:04,567
I don't play sucker's games,
and I don't like to guess.

634
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,084
I'll call you back.

635
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,113
All right, we're ready to roll out.

636
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,447
Stand by for my command.

637
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:20,683
Checking CCTV feeds.

638
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:22,818
Confirming all routes are clear.

639
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,292
Not now.

640
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,060
Elizabeth... Not a good time.

641
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,762
I-I know about Harold's decoys.

642
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,897
I need to know which truck has the goods.

643
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,348
- Cameras are up.
- Agent Ressler, you have the all-clear.

644
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:39,190
Okay, let's load up.

645
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,470
I can't talk.

646
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:42,838
Then just listen.

647
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,941
Because while Harold may be dedicated

648
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,776
to getting this shipment through,

649
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,211
I am equally dedicated to stopping it.

650
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:52,214
Not for me or for the poor woman
who lost her life

651
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,984
to one of these guns but for her mother.

652
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:57,720
Could you imagine your only child

653
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,322
just about to go off to college...

654
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,390
how proud she must have been?

655
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:05,194
How proud Sam was when you got
into the FBI Academy.

656
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,330
- How proud you'll be...
- I'm hanging up now.

657
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,865
Elizabeth, please. Let me get these guns.

658
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,068
Hell, we'll sink the truck
in a lake somewhere.

659
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:13,502
Hey, Keen, you ready?

660
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,320
Copy that. On your go. I'm hanging up.

661
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:17,506
Keen, who are you talking to?

662
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,442
Theoretically, one should assume

663
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,344
Ressler would drive the shipment.

664
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:24,513
He's the most experienced
field agent, the obvious choice,

665
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:26,682
which is why perhaps it won't be him.

666
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:27,750
Keen.

667
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:29,852
And Agent Park... she's new.

668
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,021
I don't know. My hunch is,

669
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,757
Harold put the shipment with
the badass in the bunch.

670
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,459
I think it may be you.

671
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,761
Does your truck have the guns, Elizabeth?

672
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,029
Keep a bumper lock on that truck.

673
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,230
You, too. Eyes wide.

674
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:42,565
Elizabeth, please.

675
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:43,821
Is that Reddington?

676
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:46,535
Yes, and I was just explaining
to him that we have a job to do.

677
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,437
Listen, you don't have to say a thing.

678
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:51,107
I'll count to 10. If it's not your truck,

679
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,143
hang up before I get there,
but if it is your truck,

680
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,679
stay on the line
till after the count of 10.

681
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:58,681
1, 2... Tell Reddington I'm sorry,

682
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,349
but he's on the wrong side
of history this time...

683
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:02,351
...3, 4, 5, 6...
...and if he thinks we're gonna break

684
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,453
or even bend the law
because of his opinion

685
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:06,489
- on this issue,
- he's dead-wrong.

686
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,690
...7, 8...

687
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:09,291
All right, here we go.

688
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:11,127
- 9...
- Understood?

689
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:12,169
10.

690
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,964
Yes, sir. Understood.

691
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,866
Thank you, Elizabeth.

692
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,307
They're leaving now.

693
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:29,845
Okay, Agent Ressler, stay south
on 21 toward Independence.

694
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,480
Copy that, Aram.

695
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:34,316
Agent Park, CCTV shows you are clear.

696
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,485
So you want to take the second exit.

697
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,287
Confirm, second exit.

698
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:39,688
Affirmative, second exit.

699
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,323
Stay on 65?

700
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:43,793
Yes, Agent Keen, that is right.

701
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:47,596
Stay on State Road 65 for 12 miles.

702
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,473
Aram, we're on Talmadge
approaching Younes.

703
00:30:57,497 --> 00:30:59,175
There's smoke on the horizon.

704
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,077
Do you show any hazards ahead?

705
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,878
Smoke. Hang on.

706
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,547
Uh, no.

707
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,572
Uh, no, there are no accidents
reported in that area.

708
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:11,420
Don't stop.

709
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,589
I have to. Road's blocked.

710
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:15,191
Driver, lock down the cab.

711
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:16,725
Do not exit the vehicle.

712
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,417
You three, watch for an ambush.

713
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,065
Heddie, what's happening?

714
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,267
Hang tight, sugar plumb.

715
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,837
They're approaching us right now.

716
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,877
Officer, I'm with the FBI.

717
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,334
Hands.

718
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,915
Cooper, it's a trap.
We've been hit. It's a trap.

719
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,851
Put them up. You're under arrest.

720
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,860
Heddie, what's happening?

721
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:52,194
What's wrong, Heddie?

722
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:53,687
It's empty.

723
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,231
The truck's empty.

724
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:57,032
We hit the wrong convoy.

725
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,768
- That can't be.
- Babe, it is.

726
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:04,773
Thank you, Mr. Reddington.

727
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,709
It was a pleasure doing business.

728
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,653
Any problems?

729
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:18,888
No. None.

730
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,048
You lied to me.

731
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,054
When you told me
I'd be carrying the guns,

732
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,890
you knew you were sending them
with Ressler.

733
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:48,693
- Yes.
- That whole conversation was fake,

734
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,018
put on for my benefit so that
I'd think I'd have the guns?

735
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,832
You don't trust me.

736
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,956
I'm sorry, are you actually angry at me?

737
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:57,652
You betrayed us.

738
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,621
You told Reddington which truck to hit.

739
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,323
I was right not to trust you.

740
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:04,326
You chose them over us,
over your job, over the law.

741
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,394
Some laws deserve to be broken.

742
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,762
Not by you, not while
you're carrying a badge.

743
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,934
You knew I would tell him?

744
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,269
I thought you might,

745
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,936
and I couldn't take that chance.

746
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:20,731
I'm angry at you, Elizabeth,
and disappointed.

747
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,111
But, most of all, I'm worried.

748
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,180
With Reddington,
we blur the lines so often,

749
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,280
it's sometimes hard to see,
for all of us.

750
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:30,452
What worries me is that, at times,

751
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,843
it could be especially hard for you.

752
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,914
Because I have dark impulses.

753
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,041
Yeah.

754
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:41,837
And today, you gave into them.

755
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,770
So what now?

756
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:54,576
I just delivered 6,000 guns

757
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,894
to a man I believe to have
no moral compass.

758
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,773
God knows how many people
may die as a result.

759
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,475
Today was a terrible day.

760
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,378
And it might be more than I can handle

761
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,950
if I thought you and I
couldn't forgive each other.

762
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:16,820
So I was right.

763
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,889
You were.

764
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,104
Where will you go?

765
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,172
I don't know yet.

766
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:27,342
Some place far away.

767
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,903
Whoever it was, it wasn't her.

768
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,606
She's dead.

769
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,642
Good.

770
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:41,104
Because she did this to him.

771
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,941
I'll look into it.

772
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,651
I'll take care of this.

773
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:52,000
All you need to do is take care
of yourself, stay safe.

774
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,922
Dembe! Perfect timing.

775
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,925
Here is the "Scrabble"
and the "Parcheesi."

776
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,693
Thank you, these are great.

777
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,029
Are you sure board games are the
best tools for interrogation?

778
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,731
You'd be surprised.

779
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,734
The real breakthrough actually
happened during "Oregon Trail."

780
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:28,470
And then there was such
a great feeling of comfort

781
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,672
and familiarity with
"Chutes and Ladders."

782
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,974
A real sense of nostalgia.

783
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,468
Did she tell you who hired her

784
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,177
- to watch Ilya?
- Not yet.

785
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,246
But I think you're gonna be
very surprised

786
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,116
with the level of detail we're
going to get with "Scrabble."

787
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,322
Okeydokey. Here we go.

788
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,396
Yeah, everything's accounted for.

789
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,997
Midwest shipments are going out now.

790
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,967
Thanks to the FBI, should be
our best quarter yet.

791
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,035
I'll see you in the morning.

792
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:06,231
Who are you?

793
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,176
What do you want?

794
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,245
I want you to come have a seat.

795
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,298
You know, for my entire
professional life,

796
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:36,304
I've been a fervent and faithful
support of gun manufacturers.

797
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:39,074
These people take great pride

798
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:43,059
in their history
and exquisite craftsmanship.

799
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:48,071
The guns they make
are the tools of my trade.

800
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,519
In the right hand,
that's exactly what they are.

801
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,069
A proper tool.

802
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,056
For sport.

803
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,531
Protection.

804
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,867
Order.

805
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:02,764
In the wrong hands...

806
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:05,123
the hands you put your guns in...

807
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,376
they subvert order,

808
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,439
tearing communities apart,

809
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,608
ruining lives,

810
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,634
resulting in tragedy.

811
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:19,803
You're Raymond Reddington.

812
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:29,112
I've lost so many friends
to gun violence.

813
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,560
Dear friends.

814
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,728
Not 'cause of me.

815
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,863
Not 'cause of anything I did.

816
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:36,097
Yes, yes, of course.

817
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,900
You dot the I's, cross the T's,

818
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,292
and, in your world,
those rules protect you.

819
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,706
But in my world,

820
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,143
there are no laws to hide behind.

821
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,712
You can act in bad faith

822
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:54,916
as long as you're willing
to face the consequences.

823
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,418
What consequences?

824
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,809
The wrath of men like me.

825
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:02,223
I object to what you're doing,

826
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:07,796
and I don't need to convince
any court to agree with me.

827
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,438
In my world, if I think you're guilty...

828
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:14,002
I just execute sentence.

829
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,692
Please.

830
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,872
Please, don't do this.

831
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,113
I heard... heard someone else

832
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,528
beg at the point of one of your guns.

833
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,535
She said please, too.

834
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,950
And then she was murdered.

835
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:46,267
Now, I understand it can be hard
to see tragedy for what it is

836
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:50,061
until that tragedy befalls you
or a loved one.

837
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,815
Well, I'm here to tell you
that's happening to you.

838
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,045
About an hour ago,

839
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:00,682
a violent criminal bought
one of your FineCal 9s

840
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,717
on the street for $100,

841
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,887
and now that criminal is
going to shoot you with it.

842
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,021
Tragic.

843
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:49,913
It was Cooper.

844
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,323
He tricked me.

845
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,136
You seem put out by it.

846
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,271
Don't be.

847
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:57,962
Take it as a compliment.

848
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:00,548
That he doesn't trust me?

849
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,979
That he knows you're a person of
conviction and principle.

850
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,138
A lot of good my principle did.

851
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:11,185
Kemp got all of his guns.

852
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,939
Yes.

853
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,949
He got his.

854
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,829
What did you do?

855
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:27,535
I acted on my conviction and principle.

856
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:37,912
Cooper says we blur the line
between right and wrong

857
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,317
so often, we can't see it
clearly anymore.

858
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:45,620
I know I can't.

859
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,681
I disagree. I find you
increasingly clear-eyed.

860
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,496
I'm sorry that the Task Force
had to take sides today,

861
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,300
but it meant a great deal to me
to know you were on mine.

862
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,361
Excuse me.

863
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,041
Any news?

864
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,177
The woman in the blue Malibu...

865
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,834
She's a private eye, Raymond.

866
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:13,830
Hired to learn what she can about Ilya.

867
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,374
It was Elizabeth.

868
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:19,420
She hired her.

869
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:20,888
She knows you're not Ilya

870
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,880
and she's been keeping it from you.

871
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,331
I understand.

872
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,168
Is everything all right?

873
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,497
To being on the same side.

874
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:43,344
At long last.

1
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:32,309
Hey, Hatcher.

2
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,345
Coroner's finished with
the scatter at the tree line.

3
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,414
Probably got another seven
or eight down there.

4
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:37,524
So they're released?

5
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,450
Yep. All yours.

6
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,556
The feds say we're clear.
Start bringing the victims up.

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,991
Take a team to the tree line

8
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,485
and start moving 'em to the morgue.

9
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,255
Here's the next one, Hatcher.

10
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,064
Hello, Mr. Geller.

11
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,650
- Hey.
- Hello.

12
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,052
You must be Crystal.

13
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,253
One and only.

14
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,655
You look different
than your profile picture.

15
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,305
You look the same.

16
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:55,341
Better.

17
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:58,933
Please. Why don't you come in.

18
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,155
I don't understand.
Over the phone, you said...

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,958
- I know what I said.
- If you're a cop...

20
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:11,128
Please, I didn't ask you here
for sex.

21
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:12,663
Not like you think.

22
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,785
It's something different.

23
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,001
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,789
Angela, sit down.

25
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:21,541
How do you know my real name?

26
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,207
Who are you?

27
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,976
I'm someone who knows more about you

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,214
than you might want to believe.

29
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,048
I know about your father.

30
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:35,186
I know about the medical debt,
the collectors.

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,554
I said who are you?

32
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:38,289
Angela, there is something

33
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,490
that I would like to tell you.

34
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:40,858
Something very special

35
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,227
that might just change your life.

36
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,635
Would you like to hear about it?

37
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,344
_

38
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,499
Already looked there.

39
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:05,349
There, too.

40
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,124
You do know I'm a private investigator.

41
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,511
You were made.

42
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,629
Ilya obviously knew
you were watching him.

43
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:19,964
Maybe that wouldn't have happened

44
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:22,033
if you'd been honest
about why you hired me.

45
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,200
I was honest.

46
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,970
I hired you to find Koslov
so I could question him.

47
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:28,573
Does this look like a man
who's running from questions?

48
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,541
He's running for his life.

49
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,096
Now, why would he do that?

50
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:38,349
They came here to the mosque,

51
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:41,319
said that some of our members
are communicating

52
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:42,920
with Syrian jihadists.

53
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:44,622
The FBI came?

54
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,257
Counterterrorism division.

55
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:48,359
They wouldn't tell me what they know.

56
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:49,727
Maybe they'll tell you.

57
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,798
He knows about the Task Force.

58
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,425
Does he?

59
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,133
I wouldn't be much of a shepherd

60
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:58,903
if I didn't know the hearts
and minds of my flock.

61
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:01,138
Excuse me.

62
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,749
I'll see what I can do.

63
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,244
Is it done?

64
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:08,779
My job is to find people,

65
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,615
not to keep them from being found.

66
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,683
- Is it done?
- It is.

67
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,453
Wherever Koslov went,
she's never gonna find him.

68
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:16,782
Good.

69
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,993
Imam Asmal is grateful for the help.

70
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,583
We both are.

71
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,431
Elizabeth knows I'm not Ilya.

72
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,467
I wonder what else she knows.

73
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,369
Perhaps you should ask her.

74
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,340
She's waiting in the park.

75
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,875
You have a case.

76
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,511
From my days in the Mobile Psych Unit.

77
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,599
I'd like to dig into it.

78
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:45,583
If it's important to you,
then it's important to me.

79
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,151
You're sure you don't mind?

80
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:48,352
Of course not.

81
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,821
That's what's so nice
about us finally being

82
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,125
on the same side of things, same agenda.

83
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,826
No subterfuge.

84
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,194
What you want, I want.

85
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,463
And you're okay with my
involving the team.

86
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,699
I am. In fact, I insist.

87
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:03,829
Idle hands and all that.

88
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:08,973
But I would like you to look
into something for me.

89
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,032
Of course.

90
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,576
It's about Dembe's... imam.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,812
- Is there something wrong?
- I don't know yet.

92
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,347
That's what I need to find out.

93
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:18,416
But first, tell me about this

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,139
cold case of yours.

95
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,186
They called him the Boneyard Killer.

96
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,855
His first victim was found
just outside Rehoboth Beach

97
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,858
when local police exhumed a body
for autopsy.

98
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:31,662
What they found was a second
body buried in that same grave.

99
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,031
A young woman
four feet below the surface,

100
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,667
resting just above
a freshly buried coffin...

101
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,102
murdered and hidden

102
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,004
in the last place
anyone would ever look for her.

103
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,040
Since then, three women
have been discovered this way

104
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:45,643
in graveyards in Virginia
and West Virginia.

105
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,878
He was using the cemeteries as dumpsites.

106
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,114
Anything significant about
the graves that were chosen?

107
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:52,717
- They were fresh. Easy to dig.
- And the victims?

108
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,186
All young women
with a history of sex work.

109
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,754
Okay, this is, uh, terrible,

110
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,756
but sex workers are
like 20 times more likely

111
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,658
to be targeted by serial killers.

112
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:04,128
True, but none of his victims
were sexually assaulted,

113
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:05,830
no sign of defensive wounds,

114
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:08,599
no pre- or postmortem mutilation.

115
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:10,334
But the way he killed them...

116
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:11,869
we found dirt in their airways.

117
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,604
They were alive when he buried them.

118
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:14,972
Alive, yes.

119
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,607
And unconscious.

120
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:19,176
Pumped so full of sodium thiopental,

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,011
- they'd never wake up.
- I don't understand.

122
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:23,314
He drugged them so they'd die
in their sleep?

123
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,583
- Why would he do that?
- He didn't want them to suffer.

124
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:27,618
The case went cold until a week ago,

125
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:29,687
when flash floods hit Montgomery

126
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:33,290
and upended a few graves
at Greenfare Cemetery,

127
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,693
including one unidentified body

128
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,228
that wasn't supposed to be there.

129
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,830
Initial forensics suggest she was sedated

130
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:41,732
and buried alive just like the others.

131
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,367
Has the Bureau reached out to you?

132
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,735
No, and they're not going to.

133
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,103
They asked me to leave the case.

134
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,873
They said my profile wasn't... additive.

135
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:50,908
- So this is your cold case.
- Yes.

136
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,511
What do you mean they thought
your profile wasn't "additive"?

137
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,045
I don't think he wants to kill.

138
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,348
I think he's mimicking these profiles

139
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:59,049
in order to hide some other agenda.

140
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,217
What, I don't know,

141
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,786
but I think he finds satisfaction

142
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,488
in something other than the act
of the crime itself.

143
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:05,723
Whatever his motive,

144
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:07,458
these bodies were found by chance,

145
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,692
and we can't wait for another.

146
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:10,571
Talk to the M.E. See what he knows.

147
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,653
Let's hope this newest tragedy
will help you find this guy.

148
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:18,658
Uh, sir, can I ask for another favor?

149
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,190
Reddington says that counterterrorism

150
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,873
is sniffing around Dembe's imam.

151
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,608
He wants to know what they found.

152
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:25,643
What were they looking for?

153
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,178
Syrian jihadists.

154
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:30,481
Some of the congregants may be
involved with Tahrir al-Sham.

155
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,216
But Dembe thinks that's impossible.

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,106
I'll make a few calls.

157
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,291
Ilya Koslov is out there somewhere,

158
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:41,826
and I have no idea where.

159
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,561
Do you know what your mother
wanted from him?

160
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:47,064
I don't. But she said
her life depended on it.

161
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:49,433
You were right.

162
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,302
I looked at the original case files,

163
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:54,961
and this does appear to be
the work of the same killer.

164
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,165
I have ID'd her as one Mara Lynne James.

165
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,745
Now, the forensic evidence
on your previous victims

166
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,991
was limited, but this woman...

167
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,454
the cold slowed the growth of bacteria,

168
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,985
so I have a better picture
of what happened.

169
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,053
Suffocation?

170
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:10,421
With sodium thiopental

171
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,511
to sedate her beforehand.

172
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:13,912
Soil in the lungs.

173
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,814
Same lack of any defensive wounds.

174
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:17,716
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?

175
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,975
No, but she was sexually active.

176
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,824
She had a baby.

177
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,227
The degree of scarring
around the incision

178
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,496
suggests she gave birth
no more than a month

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,398
before she was killed.

180
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,075
Okay, now one more big push.

181
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,344
- C'mon. You can do it.
- Come on. Push.

182
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,182
You did it.

183
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:53,485
Is everything okay?

184
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,853
Isn't he supposed to cry or some...

185
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:56,755
Yes, she is.

186
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,480
It's a girl.

187
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,360
Rest. Please.

188
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,565
We have work to do.

189
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:17,624
I tried to get off the streets.

190
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,616
We both did.

191
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,252
We had every resource to help her.

192
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,988
We apologize for coming
at such a difficult time.

193
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,389
We're sorry for your loss.

194
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:27,624
We want you to know
that we've deployed

195
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,359
our Child Abduction Response team

196
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:31,194
and alerted every law enforcement agency

197
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:32,796
in the country.

198
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,119
What for?

199
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:36,666
To find Mara's child.

200
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,024
Mara didn't have a child.

201
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:43,473
According to the M.E., she gave
birth a month before she passed.

202
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:44,975
A baby?

203
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,010
Did she have a man in her life?

204
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,279
A man?

205
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:52,015
You do know what she did for a living?

206
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,460
Did she talk about anyone in particular?

207
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,919
Yeah, she talked.
She talked all the time.

208
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,120
None of it was ever true.

209
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,855
Nancy James, if you know something

210
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,591
that could help that child...

211
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,632
A year ago...

212
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,532
10 months maybe,

213
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:13,558
she said she met a guy,
a big fish.

214
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:16,595
- Did she tell you his name?
- No.

215
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,665
Just that he had a plan.

216
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,833
A way for her to get out.

217
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,215
CTD and MPD will be here in 20.

218
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,650
I can't hold them off any longer.

219
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,452
Did the Bureau do this?

220
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:30,787
Has my imam been arrested?

221
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,089
CTD says no, but based on their findings,

222
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:34,057
maybe they should've.

223
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,758
The case file Agent Keen asked for.

224
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:37,427
Apparently, two members
have been smuggling

225
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,329
shipping containers in and out of Syria.

226
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,093
- For Tahrir al-Sham?
- Unclear.

227
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,032
We don't know what's being
shipped or by whom.

228
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,402
These members in the file.
I've seen them at the services.

229
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,627
- I don't see them as a threat.
- Then where are they?

230
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,907
As soon as you called about the
abduction, we put out a BOLO.

231
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,909
But it appears as if they're long gone.

232
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,444
Along with Imam Asmal.

233
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,079
The Bureau didn't do him any favors

234
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,747
by questioning him here in the mosque.

235
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:01,102
Made it appear as if he knew
something and might talk.

236
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,053
Can you be sure he didn't know?

237
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:06,945
If he said he didn't know,
he didn't know.

238
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,958
What was the port of origin?

239
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:11,494
Latakia, Syria. Why?

240
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,230
Ironically, smuggling on a large scale

241
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:17,367
is a profitable
yet surprisingly small club.

242
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,957
And ever since civil war
broke out in Syria,

243
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:23,473
the margins on everything
from weapons to medical supplies

244
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:26,943
to narcotics to food
going in and out of the country

245
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,479
have been particularly bodacious.

246
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,215
As such, there's plenty of room
for all the players.

247
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,151
Turf has been designated.
Territory agreed upon.

248
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:36,386
Who got Latakia?

249
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,288
A Greek fellow from Queens.

250
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,100
A-And Greece.

251
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,294
How's Mom? You doing okay?

252
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:46,996
Great.

253
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,498
Can't stop staring at her.

254
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:50,533
She is adorable. You're blessed.

255
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,468
I'm gonna run to the store,
but there was a call

256
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,437
while you two were asleep.
I didn't want to wake you.

257
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,739
An attorney. Geoffrey Entz.

258
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:59,142
He said you would know
what it was regarding.

259
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,843
Such a cute baby.

260
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,045
I'll see you soon.

261
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,663
I talked to him.

262
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,777
The lawyer? What did he say?

263
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:23,933
That he got the letter,

264
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,302
but he didn't want to discuss it
over the phone.

265
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,470
Did he ask to meet?

266
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:30,740
Yes, but I-I didn't think it
would be this soon.

267
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,675
- I'm not prepared.
- I told you, Angela.

268
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,737
I have it all worked out.

269
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,446
Like a script.

270
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,658
I'll coach you through everything.

271
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,087
Listen, I'm not in a good place
to talk right now,

272
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,332
so let me call you back.

273
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,805
I think I may have something.

274
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,707
As you may know, genetic material passes

275
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,676
from mother to child during pregnancy,

276
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,044
but what you may not know

277
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,246
is it also happens in reverse.

278
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,382
Fetal cells cross the placenta
and enter the mother's body,

279
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:16,953
making up as much as 10%
of the free-floating DNA

280
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,654
- in her bloodstream.
- How does that help us?

281
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:20,366
Well, with the M.E.'s help,

282
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,259
I was able to run the fetal DNA
from Mara James

283
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:26,262
against databases
from genetic testing services.

284
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,931
And with almost absolute certainty,

285
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:31,834
the father of her child is...

286
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,636
Jonathan McClaire.

287
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,338
- The self-help guru?
- The same.

288
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:36,672
Author of six books.

289
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,641
He runs workshops all around the world.

290
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,710
A married man living a public life

291
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,056
has a child with a prostitute?

292
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:44,847
Bring him in.
Find out what he has to say.

293
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,116
Right, uh, about that. Here's the thing.

294
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,618
He didn't kill her.

295
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:49,919
Well, how do you know that?

296
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:52,522
Because he died 11 months before

297
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,757
Mara James was murdered.

298
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,958
Kendra, what I am offering you

299
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,972
is a chance to change your life.

300
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,340
A way out.

301
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,910
And forget about debt
or your car payments.

302
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,567
This is far more than that.

303
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,902
If you can imagine,

304
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:23,219
I am the last man that you ever
have to meet in a hotel room.

305
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,806
Ever.

306
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,657
How much are we talking about?

307
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:38,214
Tell me again how this works.

308
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,948
That's it!

309
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,256
Mr. Korba, what a pleasure!

310
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,033
Your reputation precedes you.

311
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,603
Mine may not, so allow me
to introduce myself.

312
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,438
I know who you are. You don't scare me.

313
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,216
My heavens.

314
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,412
Is that A5 olive wagyu?

315
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,815
I didn't know you did business in Japan.

316
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,517
Or did these just fall off
a truck somewhere

317
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,587
on their circuitous journey
to Nobu Damascus?

318
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,289
I'm a legitimate businessman.

319
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,057
Yes, I'm sure you are.

320
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,392
But as it happens,

321
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,461
I'm not necessarily
interested in your beef.

322
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,898
I'm really here to discuss
Jalal Abbas and his friends,

323
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,468
and whatever they're bringing
into the country from Syria.

324
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,470
I may have the face of an angel,

325
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,206
but I'm not telling you anything.

326
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,540
On the contrary,

327
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,109
I think you're going to tell me
where they are

328
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,085
and what they're smuggling.

329
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,381
You think you're the first guy
to threaten me?

330
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,183
I'm not threatening you, Costas.

331
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,985
I'm threatening your livelihood.

332
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,822
Did you know these cows
that gave up their lives

333
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,624
to be here today

334
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,126
grew up on the island of Shodoshima?

335
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,163
And let me tell you,
those cows had it good.

336
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,899
Frolicking over sun-dappled hillsides,

337
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,970
dining on olive peels
from Japan's oldest plantation.

338
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:06,675
I'm told one cow can sell
for $40,000, $50,000 wholesale.

339
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:11,080
Rounding down, I'm probably
looking at 30 quarters.

340
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,617
Given the average rate
of cooling, once I kill the AC,

341
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,319
you've probably got, what, 45 minutes

342
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,788
before your half a million dollars

343
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,657
of umami-flavored goodness

344
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,726
will be worth less than a shinbone.

345
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,928
I don't know what they had
in those shipment containers.

346
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,096
I don't.

347
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,721
But you know where they went.

348
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,724
Yes. Yes, I do.

349
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:37,006
I didn't know the FBI
investigated car accidents.

350
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,909
We're not here about your
husband's death, Mrs. McClaire.

351
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,111
We'd like to talk about his
relationship with Mara James.

352
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,169
What did she tell you?

353
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,850
She signed a nondisclosure agreement.

354
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,752
Mara James is dead.

355
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,287
She was murdered.

356
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,954
Oh, my God.

357
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,823
That's awful.

358
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,958
You said she signed a contract.

359
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,298
My husband had an affair
that resulted in a child.

360
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,103
Ms. James approached our attorneys.

361
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:12,181
Jonathan had only recently
passed, and so I settled.

362
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,944
We didn't find a record
of any settlement.

363
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,612
It was sealed.

364
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,348
My husband's career was based on...

365
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,317
the appearance of a happy marriage.

366
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,155
Even now, I live off the book sales.

367
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,240
And sales would dry up if anyone
knew he'd been unfaithful.

368
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,816
So you agreed to a secret settlement.

369
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:36,539
Well, there was a DNA test, so I
know it was his child, but...

370
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,417
we were so happy.

371
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:46,675
I still can't believe he stepped
outside of our marriage.

372
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,219
What am I looking at?

373
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,788
The victims we found eight years ago.

374
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,190
Their bodies were so decomposed

375
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,891
they didn't have C-section scars
like Mara's,

376
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,026
but take a look at this.

377
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,028
Pockmarks along the pelvic bone

378
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,953
caused by ligaments tearing
during childbirth.

379
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,599
Our victims were all mothers.

380
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,168
If they all had babies, did they
all have secret settlements?

381
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,337
The point of secret settlements
is that they're secret.

382
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,272
It could take months to track
down the right courthouses

383
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,974
- and secure warrants.
- That's what I thought,

384
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,609
but it's a good thing we know a criminal

385
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,543
who can cut through the red tape.

386
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,029
I'll be obliged to take a sniff
in your company.

387
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:44,166
Yes, I understand your feeling
of obligation.

388
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,467
Ahh!

389
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,443
Mickey, how long have you been

390
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,645
the file clerk for the courthouse?

391
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,014
Must be going on 25 years.

392
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,150
Shepherding a national database

393
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,386
of pleadings and motions,
suits and countersuits.

394
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,923
Everyone's dirty little secrets.

395
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,360
Pearl's angina has been acting up.

396
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,418
Set us back a little more than usual.

397
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,390
Huh.

398
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,469
You're worth it at twice the price.

399
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,638
And Pearl is priceless.

400
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,976
Brother, you sure know
how to wet my whistle.

401
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,380
Yes, sir, you most certainly do.

402
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,781
Mmm!

403
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,749
Ahh!

404
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,107
So, what can I do you for?

405
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,354
Mr. Reddington pays for
his wife's angina medication?

406
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,023
Medication, hospital visits.

407
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,460
I get the impression he pays for
whatever the file clerk needs.

408
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,495
What have you found in the settlements?

409
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,897
I'm hoping it's enough
to justify the, shall we say,

410
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,933
unorthodox way in which we obtained them.

411
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:54,269
The victims we're aware of
all had children out of wedlock

412
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,838
with very wealthy men,

413
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,740
and they all made paternity
claims against the fathers,

414
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,741
which were all settled.

415
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,443
And within weeks of the agreements,

416
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,845
each of the women were murdered.

417
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,912
And the children?

418
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,647
We haven't found a single one.

419
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,375
- So, what have we found?
- Death certificates.

420
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,425
Turns out Jonathan McClaire
wasn't the only father who died

421
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:13,966
before the mother of his child.
They all did.

422
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,158
So five mothers who died
soon after giving birth,

423
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,994
and five fathers who died
soon after conception.

424
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,396
The men died in at least four states,

425
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,898
all in crazy accidents...

426
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,634
helicopter crash, a pileup on I-80.

427
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,936
Each event was investigated, but cleared.

428
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,972
No foul play. Nothing to connect them.

429
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,041
Nothing except for a name. Nyle Hatcher.

430
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,511
He signed one of their death
certificates in Pennsylvania,

431
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,678
which I thought was pretty odd,

432
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,714
considering he's a mortician in Bethesda.

433
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,048
So I kept digging.

434
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,518
Turns out he ID'd another victim
in Delaware

435
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,319
and notified next of kin
in West Virginia.

436
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,521
Doesn't make any sense.

437
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,156
A mortician from Bethesda

438
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,304
dealing with bodies from places
like Delaware and West Virginia.

439
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,353
According to his employment
records, he used to operate

440
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,463
a funeral home outside Rehoboth Beach.

441
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,503
Makes sense.
He had access to the cemetery.

442
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:59,334
And no one would question why
a mortician was hanging around.

443
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,442
- Did you get an address?
- 452 Elm,

444
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:04,173
the same as the mortuary
he currently operates...

445
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,041
Sweet Rest Funeral Home.

446
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,709
Keen, Ressler, get going.

447
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,752
Aram, pull a warrant.

448
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:13,151
When you got the settlements
from Reddington,

449
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:14,917
did he say anything about Dembe's imam?

450
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,418
He got a lead on the smugglers,

451
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,620
and I think he's going
to pay them a visit.

452
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,722
I don't suppose it would do
any good to remind him

453
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,890
that's our job.

454
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,091
He knows.

455
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,850
He just doesn't care.

456
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,464
Mr. Hatcher's out today.

457
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,366
Said he won't be in until Monday.

458
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,834
Said it's a family matter.

459
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,870
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

460
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,238
He's not answering.

461
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,106
Do you have any other way
of reaching him?

462
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,141
Not anymore.

463
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,826
He used to keep an apartment upstairs.

464
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,779
Now he only has his office.

465
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,581
We're gonna need
his current home address.

466
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,316
And access to that office.

467
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,851
Um, okay, but it's private.

468
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,220
I'm not allowed in there.

469
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,288
Well, that's okay. I am.

470
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,672
This is a warrant.

471
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,937
What the hell?

472
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,081
This woman, he's following her.

473
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,116
He's got all kinds of data.

474
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,164
Keen, what is it?

475
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,959
I'm not sure I want to know.

476
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,046
Kendra. Hi.

477
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,415
I'm, um, Agent Mojtabai.

478
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,617
You're, uh... You're not under arrest.

479
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,086
- Could've fooled me.
- Yeah. About that...

480
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,888
Let me... Let me get that for you.

481
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:58,159
If I'm not under arrest, why am I here?

482
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:01,989
To talk about a man named Nyle Hatcher.

483
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:06,327
In my line of work, I meet lots of men.

484
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:08,436
Right, um...

485
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,414
This one runs a funeral home.

486
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,333
And...

487
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:15,711
he murders women.

488
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,592
Yeah, I know the guy.

489
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,618
Hatcher was in Baltimore yesterday.

490
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:25,986
The ferry-boat accident.

491
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,088
Sixteen people drowned.

492
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,190
DMORT was deployed
to identify the victims.

493
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:32,293
The Disaster Mortuary
Operational Response Teams.

494
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,794
When there's a mass-casualty event,

495
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:36,197
morticians are brought in
to help identify the bodies,

496
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,365
assess cause of death.

497
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:38,733
The country is divided by region,

498
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,468
and based on where the victims
were found,

499
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:43,404
Hatcher operates with
Region III, which includes

500
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:46,507
D.C., Virginia, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland.

501
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:48,709
Which is why a Bethesda
mortician gets access

502
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,911
to rich men at crime scenes
up and down the East Coast.

503
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,947
Well, we know how Hatcher
interacted with the dead men.

504
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,883
But we still have no idea
what part he played... if any...

505
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:58,819
in the paternity cases
or the deaths of the mothers.

506
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,521
Actually, we do.

507
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:02,022
He didn't want to hook up.

508
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:03,524
I thought he did, but when I got there,

509
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:07,294
he knew everything about me...
family, money problems.

510
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:09,130
He said he could fix all that.

511
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,298
By getting you pregnant and
suing the father for paternity.

512
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,833
He said no one would get hurt,

513
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:14,869
that a rich dude
would be a little less rich.

514
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:16,480
And the baby?

515
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:18,939
He told me about these safe-haven laws

516
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:20,841
where you leave babies at fire stations

517
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,403
and they get adopted.

518
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,154
Adopted.

519
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,616
Because the father would already be dead.

520
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,160
Run that by me again.

521
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,353
We found sperm in his office.

522
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:35,823
There was a thermos, and in it,
uh, there was a sample.

523
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:38,325
- Sperm from a dead man?
- The rich dead man.

524
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,829
The one Hatcher s-selected
from his DMORT assignment.

525
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,531
Did the men use a-a donor bank?

526
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,266
Is that where he got the samples?

527
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,434
We don't think so.

528
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,302
Then what exactly do you think?

529
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:49,770
Hatcher inseminated the women

530
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:52,473
using semen he extracted
from the corpses.

531
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:56,076
Apparently, sperm is viable
up to 36 hours postmortem.

532
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,279
He extracts the sperm,
impregnates the mother,

533
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:00,147
who then makes an embarrassing
paternity claim

534
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,549
that's backed up by DNA.

535
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:04,118
Now, rather than risk a scandal,
the widow hushes it up

536
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,320
with a secret settlement
and no one's the wiser

537
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,889
because dead men tell no tales.

538
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,591
Even about their seed.

539
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,493
What about Kendra Taylor?

540
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,661
Is she pregnant?

541
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:15,262
You never met Roger Ashby?

542
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:17,164
No, the hookup was
supposed to be tomorrow.

543
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:19,700
Is that what Hatcher told you,
it was gonna be a hookup?

544
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,998
He didn't exactly say. Why?

545
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,637
Because Roger Ashby died yesterday

546
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,591
in a ferry-boat accident.

547
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:28,776
Like I said, all I know

548
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,064
is the hookup was gonna be
tomorrow, and after that,

549
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:32,780
I was supposed to make a claim
for child support.

550
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:34,348
Once the settlement was finalized,

551
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:38,174
Hatcher would take the money,
and you'd end up dead.

552
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,957
That's the last of it.

553
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,558
The money for you and your meal ticket

554
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:47,461
will be wired to the account
by end of business today.

555
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:54,034
Her name is Lily.

556
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:55,892
We're done here.

557
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,808
Hey, um, guys, so, uh...

558
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,376
Kendra says that
she and the target never met.

559
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,636
But that Hatcher told her
she'd be impregnated tomorrow.

560
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,682
By a man who died yesterday.

561
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:10,219
So what am I missing?

562
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:11,519
The birds and the bees?

563
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:13,387
Lemme tell you,
there's a whole new wrinkle.

564
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:14,755
I accessed Hatcher's hard drive.

565
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,056
He had a list of the fathers

566
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,424
and how much the widows agreed to pay.

567
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:19,126
We know all that
from the secret settlements.

568
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,861
You know almost all of it.

569
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:23,271
There was another name. Abraham Geller.

570
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:24,477
Wealthy hedge-fund guy.

571
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,166
Died in a plane crash 10 months ago.

572
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,335
Which might mean someone just
gave birth to his child...

573
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,037
and may have signed a settlement offer.

574
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,572
Or her death warrant.

575
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:33,807
You two, find the lawyer
who handles the Geller estate.

576
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,009
See what he knows.

577
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:37,344
Um, the birds and the bees?

578
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:39,079
What's the new wrinkle?

579
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,786
Did the transfer go through?

580
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,005
Just. You did well.

581
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:49,490
The hard part's over.

582
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:53,095
Your cut's over a hundred
thousand dollars, Angela.

583
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,697
So drop off the child
and meet me at Cedar Wind.

584
00:26:56,721 --> 00:27:00,256
I promise you, when you get
what's coming to you,

585
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,304
your life will change forever.

586
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:17,162
Agents Ressler and Park, FBI.

587
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:18,630
Uh, what can I do for you?

588
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:20,866
Was a paternity claim made
against Abraham Geller?

589
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,701
I don't discuss my clients' cases.

590
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,103
This isn't about your client.
It's about a woman's life.

591
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,672
I'm sure you can appreciate
this is privileged information.

592
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,708
Yes, but it's
a life-threatening situation.

593
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,377
What you know could save
Angela Hendrickson's life.

594
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,951
- Has she been here?
- Yeah.

595
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,284
To chisel a decent family
out of a small fortune.

596
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,516
So she signed a settlement
agreement. You wired the money?

597
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,419
I did. Less than an hour ago.

598
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:51,862
Mm.

599
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:57,936
I thought you'd be alone.

600
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,839
I... couldn't leave her.

601
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,707
I know it wasn't what we agreed to.

602
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,209
Oh, no, don't give it another thought.

603
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,011
I'm glad she's here.

604
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:08,113
I think every child should have
a loving home.

605
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:09,748
Just not yours.

606
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:20,008
I found her. Angela Hendrickson.

607
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,879
Now, she's not answering our
calls, but she received a call

608
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,254
outside a Rockville Fire station
30 minutes ago,

609
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:27,890
and her cell just pinged
a tower off county road 75.

610
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,258
What's the green area?

611
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,927
That is Cedar Wind Cemetery
in Livingston.

612
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,143
Oh, cemetery. That's bad.

613
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,964
- Ressler.
- That's, uh... That's really bad.

614
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:36,432
Ressler, we have a location.

615
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,501
Keen will meet you on-site.

616
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,826
Aww. Hey, baby.

617
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,436
We're almost finished.
We'll be home soon.

618
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,365
Oh, my.

619
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,068
Angela, I am so sorry.

620
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:14,578
I never meant for you to see this.

621
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,019
- Yeah?
- Jalal?

622
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,865
Who are you?

623
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:44,725
A friend from the mosque.

624
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,003
Aah!

625
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:50,406
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

626
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,309
Okay, okay! Okay!

627
00:29:57,738 --> 00:29:58,915
Go ahead.

628
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,829
Where is Imam Asmal?

629
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,697
I don't know. I don't.

630
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:16,599
- I'm sorry.
- You do.

631
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:18,301
Answer the question.

632
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:21,070
Hello, little girl.
We'll be home real soon.

633
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:26,976
Good heavens.

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,011
Hands! Put your hands in the air!

635
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,513
Got a baby here.

636
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,648
Where is she?!

637
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,350
Angela Hendrickson ...where?! I don't...

638
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,551
I don't know who that is.

639
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,253
Where is she, Nyle?

640
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,256
Which grave? I have no...

641
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,491
Answer me!

642
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:44,260
I have no earthly idea what you mean!

643
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:46,562
He doesn't want her to suffer,
so she's sedated,

644
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,698
but she may still be alive.

645
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,199
We need to fan out.

646
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,901
We're looking for a fresh grave.

647
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:54,092
There can't be many.

648
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,081
How do we get to the basement?

649
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:07,016
I don't have a basement.

650
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,638
Morgan.

651
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:49,859
Hey! I got something!

652
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,469
I feel something!

653
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:13,015
She's got a pulse.

654
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,585
Get on the radio! Call the paramedics!

655
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:30,922
What the hell?

656
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,846
_

657
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,271
_

658
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,549
Womens were brutalized,
how many were they?

659
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,036
I try not to think about them.

660
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,921
It wasn't personal.

661
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:04,116
I needed hosts willing to break the law,

662
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,375
and they did that just by
showing up at my hotel room.

663
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:11,223
Desperate and broke...

664
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:15,101
And what... dispensable?

665
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:19,364
It isn't my fault that nobody
cares when a prostitute dies.

666
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:22,442
No, people care. Families care.

667
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:27,239
This was never about killing those women.

668
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:33,995
Agent Keen, I have spent my life
surrounded by death...

669
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:38,450
surrounded by the pain
that comes with life's end,

670
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,185
the futility of it all.

671
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:41,887
It's a lonely existence.

672
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:44,322
One that I thought money could change.

673
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,024
So I came up with a way to steal money

674
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:49,161
from people that wouldn't care
that it was missing...

675
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:50,696
the dead.

676
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,619
I like to think of them as "donors."

677
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:55,000
But the donors required hosts...

678
00:33:55,024 --> 00:34:00,539
women who, sadly, needed to die
to protect the plan...

679
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:03,909
which is why I chose women
who needed to be freed

680
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:07,696
from their otherwise insufferable lives.

681
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:12,206
Finally, the plan requires a child.

682
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:15,087
What did you do with the children?

683
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:16,388
Well, I tell all the mothers

684
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:18,557
that I plan to give the newborns away.

685
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:21,059
Some mother don't like that,
and some, like Angela,

686
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,595
even try to keep their babies.

687
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:25,997
That upset me at first, until I realized

688
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:31,136
that the money those children
provided me wasn't the solution.

689
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,680
The children were the solution.

690
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:37,364
What does that mean?

691
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:40,045
It means I couldn't leave them
at the fire station

692
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,413
like I thought.

693
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:42,914
Means I needed them.

694
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:46,118
Means I couldn't let them go,
that they needed me.

695
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:47,519
Needed you?

696
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,255
Forging the adoption paperwork
wasn't cheap,

697
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,657
but money isn't a problem for me.

698
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:56,639
I just didn't want any of those
kids to grow up alone...

699
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,599
Like me, without a family.

700
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:04,236
They needed sisters and brothers.

701
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,138
Where are the kids, Nyle?

702
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:07,839
They're home.

703
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:09,574
They have all they need.

704
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:11,276
A loving father.

705
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,767
Unbelievable financial resources.

706
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,403
What's gonna happen to those kids?

707
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,317
What are they gonna say
when they find out what you did?

708
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:21,408
Oh, don't tell them what I did.

709
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:23,155
They don't need to know.

710
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,924
They gave me such a precious gift.

711
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,225
I mean, I was dead.

712
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:28,827
They brought me back to life.

713
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,585
All that matters are those kids' lives.

714
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,355
And with you in prison, they're
gonna be a whole lot better.

715
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:38,370
Imam Asmal.

716
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:40,105
I'm telling you I don't know.

717
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:41,539
Who are they?

718
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,042
Refugees seeking asylum.

719
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,279
Imam Asmal knows nothing of this.

720
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:49,281
I thought the FBI took him
because they thought he did.

721
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,879
And you have no ties to Tahrir al-Sham.

722
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:54,719
Me? I'm trying to save them
from Tahrir al-Sham.

723
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:58,178
The United States has made it
illegal for them to come here.

724
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,776
But the Prophet Muhammed teaches us

725
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,711
not to obey the created

726
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:05,314
if it means disobeying the Creator.

727
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,716
- Harold?
- CTD traced a cellphone

728
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,218
belonging to one of the extremists.

729
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:11,487
They traced it to a safe house
in West Adams.

730
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:12,922
Units are en route.

731
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:15,346
They're not extremists.
They're humanitarians.

732
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,760
Humanitarians took the imam?

733
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,196
How long do we have
before the troops arrive?

734
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,097
You are at the safe house.

735
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:25,568
It's feeling less and
less safe with every second.

736
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,639
Looks like your cold-case
theory was right, Liz.

737
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,116
I confirmed it.

738
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,374
He set the money aside for the children.

739
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:46,121
A guy with a conscience
who does what he did,

740
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:48,891
that's way scarier
than a straight psychopath.

741
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,027
We should tell the widows their
husbands didn't cheat on them.

742
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,562
And the kids?

743
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,763
What's being done about the kids?

744
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,165
Child Services is reaching out

745
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:57,666
to the families of both parents.

746
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,768
Hopefully someone will step up.

747
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,203
Hi.

748
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:03,973
I'm Margaret. Mm-hmm.

749
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:06,408
I'm your grandma.

750
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,800
Aren't you the sweetest?

751
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:12,114
You have your mother's eyes.

752
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,449
What about Angela?

753
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:14,750
Will she get to keep her child?

754
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,785
She's under house arrest, awaiting trial.

755
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:20,422
But mothers can keep their
infants with them in prison

756
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,098
for up to 18 months.

757
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,368
Ah. Please tell me you're hungry.

758
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,637
Tonight's special is wagyu beef.

759
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,373
So this is what it's all about.
Asylum seekers.

760
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:40,976
Counterterrorism division is
looking for extremists that don't exist

761
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,413
when they should be looking
for Dembe's imam.

762
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:47,883
His kidnapping is completely
unrelated and, as yet, unsolved.

763
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:50,152
I checked with MPD on my way over.

764
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:51,353
They've got nothing.

765
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:52,888
No forensics. No witnesses.

766
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:55,124
Sakiya said the same.

767
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,726
I told her to double-check
everything, but...

768
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,818
I'm afraid it's a diminishing return.

769
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,932
How's he holding up?

770
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,477
It's hard for him.

771
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:10,706
Especially since he knows I'm to blame.

772
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,874
You?

773
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,203
People close to me
are often in harm's way.

774
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,913
Dembe's imam is not close to you.

775
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:20,115
No. But Dembe is.

776
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:25,354
I don't think whoever did this
is interested in extremists

777
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:28,123
or clerics and refugees.

778
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:31,726
I think they're interested in me.

779
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:40,402
At first, I thought you screwed up,

780
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:43,639
that Koslov ran because he knew
you were following him.

781
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:47,276
But then I realized
Ilya wasn't scared of you.

782
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,185
You're the one who's scared.

783
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,646
Reddington got to you.

784
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:56,818
Ilya Koslov has information that
could save my mother's life.

785
00:38:57,861 --> 00:39:01,078
And you helped prevent me
from finding it.

786
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,826
The least you can do is tell me why.

787
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,903
You have powerful enemies.

788
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:10,290
I had no idea he was one of them.

789
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:14,252
The Sikorsky Archive.

790
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,005
What's that?

791
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:19,074
Before Reddington warned me off,

792
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:22,394
I had a mic trained on Ilya's apartment.

793
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:25,062
That archive, whatever it is,

794
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:28,841
he's obsessed with it.
If Koslov has information

795
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,013
that could save a woman's life,
my guess it's in that archive.

796
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,749
We have a lot to talk about.

797
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:55,251
Who are you?

798
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,707
How about you let me ask the questions?

799
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,519
What, you change your number?

800
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,181
That's cold.

801
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,482
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Maybe not.

802
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,626
But I got something to say to you,

803
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,370
and, trust me,
you're gonna want to hear it.

804
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,579
That's Ray Field...

805
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:28,535
until next week, when they
break ground on the strip mall.

806
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,299
Digging up Ray Field?

807
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:31,996
Yeah, baby brother.

808
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,873
And all the secrets under it.

809
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,613
Yes.

810
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,417
I'll tell him.

811
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,186
They're at the safe house on Vermont.

812
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,946
Jalal asked me to thank you.

813
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:50,545
Happy ending for them.

814
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,794
For you, not so much.

815
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,364
Raymond.

816
00:40:58,376 --> 00:40:59,633
I'm fine.

817
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,103
I'm fine.

818
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,282
I found something.

819
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,051
A fingerprint on the corner
of the imam's desk.

820
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,253
Could you identify it?

821
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,962
I could. But, uh...

822
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,630
But what?

823
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,738
Belongs to a man who's been
in prison for 15 years.

824
00:41:26,762 --> 00:41:28,695
Arturo Ruel.

825
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,230
How can that be?

826
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,390
I don't know. Perhaps Raymond will.

827
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,335
Raymond.

828
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,174
Raymond!

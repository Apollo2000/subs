2
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,834
Must be good
to be home again, sir.

3
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,107
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,244
Well, we'll see about that.

5
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,933
Good afternoon.

6
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:51,436
I'm here to see Assistant Director
Harold Cooper.

7
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,054
Do you have an appointment?

8
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:54,272
I do not.

9
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,124
Tell him
it's Raymond Reddington.

10
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,335
Ressler.
Washington field office.

11
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:58,987
I'm the case agent
on Reddington.

12
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,755
- When did this happen?
- Under an hour ago.

13
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,340
We confirm it's actually him?

14
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:04,909
It's him all right.
Prints match. Tattoos.

15
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:08,146
He even volunteered classified details
about a Brussels mission in '08.

16
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,815
- What happened in Brussels?
- Sir?

17
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,334
We tried to kill him, sir.

18
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:17,772
It really is him.

19
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,944
Came in with a briefcase containing
every alias he's ever used.

20
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,629
Most of 'em we've
never even heard of.

21
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,763
What does he want?

22
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,499
Don't know. Won't talk.

23
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,117
He's a stone.

24
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:30,452
Call lab services.

25
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:33,304
Have them fit him with
an AlphaChip RFID tag.

26
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:36,041
Assemble a full intel review.
NSA. CIA.

27
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,313
What exactly
do you want to know?

28
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,778
Everything.

29
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,216
Raymond "Red" Reddington
attended the Naval Academy.

30
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,286
Top of his class.
Graduated by the time he was 24.

31
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:50,438
He was being groomed
for admiral.

32
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:53,358
Then in 1990,
Reddington's coming home

33
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:55,577
to see his wife and his daughter
for Christmas.

34
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,128
He never arrives.

35
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,780
This highly respected officer

36
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,665
up and disappears from
the face of the earth...

37
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:03,268
until four years later

38
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:07,005
when classified NOFORN documents
start showing up in Maghreb,

39
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,357
Islamabad, Beijing.

40
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,176
These leaks were traced
to Reddington.

41
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,611
This guy's an equal
opportunity offender,

42
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,313
a facilitator of sorts,

43
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,515
who's built an enterprise brokering deals
for fellow criminals.

44
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,718
- Ouch.
- He has no country.

45
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,152
He has no political agenda.

46
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:24,723
Reddington's only allegiance
is to the highest bidder.

47
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,191
They call him something
in the papers.

48
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:29,994
"The concierge of crime."

49
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,547
He's online.

50
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,052
Evidently someone with the authority
to make decisions has arrived.

51
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:41,489
I think I smell the stench of your cologne,
Agent Cooper. Smells like hubris.

52
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:44,426
Get these feeds fixed.
I want him up here. Come on.

53
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,311
You must have many questions,

54
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:49,764
so let's begin with the most
important one... Why I'm here.

55
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,735
Remember the 1986 attack
on the U.S. Embassy in Damascus,

56
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,404
the abduction of
the six foreign nationals

57
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,174
from the French consulate
in Algiers in '97,

58
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:03,778
or the 2002 breach of the
Krungthai Bank in Bangkok?

59
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,748
You see these events
as unrelated.

60
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:09,501
I can tell you one man is
responsible for all three.

61
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:12,520
His name is Ranko Zamani.

62
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:14,839
You want him. I want him.

63
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:18,993
So let's say for the moment
our interests are aligned.

64
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:22,564
Ranko Sinisa Zamani.

65
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,999
Serbian national
educated in the U.S.

66
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,837
Ranko Zamani's
been dead for six years.

67
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,705
- He's a non-existent threat.
- Then a dead man

68
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,142
just stepped off United 283
from Munich to Dulles.

69
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:40,048
He entered the country
under the name Sacha M. Chacko.

70
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,917
- Cleared customs at 10:56 a.m.
- Listen up, people.

71
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:46,137
The lab just pulled a latent
print from the airline arm rest.

72
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:48,072
Nine points of comparison.

73
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:50,041
Zamani's alive.

74
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,148
You have my attention.

75
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,299
Were you wrong?

76
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,435
I was wrong.

77
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,787
Yes, you were wrong.

78
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:05,390
At least it's not the first time.
Familiar territory.

79
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,427
Now, I'll give you Zamani,
but first...

80
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,496
No "but firsts."
You don't decide anything.

81
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,215
Agent Cooper, you've overestimated
your authority.

82
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,118
I said I'll help you
find Zamani, and I will.

83
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:21,823
But from this point forward,
there's one very important rule...

84
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,375
I speak only with Elizabeth Keen.

85
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:27,462
Who the hell's Elizabeth Keen?

86
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,750
Oh, buddy.

87
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,302
Seriously, dude?

88
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,310
Babe, what time is it?

89
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,108
I don't know.
What time you gotta be there?

90
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:44,329
- Oh, crap.
- What's up?

91
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:45,346
- Crap!
- What?

92
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:48,416
No! My first day!

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,901
Babe, are you good?
You need help?

94
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,986
I missed the bus, babe.

95
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,205
I'm gonna need to take the car.

96
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,690
You can't take the car.
I need the car.

97
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,575
I've got field trip
planning committee.

98
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,227
You took the dog out, right?

99
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:02,363
I did. For the field trip...
Air and Space or the D.C. Zoo?

100
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:05,383
- The zoo's gender neutral.
- All right.

101
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,118
- Good thinkin'.
- We're out of milk.

102
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,287
- Oop. Sorry.
- Is this pee?

103
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:10,738
I'm standing in pee, babe.

104
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,974
- He's your dog, too.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

105
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:16,535
I'm gonna smell like a urinary
tract infection on my first day!

106
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,366
Hey, don't forget we got the last
adoption meeting today. One-thirty.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
You heard me, right?
One-thirty.

108
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,769
Yep. One-thirty.
Last meeting.

109
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,437
I'm in the car.
You got the keys?

110
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,506
Yeah, in my pocket.
I got your coffee.

111
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,092
No more peeing, dude.

112
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,114
What?

113
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,234
We both woke up
seven minutes ago.

114
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,169
I'm pretty sure my pants
are on backwards

115
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,120
and I can barely see straight.

116
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,323
But you are somehow dressed,

117
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:48,259
composed, and as beautiful
as the day I met you.

118
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,111
- I think I'm forgetting something.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,568
You know I'm not gonna let this job
come between us and our family, right?

120
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,303
I know.

121
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,789
We want a family,
we're going to have a family.

122
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,108
Were you serious about that kid thing?
Because I got stuff goin...

123
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,226
Ow!

124
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,045
Mama.

125
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,245
Today's the day.

126
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,347
Yeah, I know.

127
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,434
Man, I am so proud of you.

128
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,169
- Thanks.
- You worked so hard for this.

129
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,187
Are you nervous?

130
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,406
No. But I am very late.

131
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,667
Agent Keen.

132
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,769
Donald Ressler.
Washington field office.

133
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,721
I need you to come with me
right away.

134
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,859
Babe, I don't think I'm
gonna need to take the car.

135
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,485
Agent Keen.
Am I getting that right?

136
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:49,387
- Yes, sir.
- Harold Cooper.

137
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,738
Assistant Director
of Counterterrorism.

138
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,840
Yes, sir.
I know who you are, sir.

139
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,561
So, uh...can you
tell us what's going on?

140
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,095
I wish I could.

141
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,982
I can tell you that...

142
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:03,384
I've been vetted by the
agency like everyone else,

143
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,104
you know, same background checks,
psych profiles.

144
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:08,839
I'm sure OPR's trolling
my digital footprint right now,

145
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,441
and I can tell you
what they'll find.

146
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,575
What will they find?

147
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:13,861
Nothing. I have no history
with Reddington.

148
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,301
They tell me today's
your first day as a profiler.

149
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,436
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,467
I was reassigned from New York.
I graduated Quantico last month.

151
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:22,003
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:25,039
Do me a favor.
Profile yourself.

153
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,425
I'm sorry, sir?

154
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,144
Who are you?
What is he looking for?

155
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,612
Profile Elizabeth Keen.

156
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:33,965
Oh. Okay.

157
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,733
Uh...

158
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:39,470
Um, well, I've been with
the Bureau for four years.

159
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,006
I was the head of the Mobile
Emergency Psych Unit in New York.

160
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,458
We worked murders,

161
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,093
- extortion...
- Read your résumé.

162
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:48,596
Of course.

163
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,737
My colleagues call me "sir."

164
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:59,323
They think I'm...

165
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:00,591
a bitch.

166
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:05,680
Like most kids
who raised themselves,

167
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:08,032
I can display
narcissistic behavior.

168
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,220
I can be withdrawn,
disconnected. Uh...

169
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:16,290
I have a deep yearning to understand
and relate to the criminal mind.

170
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,964
I'm board certified
in forensic psychology,

171
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:24,849
and yet I operate
under the delusion

172
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:28,419
that I can rewrite my past
by having kids of my own.

173
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,005
Do you find it odd
Reddington surrendered himself

174
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
the day you started working
as a profiler?

175
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,376
I think that it suggests
he was waiting for me.

176
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,245
Why you? Specifically.

177
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:45,103
Because I'm new and he thinks
I can be easily manipulated.

178
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,855
The man obviously
doesn't know me very well.

179
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,010
What is this place?

180
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:55,747
D.C. Metro Sorting Facility,
U.S. Postal Service.

181
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,316
It was abandoned and slated
for demo twelve years ago.

182
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,951
The Bureau acquired the building
post-9/11.

183
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:04,221
Been operating a variety of covert
operations here ever since.

184
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:07,208
So this is a black site?

185
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:10,928
We're sentimental.
We prefer to call it The Post Office.

186
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,071
If you need anything,
remember...

187
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,673
we're right here.

188
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:05,883
Agent Keen, what a pleasure.

189
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:13,174
Well...

190
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,709
I'm here.

191
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,912
You got rid of your highlights.

192
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:23,584
You look much less Baltimore.

193
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,656
Do you get back home much?

194
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,324
Tell me about Zamani.

195
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,027
I haven't been home in years.

196
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:37,815
Why involve me? I'm nobody.
It's my first day.

197
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,650
Nothin' special about me.

198
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,652
Oh, I think
you're very special.

199
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:49,827
Within the hour,
Ranko Zamani will abduct

200
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,563
the daughter of
U.S. General Daniel Ryker.

201
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:55,066
There'll be
some kind of diversion,

202
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,835
communications will be scrambled,

203
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,671
then he'll grab the girl.

204
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,140
He wants to be out of the
country within 36 hours.

205
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,310
If you don't move quickly,
she will die.

206
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:08,379
That's what I know.

207
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,464
And how do you know this?

208
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:13,050
Because I'm the one
who got him into the country.

209
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,937
And I'm supposed
to believe you?

210
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:18,222
No, of course not!

211
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:24,428
I'm a criminal.
Criminals are notorious liars.

212
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:28,316
Everything about me is a lie.

213
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,891
But if anyone can give me
a second chance, it's you.

214
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:41,028
The two of us have...
overcome so much.

215
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:44,098
I mean, look at you.

216
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,970
Abandoned by a father
who was a career criminal,

217
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,440
a mother who died of...
weakness and shame.

218
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,246
And yet here you are, about
to make a name for yourself,

219
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,232
about to...
capture Ranko Zamani.

220
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,122
I'm gonna make you famous,
Lizzy.

221
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:09,607
What did you tell him?

222
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,609
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,912
How did he know those things?
Private things about my family?

224
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:17,398
Why didn't your father's criminal record
show up on your background report?

225
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,917
We need to contact the SWAT commander
at Quantico. Roll a team out to the girl.

226
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:21,168
This is nonsense.
He's bluffing, sir.

227
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,137
No, he's establishing value.

228
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,039
I've been the case agent
on this guy for five years.

229
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,275
And five years
has gotten you what?

230
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,428
You asked me here,
you asked my opinion.

231
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:34,198
Here it is...
That girl's gonna get taken.

232
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,366
Excuse me.

233
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:47,111
Tom.
Thank God you picked up.

234
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:49,297
Hey, tell me you're close.
What's going on? Are you close?

235
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:51,015
That helicopter,

236
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,566
they flew me to
the Assistant Director,

237
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:55,052
put me on a case, and I
can't get away right now.

238
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,420
You're kidding, right?

239
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,756
The adoption people,
they're all waiting.

240
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:02,293
- Liz, are you there?
- Put on a great show in there.

241
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,728
You better
pull yourself together

242
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,179
because you just
called in the cavalry.

243
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:07,631
Can I just have one minute,
um...

244
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,749
We don't have a minute.
Come on.

245
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,668
Let's go.

246
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:13,004
I'm sorry. I know we had

247
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:16,440
an appointment, but there's a
girl, something happened...

248
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:20,044
I-I can't tell you.
It's classified.

249
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:22,863
- This whole...day is classified.
- Lizzy...

250
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,949
Lizzy, babe, if...
if it's too much,

251
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:26,934
we don't have to
do this right now, okay?

252
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,703
We don't have to do it.
We'll just... We'll do it next year.

253
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:31,038
But if we are gonna go through

254
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:34,358
with this,
you gotta do it with me.

255
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,027
- I can't do it alone, Lizzy.
- We gotta go.

256
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:38,646
No. No. Tom, listen,

257
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:42,900
our family is the only thing
that matters, okay?

258
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,720
- It's the only thing that matters.
- Okay.

259
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,955
All right, let me, uh...

260
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,374
Let me handle it, I'll,
um, I'll take care of it.

261
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,809
I think this woman might
punch me in the face,

262
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:53,044
- but I got it.
- I am so sorry.

263
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:54,845
Don't be sorry,
just be safe, okay?

264
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,846
I love you.

265
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,314
I love you too.

266
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:04,739
Sir.

267
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,207
At ease.

268
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,008
We have a situation, sir.

269
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,710
It's about your daughter.

270
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,045
My daughter?

271
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:20,704
Guys, with the guns, please.

272
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,206
We don't want to
scare the kids.

273
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,325
I got this.

274
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,252
Beth. Sweetie, this lady
needs to speak to you.

275
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:36,904
Hi, Bethany, don't be scared.

276
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,989
I just need you
to come with me, okay?

277
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:40,374
Thank you.

278
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,103
Your name's Beth, right?
Yeah?

279
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,654
My name's Beth, too.

280
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,873
I'm Elizabeth.

281
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:58,175
My friends call me Liz, though.

282
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,210
You can call me Liz
if you want.

283
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,797
My daddy has a pin like that.

284
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:06,801
Oh, yeah? I bet your daddy
has lots of medals.

285
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:09,420
To get a pin like this
you gotta be really brave.

286
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:12,440
This can be
your special pin, okay?

287
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,658
There you go.

288
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,260
You like it?

289
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,749
Oh...

290
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,767
You don't have to...

291
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:26,003
Thank you so much.
This is beautiful.

292
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,756
Wow.

293
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,258
The bull's pokey.
Be careful.

294
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,860
Okay, I'll be careful.

295
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,302
What's going on?

296
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,686
Hey, what's going on up there?

297
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,272
HazMat has the road closed.
We'll be turning around.

298
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:48,075
Rolling
Thunder to Follow 1.

299
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,894
Be advised we have
a chemical spill ahead.

300
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:52,596
Copy that.
Proceeding to alternate route.

301
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,366
Do you want to call your daddy?

302
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,435
Yeah, I want to
tell him I'm okay.

303
00:16:58,469 --> 00:16:59,469
Okay.

304
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,002
Back up!

305
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,557
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

306
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,885
Tango, tango,
tango, respond!

307
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,403
I can't see!
I got blood in my...

308
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,028
Get the girl!

309
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,598
If you want to save the girl,
do not fire your weapon.

310
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,670
Take it.

311
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:14,845
Okay, baby,
this smoke's gonna hurt us.

312
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,897
All right? I need you
to put this on for me.

313
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,300
- What about you?
- There's only one.

314
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,185
It's for you, hon.
Okay, listen to me.

315
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,988
- These men are gonna take you.
- Are they gonna hurt me?

316
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,423
They're not gonna hurt you.
I'm gonna find you, okay?

317
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,758
Okay.

318
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,320
Beth, I'm gonna find you.

319
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,334
Who made the call to send that girl
after my daughter?

320
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,309
Who made the call?!

321
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,599
Where's the girl?
It's been four hours.

322
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,884
Your people haven't made
any demands.

323
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,254
My people? I told you
Zamani would take the girl.

324
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,890
I told you that's all I knew.

325
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,159
This is in your hands now.

326
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:15,345
I need your help with Zamani.

327
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:18,915
How about a trade?

328
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:21,334
You tell me and I'll tell you.

329
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,419
Tell me about
the scar on your palm.

330
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:27,307
I've noticed how you stroke it.

331
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:32,879
There was a fire.
I was fourteen.

332
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,848
Someone tried to hurt you.

333
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,487
Not exactly, no.

334
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,047
May I see it?

335
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,914
Is a child really what you want?

336
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:09,927
How on earth...

337
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:11,651
But a baby won't fix
what happened in the past.

338
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,386
You lost the right
to speak about parenthood

339
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,339
when you abandoned your wife
and daughter on Christmas Eve.

340
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,491
- The girl.
- You won't find the girl

341
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,693
until you learn
to look at this differently.

342
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,929
And how should I look at this?

343
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,031
Like a criminal.

344
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,434
May come easier than you think.

345
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:31,237
Shall I show you?

346
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,610
Well, at least you know
what Zamani looks like.

347
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,650
Oh, my goodness!

348
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,269
I haven't seen him in years.

349
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,388
Very interesting fellow.

350
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:50,356
Completely unrelated to this.

351
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,343
You're pointing at
the wrong guy here.

352
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:56,362
Miroslav.

353
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,964
They call him The Chemist.

354
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:00,683
A highly regarded munitions expert.

355
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:05,672
He left MIT to work for
the Russian, Vor Usoyan.

356
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:09,375
Last two years...
very expensive freelancer.

357
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,182
I don't know what the hell
any of this is.

358
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,318
Ooh, the German.

359
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:21,771
A banker. Name's Reinhardt.

360
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,625
He's most likely
moving the money.

361
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,194
What about the girl?

362
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,712
What do you have on
the girl and her father?

363
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:33,265
Your 36-hour timeline
would suggest a singular event.

364
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,867
Something in D.C.

365
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:38,270
I'm not sure how the girl fits.

366
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,839
What about the Chemist?

367
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:45,194
Important...well paid...

368
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,332
Whatever Zamani's planning
is expensive.

369
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,352
Some sort of attack?

370
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:54,754
You're thinking like a cop.

371
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,407
Cops are so objective.

372
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,362
They're obligated to protocols.
Make it personal.

373
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:01,760
Okay, this is nonsense.

374
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:06,482
Zamani's sick.
CIA says he carries Nipah virus.

375
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:07,734
Dying makes him dangerous.

376
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:12,355
So what does he desperately want
before he dies?

377
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,674
And how does that relate
to the little girl?

378
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:21,848
Her father, the General,
spent time in Bosnia...

379
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:24,217
supporting NATO troops
in the Bihac Pocket region.

380
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,052
Zamani's home.

381
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,254
He bombed a chemical weapons
facility...

382
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:31,457
poisoning the village.

383
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:34,594
It's about his family.

384
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,481
They died, Zamani survived.

385
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,266
He wants revenge.

386
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,619
He hired the Chemist to build a bomb,
detonate it in Washington.

387
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,545
He's gonna use Beth
to settle the score...

388
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:58,384
deliver the bomb.

389
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:01,904
Okay, let's move.
We're on a clock.

390
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,491
I have an acquaintance.

391
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:09,145
They call him The Innkeeper,
runs a series of safe houses.

392
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,865
Lean on him.
He'll know where to find the Chemist.

393
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,169
You find the Chemist,
you'll find Zamani.

394
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:18,637
Where is this Innkeeper?

395
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:21,273
If I tell you, you have to
give me something in return.

396
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,810
No more restraints,
no more cages.

397
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:25,628
If you want to capture Zamani,

398
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:27,296
he has to believe
I'm moving freely...

399
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,865
in touch with old friends,

400
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,867
staying in one of
my favorite hotels...

401
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,036
If you think we're gonna
put you up at the Sheraton...

402
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,105
Save your Starwood points,
Harold.

403
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,074
The Sheraton's not my scene.

404
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,385
Hey, live it up, pal.

405
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,121
Soon as this is over, you're
headed back to a black site.

406
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,636
Mr. Homan, it's awfully nice
to have you back.

407
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,860
There's complimentary Champagne.

408
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:01,364
As usual, the bed's made up with
blankets instead of a comforter.

409
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:03,866
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you, Eric.

410
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:07,470
Tip the gentleman, will you?

411
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:19,615
Where is the Chemist?

412
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:26,956
FBI. Hands.

413
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:30,126
Tranquilo, papi.

414
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:43,973
♪ How lucky can one guy be? ♪

415
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:47,076
♪ I kissed her
and she kissed me ♪

416
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,445
♪ Like the fella once said ♪

417
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,681
♪ Ain't that a kick in the head? ♪

418
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:52,815
They found the lab.

419
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,318
They're interrogating
the Chemist as we speak.

420
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:57,286
- What about the bomb?
- We think that we got there

421
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:58,921
before he built it.

422
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,990
I gotta get out of here
and clear my head.

423
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,093
Take a shower, see my husband.

424
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,531
Don't go too far.

425
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:19,926
Oh, my...

426
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:25,181
Did they say yes?

427
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:29,035
Oh, baby!
How did you do this?

428
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:32,338
Oh, my God, I cannot believe...

429
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,157
We're gonna have a baby,
and this is exac...

430
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,610
Tom?

431
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:43,533
Sit down.

432
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,268
Sit down!!!

433
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:49,956
Do what I say
or I'll shoot your husband.

434
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,242
See, Tom and I,
we have been talking,

435
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:56,669
trying to figure out how
you knew I was in town.

436
00:26:56,704 --> 00:27:00,032
I tell him you figure out
my plan...

437
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:03,502
to take the General's daughter.

438
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,937
Tom, look at me.

439
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,839
Make for nice surprise.

440
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:09,775
But my people handle
quite well, I think.

441
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,677
It's gonna be okay.

442
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:16,382
But then, your people
come for my Chemist friend.

443
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,534
I was finished with The Chemist,

444
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:21,887
so you saved me payment
for services.

445
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:25,341
And for that, I thank you.

446
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:30,012
But...it did make me wonder
what else you know.

447
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:33,349
What else do you know?

448
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:35,534
I don't...

449
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:36,619
Tom.

450
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,371
No, no, no, no, no.
Over here.

451
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,139
I ask question.

452
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,425
What else do you know
about my plan?

453
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,827
A bomb. Maybe.
We don't know.

454
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,964
We only knew about the girl.
The rest is just speculation.

455
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,932
Tom, baby, it's gonna be okay.

456
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:52,251
- Uhh!
- You son of a bitch!

457
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,687
What else do you know
about my plan?!

458
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,072
Nothing! I swear!

459
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,924
Oh.

460
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:00,142
My God.

461
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:04,096
You're not as smart
as Reddington says.

462
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:08,467
My friend, he is always
so obsessed with you.

463
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,552
I'm not sure why.

464
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:11,537
It's gonna be okay.

465
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:14,974
Now, what I have planned
will make for many casualties.

466
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:17,510
So now you have choice.

467
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:21,681
Stop me now
and save many Americans,

468
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:25,150
or save only...

469
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:26,585
one.

470
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,522
What do you choose?

471
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,413
Tom. Baby.

472
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:40,950
Oh, my God.
Baby, keep your eyes open.

473
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:43,502
I'm gonna get help.

474
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,638
I'm gonna get help.

475
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:46,856
Don't fall aslee...

476
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,424
You're gonna be okay!

477
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,143
- You're gonna be okay.
- 911. What is your emergency?

478
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:18,477
Did you send him?

479
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:19,996
Are you the one who did this?

480
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,831
Did what?

481
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,783
He was in my house!

482
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:26,269
My husband is on a ventilator
because Zamani came...

483
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:28,054
Calm down
and tell me what happened.

484
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,023
Don't play stupid.
You're the only thing connecting us.

485
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:33,242
He told me that
you're obsessed with me.

486
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:36,662
Did he mention
the girl or the bomb?

487
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,113
We're not a team.

488
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,548
- Zamani.
- I'm not your partner.

489
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,583
What did he say?

490
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:42,418
I don't know, he said...

491
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,103
he said something
about casualties...

492
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:46,322
and chemical agents, and...

493
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,840
he talked about you.

494
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:50,543
He even thanked me for
getting rid of the Chemist.

495
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:53,095
So the bomb's still in play.

496
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,265
Why the hell was he
in my house?!

497
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,967
Tell me! You know him!

498
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,003
Why is my husband dying
in a hospital right now?!

499
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,607
The truth is, despite your feelings,
your husband doesn't matter.

500
00:30:04,641 --> 00:30:06,175
Zamani did you a favor, Lizzy.

501
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,765
Now, you know I just punched
a hole in your carotid.

502
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:15,134
Best chance, one minute
before you pass out.

503
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:17,053
So here's how it's gonna work.

504
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,805
You tell me how I find Zamani
and make this right,

505
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,024
or I let you die right here.

506
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,492
Understand?

507
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:27,079
Yeah.

508
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:29,332
But if I die...

509
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:32,218
you'll never know
the truth about your husband.

510
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:34,654
You know nothing
about my husband.

511
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:34,463
Agent Ressler?

512
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,832
I gotta talk to him.

513
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,234
You shouldn't even be here.

514
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:41,921
You're under official review.
You know that.

515
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:44,190
I know.
The Chemist isn't talking, is he?

516
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:45,424
No.

517
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:48,411
Red knows Zamani.
Just give me five minutes.

518
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,580
Thank you.

519
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,658
He's gone.

520
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:33,672
It's good to see you,
old friend.

521
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:36,742
Initiating track.

522
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,828
Okay, got him.

523
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,963
His chip indicates
he's at the Lincoln Memorial.

524
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:44,517
We're on him.
Forty seconds out. En route.

525
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:46,368
How did things go
with Agent Keen?

526
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:49,588
Paid her a visit, like you asked.

527
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:51,457
And the husband?

528
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,675
Like you asked.

529
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:56,695
It's a shame you're gonna
miss the cherry blossoms.

530
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,951
I think a great many people
will miss the cherry blossoms.

531
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:06,772
Tell me, the General's daughter
is such a risk.

532
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:10,376
This is about
much more than one girl.

533
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,261
He's on the move.
Heading westbound.

534
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,581
This is about...

535
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,817
the children.

536
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:23,222
Raymond, today...

537
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:25,357
on this day...

538
00:33:25,392 --> 00:33:28,360
I am giving their plague
back to them.

539
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:33,532
In sixty years they will be
talking about this day...

540
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,000
about my legacy.

541
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:46,495
Still heading west.

542
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,996
300 yards from your position.

543
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:50,649
- Hello?
- There's a wrinkle.

544
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,319
Zamani wants more
than the General's daughter.

545
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:55,204
- He's after children.
- Where are you?

546
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:57,206
Approaching 14th.

547
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,391
You gotta move!
You gotta move!

548
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:01,360
I need you to tell me
what Zamani said.

549
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:02,611
In the house...

550
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:03,796
what did he say,

551
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,064
what did you see?

552
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,319
He, uh, he asked about
the Chemist and about the girl.

553
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:12,037
No. What did you see?

554
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:14,273
Uh, there was blood.

555
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:15,374
There was blood everywhere.

556
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:16,658
Take a breath, Lizzy.

557
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:18,994
Over here.

558
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:20,396
There was a tattoo.

559
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,797
He's Serbian Orthodox.

560
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,132
You're closing on him.

561
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,401
- He wouldn't have a tattoo.
- I know what I saw.

562
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,019
This mark, I've seen it before.

563
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:32,157
Field trip. D.C. Air and Space
or the D.C. Zoo?

564
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:33,359
It wasn't a tattoo.

565
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,693
It was a stamp.

566
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,762
Zamani's gonna bomb
the D.C. Zoo.

567
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:40,749
I got nothin'.
Come on, where is he?!

568
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:42,601
He's turning onto Maryland Ave.

569
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,335
Dead ahead.
He's dead ahead.

570
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:00,603
He's stopped.

571
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:03,155
The signal has stopped.
He's right there.

572
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,193
Where is he?!

573
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:10,429
He should be right behind you.

574
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:11,413
Vertically.

575
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:12,648
Are there stairs near you?

576
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:32,768
Beth?

577
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:35,721
Hi, honey.
Are you hurt?

578
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,589
No.

579
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:39,408
Are you alone?

580
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:41,710
He said to wait here
for my daddy.

581
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,282
He said not to take it off.

582
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:02,815
Whatever you do,
don't touch it.

583
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:04,099
There's less than three minutes.

584
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,201
I've got to evacuate,
call the bomb squad...

585
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:07,853
Your people will never
be there in time.

586
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:09,188
My friend, he's on his way.

587
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,806
Your friend.
What friend?

588
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:14,226
Reddington!

589
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:17,512
Reddington!

590
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,664
Hands in the air.

591
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:27,790
Zamani.

592
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:29,742
Step down from the ledge.

593
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:33,979
Hands where I can see 'em
or I'll shoot you down!

594
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,816
Tell the General
his daughter was...

595
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:41,220
an unfortunate civilian casualty.

596
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,031
He pulled the tracking chip.

597
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,166
Son of a bitch.

598
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,244
Did Reddington send you?

599
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,277
I can't understand what you're saying.
Can you stop the bomb?

600
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:16,333
Can you stop it?

601
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,187
- Are we gonna be okay?
- Yeah, baby, we're gonna be okay.

602
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,545
Hey. I was scared
when I was your age, too.

603
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,614
But I had a secret weapon
to keep me safe.

604
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,133
My daddy gave it to me.

605
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:37,137
It's very special.
I've never shown it to anybody.

606
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,355
It's like magic.

607
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,708
What does it do?

608
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,811
Whenever I'm feeling
sad or afraid,

609
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,982
I just touch it like this,
and it makes me brave.

610
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,934
Do you want to see
if it can make you brave?

611
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,685
Yeah?

612
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,643
You're a brave girl.

613
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,871
<i>Uzasny!</i>

614
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:11,872
Wait.

615
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,009
Wait!

616
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,777
What are you doing?!

617
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,496
Just consider the device
his payment for services.

618
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,098
<i>Spasibo! Naslazhdaisa!</i>

619
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,034
That is a chemical weapon!

620
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:26,337
He's fascinated by the things.

621
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,389
He certainly has more use
for it than we do.

622
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,278
Daddy!

623
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:39,099
Red vest, gray sweatshirt!
He's got the bomb!

624
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,540
We're gonna make a great team.

625
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,462
Who is the Ukrainian?

626
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,033
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- You gave him a chemical weapon.

627
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,019
He took it.

628
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,804
That's the price
of doing business, Harold,

629
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,424
with certain people who can get
certain things done. You know that.

630
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,976
You never look
at the larger picture.

631
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,912
The bomb didn't detonate,
the girl is safe, Zamani's dead.

632
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,365
Frankly, I think this all
went down rather swimmingly.

633
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,500
This was never about Zamani.

634
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,570
You surrendered and infiltrated
the FBI to get at our intelligence.

635
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,872
- Your intelligence?
- To get that weapon.

636
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,059
I certainly don't want your intelligence,
Agent Ressler.

637
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,827
I'm quite happy with my own.

638
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,530
I think it's more likely that I
tried to help you in good faith

639
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,400
and had to finish
the job myself because...

640
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,302
you couldn't.

641
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,552
I think we're finished.

642
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,691
Well, this was fun.
Let's do it again.

643
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:40,193
Really, let's do it again.

644
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,730
Understand,
Zamani was only the first.

645
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:44,298
The first what?

646
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,383
Name. On the list.

647
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,826
What list?

648
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:59,663
It's called The Blacklist.
That sounds exciting.

649
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:03,517
That's why we're all here,
of course. My wish list.

650
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,453
A list I've been cultivating
for over twenty years.

651
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,123
Politicians, mobsters,
hackers...

652
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,624
spies.

653
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,393
We have our own list.

654
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,545
Agent Ressler, please.

655
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,631
We all know your Top Ten is little
more than a publicity campaign.

656
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,300
It's a popularity contest
at best.

657
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,602
I'm talking about
the criminals who matter.

658
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,206
The ones you can't find because
you don't even know they exist.

659
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:29,376
Zamani was a small fish.

660
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:32,888
I'm Ahab.

661
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:38,001
And if you want the whales on my list,
you have to play by my rules.

662
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:42,439
I never sleep in the same location
for more than two nights in a row.

663
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:46,160
I want a fully encrypted 8-millimeter
tag embedded in my neck...

664
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,396
not that garbage from AlphaChip
you stuck in my shoulder.

665
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:53,667
I want my own security. I've compiled
a list of five acceptable applicants.

666
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,185
Pick two.

667
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,372
Whatever I tell you
falls under an immunity package

668
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:00,307
that I negotiate myself.

669
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,793
And finally, most importantly,

670
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,413
I speak only
with Elizabeth Keen.

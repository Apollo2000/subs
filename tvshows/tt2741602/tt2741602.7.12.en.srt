1
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,797
Mr. Reddington.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,565
So pleased you made it, sir.

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:16,900
Ha! So am I.

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,501
What a ride.

5
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:21,005
You can't imagine what
it took to get here.

6
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:23,274
And might I say
not a moment too soon.

7
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:26,043
We are in for
quite a storm.

8
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,045
Arthur Rodman.
I'm at your service.

9
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,779
What a place.

10
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:31,581
This is lovely.

11
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,385
I'm sorry.
I wasn't prepared for...

12
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,020
You were told
no seconds are permitted?

13
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:38,255
Oh, no, no,
Dembe won't be staying.

14
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,358
Raymond, are you sure
this place is secure?

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,493
Oh, you needn't worry.
The island is a safe haven.

16
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,264
Mr. Vries, our owner, offers it to
men and women such as Mr. Reddington

17
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:50,334
as a place to do business
or resolve disputes

18
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,802
with absolute privacy
and security.

19
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,339
And your property is the
only one on the island, yes?

20
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:59,243
Yes. My employer provides
staff, lodging, fine dining.

21
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:01,878
You should go before
the sky gets any darker.

22
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,314
Please.

23
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:06,283
And don't worry.
I'll see you here in two days,

24
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,617
and we'll celebrate.

25
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,286
I don't trust
Cassandra.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,222
Ah.

27
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:13,257
Eat a whole pizza,
read a couple of great books.

28
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,293
Maybe take the kids skating.
My God, I can't remember

29
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:19,529
the last time you had
a whole weekend off.

30
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,998
Two days, Raymond.

31
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,367
Remember, you promised
Agnes to be at the ballet.

32
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,801
I'll see you Sunday.

33
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,571
Not to worry.

34
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,911
All firearms
will be kept in a safe

35
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,746
until the proceedings
are complete.

36
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,774
There he is.
In the flesh.

37
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,145
Hello, Cassandra.

38
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,514
You're looking like
the best of times.

39
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,483
I wasn't sure
you were going to make it.

40
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,224
I had to come.
I couldn't let down the others.

41
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,993
The others. Mm.

42
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:26,964
Well, to be honest,
I was hoping that part of you came for me.

43
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,967
The best part did.

44
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:33,603
You brought
your piece?

45
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:35,473
Of course.

46
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:38,576
Then it's official.

47
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,710
We have the complete set.

48
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,612
You're convinced
it's the right time to sell?

49
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,349
I am. But, um...

50
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,585
Relax.
Business later.

51
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,187
I'll lay everything out
for the group tonight.

52
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,523
We will stay out
of your way during your stay,

53
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,091
but anything you need,
Mr. Reddington,

54
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:55,559
don't hesitate to ask.

55
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:56,460
Thank you, Arthur.

56
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,135
Think it's bugged?

57
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,504
Annika, your brow
is already furrowed.

58
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,474
I swept my whole room...
The basket, the vents.

59
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,143
It appears clean.

60
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,344
That's a relief.

61
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:14,744
Mm.

62
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:15,879
You bring it?

63
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,680
Hmm. I brought it.

64
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,216
I didn't want to touch it,
but...

65
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,185
Same old Annika.

66
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:22,953
You've been reading
ghost stories.

67
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,855
Not ghost stories,
news stories.

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,657
It came
from a tomb, right?

69
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,093
The original dig
was in Turkey...

70
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,128
Give me a hug.

71
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,795
Three of the archaeologists
are dead...

72
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,232
One pancreatic cancer,
one suicide,

73
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,901
one heart disease.

74
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,004
You think
the caskets we stole

75
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,838
gave an archaeologist
pancreatic cancer?

76
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,607
They are cursed.

77
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,908
I believe you.

78
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,610
- Well, I believe you believe you.
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,913
That innate sense of danger
is what drove you to become

80
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:53,883
perhaps the single best
security expert I know.

81
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,220
I'm right.
Don't touch it.

82
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,189
Have you seen the others?

83
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,923
Mm, just Margo.

84
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,691
You think
I haven't changed?

85
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,595
Come on.

86
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,630
She's exactly where
you'd think she'd be.

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,070
Ready, Margo?

88
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,805
Thirty seconds.

89
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,475
Go.

90
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,247
Ah. Know what
I'm thinking, Margo?

91
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,881
I'm thinking
of all the ways

92
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,985
I'm going to be
spending your moneys, yes?

93
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,668
No, no.

94
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:47,804
No, no, no, no, no!

95
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,939
Boo-yah!

96
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:54,511
I can name three other can
openers who could crack those locks.

97
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,314
Only one could do it
in 30 seconds,

98
00:04:57,448 --> 00:05:00,451
and none could do it
after a half pint of aquavit.

99
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,852
Reddington,
you dapper dog.

100
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,121
Margo, you're a Viking.

101
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,056
Five grand says
I can do it again in 20.

102
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,326
No dice. I came here to make
money, not give it away.

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,329
Good evening, Margo.

104
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,964
Hello, Mahmoud.

105
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:15,966
Mahmoud, your hearing
has gotten worse?

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,269
Oh, it's not all gone.
But soon.

107
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,170
I'm terribly sorry.

108
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:23,307
You're kind. But when I decided
to blow things up for a living,

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,542
I knew there'd be
occupational hazards.

110
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:29,980
Tell me, did I detect a chill
in the air from the two of you?

111
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:32,716
Are you on again
or off again?

112
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,551
Ah.

113
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,886
Welcome, everyone.

114
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,657
Thank you for coming.

115
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,824
I hope after
what you're about to hear,

116
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,529
you'll decide
that it has been worth it.

117
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,998
Let's talk business.

118
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,533
It's been just
under three years

119
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,702
since I first
went to Reddington,

120
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,936
told him about the caskets,
asked him to fund the job...

121
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,572
You have buyer or not?

122
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:57,441
Let her talk.

123
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,010
I want to say
we did the right thing.

124
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:03,547
No legitimate fence would've
touched what we had.

125
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,484
Every art crime cop in every
continent was watching.

126
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,020
The right thing to do
was split it and wait.

127
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:11,755
And you think
it's been long enough?

128
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,225
I do. We've seen a number of
high-profile thefts this year.

129
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,095
The FBI, INTERPOL,
they're busy elsewhere.

130
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,363
It's time to move.

131
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,398
Who's the buyer?

132
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:26,570
A collector, with a particular
interest in Byzantine art.

133
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:30,240
I did some research and
floated the idea last month.

134
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,142
You should've
asked us first.

135
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:33,943
- I agree.
- I don't.

136
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:36,447
As the architect,

137
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,049
it's Cassandra's right
to explore a next move.

138
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:40,951
Everything was done
anonymously.

139
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,387
He has no idea who we are,

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,190
but he is on his way,
and weather permitting,

141
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,624
he should be here
this time tomorrow.

142
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,226
What kinda bread
we baking?

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,295
Ah, it's hard to know.

144
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:55,065
Each individual piece
could be worth a few million,

145
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,103
but the complete set increases
the potential number to maybe...

146
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:00,437
Seventy-five.

147
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,806
- No, that's high.
- Come on.

148
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,744
The Blue Wittelsbach-Graff
Diamond went for over $23 mil.

149
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,780
The Qianlong vase
went for 53,

150
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,282
or maybe you think I'm too
dumb to do my homework.

151
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,118
- Take it easy.
- Easy?

152
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,287
The five of you
got 18% each.

153
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:21,258
That's even cut
for each specialty.

154
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:24,894
But me, I'm just a goon with a
gun, so I only get 10%?

155
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,265
No way I'm letting you undersell
and cut my take even more.

156
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,000
- Keep your voices down.
- Nobody wants to undersell...

157
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,302
You know what? Rules say

158
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:35,472
we don't sell
unless it's unanimous,

159
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:39,777
so maybe I don't agree to
anything until my cut is even!

160
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,943
That's enough, Joko.

161
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,683
You got 10%
because you came in late,

162
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:50,487
not because anyone here
undervalues your contribution.

163
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:53,991
As far as I'm concerned,
the goon with the gun,

164
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,593
he's the real operator.

165
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,296
He's the one who has to handle
himself under pressure

166
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,365
when things go sideways.

167
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:04,802
He's the one everyone
else has to rely on.

168
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,005
The goon with the gun doesn't do his
job, there is no job.

169
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,440
We needed you.

170
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,509
Nobody's ever said otherwise
except maybe you.

171
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:15,846
At the end of the day,
you accepted your cut,

172
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,714
and it's done.

173
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:25,022
So, let's all take a breath
and remember we're friends.

174
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,624
I vote we sell.

175
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,693
Agreed.
The sooner the better.

176
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:31,595
- Agreed.
- Then I make five.

177
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:39,336
Agreed.

178
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:58,655
Holy Mary Mother of God,
protect me now and always.

179
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:08,232
Margo,
yours is the last.

180
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,370
It's beautiful.

181
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,376
Margo. Your nose.

182
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,483
You should sit down.

183
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:30,888
Margo!

184
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,590
Margo.

185
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,759
Can you hear me?

186
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:44,596
Subtitles by explosiveskull
www.OpenSubtitles.org

187
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,578
I'll ask Mahmoud
if Margo has any family,

188
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:57,781
and if so, I'll see
that they get her remains.

189
00:09:57,915 --> 00:09:59,716
Grab a tablecloth there.

190
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,423
What do you think
happened to her?

191
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,100
What is it?

192
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,105
What do you see?

193
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,611
It was the curse!

194
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:29,047
Annika, please,
that's not helpful right now.

195
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,814
Y-You think
I'm kidding?

196
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:32,616
Margo was number four.

197
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,384
Four bodies connected
to these caskets

198
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:35,552
in the three years
since they were found!

199
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:36,653
She said stop it.

200
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,422
Everyone, just
try to calm down.

201
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,623
What could've happened?

202
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,792
Come on.
Are you serious?

203
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,126
I'll tell you what happened.

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,996
Diabetes. Hypertension...

205
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,463
You hardly knew her.

206
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,098
I don't have to know her.
Look at her.

207
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,035
Morbidly overweight,
probably alcoholic.

208
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,170
- Did she smoke?
- Yes, but...

209
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,205
Then the question isn't
why it happened.

210
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,873
It's why it didn't
happen sooner.

211
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:58,675
All right,
Joko, you made your point.

212
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,877
Margo could crack a bank vault

213
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:02,646
in less than eight minutes

214
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,314
under withering pressure.

215
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,317
She had ice water
in her veins.

216
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,820
Okay, she didn't
make healthy choices,

217
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:13,323
but this had nothing
to do with stress

218
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:16,893
or hypertension
or a curse.

219
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,329
You think
somebody killed her.

220
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:25,535
Why? Who would do that?

221
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:28,238
Someone who stands to gain
from her death.

222
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,840
That could be
any one of us.

223
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,209
Before, it was a six-way split.
Now it's only five.

224
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:34,745
Perhaps,
but only one of us

225
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,680
was complaining about
the size of their percentage.

226
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,548
You think I killed
your girlfriend?

227
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,084
She wasn't my girlfriend.

228
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,685
That's right.
You two broke up,

229
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,054
so maybe you killed her.

230
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,421
Maybe you can't handle idea

231
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,090
of her shacking up
with someone new.

232
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:47,257
Go to hell!

233
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,525
Mahmoud, look at me.

234
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,729
We are genuinely sorry
for your loss.

235
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,532
But the truth is,
we don't have enough evidence

236
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,768
to start accusing each other
of homicide.

237
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,239
I suggest
we all turn in early

238
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,340
and look at this

239
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,541
with fresh eyes
in the morning.

240
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,778
What about
Margo's casket?

241
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:10,447
If everyone agrees,
I'll hold onto it for now.

242
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,016
We do.

243
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,284
Everyone else,
take yours with you.

244
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,920
We'll reconvene here
at 7:00 a.m.

245
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,896
Do you remember
what happened

246
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,066
the last time you knocked
on my door at 2:00 a.m.?

247
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,566
Yes, you shot at me.

248
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,435
I thought you were
someone else.

249
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:32,936
You thought
I was your husband.

250
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,939
I like committing
crimes of passion.

251
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:37,374
Want to commit one now?

252
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:41,578
I had something a bit
more frigid in mind.

253
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,281
Petechial hemorrhages?

254
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,450
Broken blood vessels

255
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,918
in her eyes.

256
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,453
Also on the inside
of her lips

257
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,123
and underneath
her fingernails.

258
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,757
That means
she was poisoned?

259
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,995
Not definitively, no,
but it certainly suggests it.

260
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,897
We won't know for sure
until we open her up.

261
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:02,033
What?

262
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,301
We need towels,

263
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,937
tongs, and a ladle.

264
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:09,107
Doesn't matter what size.

265
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:15,012
Boy, you really know how
to show a girl a good time.

266
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,951
Tell me, do you do autopsies
during all your dates,

267
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:22,652
or am I special?

268
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:34,297
I never heard from you
after Marseilles.

269
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,168
Was a perfect job.

270
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,737
An even more perfect four days
together at Hotel de la Mer.

271
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:43,707
Can I have a towel?

272
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,677
Raymond.

273
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,981
I've walked away
from Marco.

274
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:51,314
From everything.

275
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,650
I thought
you would, too.

276
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,920
I was going to.

277
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,994
Till I found out we took nearly
$40 million from that vault,

278
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,162
not 30.

279
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:09,533
You're either very bad at math
or very good at lying.

280
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,867
I'm good at both.

281
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,435
What I'm terrible
at is life.

282
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,571
Another towel.

283
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:25,849
After Marseilles,
I heard about a job in Lisbon.

284
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,518
Big score,
but it came with a big overhead.

285
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,089
Tunneling gear,
commercial grade, the works.

286
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,692
I thought about bringing it to
you, but I couldn't.

287
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:40,730
You say you walked away
because I took the money,

288
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,366
but I took it because
you'd already walked away.

289
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:48,338
Can you hold that?

290
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,475
I shouldn't
have done it,

291
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,544
but I was hurt, and...

292
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:56,713
I regret it.

293
00:14:58,015 --> 00:14:59,583
You have no reason
to believe me,

294
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:02,719
but I do.

295
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,224
Tell me about Lisbon.

296
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,462
Uh, I invested
everything I had

297
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,431
and even some
I didn't have.

298
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,467
And then,
at the last minute,

299
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:20,104
just two days before
we were set to move,

300
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:22,739
the museum shipped the
piece back to New York,

301
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:27,811
made a secret deal to trade
exhibits, and that was it.

302
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,913
I lost
my entire investment.

303
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,414
Why are you
telling me this?

304
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:33,650
You asked.

305
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:35,418
You brought it up.

306
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,421
Why?

307
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:41,959
Because I've had a run
of bad luck lately,

308
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,295
and I've been thinking
a lot about why.

309
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,528
You sound like Annika.

310
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:48,099
It's no accident

311
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:51,102
that things went wrong
when I burned what we had.

312
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,770
I would do anything
to take it back,

313
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,307
to go back to that suite

314
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,641
at Hotel de la Mer.

315
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,777
The ladle.

316
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:04,848
The ladle.

317
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:14,791
She bled to death
internally.

318
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,661
Must be half
her blood supply.

319
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:19,330
How?

320
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,802
Some kind of
anti-coagulating agent.

321
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,340
When blood's that thin,
you can spontaneously hemorrhage.

322
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,275
Every organ,

323
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,279
all your veins, arteries

324
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,181
start leaking
into the viscera.

325
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:38,715
You're sure?

326
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,018
This didn't happen
naturally.

327
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:42,420
Someone killed her.

328
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:45,689
Someone on this island.

329
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,328
Murdered?

330
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,229
You wanted a forensic
investigation.

331
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,065
That's what it showed.

332
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,199
Where's Joko?

333
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,599
I-I knocked
on his door.

334
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,901
And you're sure?

335
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,205
Yes.
She was poisoned,

336
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,042
dosed with
an anti-coagulating agent.

337
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:07,211
D-Dosed?
You... You mean injected?

338
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:09,913
It seems more likely
it was administered orally,

339
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,083
in her food
or something she drank.

340
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,417
Last night at dinner?

341
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,020
What I saw would've
taken hours to develop...

342
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:17,721
Six, maybe even eight.

343
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,390
What time
did Margo get here?

344
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:20,857
- Yesterday morning. We all did...
- W-W-What you saw?

345
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,826
You did an autopsy?
You cut her open?

346
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,029
So it happened
here on the island.

347
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,064
I saw you
having breakfast with her.

348
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,268
- You think I killed her?
- As far as motives go,

349
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:33,104
there aren't any
more powerful than love.

350
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,039
Money.

351
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,208
Maybe, but if money
were the objective,

352
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,576
why stop there? Why not
kill the rest of us, too?

353
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,078
I have no idea.

354
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,415
But I'm sure as hell
going to ask!

355
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,050
Ask who?

356
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,884
Well, only one of us
isn't here.

357
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,089
Mahmoud, the man's
three times your size.

358
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:53,757
What do you intend to do,
poke him to death?

359
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,026
He's right. Will you stop?

360
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,693
We don't even know
it was him.

361
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,827
Joko!

362
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:58,963
Come out here!

363
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,801
Watch out.

364
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:34,965
Oh, my God.

365
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:40,670
None of us
are capable of this.

366
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,107
For a treasure
like the caskets,

367
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,509
people are capable
of anything.

368
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,811
I agree.

369
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,946
But he wasn't killed
for the treasure.

370
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,949
I don't know
what's happening,

371
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,953
but clearly, this isn't
about the caskets.

372
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,492
Annika, you can't leave.

373
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,726
Are you kidding me?
I am not interested in dying here!

374
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,162
Oh, look,
we should stick together

375
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,564
until we know
what we're dealing with.

376
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:07,931
You have my casket.

377
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,334
It is yours.
I don't want it.

378
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:11,701
That's ridiculous.

379
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:12,836
You're walking away
from millions.

380
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,971
Five bodies!

381
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,573
I won't be the sixth.

382
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,074
You going?

383
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,409
Damn right,

384
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,344
and if you are smart,
you will go with me...

385
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:22,580
You, Cassandra,
and Mahmoud.

386
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:28,152
Mahmoud.

387
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,054
Where is he?

388
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,679
Mahmoud?

389
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,223
- Annika, listen to me.
- Please, please, please, please.

390
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:09,093
Hello?

391
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:11,228
- Hello?
- If we just stick together,

392
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,496
we can talk this out.

393
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,031
Hello? Anybody here?

394
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:21,972
Mahmoud.

395
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,696
Hello?

396
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,632
Hello? Is anybody here?

397
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:50,134
- Please...
- Annika.

398
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,069
- Somebody help!
- What are you doing?

399
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:54,271
Where is Arthur?
I want to see him right now.

400
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,805
I want off this island.

401
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:57,608
I want him
to fly me home!

402
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,276
Annika, stay calm.

403
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,445
No one's going anywhere
in this weather.

404
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,380
The plane can't fly.

405
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,914
We have to wait
for the weather to clear.

406
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,016
You!

407
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,285
You brought us here!

408
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,154
Wait, Mahmoud! Please!

409
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:11,355
You did this!

410
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,425
- You poisoned her!
- No!

411
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:16,060
You put something
in her nebulizer!

412
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,628
You poisoned us all!

413
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,463
Mahmoud! Mahmoud.

414
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:21,298
Lower the gun.

415
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:24,134
Think!
It had to be her!

416
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:26,604
She set us up!
She walked us into a trap!

417
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,439
Lower your weapon now!

418
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:29,974
Get away from her!

419
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,442
Mahmoud, I won't
tell you again.

420
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:38,115
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

421
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,758
You were right.

422
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,529
I have no reason
to believe you.

423
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,333
About Marseilles
or about this.

424
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,203
I didn't do this.

425
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,139
But I know who did.

426
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,147
I worked
through a fence in Boston.

427
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,483
He introduced me
to a potential buyer

428
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:15,719
who turned out to be
an FBI undercover agent.

429
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,121
He played with me
for a few days.

430
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,223
He made sure
he got me on tape,

431
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,392
and then he arrested me
for theft

432
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:26,430
and interstate transportation
of stolen property.

433
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:28,499
And you cut a deal.

434
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:30,000
Is that why you
brought us together?

435
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,969
Save yourself
by giving us up?

436
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,672
I didn't
give them your names,

437
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,374
and I got it in writing that
they wouldn't ask for them.

438
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:40,244
Well, if they didn't want us,
what did they want?

439
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,845
You remember where
the caskets were found?

440
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,983
An archaeological dig
in the Kayseri Province.

441
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,420
One of the archaeologists
was a CIA agent

442
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:53,457
using the dig as cover to meet
with his Turkish sources.

443
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,125
Source...
What sources?

444
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,529
American operatives inside
the Turkish government.

445
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:01,231
They told you this?
The FBI?

446
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:04,001
The Turks had figured out
who he was.

447
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,369
They knew that he had a list

448
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:07,837
of American assets
inside their country.

449
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,740
They killed him for it.

450
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,241
But they didn't
get the list?

451
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,145
No, because he'd already
hidden it as a microdot.

452
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,780
That's what this is about.

453
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:22,186
The Smithsonian had
sponsored the expedition.

454
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,722
He knew that he could get
the intel out of the country

455
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:26,423
in the caskets,

456
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:29,426
which would be sent to D.C.
for further analysis.

457
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,564
So he put the microdot
on one of them.

458
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,632
And the CIA
wants it back

459
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,968
to protect the identities
of their undercover agents.

460
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:40,003
We made a deal.

461
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:43,607
I'd help them to recover the
caskets and secure their intel,

462
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:47,177
and in return, they'd let us walk...
All of us.

463
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:51,415
But then,
it all went sideways.

464
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:54,884
It went sideways because
they weren't CIA agents.

465
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,088
They lied to you.

466
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:00,624
And we won't know why
until we read the microdot.

467
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,412
Do you have
your cell phone with you?

468
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,913
It won't work.
There's no service.

469
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,183
We're hundreds of miles
from the nearest tower.

470
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,519
I don't intend
to make a call.

471
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:40,864
Ah, perfect.

472
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,299
Now we just need
a screwdriver

473
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,701
and some tape...
Any kind of tape.

474
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:55,212
My father was fascinated
by insects.

475
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:59,216
Fancied himself
an amateur entomologist.

476
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,318
Ah, great.

477
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:06,890
By the time I was six,
my father had taught me

478
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:13,163
that a microscope is
essentially two convex lenses

479
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:16,200
in relationship
to one another.

480
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,669
I'll never forget
the joy on his face

481
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:22,239
as he helped me
make my first one,

482
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:26,910
then watched as I went into
the yard in search of bugs.

483
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:30,280
The idea that a whole world
that I couldn't see

484
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,349
had suddenly
revealed itself

485
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,386
and been brought
into focus...

486
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,356
...felt like a miracle.

487
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,593
Because it was,

488
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:46,296
given how often we miss
what's right in front of us.

489
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:50,934
What I see right
in front of me

490
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,370
is someone
I misjudged.

491
00:25:57,541 --> 00:26:00,444
What's happened tonight,
I should've known.

492
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:03,714
You could never
have done it.

493
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,219
But we do that,
you and I...

494
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,288
Misjudge each other.

495
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,692
I tonight,
you in Marseilles.

496
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:20,797
I wanted to run away with you.
You didn't.

497
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,400
What you misjudged
was the reason why.

498
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,671
You thought
it was about you.

499
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:31,208
It wasn't.
I had obligations.

500
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,014
To the young woman
you were watching over.

501
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,649
Yes.

502
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:41,552
Her husband wasn't
who he appeared to be.

503
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,421
She was in jeopardy.
I had to intervene.

504
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,424
And... is she still
in jeopardy?

505
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:49,526
I hope not.

506
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:55,666
Then maybe you're no longer
under obligation.

507
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,638
Not except
to watch her daughter dance

508
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,307
in <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>
tomorrow night.

509
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:08,012
You have the caskets?

510
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,647
Yes, four of them.

511
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:11,815
Where's yours?

512
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,451
In my suite.

513
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:17,989
Mahmoud's must still
be in his, as well.

514
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:21,658
If one of these four
has the microdot,

515
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:24,028
all we need
is a little light,

516
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,430
and we should be able
to read it.

517
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:33,470
Damn it.

518
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:37,407
It's so fussy, this.

519
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,478
We need tape.
We really need tape.

520
00:27:58,997 --> 00:27:59,998
Raymond?

521
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:23,520
Who are they?

522
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,623
The island staff.

523
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,226
Turks got here
before we did.

524
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,195
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

525
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:54,418
Thanks for coming.

526
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,586
We have
so many questions.

527
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,559
Let's try this again,
shall we?

528
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:06,263
I want to know who you are
and why you are here.

529
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,665
I think you
and your homicidal brethren

530
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,467
masquerading
as house staff

531
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,769
are in fact
Turkish operatives.

532
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:15,973
I think you're here
to recover the microdot,

533
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:18,809
the one the CIA officer hid
in one of the caskets.

534
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:21,045
Is that why you're here?

535
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,815
To get the list of Americans
working in your government?

536
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:26,984
Do you know which casket
you're looking for?

537
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,321
Fair enough.
Maybe you don't speak English.

538
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,590
Let's see
if you recognize numbers.

539
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:37,061
Three, two, one.

540
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,495
The smallest one.

541
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,998
Ah, so you do
understand numbers.

542
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:42,632
The smallest casket.

543
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:45,002
That's why you targeted
Margo first.

544
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,804
That's what the American
told us before he died.

545
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:49,140
We don't know
if he told the truth.

546
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:51,075
We're about to find out.

547
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,743
The plan was
to poison the woman only.

548
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,712
Once you were alerted,
our objective changed.

549
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:58,182
We were told
to eliminate everyone.

550
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:00,985
Retrieve and examine
all six caskets.

551
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,330
Looks like your
poor CIA officer

552
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,564
did tell you the truth.

553
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,299
You found it?

554
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,835
Yes, but it's not a list

555
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,806
of American assets in Turkey.

556
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,808
It appears we had it
the wrong way around.

557
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,310
<i>Ahmet. Ahmet, come in.</i>

558
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:31,648
How many operatives
does he have?

559
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,453
Never mind.
I'll ask him myself.

560
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,956
<i>Ahmet,
report your location.</i>

561
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,893
Ahmet's taking a nap.

562
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:44,494
To whom do I have
the pleasure of speaking?

563
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:47,697
Reddington.

564
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:50,067
<i>I know that voice.
Arthur Rodman.</i>

565
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,902
Cassandra, do you realize
what this means?

566
00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:53,204
The butler did it.

567
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:55,472
Oh, I'm no butler.

568
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,275
<i>Oh, I know exactly
what you are.</i>

569
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,608
You're the bloodhound
the Turks hired

570
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,544
to find the list
of Turkish assets

571
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:02,846
working within
the American government.

572
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,514
<i>Wait a minute.
Oh, my God.</i>

573
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:06,650
You're Cornelius Ruck,
aren't you?

574
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,852
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

575
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:11,721
<i>You tracked Korgeneral Ordu
across the Gibson.</i>

576
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:13,423
They say you made do
for three days

577
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:16,027
on nothing but honeypot ants
and eucalyptus.

578
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,861
Oh, my God.
Of course the Turks

579
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:19,362
hired you to find the list.

580
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:22,332
Where's the microdot?

581
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,434
We have it,
and we're taking it with us

582
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:25,535
when we leave the island.

583
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,604
<i>Don't be absurd.</i>

584
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:29,806
<i>You're never leaving
this island.</i>

585
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,576
You're in a storm with no
transportation or heavy weaponry

586
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:35,046
facing a dozen
of our best agents.

587
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:37,714
Surrender, and I'll consider
showing you mercy.

588
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,717
We'll need a little time
to think about that.

589
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:44,188
You need a little time...

590
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:46,290
That's long enough.
We've decided.

591
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:48,292
We're going to forego
the offer to surrender.

592
00:31:48,425 --> 00:31:50,294
Wish us luck.

593
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:51,862
We don't have a choice.

594
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,797
We're either leaving here
with the caskets or...

595
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,532
Mm.

596
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,104
We should definitely
leave with the caskets.

597
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:02,073
Mm.

598
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:55,912
Hi, there.

599
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:58,915
The knife.

600
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:05,156
Cassandra. Cassandra,
are you listening?

601
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:08,225
<i>You have something I want,
the caskets,</i>

602
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,095
and I have someone
you may like to trade for.

603
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:14,098
<i>Either you bring my casket
to the Bibliotek,</i>

604
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:15,932
or I put a bullet
in Mr. Reddington's head.

605
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:23,541
You should have
come to me from the outset.

606
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,509
So many lives
might have been spared.

607
00:35:25,642 --> 00:35:27,445
Mm.

608
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:36,786
Open it.

609
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:45,996
Get over there
with her.

610
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,188
So what now?

611
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:14,291
I get rich.

612
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,658
You die.

613
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:18,996
Oh.

614
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,399
Well, any time
would be good.

615
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:25,269
Like now.

616
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:46,323
You all right?

617
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,093
Raymond!

618
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:54,598
- It's over.
- No! No!

619
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:55,932
Goodbye, Mr. Reddington.

620
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,635
Well, hold on.
You forgot the fish.

621
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:00,304
What... What fish?

622
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:02,406
The sailfish.
Above the mantle.

623
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:27,331
What do you know?

624
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:28,765
It stopped snowing.

625
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,370
So?

626
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:09,473
Cynthia is nothing if not a
fan of the dramatic reveal.

627
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:15,912
I can't believe it.

628
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,615
I'm not here
to test your faith, love.

629
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:18,748
Just to get a number.

630
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:39,003
That's a nice number.

631
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:43,940
This calls
for a celebration.

632
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,043
In the south of France,
perhaps.

633
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:50,780
Do you mean that?

634
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:54,784
As you said,
I fulfilled my obligation.

635
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,155
Yes.

636
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,493
All but one.

637
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,748
- You guys!
- That was a great show.

638
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,117
- And she was adorable.
- Right? Wasn't it so cute.

639
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,385
Oh, my God.

640
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:02,653
The cutest.

641
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,488
She may actually be more
adorable in tights than me.

642
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,958
Hey!

643
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:10,961
Ohh, hi, Agnes.

644
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:15,833
Oh, my God.

645
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,167
Ready?

646
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:19,069
I am.

647
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:20,471
To say goodbye.

648
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:25,209
I told you,
I'm under no obligation.

649
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:28,045
I know.

650
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:32,483
But I saw you watching,
how you looked.

651
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:35,753
You may have come into her
life out of obligation,

652
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:38,622
but you're staying in it
for love.

653
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:41,992
Cassandra...

654
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:43,660
Who knew
that underneath it all,

655
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,630
you're so sweet?

656
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:02,846
I didn't think
you'd made it.

657
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:07,017
Watched from the wings.

658
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,286
And you brought a friend.

659
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:12,523
If you have plans...

660
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:13,791
I don't.

661
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:19,296
Thank you, by the way,
for the intel on the Turkish agents.

662
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,836
You know,
you were right

663
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:28,138
when you recently
told me that, um,

664
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:30,274
it's been difficult
since Tom,

665
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,676
but that I have Agnes,
and I should be looking forward

666
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,677
and not back.

667
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,147
And that you deserve
a bigger life.

668
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,384
I agree.

669
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,320
I do.

670
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:44,388
But so do you.

671
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:50,360
I don't know
how to do that.

672
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:53,864
That makes two of us.

673
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,632
Mommy,
where are you?

674
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:56,800
You should get back.

675
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:01,138
Thanks again for coming.
It means a lot.

676
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,906
To me, too.

677
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:10,180
Hey.

678
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:15,052
We may not have bigger lives,
but we have each other.

679
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:28,497

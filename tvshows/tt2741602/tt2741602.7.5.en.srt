1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,503
I don't know what to say.

2
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:14,114
Abbott has some of the most impressive

3
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:15,973
college acceptances in the country.

4
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,575
And this scholarship...

5
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:19,143
- it would cover full tuition?
- Yes.

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,078
Along with room and board

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,581
and a stipend for books and supplies.

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,350
- So I'd live at the school?
- We could visit anytime.

9
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:28,185
Yeah, we're only a few hours away.

10
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:30,854
Howie, your reaction is natural.

11
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,757
But I want you to know...
our scholarship committee

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,727
combs through thousands
of nomination letters

13
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,195
from across the country.

14
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,464
There were more than 2,200 submissions

15
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:43,367
for the Booth-Farnwell seat
this year alone.

16
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:48,272
And the selection committee
agreed that you, Howie,

17
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:52,476
you're the one who shows
the most raw academic potential.

18
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:55,179
So if you want to become a member

19
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,615
of the Abbott Boarding School...

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,417
the scholarship's yours.

21
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:04,088
Thank you!

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,856
And remember to mark your calendars.

23
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,791
Parents weekend will be here
before you know it.

24
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,012
Uh, Howie, shake the man's hand.

25
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:16,500
Sorry. Just... getting over a cold.

William Burroughs

31
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,300
said the same thing to me once.

32
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,437
I have two leads.

33
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,714
Tell me.

34
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,975
Ah! Ernesto's a concierge nurse.

35
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:35,412
Ernesto coordinates
a burgeoning portfolio

36
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,981
of urine samples and blood draws.

37
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,217
As a bonus, he doesn't
understand a lick of English,

38
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,485
so, please, speak freely.

39
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,965
One lead is still a work in progress.

40
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,456
The other one is solid.

41
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,651
What do you know about Norman Devane?

42
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:49,198
- He's an assassin.
- He's a genius.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,395
Well, he's an ingenious assassin.

44
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:53,464
Who hides murder behind illness.

45
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,700
Our friend in Paris made
a series of payments to him

46
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,603
under the alias of Constance Drucker.

47
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,000
Paris was not your fault.

48
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,709
Devane can get us to her.

49
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,414
I spoke to Linda.

50
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:11,048
She says you haven't slept well
since it all happened.

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,583
I underestimated her.

52
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:13,981
Well, we both did.

53
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,716
I should've known better.

54
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,554
Linda tells me your goddaughter's

55
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,856
getting married Saturday.

56
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,248
- You should go.
- No.

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,834
Get drunk, dance the hora, and forget.

58
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:24,728
No. I-I am not leaving your side
until this is done.

59
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,064
My friend.

62
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,743
Elizabeth. I have a case for you.

63
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:43,165
The man we're looking for
is Norman Devane.

64
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,415
Oh, uh, that's, um...

65
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,798
Uh, sorry.

66
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:53,557
We all know Devane as the mastermind

67
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,926
behind the Libyan bioweapons program,

68
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,895
but Reddington says that represents

69
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,297
just a single line
in a very lengthy résumé.

70
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,700
In Reddington's world, Devane
is known as a killer for hire.

71
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,203
Simon Vestergaard was a shipping magnate

72
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,771
who died of liver cancer.

73
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:11,708
Senator Jessica Tandler died
of drug-resistant pneumonia.

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,978
And Ronald Perchik
was a federal judge who suffered

75
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,682
a deadly stroke two days after
receiving a shingles vaccine.

76
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:21,084
Did Devane kill them, or did
they die of natural causes?

77
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,853
Both. And according to Reddington,

78
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,764
Devane is in the U.S. and active.

79
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,758
Subject is a 14-year-old Caucasian male.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
Type B-negative.

81
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,862
Full immunization record.

82
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,964
Hey, uh, you new?

83
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,098
You look new.

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,668
Mm-hmm. Howie Keller.

85
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,903
Howie? Cute. Uh, I'm Theo Wolf.

86
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,773
Sort of the, uh, unofficial
Abbott welcoming party.

87
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,942
- So he kills sick people?
- No, he kills people

88
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:47,110
by making them sick...
by giving them cancer

89
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,179
or pneumonia or some
other deadly disease.

90
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,315
He gives them cancer?
Is that even possible?

91
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,717
Theoretically,
if a healthy person is injected

92
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,086
with a high concentration
of cancerous cells

93
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,655
and those cells got into
his or her bone marrow,

94
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,691
they could, you know, catch leukemia.

95
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,393
- Catch it. Like a cold?
- Yeah, just a super bad one.

96
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:06,363
The world believed these three
died of natural causes,

97
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:07,865
but Reddington says they were murdered.

98
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,267
You don't get it. Uh, Brandon Durso

99
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,336
got a B-plus on his
French presentation...

100
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,137
had a full-blown panic attack.

101
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,139
- Because he got a B?
- A B plus.

102
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,641
My point is, you can't take all that

103
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,543
"truth and excellence" crap
too seriously.

104
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,612
You got to be able to relax here.

105
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,881
And if you need any help
with that, like some...

106
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,182
some weed or, uh...

107
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:26,935
Well, I don't do drugs.

108
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,919
Right. Says the new kid.

109
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,821
The woman who abducted
Mr. Reddington in Paris...

110
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,756
- she's in business with Devane?
- Apparently.

111
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,025
Did she hire him to kill
Reddington or someone else?

112
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,168
He doesn't know.

113
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,428
So all we know is that
an insidious assassin

114
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,735
is on the loose and we have
no idea how to catch him.

115
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,332
The WMD Directorate oversaw

116
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,867
our response to the Libyan bioweapons.

117
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,436
If Devane is the mastermind,
he might be on their radar.

118
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:48,238
Get there and see. At this point,

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,958
"might be" is the best we've got.

120
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:53,844
Elodie Radcliffe?

121
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,679
The woman whose husband
is in a wheelchair?

122
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,948
Yes. Exactly. I'm the "other man" to...

123
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,184
I mean, I'm not yet, but... I want to be.

124
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,586
Which is worse.

125
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,254
I think it's great.

126
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:06,990
Great? I slept with a married woman.

127
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,092
I think it's great you slept with anyone.

128
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,929
I appreciate that she's
taking care of her husband.

129
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,402
But she needs a life, too. And so do you.

130
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,135
Sorry to keep you waiting.

131
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,171
But Putin has a new nuke,
and it turns out the Ayatollahs

132
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,074
have more heavy water than
a surrogate carrying twins.

133
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:27,177
And now that I've kept you
waiting, I can't help you.

134
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,146
Uh, we called ahead
asking for any information

135
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,480
- your office had...
- Norman Devane.

136
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,482
We know what he did,
but not what he's doing.

137
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,173
After Libya, he went to Syria.

138
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,954
Helped Assad gas his own people.
He was smart.

139
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:40,390
You name it... bacteria, virus,
fungi... he could weaponize it.

140
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,908
You hit him with a drone strike
outside Damascus.

141
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,661
We hit his lab. Never found him.

142
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,330
But you traced a payment he made

143
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:47,798
to an Anatole Kuragin. Who's he?

144
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,600
A Ukrainian hacker. And the
payment was seven years ago.

145
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,135
We haven't heard from him since.

146
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,437
Do you know where we could find him?

147
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,707
He's in Havana.
So, yes, I know where he is.

148
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,075
But you can't find him.

149
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:00,610
I know someone who can.

150
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,551
October 25th. 1:35 a.m.

151
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,753
Subject Howard Keller.

152
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,848
Administering pathogen A-21.

153
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,892
You're going to feel a little pinch.

154
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,272
Unbelievable.

155
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,950
Who the hell are you?

156
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:24,286
A friend told me you had a keen eye

157
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:26,588
for salt and pepper shakers.

158
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,492
She was wrong. You have an exquisite eye.

159
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:32,494
What do you want?

160
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:37,900
I once saw the most adorable
little ceramic set

161
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,269
in a junk shop outside Topeka...

162
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:43,872
salt in a straw hat, pepper in a bowler,

163
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:48,577
both delicately balanced
on a tiny green hat stand.

164
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,547
You're a collector.

165
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,182
Eh, an admirer.

166
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:55,551
Of all things precious.

167
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,452
Including information.

168
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,423
What kind of information?

169
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:04,026
Whatever you know about Norman Devane.

170
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,929
I don't know anything.

171
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,798
As a rule, I also admire loyalty.

172
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,401
But as I have pressing business
with Mr. Devane,

173
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,185
I'm afraid you'll have to
make an exception.

174
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:16,238
I don't make exceptions.

175
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,211
Perhaps these will change your mind.

176
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,448
Technically speaking,
they're pepper casters.

177
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,184
Handcrafted American silver

178
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:32,490
from the workshop of Paul Revere.

179
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,990
Original or replica?

180
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,759
I'm surprised you would even ask.

181
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:55,811
I don't mean to press,

182
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,294
but I have a meeting
in an hour with Raúl.

183
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,983
Raúl? You're meeting with Castro.

184
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:04,152
Yes, and unlike Fidel, he's
a stickler for punctuality.

185
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,354
So. Devane.

186
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:07,723
He paid me to create backdoor access

187
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:10,092
to National Diagnostics Lab's
server farm.

188
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,460
Why?

189
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:13,992
Is this a Frommer?

190
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:17,366
I knew a gaucho who
had a pearl-handled one

191
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,967
in Patagonia, of all places.

192
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,036
- What was Devane looking for?
- He swore by it.

193
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,772
Though he did say the trigger
was a little sticky.

194
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,375
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Raymond!

195
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,277
Oh, what the hell?

196
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,045
I barely touched the trigger!

197
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:31,413
It has a grip safety.

198
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,015
Well, he must have disabled it.

199
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,216
Oh! Ge...

200
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,550
Ohh, God!

201
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:38,553
Obviously, he set it to a hair trigger.

202
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:41,323
The man clearly had a death wish.

203
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,992
Now we will never know
what Devane was looking for.

204
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,527
You should take a shower.

205
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,529
Get some clothes from his closet.

206
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:55,193
Elizabeth. Write this down.

207
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:58,407
National Diagnostics Lab.

208
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:02,311
A warrant? To access our system?

209
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:03,912
We believe that it's been hacked.

210
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,280
By whom? For what?

211
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,716
Your company does diagnostic
testing for hospitals

212
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,084
and clinics all across the country,

213
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,749
which means your system has information.

214
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,431
On 110 million patients.

215
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,690
110 million.

216
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,091
From children to presidents.

217
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,893
If the system was hacked, whoever did it

218
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,351
has detailed medical
and financial information

219
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,997
on one in three Americans.

220
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,686
We're gonna need access to that database.

221
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,539
- I'm not falling for it, Theo.
- It's not a joke, man.

222
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,708
That janitor freak had you
in the laundry bin

223
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,343
and wheeled you into the south wing.

224
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,610
I would've woken up.

225
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:37,082
Besides, if you really saw something,

226
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,413
why didn't you say anything?

227
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,648
Yeah, and tell Dr. Mitchell

228
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,717
that I was hot-boxing Lancaster's room?

229
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,885
- Not happening.
- You were probably hallucinating.

230
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,588
Your bed was empty, man.
I know what I saw.

231
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,523
Look, you're a newbie,
so you wouldn't know this,

232
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:52,194
but weird stuff happens
at Abbott, all right?

233
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:54,262
So he sleeps with her

234
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,497
and then never calls her.

235
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,332
He wants to, but it's been two weeks.

236
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,968
"He" is right here, tracing the hack.

237
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,871
How can anybody be so smart and so dumb?

238
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:04,483
- It's a gift.
- Well, call her.

239
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,841
Say you've been on assignment.

240
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,977
Lying? That's your advice on
how to start a relationship?

241
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,413
No, that's my advice
on how to salvage one.

242
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,416
Okay. That's weird.
Um, not... not your advice.

243
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,451
Well, uh... Well, definitely your advice.

244
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:19,955
But it looks like, uh,
Kuragin hacked the system

245
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,958
to give some root access that
they used to order a test.

246
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,060
- What kind of a test?
- Full genome sequencing

247
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:27,896
on a 13-year-old boy
named Marcus Sinclair.

248
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,365
Are you telling me Devane hired a hacker

249
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,868
to access the medical records
of 100 million people

250
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,037
just so he could sequence
one teenager's genes?

251
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,606
Actually... Actually, it seems like

252
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,214
they hired him to sequence
the genes of 20 teenagers.

253
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:44,946
Why? What makes them special?

254
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,316
Howie! Hey.

255
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,085
I wanted to congratulate you
on Tuesday's quiz.

256
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:52,921
You were the only student with
a perfect score in the cl...

257
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,524
Howie? You look awfully pale.
Are you feeling all right?

258
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:58,326
I'm okay. Just a little...

259
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:01,229
Ohh! Get a nurse!

260
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,565
- What happened?
- Yeah, she's coming!

261
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,267
You passed out in the hallway, man.

262
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:06,688
How could you still not believe me?

263
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,303
Maybe 'cause you were high.

264
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,605
Would you let that go?

265
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,541
I'm telling you, whoever
took you last night

266
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,543
clearly did something to you.

267
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,877
You're being paranoid.

268
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,412
The nurse said I was probably dehydrated.

269
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:20,082
The nurse could be in on it
for all we know.

270
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:24,019
I told you... weird stuff
happens at this school.

271
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,054
Kids get sick, disappear.

272
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:27,989
Look.

273
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,192
I swiped these from Dr. Mitchell's office

274
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:31,636
so that we can get into the south wing

275
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,776
a-and find wherever Dr. Who took you.

276
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,131
Do you even watch "Dr. Who"?

277
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,088
Are you coming with me or not?

278
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,706
There's 20 teenagers.
All white, all male.

279
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,209
And all with B-negative blood
or similar biomarkers.

280
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,244
Devane used the hack to identify patients

281
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,979
who fit a specific demographic,

282
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,914
then sampled and sequenced their DNA

283
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,449
using NDL's automated system.

284
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:08,851
So Devane's looking at kids who fit

285
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,653
a particular biochemical
and genetic profile. Why?

286
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,655
We don't know,
but of the 20 kids he sequenced,

287
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,759
five developed life-threatening
cancers or infections.

288
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,194
Three died. Two recovered.

289
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:21,163
Why would a man who
assassinated world leaders

290
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,564
start targeting kids?

291
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,500
And why would some of the kids
he targeted survive?

292
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:26,135
Not to mention how any of this connects

293
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,303
to the woman who abducted
Reddington in Paris.

294
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,972
Keen, Ressler, meet with the parents.

295
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,307
Aram, stay with the
National Diagnostics files.

296
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:36,445
I see a lot of smoke. Now
we just have to find the fire.

297
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,579
N-No. No. No. No.

298
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:02,052
Doesn't matter how I know. I know.

299
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,587
Short December pork bellies.

300
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,923
Yes, the full five million.

301
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,159
It's done.

302
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:15,463
Cheer up! Dembe found a text
on Kuragin's phone.

303
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:19,111
It seems Mr. Kuragin hacked
into the agriculture department

304
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,568
and learned that the Chinese

305
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,271
are about to impose
a tariff on pork bellies.

306
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,194
He may have expired

307
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:27,609
before telling us
all he knew about Devane,

308
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,546
but we're gonna make a fortune
in the futures market.

309
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,036
I'm not like you.

310
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,584
I may have been once, but not anymore.

311
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,125
What happened in Havana and Paris, I...

312
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,576
I just can't shake it.

313
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:43,825
Neither can I.

314
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,925
But I can accept it.

315
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,597
Things happen.

316
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,099
You, a fatalist?

317
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,867
Save that for someone who
doesn't know you so well.

318
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,135
You leave nothing to fate.

319
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:55,904
I try to leave nothing to fate,

320
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,006
but I'm perfectly comfortable with chaos.

321
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:01,731
That's why I trust that
whatever happens is...

322
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,945
probably meant to be.

323
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:06,047
Like accidentally killing a guy

324
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,616
and finding he has intel on hog futures.

325
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,151
Cosmic, huh?

326
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,220
Like you ending up in a velour tracksuit.

327
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:15,657
It looks comfortable as hell, I must say.

328
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,528
You know, I came out of
retirement for Paris.

329
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,731
For you. For us.

330
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,768
I look forward to
going back to my hammock.

331
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,604
You said you had two possible leads.

332
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:30,805
What's the second?

333
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,907
I have a source. Won't give his name.

334
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,677
He sent me a secure message
saying he could identify

335
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,347
the man who coordinated
your abduction. He's skittish.

336
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:42,317
I know he's in town,
but he's refusing to meet.

337
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,454
How about this wedding?

338
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,922
I told you, I'm not going.

339
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,157
Because it's a distraction.

340
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,259
It has nothing to do with Paris.

341
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,527
But what if it did?

342
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,697
What if the wedding
helped us solve Paris?

343
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,798
Would you go then?

344
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,199
Of course, but it doesn't.

345
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,336
Weddings, for the most part,
are safe, happy places.

346
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,720
Places that even the most skittish source

347
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,855
would be comfortable in.

348
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,574
You want me to invite
the source to the wedding?

349
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:09,411
Drunken revelers, interminable toasting,

350
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,645
cheesy cover bands...

351
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:14,249
I can't think of a better place
for a covert meeting.

352
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,584
I doubt it will work, but I will try.

353
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,420
That's all anyone can do.

354
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,143
The rest, we leave to fate.

355
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,062
Two rounds of chemo.
Then radiation. Then surgery.

356
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,330
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been.

357
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:30,652
On all of you.

358
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:33,301
They put Peter into a coma to
try to buy him some more time,

359
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:36,471
but none of the antibiotics
that they tried worked.

360
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:37,906
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

361
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:40,041
Insurance paid for some,
but we had to take out

362
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,810
a second mortgage on the house.

363
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:46,114
Don't know if we'll ever be able
to pay it back, but he's alive.

364
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:48,249
How long has Ben been in remission?

365
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,684
- Five years.
- The doctors said

366
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:51,820
it was a miracle the tumor
didn't metastasize.

367
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,721
Mr. Crane, can you tell me if anyone

368
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:55,490
might want to harm you or your family?

369
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:58,259
I'm sorry? Are you saying somebody
purposefully made my boy sick?

370
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,296
I don't understand.
How can you give someone cancer?

371
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,398
We're just investigating
every possibility.

372
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,567
Do you have any enemies?

373
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,669
Someone who might have
hurt Ben to get to you?

374
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:10,205
- Enemies?
- We're from Wisconsin.

375
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,706
What about at school?

376
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,175
Can you tell me about his
friends, their families?

377
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,410
Peter went to boarding school.

378
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,679
- Boarding school?
- That's right.

379
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,280
Ben loved it there.

380
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,037
What was the name of the school?

381
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,721
Earlier this morning,
Theo Wolf was rushed

382
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:30,024
to St. Mary's Hospital
after being found unconscious.

383
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:34,095
Despite the best efforts of the
hospital's doctors and staff,

384
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,731
I'm sorry to tell you that Theo...

385
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,832
has passed away.

386
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,436
If you'd like to talk,

387
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:43,071
if you feel like you're struggling,

388
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:45,473
please, do not struggle alone.

389
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,409
Reach out to a friend,
a teacher, or myself.

390
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:52,981
All of us at Abbott are here
for you in this difficult time.

391
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,657
Dr. Mitchell?

392
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,860
Mr. Keller. What can I do for you?

393
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:09,097
There's something I have to tell you.

394
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:11,166
About Theo.

395
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:25,851
"It's Aram."

396
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:30,752
Hello?

397
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:33,188
Hey, uh, Elodie. It's, um...

398
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,735
It's... It's Aram.

399
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,325
Mojtabai.

400
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,663
Well. Hello, stranger.

401
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,665
Yeah, I, uh... I know
it's, uh, been two weeks

402
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,033
since I've... I've called.

403
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,956
I wanted to. I just, um...

404
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:50,338
You have no idea how much I, um...

405
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,941
Okay, um, a friend says I should tell you

406
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:54,409
I was busy at work, but I wasn't.

407
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,344
I mean... I mean, I was. I just...

408
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:59,380
Uh, not... not too busy to call.

409
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:01,516
It's okay. I didn't call, either.

410
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:03,618
Yeah. You're... You're married.

411
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,854
You're loving, honoring,
and, uh, cherishing...

412
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:08,519
while I am... I am lusting.

413
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:11,125
Which, of the seven deadly sins,
if I'm not mistaken,

414
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,395
is, uh, number one with a bullet.

415
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,266
I'm meeting some people
at the Fremont tomorrow.

416
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:19,701
You want to come?

417
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,835
Um... uh, sure.

418
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:24,712
You'd have to wear a suit and tie.

419
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:27,175
That, uh... That sounds, uh, fancy.

420
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:30,545
You, uh... Are you sure
it's okay if I join?

421
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:33,210
Of course not. That's why you have to.

422
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:36,384
Meet me in the lobby at 7:00.

423
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,457
Sir, I found a connection.

424
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,359
In the files we pulled
from National Diagnostics,

425
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,027
each of the boys listed two addresses...

426
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,563
one where their families lived,
which were all different,

427
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:50,665
and a second one, which was all the same.

428
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,301
2725 Hollow Mill Lane. Old Falls.

429
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:54,702
How can that be?

430
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:56,471
None of the boys we identified
are from Virginia.

431
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:58,373
No, but they all went
to boarding school there.

432
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,618
Abbott Boarding School.

433
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:00,808
And from what their parents told us,

434
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,278
all five of the kids who got
sick were Abbott students.

435
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,380
- Became Abbott students.
- How do you mean?

436
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:08,850
Devane had Benjamin Gansky's
genome tested in February 2012,

437
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,752
seven months before he enrolled.

438
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:12,120
He tested Peter Crane

439
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,322
four months before he enrolled in 2016.

440
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,090
Sounds like gene sequencing

441
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:18,726
was the final part of
some sort of entrance exam.

442
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,962
Every student that passed
wound up at the school.

443
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:24,098
We don't know what Devane is doing
or why, but we do know where.

444
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,933
Are any students currently at Abbott

445
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,535
whose profile Devane hacked?

446
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:29,237
One. Howard Keller.

447
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,105
Get to the school. Alert the headmaster.

448
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,508
I don't want anything
happening to young Mr. Keller

449
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,276
on our watch.

450
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:38,112
We have a situation.
I just hung up with the police.

451
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:40,448
I don't know what they know,
but they know.

452
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,816
They're on their way now.

453
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:44,385
- O-On their way?
- You need to shut it down.

454
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,020
Y-You got to get out!

455
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,488
You need to deal with the boy, too!

456
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,157
Okay. Just calm down.

457
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,498
I'm on the verge of a breakthrough.

458
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:51,559
Take care of it, Norman.

459
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:52,960
Do you understand what I'm saying?

460
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:55,029
It's not just Theo Wolf or Howard Keller.

461
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:56,197
It's the FBI.

462
00:23:56,199 --> 00:24:00,001
I can stall them.
But this is over, Norman.

463
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,269
We're even.

464
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:03,071
Now get rid of the kid and clear out.

465
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:05,406
You need to go now.

466
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,846
Why are you...

467
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:14,716
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

468
00:24:14,718 --> 00:24:16,718
There you go.

469
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,650
Just go to sleep, little man.

470
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,623
It'll be over soon.

471
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,494
It'll all be over very soon.

472
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:59,043
Sir?

473
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:01,411
Okay. Uh, so, I should've
caught this before,

474
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,379
so let me start by saying, um, I'm sorry.

475
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,048
- Sorry for what?
- You know how you told me

476
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,150
to notify the headmaster
at Abbott and let him know

477
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,851
that Howard Keller may be in danger?

478
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,153
Yes. What did he say?

479
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,521
It's not what he said. It's who he is.

480
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,256
The headmaster at Abbott Boarding School

481
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:15,525
is Kelvin Mitchell,
and his son, Thomas Mitchell,

482
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,550
is on the list of names Devane
hacked from National Diagnostics.

483
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:20,377
He's one of Devane's subjects.

484
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,399
Okay. That's... That's just absurd.

485
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:24,985
We know your son was involved.

486
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,869
More importantly, we have
reason to believe

487
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:28,404
Howard Keller is in danger.

488
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,073
I'm sorry. I'd like to cooperate.

489
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:32,175
But if you think
I'm about to grant you access

490
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,876
to one of the children under my care

491
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,178
without proper authorization...

492
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,080
Hey, you! Yeah, you.

493
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:40,016
You want to go to jail for
obstruction of justice, too?

494
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:42,251
Or are you gonna show me
to Howard Keller's room?

495
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,592
Norman Devane. Where is he?

496
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:52,095
I'm not talking to you
without a lawyer. Or a warrant.

497
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,992
So why is he bringing
students to your school?

498
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,566
I said I want a lawyer.

499
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,130
Howard Keller?

500
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,718
- Where is he?
- I have no idea.

501
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:14,210
Hey. Hey!

502
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,153
He's been sedated.
Lock down the school! Now!

503
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,856
You want a lawyer? How about
this for legal advice?

504
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,825
Cooperate. Because the man
you're protecting is wanted

505
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:24,260
not only by the FBI,

506
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:26,395
but by MI6, the FSB, the Mossad.

507
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:28,064
I'm telling you, I-I can't help.

508
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,645
Why the hell are you sheltering this guy?

509
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm not! You don't understand.

510
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:32,869
Oh, I understand that you're lying.

511
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,004
But I don't understand
why you're protecting

512
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:36,973
the man who tried to kill your son.

513
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:40,165
Norman Devane didn't try to
kill my son! He saved him!

514
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:45,782
You're gonna tell me where
Devane is. Right now.

515
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:49,519
Call an ambulance!

516
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,843
Flip him for me.

517
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:55,497
Howard! Howard.
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

518
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:56,688
I need you to talk to me.

519
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:59,080
The man who did this...
do you know where he went?

520
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:02,439
Talk to me, Howard!
Do you know where he went?!

521
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,547
Norman Devane! FBI!

522
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:19,816
Put your hands where I can see them.

523
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:22,151
I said hands. Now.

524
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:50,880
The kid... what did you do to him?

525
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,293
You were right.
About the wedding feeling safe.

526
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:05,828
Meeting is confirmed.

527
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,831
Then you need to change.
We'll have you home in a jiffy.

528
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,399
Things are looking up!

529
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:13,069
Between you and Devane, we now
have two lines in the water.

530
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,403
A fish will eventually bite.

531
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,038
Because everything happens for a reason.

532
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,275
Even if that reason is as random
as my goddaughter's wedding.

533
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:22,445
Did you find Devane?

534
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,313
Yes, and he's still infecting people.

535
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:25,915
Only now the people he's infecting

536
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,542
are children at a boarding school.

537
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:29,752
- I need to speak with him.
- There was a fight.

538
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,388
He was injected with the disease
he gave one of the students...

539
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,457
some sort of flesh-eating bacteria.

540
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,092
Ressler's taking him to the hospital.

541
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:37,260
Why children?

542
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,262
I don't know. Some died.

543
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,397
Some made miraculous recoveries.

544
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,267
We're taking one to
Children of Mercy now.

545
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,469
Children of Mercy.
So Ressler isn't with you.

546
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,205
No, he's taking Devane to Walter Reed.

547
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,937
License and registration, please.

548
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:23,005
- What are you doing?
- I've always wanted to say that.

549
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:26,309
Please, unlock the doors
and step out of the vehicle.

550
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:27,843
- Very funny.
- No, really.

551
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,712
Unlock the doors. I'm taking Devane.

552
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,315
What are you doing? Who is that?

553
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,617
He can't tell you anything if he's dead.

554
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,398
- Come on out.
- He's in federal custody.

555
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,356
He was. He's not anymore.

556
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:43,326
Fine. You know what? Have it your way.

557
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:47,596
Wherever he goes, I go.

558
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,614
You know what I always wanted to say?

559
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,268
I have no idea.

560
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,971
This is gonna be a gas!

561
00:30:08,168 --> 00:30:10,335
Some kind of Vibrio bacteria.

562
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,704
- Vibrio vulnificus.
- It's a bacteria

563
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:16,141
that aggressively attacks
the body's soft tissue.

564
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:18,061
It can be treated with antibiotics.

565
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,352
Not this strain.

566
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:21,154
How do you know that?

567
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,989
Because I created it.

568
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:25,525
You're Norman Devane.

569
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,961
You're Spalding Stark. We arrested you!

570
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,165
You brought an FBI agent here?

571
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,933
It was a two-for-one sale.

572
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:36,435
The boy... is he alive?

573
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,637
What do you care?

574
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,305
He wasn't trying to kill the boy.

575
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,673
He was trying to cure him.

576
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,675
What are you talking about?
He got the kid sick.

577
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:45,344
He experimented on them. On all of them.

578
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:47,079
And some of the children survived,

579
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,349
but only because he wanted them
to, because he cured them.

580
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,817
That's right, isn't it, Norman?

581
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,854
- Is the boy alive?
- I know that's what you've done.

582
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:57,089
What I can't figure out is why.

583
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,558
Try blackmail.

584
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,027
Make people sick and demand
a ransom for the cure.

585
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,404
Is the boy okay or not?

586
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:07,133
I understand what you've been
exposed to is what you gave him.

587
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:09,368
But you also gave him the cure,

588
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,704
and you're wondering if it worked.

589
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,973
Well, we'll just have to
get back to you on that.

590
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:16,976
Let's take a stroll down
memory lane, shall we?

591
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,411
The drone strike.

592
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:21,180
After the strike, you went
from hundreds of victims

593
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:22,448
to... ten?

594
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,817
Why? What changed?

595
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,287
I have all day.

596
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,024
You? What? An hour, maybe less?

597
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,260
The drone strike.

598
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:39,332
In the hospital after,
I got an infection.

599
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:42,001
Drug-resistant. Nearly killed me.

600
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:46,505
Everything I did to make
other people vulnerable...

601
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:48,808
I never thought how vulnerable I was.

602
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,777
So that's what all of this
is about? Protecting yourself?

603
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,280
Finding cures to diseases you might get?

604
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:56,749
It seems the germ doctor is a germophobe.

605
00:31:56,751 --> 00:32:00,119
A word to the wise and dying...
you can't cheat death.

606
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:03,122
You can't predict it or
protect yourself against it.

607
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:04,781
I can.

608
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:08,461
By testing immunotherapy drugs,

609
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:11,597
I learned to harness
the body's immune response

610
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,167
to fight untreatable bacteria, cancers.

611
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:18,437
You learned to do it
by experimenting on people.

612
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,139
And you didn't?

613
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:22,908
I gave terminally ill hope.

614
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,410
I didn't infect children.

615
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,846
Which brings us back to the boy.

616
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:30,383
Immunotherapy drugs
are carefully calibrated

617
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:32,218
to a particular individual.

618
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,619
The hack at the NDL.

619
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:37,823
100 million patients,
and you find a handful

620
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,925
who have enough in common with you

621
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:43,029
to guarantee that if the cures
worked for them,

622
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,897
they'd also work for you.

623
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,281
Did it work?

624
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,491
Please tell me.

625
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:51,671
As soon as you tell me
about a Russian operative

626
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:55,808
you did contract work for in 1986.

627
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,010
She reached out to you recently.

628
00:32:58,012 --> 00:32:59,712
I want to know why.

629
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:02,982
The cure... if it worked...

630
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:05,217
Tell me about the Russian.

631
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:06,619
Tell me about her, and I'll do

632
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,988
everything in my power
to get you the cure.

633
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,589
Trust me... we want you to live.

634
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,792
So we can try you for mass murder.

635
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:18,898
Constance Drucker. That's her name.

636
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,100
She was looking for a treatment.

637
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,802
Is she sick?

638
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,537
Not for her.

639
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,138
Someone she cared about.

640
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,007
She cares for no one.

641
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,408
Do I have your word?

642
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,243
You do.

643
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:33,212
His name's...

644
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:34,747
Patrick Masuda.

645
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:37,750
- Done.
- Who are you calling?

646
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:39,952
Keen. She's at the hospital with the boy.

647
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:41,787
She'll know by now if the cure worked.

648
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,490
- That won't be necessary.
- And why not?

649
00:33:44,492 --> 00:33:46,826
Because I have the cure right here.

650
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,833
He looks better already.

651
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:58,904
You're telling me that's
why Howie was admitted?

652
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:00,239
To be a lab rat?

653
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,708
Devane cured the headmaster's son.

654
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,076
He had a terminal illness,

655
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,178
and somehow Devane put it in remission.

656
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,513
So he let some maniac

657
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,148
infect my son with some
biological disease?!

658
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,617
Devane agreed to continue
treatment on the headmaster's son

659
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,018
if he agreed to allow him

660
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,988
to experiment on the students
at the school.

661
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,373
- To make him sick.
- To test his treatments.

662
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,462
He gave Howard immunotherapy
that he designed for himself.

663
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:26,332
I assume he did that for every boy.

664
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:27,600
Were they all cured?

665
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:29,969
No. They weren't.

666
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:31,570
Mr. Keller?

667
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,939
I've reviewed the tests
we've run on your son.

668
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,007
And?

669
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:38,018
And the results are very unusual.

670
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,415
I apologize, Spalding.

671
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:43,883
You offered your services,

672
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:46,752
and I returned the favor
by acting intemperately.

673
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:51,424
My research. This lab.
It can't be compromised.

674
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,592
It won't be. I just called my cleaners.

675
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:55,261
They'll take care of everything.

676
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:57,229
An FBI agent saw what you did.

677
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:58,798
Reddington killed Devane.

678
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,299
For refusing to cooperate?

679
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:02,535
No, Devane told him
what he wanted to hear.

680
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:03,977
Reddington shot him anyway.

681
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,772
Agent Ressler is as crooked
as the crooked man's cat.

682
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:08,741
You have nothing to worry about.

683
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:10,176
But apparently I do.

684
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:12,344
You haven't mentioned
my blood panel results.

685
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,346
We've been too busy.

686
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,748
Not for good news.

687
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,283
His cleaners are on their way
to mop up now.

688
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,651
You want me to let them?

689
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:20,352
You're asking if we
should look the other way.

690
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:22,321
Yeah. Again.

691
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:31,764
Let me get your chart.

692
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:35,000
No need. I have it right here.

693
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:51,015
Hello, Mr. Bloom.

694
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,550
Mister...?

695
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:54,152
And Mrs. Bloom. Isn't it great?

696
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,386
Come on!

697
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,021
Name tags at a wedding are genius.

698
00:35:58,046 --> 00:35:59,345
One side never knows the other.

699
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:00,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

700
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,214
Uh, we're going to a wedding?

701
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:04,383
No, silly. We're crashing one.

702
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:07,345
Crashing. As... As Mr. and Mrs. Bloom?

703
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,055
They were the first ones
I saw on the table.

704
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:12,145
FYI, we're on the groom's side.

705
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,538
It's better this way.

706
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,973
No, it's not.

707
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,941
But it's the way it is.

708
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,477
About my chart.

709
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,746
I didn't look at it.

710
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,681
Why not?

711
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:39,385
Because sometimes you're
supposed to look the other way.

712
00:36:42,023 --> 00:36:44,123
It was a pretty thick file, though.

713
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,758
I'd appreciate if you didn't mention

714
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,326
anything about it to Elizabeth.

715
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:51,163
I wouldn't want to cause her
any unnecessary concern.

716
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,366
It's no skin off my nose
one way or the other.

717
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:57,587
But I'm pretty sure honesty
really is the best policy.

718
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,487
I'm glad you think so, Donald.

719
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:01,474
Because I honestly
don't want her to worry.

720
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:03,044
Whether she does or not...

721
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,544

00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,116
That he's been cured?

734
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:46,118
His infection is resistant

we've administered, but
he's improving on his own.

Constance Drucker?

773
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:38,130
It's an alias used by the woman
who kidnapped Reddington.

774
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:41,267
Now, she hired Devane
to develop a treatment

775
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,302
for a man named Patrick Masuda.

776
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,871
And Reddington thinks Masuda
can lead him back to her.

777
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,440
- So we need to find him first.
- So we can get to the woman

778
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:50,442
who might have answers about my mother.

779
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:52,511
But I don't think I want them.

780
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:55,814
We went after Katarina, and
my grandfather nearly died.

781
00:39:55,816 --> 00:39:57,082
You deserve to know.

782
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,151
Yeah, but I don't need to.

783
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:02,655
I'm happy. I've got Agnes back.

784
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,224
I'm not gonna risk that
to hunt for answers

785
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,593
about a woman I've never really known.

786
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:09,261
It isn't worth it.

787
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,863
Well, it's nice.

788
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:12,598
I mean, seeing you happy.

789
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,567
It's been a long time comin'.

790
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,060
Too long.

791
00:40:18,973 --> 00:40:23,075
I-I meant to ask. What was
Reddington doing with Stark?

792
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:28,447
Looks like he set him up
after Stark got out of prison.

793
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,816
He always believed
the guy was a visionary.

794
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:33,485
Probably wanted to reinvest.

795
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:41,920
It didn't happen. There was a mix-up.

796
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:45,197
Now my contact's in the wind. I'm sorry.

797
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,299
I told you... with
two lines in the water,

798
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,568
we were bound to catch a fish,
and we did.

799
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,790
After all that.

800
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,763
The shooting in Havana.
The wedding fiasco.

801
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:57,309
But I kept feeling like there
was nothing but setbacks.

802
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:58,744
But here we are.

803
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:03,215
Made a killing on hog futures
and got a lead.

804
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,572
And a prognosis.

805
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:09,914
Wich was?

806
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,846
Stark's treatment was inefective.

807
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,918
I'm sorry.

808
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,110
Sometimes, things happens for a reason.

809
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,570
And sometimes I just don't
know what that reason is.

810
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Is there anything I can do?

811
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,270
There is actually.

812
00:41:39,952 --> 00:41:41,952
Some guy, Patrick Masuda...

813
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
I need some help to find him.

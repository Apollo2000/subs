1
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:04,287
I'm your mother.

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:07,323
A mother protects her children.

3
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,225
- I did protect you.
- By leaving me?

4
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:10,744
By hiding you.

5
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,095
I was being hunted,

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,997
and I didn't want you to be hunted, too.

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,465
And how about moving in next door

8
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:18,234
and not telling me who you really are?

9
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,136
I suppose you did that
to protect me, too.

10
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,437
And to get to know you

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,707
without our history getting in the way.

12
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,469
And we did get to know
each other, didn't we?

13
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,930
To like each other.

14
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,881
Why are you here?

15
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:34,351
I'll tell you if you put the gun down.

16
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,820
Please? You shot your father.

17
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,889
Do you really want
to shoot your mother, too?

18
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:44,760
Tell me.

19
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:48,397
After all this time, why are you here?

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,933
You know what I wish?

21
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:53,803
I wish someone
would come in here right now...

22
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,571
and see us together.

23
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,573
Why now?

24
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:01,010
Because they found me.
The Townsend Directive.

25
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:03,179
Dominic and Raymond could stop them.

26
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:05,047
I tried to make them.

27
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,983
You can be angry at me for that, but...

28
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,885
I just wanted them to do what was right.

29
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,420
They refused.

30
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:13,348
So you came here?

31
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,892
Why? Did you think I could stop them?

32
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,295
No, but I needed your help

33
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:23,933
finding the one other person
who can... Ilya Koslov.

34
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,201
I want the truth.

35
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,836
That is the truth.

36
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,138
I know who Ilya Koslov is

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,774
and that you didn't need
my help to find him.

38
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:34,443
That is the reason...
that and to get to know you

39
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,580
so that we could be family again.

40

41
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,069
Mr. Reddington, we've been through

42
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:02,004
every file four times now.

43
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,041
Are you sure this is everything
you confiscated from Orion?

44
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,242
Yes. This is every file.

45
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:08,010
Elizabeth still isn't answering.

46
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,812
Perhaps if you told us
the name of the woman

47
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:11,414
who abducted you in Paris,
we could help you find her.

48
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,215
She doesn't have a name. She's a ghost.

49
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,351
Think of a name, any name,
and that could be it.

50
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:17,920
We know she used the alias
Constance Drucker.

51
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,722
And we also know she's close.

52
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,091
Why didn't she say goodbye?

53
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:25,227
You were sleeping, sweetie, and
she had an emergency at work,

54
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,596
but she asked me to give you a big hug

55
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,098
and tell you how much she loves you.

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,067
And she has someone
you care about in her custody?

57
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,735
She does.

58
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:34,804
Hey. How's our houseguest?

59
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,872
She'll be fine.

60
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,707
Who you should be worried about

61
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,543
are the feds sitting on the apartment.

62
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,445
They saw Keen come in.

63
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,513
They're gonna wonder
why she's not coming out.

64
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,849
Then handle them. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

65
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,517
Can you tell us
what it is that she wants?

66
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,519
She's on the run. People are after her,

67
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,388
and she wants to know how to stop them.

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,057
Do you think he's still alive,
this friend of yours she has?

69
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,625
She did try to kill you, remember?

70
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:58,127
Hung you up like a Holstein.

71
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,495
Killing me wasn't her plan.

72
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:02,465
She wants answers, so
she tried to con me first.

73
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,401
When that didn't work, she
tried advanced interrogation.

74
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,869
That didn't work, either.

75
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:09,205
So, yes, I think
my friend is still alive,

76
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,907
but I think she'll employ
any means necessary

77
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,311
to get what she wants,
to get inside his head to...

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,919
Krilov.

79
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,993
Krilov.

80
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,223
The whack job who scrambled
my brain like an egg?

81
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,691
What does that mean?

82
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:30,659
It means he scrambled
my brain like an egg.

83
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:32,528
Dr. Bogdan Krilov

84
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,864
is the underworld's foremost expert

85
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,066
in accessing the subconscious.

86
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,834
The man can get anyone to talk.

87
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,336
Krilov's in prison.

88
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,004
Which means she'd have to hire a protégé.

89
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:44,473
You really think this woman's
using recovered-memory therapy

90
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,741
to get inside your friend's head?

91
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,844
Maybe, but if she is, Krilov
would know with whom and how.

92
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,913
- I need to see him, Harold.
- No, that's not possible.

93
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:53,616
He's at ADX Florence. He's in
lockdown 23 hours a day.

94
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,784
I'm sure you could get him out
for a quick visit.

95
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,386
He's a significant security threat.

96
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:59,488
If I've learned anything in this life,

97
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,957
it's that anything is possible.

98
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,294
Uh, guys, I think we're
missing a file here...

99
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,129
46-J.

100
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,231
That's the stack Agent Keen
was cataloguing last night.

101
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,133
You don't think she took the file?

102
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,369
She still isn't answering.

103
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,204
I'm gonna check on Elizabeth.

104
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,207
Harold, see if you can
round up Dr. Krilov.

105
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,142
Donald and I have some catching up to do

106
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:21,710
with the dreamweaver.

107
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,730
Who's this guy?

108
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,969
All right. We're finished. She's live.

109
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,771
Who's live? And who are you?

110
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,974
What, are you kidding? SSG.
We got the apartment mic'd up.

111
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,342
Command never called us about SSG.

112
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,743
Well, then take it up with command.

113
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,512
I'm not gonna stand here
and debate it in the street.

114
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,380
Now, you want the TRF receivers or not?

115
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,258
They're in the corner.

116
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:16,131
You know, Cooper never
notified us of a surveillance pack.

117
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,133
I'll be damned if this
is coming back on us.

118
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,735
Aah!

119
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,782
You understand
Krilov is not just in solitary.

120
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,652
He's in control.
With the worst of the worst.

121
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:39,588
Alone 23 hours a day, and
he seems to like it like that.

122
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,657
Guy doesn't even come outside
when he's allowed.

123
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,560
He speaks to no one, by choice,
so he's certainly not gonna

124
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,962
voluntarily talk with some FBI agent.

125
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,397
I don't want to talk to the guy

126
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,898
any more than he wants to talk to me.

127
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,268
Krilov. Visitor.

128
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,510
Agent Ressler.

129
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,389
I've been dreaming about this day.

130
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,116
Well, that makes one of us.

131
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,684
Open the door!

132
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,728
Elizabeth.

133
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:38,947
Nobody.

134
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,353
- Cooper.
- Harold.

135
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,621
We have a problem.

136
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,656
What's going on?
Any word from Agent Keen?

137
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,558
No. The apartment's empty,

138
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,393
with clear signs of an altercation.

139
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,795
This falls on us, Harold.

140
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,076
We shouldn't have let her go alone.

141
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:56,598
Have Dembe check in with
the agents stationed outside.

142
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,400
Maybe they saw something.

143
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,102
I'll call them and let them
know he's on the way.

144
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,370
Yep.

145
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,714
What is it? Where are they?

146
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,047
Raymond. Blood.

147
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,094
No need to notify your men, Harold.

148
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,514
They won't be taking any phone calls.

149
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,525
Oh, I wish I could help,
but I didn't see anything.

150
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,060
Thank you. Mister...?

151
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:54,229
Uh, Gregory Flynn. Two N's.

152
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,298
What's going on?

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,267
Agent Park, FBI. And you are?

154
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,235
Maddy Tolliver. Is there something wrong?

155
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,237
Well, apparently, there's
been some kind of crime.

156
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,939
A crime? What happened?

157
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,342
Did you see or hear anything
unusual in the past hour?

158
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:08,777
No, I was... Does this have
anything to do with Elizabeth?

159
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,878
You know Agent Keen?

160
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,313
Of course. She's my neighbor.

161
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,935
- Please. Tell me she's okay.
- We're checking on it.

162
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:17,288
Um, if you think of anything...
give me a call.

163
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,368
- Did he talk?
- I'm done.

164
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,269
There are police everywhere, FBI.

165
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:35,838
- So he didn't talk.
- That's why they're here?

166
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,573
Because you have another hostage?

167
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,141
Did he talk?!

168
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,310
- No.
- Then you're not done.

169
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,380
Like hell I'm not.

170
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:49,118
Let me know when
Ilya's ready for another session.

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
If you won't ask him questions...

172
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,088
I will.

173
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:15,677
What Berdy did was not okay,

174
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,780
but if I let you go, it'll stop me

175
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,815
from getting the answers I need.

176
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:23,227
What I'd like to do is take
this gag off so we can talk.

177
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,087
I don't want to put it back on,

178
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,456
but if you scream, I'll have to.

179
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,658
So... can we talk?

180
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,432
Where's Agnes?

181
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,964
I took her to Shelly's for a sleepover.

182
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,870
I told her something came up
and you had to go to work.

183
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,676
See for yourself.

184
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:53,649
Hi, Beth. It's me.
Can I talk to Agnes for a sec?

185
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,745
I would never hurt her.

186
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,998
Hi, honey.

187
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,501
How are you?

188
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,359
Chocolate-chip pancakes?

189
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:06,295
Well, I wouldn't want to interrupt that.

190
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,297
I just wanted to say I love you.

191
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,700
Okay? Bye.

192
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,170
So...

193
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:16,975
let's talk.

194
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,619
Harold still hasn't located Elizabeth.

195
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,421
No one in her building has seen her,

196
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,319
and they can't get a signal
off her phone.

197
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,992
First Ilya. Now she's got Elizabeth.

198
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,361
She thinks she's staying ahead of us.

199
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,564
I fear she might be getting
a little ahead of herself.

200
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,140
As I'm the last person you want to see,

201
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:56,473
I assume I'm the only person
who can do what you need.

202
00:10:57,248 --> 00:11:00,349
Which gives me the leverage
to set my terms...

203
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,521
time served, a new identity...

204
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,954
and, um...

205
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,990
glass of chocolate milk.

206
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,893
Make it two.

207
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,694
Hershey's or Nesquik?

208
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:14,963
Or maybe you're a Bosco man.

209
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,231
What do you want?

210
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,799
To kill you.

211
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:22,704
For working with Mr. Kaplan.
For betraying my trust.

212
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:25,440
For hurting Donald
in an attempt to hurt me.

213
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,009
Well, that's what we want.

214
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,144
And if you're smart, you're
gonna give us what we need.

215
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,147
A name of a protégé or colleague.

216
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,649
I work alone.

217
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,618
Mm. A competitor then?

218
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,254
A rival, someone's chipping away

219
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:41,557
at your business while you're in prison.

220
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,997
And if you play nice, well,

221
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:45,093
maybe we'll kill him instead of you.

222
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:49,531
And you are an FBI agent?

223
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,301
Yes, I am. And I work
with Raymond Reddington.

224
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,536
So you do the math.

225
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,574
Yeah. Okay.

226
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,078
Victor Skovic.

227
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,959
Where can we find him?

228
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,849
- Tongji.
- Where's that?

229
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,085
It's not a where. It's a who.

230
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,853
Tongji is supposed to be

231
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,856
some kind of a Chinese miracle worker.

232
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,925
He's rumored to provide a place

233
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:20,228
where people go
to find unfindable things,

234
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,965
to forget the unforgettable things...

235
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,833
a back-alley bazaar

236
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,502
where he brokers whatever you need

237
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:30,739
to ease your pain or dull your mind.

238
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:34,943
As far as I know,
Tongji only exists as a myth.

239
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,945
He's not a myth.

240
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,118
He's very real.

241
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,628
And he brokers jobs for Skovic.

242
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,094
Then it looks like we're taking
you on a little field trip

243
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,036
to meet Mr. Tongji.

244
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,233
After all these years,

245
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,169
after what I'm sure everyone
had told you about me,

246
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,071
I didn't think there was
any way you would give me

247
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,573
the benefit of the doubt,

248
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,442
that I was actually here
to put an end to it...

249
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,278
to the running, the hiding,
the living in fear.

250
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,714
I don't believe
you're afraid of anything.

251
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,049
I lost you once.

252
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,985
I'm terrified of losing you again.

253
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:22,290
You say you need me to find Ilya Koslov,

254
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,126
but I know that that's not true.

255
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,762
You had him in Paris.

256
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,929
In Paris?

257
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,293
I know who Reddington really is.

258
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,834
- He told me.
- He told you?

259
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,070
He's the real Koslov,

260
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:39,841
and he turned into Reddington
30 years ago to help you escape.

261
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,376
He told you that?

262
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:44,613
Well, Dom did, and Reddington,
he confirmed it.

263
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,383
He saved your life.

264
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:51,520
And you repaid him by torturing
him within an inch of his.

265
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:52,721
You don't understand.

266
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,357
No. You don't understand.

267
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,225
He may not be my father,

268
00:13:57,227 --> 00:14:00,028
but Reddington, this Reddington,

269
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,464
has watched over me my entire life.

270
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,535
You say you want to get to know
each other? To be a family?

271
00:14:06,537 --> 00:14:08,837
Well, he's a part of that family.

272
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,875
And if you can't be on his side,

273
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,275
I can't be on yours.

274
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,977
What if I can prove
he's not on your side?

275
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,680
I don't think there's
anything you can say

276
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:20,982
that would convince me of that.

277
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:24,553
That's why I'm not going to say anything.

278
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,223
I'm going to show you.

279
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:33,195
I don't think this is a good idea.

280
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,097
She shouldn't be in here.

281
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,125
This man, I've met him before.

282
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,989
He's friends with Reddington.

283
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:42,771
F-F-Frank...

284
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,640
Elizabeth. His name isn't Frank.

285
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,543
His name is Ilya Koslov.

286
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,995
I'll be there in five minutes.
Make sure Skovic has him ready.

287
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,639
That file doesn't prove anything.

288
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,307
Why should I trust you?

289
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,276
You have absolutely no reason to.

290
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,278
But I think you know it's the truth.

291
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,247
If Reddington isn't Koslov,
then who is he?

292
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,282
That's just one of the mysteries

293
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,417
I intend to pull from Ilya's head.

294
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,953
How could you not know?
Ilya's your friend.

295
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,589
He was my best friend, until he conspired

296
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,327
with your grandfather to have me killed,

297
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,997
blown up in a car bomb.

298
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,631
That isn't what Dom told me.

299
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,600
No. Dom told you Reddington was Koslov.

300
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,403
He lied to you to hide the truth,

301
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,372
that he tried to assassinate
his own daughter.

302
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,973
Why would he do that?

303
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,310
Because if the people
hunting me saw me die,

304
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,046
then the person he really
cared about would be safe.

305
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,583
You're his child. Who could
he care about more than you?

306
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,389
No.

307
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,391
That can't be true.

308
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,626
I'm a mortal threat to you,

309
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,695
a mother whose very existence

310
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,033
puts her daughter's life at risk.

311
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:11,202
My grandfather tried
to kill you to protect me.

312
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:15,005
And in the process,
he killed the man I loved.

313
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,838
I disappeared after that.

314
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,827
To heal.

315
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,149
I started over and was...

316
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,677
content.

317
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,889
Until they found you again.

318
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,224
The Townsend Directive.

319
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,062
They took away my life once.

320
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,481
Now they've done it again.

321
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,699
No, they didn't.

322
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,434
I did.

323
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,270
I'm the reason they're after you again.

324
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,006
I went looking for you.

325
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,369
They found out.

326
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,622
They followed my lead.

327
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,833
You were looking for me?

328
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,682
Of course I was.

329
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,186
You're my mother.

330
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,159
This is a waste of time.

331
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,195
I couldn't get anything out of him.

332
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,163
- I'd like to go now.
- Where?

333
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,999
Out the door and into
the arms of the police?

334
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,500
I have no interest in dying here.

335
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,535
You're not going to die, Victor.

336
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,605
Not if, from now on,
you do exactly as I tell you.

337
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,241
Sit down and keep your mouth shut!

338
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,645
I just got a call.

339
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,480
The Kazanjian brothers pulled into town.

340
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,660
We need to step up our timeline
before it's too late.

341
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,663
Good news, Ilya.

342
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,023
Dr. Skovic's done with you.

343
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,691
The bad news is...

344
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,029
...I'm just getting started.

345
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Keep these vehicles moving!

346
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,368
I need open spaces here!

347
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,170
Hey!

348
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,706
Wrong garage! Take a walk!

349
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,728
We need vehicle.

350
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,546
You just picked the wrong garage.

351
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,114
You hear me?

352
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,683
Aah!

353
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,757
Fortify the bumper on that Chevy.

354
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,823
You have 30 minutes.

355
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,586
So, you and Krilov have a history.

356
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,899
What exactly did he do?

357
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,159
He got inside my head,
planted a false memory,

358
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,365
tried to convince me I killed
a national-security advisor.

359
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,326
And now we're working with him?

360
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,496
It's been a slippery slope.

361
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,305
You think?

362
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,146
Have a seat right there.

363
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,352
I'm here to see Tongji.

364
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,154
- You have appointment?
- I do not.

365
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,555
You got to have an appointment.

366
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,934
Tell him it's Raymond Reddington.

367
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,331
Mr. Reddington, you no appointment,

368
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,166
you no see Tongji.

369
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,567
Come back when you have the appointment!

370
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,404
I have a gun. Does that
count as an appointment?

371
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,939
And I have a friend with
a gun... two appointments.

372
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,342
He's not reachable.

373
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,477
Why don't you tell Tongji

374
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,514
that Bogdan Krilov wants to see him?

375
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,215
Dr. Krilov!

376
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,484
Of course, sir. Dr. Krilov.

377
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,932
No smoking!

378
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,693
My God.

379
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,662
Hello, my friend.

380
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,766
They said you were in prison.

381
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,701
They said you would die there.

382
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,969
They were wrong.

383
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,705
Are you okay? Do you need help?

384
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:46,376
Listen. I'm looking for someone,
the man who took my place.

385
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,778
Victor Skovic.

386
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,313
Do you know how to find him?

387
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,302
I may. But I'm not telling you.

388
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,737
Tongji. This is important.

389
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,573
Skovic's gone. He's under contract.

390
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,542
- With whom?
- Some woman.

391
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:01,702
Uh, I don't know her name.

392
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,748
Uh, she had a handler.

393
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,817
Berdy Chernov.

394
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,541
The man we're looking for
is Victor Skovic.

395
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,143
- What do you know about him?
- I know that, as we speak,

396
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,379
he's sucking whatever he can
from the depths

397
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,481
of my friend's cerebral cortex.

398
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,818
Berdy Chernov is the man
who brokered the contract.

399
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,753
- Are you familiar with him?
- I am not.

400
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,922
- I am.
- You are?

401
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,491
Chernov. I know...
I know I've heard that name.

402
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,127
From work? A case? An article you read?

403
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,029
The wedding. A wedding.

404
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,064
A few weeks ago, Elodie and I
crashed this wedding.

405
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,718
Well, she actually...
she stole these name tags,

406
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,215
which is quite easy to do, by the way,

407
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:46,594
because they just leave them
right out there in the open.

408
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,634
- Aram.
- Yeah?

409
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,573
- Berdy Chernov.
- Right. Okay.

410
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,608
So, I'm standing there
wearing this name tag,

411
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,145
and this guy comes over to me,
thinking that I am Frank Bloom.

412
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,713
The wedding. Was it at the Fremont?

413
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,949
Yeah. Why? Were you invited?

414
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,518
Frank Bloom is an alias for my friend.

415
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,620
He went to that wedding to meet a contact

416
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,488
and get the name of a man involved

417
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,057
in my abduction in Paris.

418
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,093
But he gave it to you instead
because you stole his name tag.

419
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,928
Like I said, they just
leave them out in the open.

420
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,830
Chernov. What can you tell us about him?

421
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,033
I can tell you that is not
the name he goes by.

422
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,102
Can you tell us what name he does go by?

423
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,037
No. But I can get it.

424
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,106
I can get it. I can get it.

425
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,877
When we land, Krilov comes with me.

426
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,079
Revenge doesn't suit you, Donald.

427
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,548
I'm taking him back to prison.

428
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,216
Are you?

429
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,118
I wonder.

430
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:51,868
Okay. So, the guy who thought
I was Frank Bloom gave me this.

431
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,938
Chernov's alias is Gregory Flynn.

432
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,473
Mean anything to you?

433
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,208
- No.
- Okay, we're on it.

434
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,237
I'll let you know as soon
as we have a lead.

435
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,245
You crashed a wedding?

436
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,909
I know. But, uh, I got to say...

437
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,750
it was pretty awesome.

438
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,897
Gregory Flynn. Find him. Now.

439
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,206
Yep.

440
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,193
What is it? The Townsend Directive?

441
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,796
A bounty, an incentive to kill me.

442
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,164
Can it be called off?

443
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,533
I'm betting my life on it.

444
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,316
I'm still looking for the answers I need,

445
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:33,076
but I don't think you're gonna
stop me from getting them, are you?

446
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,816
I've always lived my life
very much in the moment.

447
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,552
But what does one do

448
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:47,223
when the moment is filled
with anxiety and dread?

449
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,998
I assume that was a rhetorical question.

450
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,133
Agent Park, how long have you been here?

451
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,002
Uh, the whole time.

452
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,039
Dembe, has Harold texted you

453
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,308
any new information on Gregory Flynn?

454
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,277
- No.
- Who?

455
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,946
Are we giving you a lift somewhere?

456
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,915
D-Did you say Gregory Flynn?

457
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:17,087
Yes. If we can find him,
we can find my friend.

458
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,755
And Agent Keen.

459
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,590
Possibly.

460
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,226
Definitely. He lives in her building.

461
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,995
After the protective detail went missing,

462
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,864
I canvassed the neighbors.
One of them was Gregory Flynn.

463
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,166
He lives across the hall from her.

464
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,736
Dembe, pull over.

465
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,771
Agent Park, you are a treasure.

466
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,572
I hope you don't mind,
but, please, get out.

467
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:40,419
Wait. What? Are you serious?

468
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:43,046
There's another rhetorical question.

469
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,587
I'll call Chuck and Morgan.
You call Heddie.

470
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,655
We're gonna need them very fast.

471
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,128
Oh, hey. Just in time.

472
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,896
I've been dealing with Krilov.
What's going on?

473
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,132
The name you got, Berdy Chernov,
he and the woman from Paris

474
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,967
live across the hall from Agent Keen.

475
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,802
- We're heading there now.
- Have you heard from her?

476
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,971
Yeah, thank God. I just patched
her through to Mr. Cooper.

477
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,535
Well, is she okay?

478
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:11,242
- I'm fine.
- Where have you been?

479
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,777
I had an issue with Agnes,
but it's fine now.

480
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,311
I-I found something while I was out.

481
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,080
Thought it was a lead,
so I chased after it.

482
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,848
You found a lead
after you left the office?

483
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,603
Yeah, but it didn't go anywhere.

484
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,185
Now I'm stuck in traffic,
on the way back from...

485
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,653
Agnes. Where is she?

486
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,088
Uh, at a friend's. Why?

487
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,357
There was an altercation
in your apartment.

488
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,226
The woman from Paris, she lives
across the hall from you.

489
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,272
What? Maddy Tolliver? Are you sure?

490
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,198
We got her, Elizabeth.
She won't get away this time.

491
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,800
Have you sent a team?

492
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,369
We're on the way.
Get there as soon as you can.

493
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,241
They know.

494
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,976
If they know, Reddington knows.

495
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,627
They're on their way.

496
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:51,114
They've probably already set a perimeter.

497
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,750
I can't leave without getting
the answers I'm looking for.

498
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,952
If you stay and try to find
them, you will be caught.

499
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,287
And killed.

500
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,157
Elizabeth. Please.
You still have time. Go.

501
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,426
You don't need to be a part of this.

502
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,862
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

503
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,831
But I don't want you to get hurt.

504
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,732
Please. Go.

505
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,238
What is it?

506
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,310
Elizabeth, please. Talk to me.

507
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,013
What if I can get you out?

508
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,645
Agents Ressler and Mojtabai, FBI.

509
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,647
We need a perimeter on that building...

510
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,283
Evergreen to First
and Dove Hill Road to Brighton.

511
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,884
Copy. Any details on the suspects?

512
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,786
White female, late 50s,
possibly accompanied

513
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,523
by a white male, both
likely armed and dangerous.

514
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:08,326
Nobody goes in or out of that
building until we're on site.

515
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:09,828
We'll lock it down.

516
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,532
They're everywhere.
We're not getting out.

517
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,301
I'll get you out.

518
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:18,636
Your friend's in no shape to walk.

519
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,705
What on Earth did you do to him?

520
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,274
- You got to leave Ilya.
- Not before I get answers.

521
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:26,411
If you want me to get you out of
here alive, you've got to leave him.

522
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,556
And we got to go now.

523
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,659
This isn't going to work.

524
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,256
Sure it will.

525
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,194
It'll work.

526
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,314
Agents Ressler and Mojtabai, FBI.

527
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,337
Who's running point?
I am. Dan Lynch, MPD.

528
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,084
- We spoke on the phone.
- What do we know?

529
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,673
Perimeter's secure.
No sign of the suspects.

530
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,509
- Nobody in or out.
- What if Agent Ressler

531
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,644
personally knows one of those officers?

532
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,045
It's unlikely.

533
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:04,315
District has more than
4,000 sworn officers.

534
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:07,719
We'd have better odds of being
killed by a vending machine.

535
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:09,446
Ready your men. We breach on my go.

536
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:11,556
Whoa. Breach? We're just gonna storm in?

537
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,391
- What about HRT?
- I got an agent in there.

538
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm not waiting on anyone
to make contact with.

539
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:18,206
We go in fast. You and your men
secure the perimeter.

540
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,408
Nobody answers unless you hear gunshots.

541
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,978
Yes, sir. It's your death warrant.

542
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,114
Here we go.

543
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,259
My husband, Tom, and I

544
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,162
specifically chose this
apartment because you can access

545
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:43,131
the service corridor
from the parking structure.

546
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,766
How far does it run?

547
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,668
Only to the back of the building, but...

548
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,838
and don't tell the super...
I may have opened a small access

549
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,174
to the city's underground utility chase.

550
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,975
That runs for blocks.

551
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:08,790
- Boss. Hey. He's here.
- And Elizabeth?

552
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,892
No sign of her or anyone else.

553
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:13,061
But your friend, he's in bad shape.

554
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:14,129
Get him out of there.

555
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:23,138
I got an injury! Need a paramedic!

556
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,106
- What do you got?
- He took a beating.

557
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:28,410
- His breathing isn't right.
- Let's get him in the back.

558
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,515
Heddie. You're out of time.

559
00:29:37,054 --> 00:29:39,020
Agents Ressler and Mojtabai, FBI.

560
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:40,422
Who's running point?

561
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:43,158
Dan Lynch, MPD. What's going on?

562
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,397
- What do you mean they're on site?!
- We just got here.

563
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,067
And what about our suspects?

564
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,279
Do you want me to follow?

565
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:07,048
No, we stay put until we see her.

566
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,487
You two. Head that way.

567
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,923
There's a service ladder
just past the fire riser...

568
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,124
50, maybe 60 yards.

569
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:17,459
Hold on. We're not splitting up.

570
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,702
All of us together?
That's too conspicuous.

571
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,896
This way, if we get caught,
only two of us get busted.

572
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:23,431
No, I am not leaving you with her.

573
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,966
Berdy, listen to the woman.

574
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:28,336
She's trying to help. I trust her.

575
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,746
Go.

576
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:33,041
Now. Go.

577
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,277
This door leads to the street.

578
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,078
You get a car.

579
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,248
I'm gonna double back,
try and stall them.

580
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,050
Elizabeth.

581
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,453
I am gonna make this up to you.

582
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:47,663
I promise.

583
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:50,499
Go.

584
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:18,520
Raymond, we have to go.

585
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:21,947
They'll be closing down the
street soon. You can't be here.

586
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,526
She slipped through our fingers again.

587
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,104
I'll be damned.

588
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:40,575
Keep your distance.

589
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,545
We want to do this very quietly.

590
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,412
Okay. Thank you.

591
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:52,682
Agent Keen.

592
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,851
Thank God you're okay. Come on.

593
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:59,689
We were so worried.

594
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:01,591
I came here as fast as I could.

595
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:04,698
- What'd you find?
- Just the equipment.

596
00:32:05,196 --> 00:32:07,764
Wait. Reddington's friend?

597
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:09,132
Gone.

598
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,034
MPD finished a sweep of the building.

599
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,368
We were too late.

600
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,437
But you can ID her, right? Your neighbor?

601
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,039
Yeah, of course.

602
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,341
We'll send out a description,
put out a BOLO.

603
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:19,609
What's her name, by the way?

604
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:21,944
- Her name?
- Yeah, the woman from Paris.

605
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:24,043
- All we have is her alias.
- Yeah.

606
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,448
What was her real name?

607
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,316
Maddy.

608
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,118
Maddy Tolliver.

609
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:40,763
Now?

610
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:42,632
Soon.

611
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:44,634
When we're a little further away

612
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:48,220
from surveillance cameras
and prying eyes.

613
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:24,006
Raymond.

614
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:27,510
The Kazanjian brothers
will kill you, too.

615
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:56,101
Death must be so beautiful.

616
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,609
To lie on soft brown earth...

617
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,945
with the grasses waving over one's head.

618
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,516
To be at peace.

619
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,554
I welcome that one day.

620
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:33,209
Well, you didn't get far, now, did you?

621
00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:34,944
Picked him up on 39th.

622
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,446
He was traveling with
another man, but we lost him.

623
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:39,382
I'll take it from here.

624
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,083
Who are you?

625
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:43,753
I'm the guy you're gonna help.

626
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,135
I want you to know how relieved I am

627
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:02,104
that you and your family are safe.

628
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:04,006
I also want to apologize.

629
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:07,005
I told you I'd protect you, and I didn't.

630
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:09,445
You have nothing to apologize for.

631
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,134
I believe I do.

632
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:13,716
As it happens, I believe you do, too.

633
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,786
You told me you got a lead
after you left the office.

634
00:35:16,788 --> 00:35:19,155
We both know that's not true.

635
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:22,258
No, it's not.

636
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,759
I know that you took a file,

637
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:25,595
that you didn't want us
to know what you saw in it,

638
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:28,197
who you saw in it.

639
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:29,966
I also know that you'd only do that

640
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:33,002
if it was something very personal.

641
00:35:33,004 --> 00:35:35,071
The photo in the file. Was it her?

642
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,872
- Yes.
- The woman from Paris

643
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:39,275
who abducted Reddington,
the woman we've been looking for

644
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:40,943
is your mother?

645
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,181
She isn't who I thought she was.

646
00:35:45,183 --> 00:35:47,850
The reason she moved in next to me...

647
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:50,953
she's looking for answers
that could save her life.

648
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,221
Has she found them?

649
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:54,928
No, but I hope she does.

650
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:57,226
I don't envy you,

651
00:35:57,228 --> 00:36:00,429
being caught in the middle
between two ruthless outlaws,

652
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:01,864
trying to pick a side.

653
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,499
Personally, I sympathize,

654
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,102
but professionally, there is
only one side to be on.

655
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:08,337
- Reddington's.
- We have a deal with him.

656
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,006
We give to get.

657
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:12,008
And he doesn't kill FBI agents.

658
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:15,578
The men stationed at
your building are missing.

659
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,993
That's indefensible.

660
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,351
And if she did it, I'll
walk her into prison myself.

661
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,154
But I'm not on Reddington's
side or her side.

662
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:27,877
I'm on the side of the truth.

663
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:32,361
And right now Reddington's
hiding that from me, and...

664
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,246
my mother isn't.

665
00:36:42,273 --> 00:36:45,241
Thank you, Morgan.

666
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:56,865
Medical team will be here in 10 minutes.

667
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,791
I didn't tell her.

668
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,029
Did you hear me?

669
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:09,665
She doesn't know.

670
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:14,924
You need to rest.

671
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:18,261
We don't need to worry about her anymore.

672
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:36,004
What exactly are you
planning on doing here?

673
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,850
The right thing.

674
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,938
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.

675
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,107
Money can't buy him a reduced sentence.

676
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,242
Erasing your memories can.

677
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,852
I am terribly sorry, Mr. Krilov.

678
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,522
Don't worry, I'm still
bringing you back to prison.

679
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:09,759
But, first, we have
some unfinished business.

680
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:12,661
You scrambled my brain,
and I'm here to make sure

681
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:15,030
that you never do that to anyone else.

682
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,077
I met my mother.

683
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:34,216
I know you didn't want me to.

684
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,256
But I did.

685
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:41,023
She told me you lied to me
about who Reddington really is.

686
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:46,224
I don't understand why you did that...

687
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:49,477
or why you'd try to have...

688
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:53,102
her killed to protect me.

689
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:58,778
You tried to kill your own child.

690
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:06,816
What kind of person
would do something like that?

691
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:17,088
I can't figure it out.

692
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,549
But maybe she can.

693
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,931
Maybe she can find out

694
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:25,901
everything you're trying to hide from me.

695
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,141
It's over.

696
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,809
What is?

697
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:35,110
The woman.

698
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,781
Aram told me she'd been
living in your building,

699
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:42,280
feigning kindness, watching Agnes.

700
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,421
But it's over. She's dead.

701
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:47,306
W-What?

702
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:50,803
How?

703
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,263
Gunned down in the street
less than an hour ago.

704
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,132
How do you know?

705
00:39:57,134 --> 00:40:00,870
I saw it happen.
Two heavily armed assets.

706
00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:05,708
They took her body because
they came for a bounty.

707
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:08,077
She's dead.

708
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,620
She is.

709
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,782
Elizabeth, go get Agnes. Take her home.

710
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:16,719
I've been reading to Dom.

711
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,687
We're halfway through "Beowulf."

712
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,516
Grendel's mother, now, there's
a woman to be reckoned with.

713
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:41,810
Hello?

714
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:43,549
Did he believe it?

715
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,691
Katarina?

716
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,483
Does he think I'm dead?

717
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,418
What happened? What's going on?

718
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,554
I bought us time to find the
answers we're looking for.

719
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,836
At least I tried. Did it work?

720
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:56,525
Like a charm.

721
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:59,361
This is our secret. No one can know.

722
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:01,897
I need to know you can keep it a secret.

723
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,767
Of course I can. I'm a Rostova.

724
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:07,903
I need to disappear for a stretch,

725
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:09,238
let things cool down.

726
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,640
But when the time is right,

727
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:14,076
when I have the answers, I will find you.

728
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:17,959
Might be a week or a month,
but I will find you.

729
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:19,815
We will end this.

730
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:28,123
I love you, Masha.

731
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:31,848
Be safe.

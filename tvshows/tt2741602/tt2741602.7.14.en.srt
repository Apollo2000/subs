1
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:11,463
How long has it been
since we lost contact with the driver?

2
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:12,731
Eighteen hours.

3
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:16,534
Any chance we will
find the cargo intact?

4
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:19,136
That would take
incredible luck.

5
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:22,274
And the only time I have
ever been lucky in Alaska

6
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,609
was when I was bumped
from behind

7
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,844
at an ice bar in Fairbanks.

8
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:30,749
I stumbled into the arms
of a lovely Nordic princess.

9
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,983
Literally, she was
a princess in Norway.

10
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,952
We flew straight to her
castle outside Bergen

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,489
and watched the Northern
Lights till dawn.

12
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,189
Otherwise,
Alaska's shown me

13
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:41,158
all the mercy
of a Greek tragedy.

14
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,543
Strange.

15
00:00:58,677 --> 00:00:59,943
According
to the tracker,

16
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,681
we should be right on
top of the containers.

17
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,800
Looks like it's time to cue
the Greek chorus, Dembe.

19
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,947
Elodie lied about
not having a prenup.

20
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,351
And now that
her husband's dead,

21
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:40,918
she stands to
inherit millions.

22
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,555
The way you described
her husband's condition,

23
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,690
it sounds more like
a mercy killing.

24
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:47,459
Maybe, but he didn't have
a medical directive,

25
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:50,227
and she couldn't have know what
was going on inside of his head.

26
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:54,699
You mean like
dreams and memories.

27
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,369
Maybe even
a deep and abiding love

28
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,571
for his betrothed.

29
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,406
- Exactly.
- A love so deep

30
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,410
that he would have preferred
that Elodie end his life

31
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:08,212
so that she could
move on with hers.

32
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,281
If only he had
the power to tell her.

33
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,716
No. Wait.

34
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,784
Wait, what?

35
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,952
How can I help you, Aram?

36
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,020
I want to know if Elodie
killed her husband.

37
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:20,392
If she did,
I have to arrest her.

38
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,260
I'm definitely...
I'm definitely breaking up with her.

39
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:24,529
But I don't really know yet,
But I need to know, you know?

40
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,730
Need to know what?

41
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,499
Oh, um...

42
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:28,899
Whether Elodie
killed her husband.

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,935
And you want
Reddington's help?

44
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,740
Get a blood sample from the
body before it's buried,

45
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,443
and I'll have it tested,
no questions asked.

46
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:42,079
Or... Crazy idea...
You could let the police investigate.

47
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,648
I should go and let
the two of you do

48
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,418
whatever it is
you two do.

49
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:49,052
Do you know why
I'm preparing this salmon?

50
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:50,755
If this is about your libido, I'm...
I'm good.

51
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,891
W-Where are we?
Why are we here?

52
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:57,328
It's for a celebratory meal
when the case is solved.

53
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,229
And what case is that?

54
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:02,767
I've been robbed.
Trucks of mine have been stolen.

55
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:04,669
Precious cargo
has gone missing.

56
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:06,304
You want us
to find your trucks.

57
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,306
I found the trucks.

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,975
Sunk in a lake
in the Alaska Triangle.

59
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,878
Wait, the Triangle's real?

60
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,079
I don't want you
to find my trucks.

61
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,082
I want you to solve
one of life's great mysteries.

62
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,951
The Alaska Triangle.

63
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,788
A place where some people
go and never return.

64
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:27,124
Supposedly 16,000
in the last 50 years.

65
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,794
Okay.
That can't be true.

66
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,831
The question isn't whether
they've disappeared. It's why.

67
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,232
Find the people
who stole my trucks

68
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,534
and you may get the answer.

69
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,173
This is former U.S.
House Majority Leader Hale Boggs.

70
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:46,043
Now, in 1972,
his twin-engine Cessna vanished

71
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,279
somewhere between
Juneau and Anchorage.

72
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,315
The nation's largest
search-and-rescue mission

73
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,251
was mounted. The Coast Guard,
Civil Air Patrol, the Navy.

74
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:54,786
All scoured the area
for months,

75
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,788
but no trace of Boggs' plane
was ever found.

76
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,790
He was lost
in a section of the state

77
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,692
known as
the Alaska Triangle.

78
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,327
Like the
Bermuda Triangle?

79
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,429
- Yes, only real.
- What's real about it

80
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:06,431
is that an unusually large
number of people

81
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:07,832
do seem to disappear there.

82
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,534
And this connects
to Reddington how?

83
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,604
Four months ago,
he lost a shipment in the triangle.

84
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:17,140
He attached a GPS tracker to
the next one and found it here.

85
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,710
And he thinks
whoever put it there

86
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,645
may be behind
the Alaska Triangle myth.

87
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:21,746
What was on the truck?

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,548
He wouldn't say,
but some of it

89
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,249
has apparently
shown up in Italy.

90
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:26,784
He's on his way
to find out how.

91
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,353
What about the drivers?

92
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:29,854
Mr. Reddington thinks they
went down with the shipment.

93
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:31,556
- Do we have any leads?
- The container numbers.

94
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,825
They're marked on the roof for
the benefit of crane operators,

95
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,827
so I was able to pull them
from the photos.

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,729
Based on those numbers,

97
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,196
do we know where the cargo
was coming from?

98
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,832
Each truck
was carrying cargo

99
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,367
offloaded in
the Port of Anchorage.

100
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,569
Dispatching, routing,
tracking, transpo...

101
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,036
It's all coordinated
by the port manager.

102
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,071
I've heard enough.
Ressler, Keen,

103
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,140
I want you two
to interview the port manager.

104
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,109
Park, I want you
to set up a liaison

105
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:53,611
with your old field office.

106
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:54,579
I don't think
that's a good idea.

107
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,914
Oh, and why not?

108
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,682
I'm not real popular
in Anchorage.

109
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:00,251
It's a good thing it's not
a popularity contest.

110
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:03,388
Someone really wants to talk to you.

111
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,756
My brother.

112
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,691
Oh, you never
talk about your brother.

113
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:08,927
Exactly.

114
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,778
Come in.

115
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,384
You and I
had an agreement.

116
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,519
I'm here on a case.

117
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,889
Our agreement was you
wouldn't be here at all.

118
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,325
I was sent here by Assistant
Director Harold Cooper.

119
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,693
This is his
authorization.

120
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,265
Liaison.
Computer access.

121
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,866
Underwater
search and rescue.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,468
To recover
three semi-trucks.

123
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:51,903
Semi-trucks.
Under water.

124
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:53,972
I'm not here
to look for him.

125
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,306
You better not be,

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,075
because I won't protect you
if you do. Not again.

127
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,462
There was a problem
with the shipment.

128
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:20,098
There's something we didn't
expect to find with the cargo.

129
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,778
I wonder how much
you're worth.

130
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,153
That's the reason why Aram
wants to draw blood?

131
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,056
To see if Elodie
poisoned her husband?

132
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,691
It's why Reddington
wants him to.

133
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,526
I think he should
tell the police.

134
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,064
That's why your phone's
been blowing up.

135
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:54,532
Robby.

136
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,199
What's he done
this time?

137
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,069
Don't know,
and I don't want to know.

138
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,170
You can't just ignore him.
He's family.

139
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:01,305
Watch me.

140
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:05,910
Park?

141
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,545
I pulled the port records.

142
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,014
It appears the same
shift manager was on duty

143
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:12,650
when the cargo for all three
stolen trucks was offloaded.

144
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,686
Name's Maxwell Barrett.

145
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,154
All right,
we're on our way to the port now.

146
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,889
<i>He's not at the port.
He's off today.</i>

147
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,123
He's got a place in Wasilla.

148
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:21,526
3250 Sun Ridge Road.

149
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,362
I know what's inside
all them containers.

150
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:27,131
Four of those containers are currently
sitting at the bottom of a lake.

151
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,000
I talked to the police,

152
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,502
and I'll tell you
what I told them.

153
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:33,971
Accidents happen.

154
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,306
Oh, this was
no accident.

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,108
The cargo's missing,
along with the drivers.

156
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,877
Those trucks have
only one thing in common...

157
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,146
You cleared them
through the port.

158
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,116
You two think
I took them trucks?

159
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,119
Why?

160
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,555
To pay for my millionaire
mountain chalet?

161
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,964
This is a waste of time.

162
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:02,767
I don't know.
I don't like it.

163
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,335
The old man
can barely walk.

164
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,837
I mean, it's not like he's John Dillinger...

165
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,386
Ressler, check this out.

166
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,458
I'll call Park,
get a forensics team up here.

167
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,228
Maybe they can figure out who this
guy's been communicating with.

168
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:35,166
She is kind and nice.

169
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,235
He's in a better place.
And I...

170
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,805
I'm a total diphthong.

171
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,015
Hey, hey.
Uh, you want a ride?

172
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,252
I, uh, figured you wouldn't
want to do this alone.

173
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,993
The guy outside your place, he, um...
He looked so familiar.

174
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,830
He was a friend
of Charles.

175
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,233
He had so many,
and they all feel awful.

176
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,669
Of course. They, um...
They lost a friend.

177
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,839
All I feel is relief.

178
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,475
For him because
he's finally at peace

179
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,711
and for me because I get
to move on with my life.

180
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,146
With our life.

181
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,517
Picking a casket
is a big decision,

182
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:30,521
so while I, uh, hunt for a
bathroom, you take your time.

183
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,823
Charles is gonna have to
live with your choice

184
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:34,926
for, like, ever.

185
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:53,911
Oh.

186
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,315
Sorry about that. Sorry.

187
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:03,955
Charles.

188
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,357
My, uh, deepest
sympathies.

189
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,892
I, uh... I know
this is super awkward.

190
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:13,332
But I think this might be
in your best interest.

191
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,334
Quick stick.

192
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,903
Oh, God.

193
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,177
I got it.
I got the goods.

194
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,378
What goods
are those, Aram?

195
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,579
The sample,
the blood sample.

196
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,381
- I have it.
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

197
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,851
I'll arrange pickup with
the lab tech for tonight.

198
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,587
The bike path
in Fort Slocum park.

199
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,522
- <i>Midnight.</i>
- A bike path.

200
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,524
At any rate, it's not
much of a bike path.

201
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,594
If you want
a real cycling adventure,

202
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,396
you should look into
the Cowboy Trail,

203
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,064
a defunct stretch
of rail line...

204
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,466
Aram?

205
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,369
Fort Slocum. Midnight.
Got to go. Got to go. Thanks.

206
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,736
- Hey.
- Hey.

207
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,372
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

208
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,906
Everything's...
Everything's fine.

209
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,474
Did you, uh...
Did you find a casket?

210
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,943
I did care about him,
you know.

211
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,411
I know it doesn't always
seem like it

212
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:03,948
because, well,
you make me so happy.

213
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,449
But, anyway, yes,

214
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,551
and I'm glad you made me
take the time to do it.

215
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:08,953
Charles deserved that.

216
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,759
We made a copy of the hard disks
from Maxwell Barrett's cabin.

217
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,961
We were able to trace
one of the downloads.

218
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,963
What are TEU values?

219
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,432
It's the insured value
of each cargo container.

220
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,234
The highest one
on the list there

221
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,771
is over $14 million
in German pharmaceuticals.

222
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,773
- Could be the next target.
- I'll contact the carrier.

223
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,908
How were you able to locate the
missing trucks in the first place?

224
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,346
- We can't tell you that.
- I wasn't asking you.

225
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,147
Look, we're just here
to do a job and go home.

226
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,081
Is that gonna be a problem?

227
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,417
That's up to Alina.

228
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,657
You getting chilly yet?

229
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,459
You think you might
want to start talking

230
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,027
in exchange
for some clothes?

231
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:53,064
I t-told you what I know.

232
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,967
Edward Lussier.
Night security at Prudhoe Bay.

233
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,903
But what
you didn't tell me

234
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,005
is why you were all trussed up
in the back of a trailer

235
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,940
full of smuggled goods.

236
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,344
I was t-taken.
M-M-Middle of the night.

237
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,711
Please, I-I don't know why...

238
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, you're worth
something to somebody,

239
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,982
and you better figure out what
before you freeze to death.

240
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,683
<i>If we want to find them,</i>

241
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,685
the pharmaceuticals
may be an opportunity.

242
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,087
An opportunity how?

243
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,188
What if we let the
shipment go as scheduled.

244
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,489
Allow them to steal it.

245
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:19,890
You want to catch them
in the act.

246
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,659
We're the FBI.
We're supposed to stop crimes,

247
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,194
not facilitate them.

248
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,629
That being said, uh,
what exactly are you suggesting?

249
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,065
That 40-foot of
pharmaceuticals is offloaded.

250
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,468
Should be on the road
within two hours.

251
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,205
I'm gonna give you
some alone time

252
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,741
so you can reflect
on your self-worth.

253
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:39,877
Wait!

254
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,682
I-I told you
everything I know!

255
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,884
Please, y-y-you can't
leave me in here!

256
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,619
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna freeze to death!

257
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,063
- <i>Buongiorno!</i>
- Don Reddington!

258
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,333
<i>Signore</i> Rossi.

259
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:03,634
Look at you.

260
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,002
Oh, how are you, friend?

261
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,238
Living <i>la dolce vita.</i>

262
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,441
And what brings you to my
little corner of paradise?

263
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,510
- My nose, of course.
- Oh, of course.

264
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,478
Word has it
you've formulated

265
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,946
a new fragrance
with musky depth

266
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,083
and a passionate
animalic note.

267
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,319
Ah. You are referring

268
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:25,756
to the Rossi
Grande Estratto No. 1.

269
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,325
<i>Questo.</i>

270
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,227
- Oh, <i>dio mio.</i>
- Uh-huh.

271
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:31,962
Oh.

272
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:34,665
So warm on the top.

273
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,234
- Honey-like.
- Yes.

274
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:42,106
With a lustful, almost
bottomless bottom.

275
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,342
Is that ambergris?

276
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:47,578
Wow! You have
very refined senses.

277
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,781
I find ambergris
to be an absolute marvel.

278
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,284
Mm-hmm.

279
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:55,052
Digestive juices
of the sperm whale

280
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:59,890
powerful enough to break down
squid beaks and fish bones

281
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,493
until the glorious beast

282
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,463
excretes the waxy mass
into the ocean.

283
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,300
Whale vomit worth more than
its weight in gold.

284
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,968
It's true.

285
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:15,574
Ambergris is very difficult
to come by these days.

286
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,576
And yet you managed
to find some.

287
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:23,281
I was contacted
by a private party in Alaska.

288
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,749
A private party in Alaska

289
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,320
just stole a shipment
of ambergris from me,

290
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:31,155
worth about $3 million.

291
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,124
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Mm.

292
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,625
Who's your supplier?

293
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,728
Raymond, you know I cannot
divulge my suppliers.

294
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,930
Ambergris is illegal
in many countries.

295
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,502
I understand.

296
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,637
You have to protect
your supply chain

297
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,609
to maintain the high quality
of your fine merchandise.

298
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,345
Such as this
extraordinary item.

299
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,813
<i>Quanto costa?</i>

300
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,715
6,800.

301
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,850
Ah. That must be
a heavenly scent.

302
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,289
Mmm. White birch?

303
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:05,823
Mmm. I smell clove.

304
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,526
- Yes.
- And oakmoss.

305
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,627
Oakmoss.

306
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,661
This one is pretty.

307
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,397
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You win.

308
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:13,964
I'll give you the name.
I'll give you the name.

309
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,833
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- Please, no more.

310
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:19,003
Write down
the relevant details

311
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:23,974
and, please, gift wrap
one bottle of Rossi No. 1.

312
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:25,644
Sure. <i>Si.</i>

313
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,160
You, uh... You want me to put
the item in... In the basket?

314
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,103
Do I, um... Do I get
a receipt or... anything?

315
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,674
No? <i>Shalom.</i>

316
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,981
Everybody on the ground.

317
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,587
Nobody move.

318
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,434
Records division?

319
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,636
Yeah, this is
Special Agent Aram Mojtabai.

320
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,339
I'd like to request the case
file for Thelonious Prackett.

321
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,107
Yeah, with a "P."

322
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,214
<i>You're like
an ice-road trucker.</i>

323
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,951
Got to be if you live
up here long enough.

324
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,622
Even if your toes can barely
reach the pedals.

325
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,955
Ten hours on the road,

326
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,325
we haven't seen one sign
of a suspicious vehicle.

327
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,893
GPS says you're still
inside the triangle.

328
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,630
They'll take the bait.

329
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,266
It's possible the hijack crew was
tipped off that I was driving.

330
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,735
More than likely they got word
that we shot their inside man.

331
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,370
You shot
their inside man.

332
00:16:58,503 --> 00:16:59,937
Yeah, but
I saved your butt.

333
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,839
Hey, guys, hold up.

334
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,240
I've got something here.

335
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:07,878
Accident blocking the road.

336
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,681
All right, here we go.
Keep this line open.

337
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:10,981
We're two minutes out
and closing.

338
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,701
Everyone okay?

339
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,503
We got an airlift en route
from Bartlett.

340
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,870
We can try
and guide you clear,

341
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,339
but we can't move
those vehicles.

342
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:36,240
Yeah.
That would be great.

343
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:37,776
Let's try
and squeeze you through.

344
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:00,699
I'm clear.

345
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,232
What do you mean
you're clear?

346
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,601
They let you through?

347
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:04,935
You sure they're not
tailing you?

348
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:06,504
No.

349
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:09,808
I think the accident
was just... an accident.

350
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:14,912
I just passed a sign
for a weigh station

351
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,748
a few miles up the road.

352
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,215
I'll wait there,
and we can regroup.

353
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,718
Copy that.

354
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:35,999
Hello?

355
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:39,671
Hello?

356
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:45,844
Hello?

357
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,856
Hey, Park,
medics are on-site.

358
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,524
We're just waiting to see
if they need any assistance

359
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:01,593
before we head your way.

360
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:04,895
Park, do you copy?

361
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,201
<i>Alina?</i>

362
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:14,472
<i>Alina, can you hear me?
Are you there?</i>

363
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:17,442
<i>Park, do you copy?</i>

364
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:18,576
<i>Park?</i>

365
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:26,284
Found a GPS tracker
hidden in the truck.

366
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,786
We had to dump it.

367
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,888
And we found her.

368
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,491
What do you want
to do with her?

369
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,608
No, no. It's okay.
I'm not with them.

370
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,477
I...

371
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,778
Here.

372
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:56,246
Take this.

373
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:01,786
Where are we?

374
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,290
We're gonna d-die here.

375
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,935
I'd say we're in the
foothills of the Chugach range.

376
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,369
If we got out
and found a trailhead,

377
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,838
I think I can get us
to an access road.

378
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,940
- You live here?
- I did.

379
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:23,942
Swore I'd never come back.

380
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:25,944
Then why did you?

381
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:30,147
What were you hauling
when they hijacked you?

382
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:33,116
Hauling?
I was being hauled.

383
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,285
You know,
I-I-I got abducted,

384
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:35,386
thrown in the
back of a truck,

385
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,955
and then that truck
got hijacked.

386
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,022
And you don't know why?

387
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,625
Lady, I'm a nobody.

388
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:41,960
Why would anyone
want to abduct me?

389
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:45,964
Here.

390
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:48,131
We'll take turns.

391
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,707
Why did you? Come back?

392
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,007
To catch the hijackers.

393
00:20:58,643 --> 00:20:59,878
I'm an FBI agent.

394
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,914
My name's Alina Park.

395
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:05,817
What's your name?

396
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,652
Me?

397
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:10,555
I told you.
I'm nobody.

398
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,557
Well, Mr. Nobody,

399
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,527
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

400
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,762
I died once in Alaska.

401
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,497
I didn't come back
to do it again.

402
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,071
She was taken
from a weigh station.

403
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,542
It's isolated.
No surveillance.

404
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:33,411
Target vehicle approaches,
gets waived out of line and hijacked,

405
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:36,046
the GPS gets pulled,
and no one's the wiser.

406
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,181
That was Mr. Reddington.
I, uh, patched him through to the call

407
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,149
and told him
about Agent Park.

408
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,586
This just came for you.

409
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,220
Case files
on Les Fleurs du Mal.

410
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,856
<i>Don't tell me
you listened to Reddington.</i>

411
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,558
I told you to have
the police look into it.

412
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:48,026
- Into what?
- Nothing as important

413
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:49,961
as finding Agent Park.

414
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,228
- Mr. Reddington.
- Speaking.

415
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,597
<i>Keen and Ressler
are coordinating</i>

416
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,197
with state and local
authorities.

417
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:56,434
They have roadblocks in place
and aerial surveillance.

418
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,836
Twamie Ullulaq.

419
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,371
Who?

420
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:03,374
The stolen cargo I traced in
Milan, Twamie took it.

421
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,043
- Do you know where he is?
- <i>I do not.</i>

422
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,611
<i>But someone
in your government does.</i>

423
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:07,879
<i>They created him.</i>

424
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,481
Twamie Ullulaq
is a native Alaskan

425
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:14,252
who the U.S. military armed and
trained in counterterrorism.

426
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,054
The army doesn't train
civilians.

427
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,056
They did during the Cold War,
didn't they, Harold?

428
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:20,325
Go on. Tell the kids
about Operation Washtub.

429
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,461
During the Cold War,

430
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,897
the Pentagon worried that
they couldn't defend Alaska,

431
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,600
<i>so it rounded up locals,
hunters, bush pilots,</i>

432
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:29,767
<i>and trained them
in counterinsurgency</i>

433
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,234
<i>against a Red Invasion.</i>

434
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,304
<i>They volunteered
in exchange for land</i>

435
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,907
and a promise that housing
would be built. Schools.

436
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,109
And when the Red Scare ended,
so did that commitment.

437
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:42,145
Imagine that.
Your government breaking its promise

438
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,581
to indigenous people.

439
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,583
How much
does the FBI know?

440
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:48,453
- I-I'm not an agent.
- We don't know each other.

441
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:51,188
You expect me to believe you
two being here is a coincidence.

442
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:52,790
Yes. Because it is.

443
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,927
There's no coincidences here.

444
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,029
The land they were given,
find it.

445
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,597
Just because nothing
was ever built on it

446
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:00,965
doesn't mean
they're still not there,

447
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,433
and it doesn't mean
she's not there.

448
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,736
And if she is,
we're gonna find her.

449
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,070
How much do you know
about us?

450
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,705
Why would I
tell you that?

451
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,307
'Cause if you don't,
I'll kill him.

452
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,508
N-No, no, no!

453
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:11,643
Don't! Please!

454
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,646
No. Don't!

455
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:16,114
Twamie,
we got a problem.

456
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:20,118
We'll continue this.

457
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:29,127
Twamie, Old Mac's dead.

458
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,329
The FBI gunned him down
inside his cabin.

459
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:33,765
Just a matter of time
before they find this camp.

460
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,967
Pack it up!
We're pulling stakes!

461
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,135
You heard him.
Come on, guys.

462
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:38,336
- Come on! Move it!
- Let's go.

463
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:39,737
- Come on!
- Right now.

464
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,378
Wilbur Eaton?
Special Agent Aram Mojtabai.

465
00:23:47,512 --> 00:23:49,347
FBI.

466
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,050
If this is about Prackett,
I made a deal.

467
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,085
Got immunity for testifying
against him.

468
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,087
I read the testimony.

469
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,088
I know what you did
for Prackett.

470
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,923
You made
the torture chambers

471
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:01,959
that killed or disabled anyone
who was put in them,

472
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:03,961
including
Charles Radcliffe.

473
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:06,564
And yet, you were at his
widow's house yesterday.

474
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,132
To offer my condolences.

475
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:10,034
For the death of a man
you almost killed.

476
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:12,570
What can I say?
I'm soft that way.

477
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:15,173
Your immunity agreement
required full disclosure

478
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:16,741
about any
and all crimes

479
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,509
involved in
Prackett's ventures.

480
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:20,411
If you fail
to disclose one,

481
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:22,380
the deal will be torn up,
and you will go to prison.

482
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,582
Why were you really
at her house?

483
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,886
Because now she can pay me
what she owes.

484
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,755
Because of the prenup.

485
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,590
Wait. Wait,
why does she owe you money?

486
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:35,727
I remember you.
From The Defiance.

487
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,227
What did you do for her?

488
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,298
You don't want to know.

489
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,337
You were gonna
let him kill me.

490
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:47,805
He was bluffing.

491
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:50,007
He was right
about coincidences.

492
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:51,909
They don't happen here.

493
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:53,911
You need to have a
purpose to come here.

494
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,379
I know yours
was to kill me.

495
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:03,621
- Put them on.
- Or what?

496
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:06,190
You're gonna shoot us?
You want us to wear these,

497
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,792
you're gonna have
to put them on us yourself.

498
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,831
You're too feisty
for your own good.

499
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:14,732
Anyone ever
tell you that?

500
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,234
All the time.

501
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,781
I know you blame me
for what h-happened,

502
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,849
but I didn't kill her.

503
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,953
Lussier...

504
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:37,722
But looks like you did
come back here to die.

505
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:50,668
AKRCC's running search and
rescue assets out of Elmendorf,

506
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,436
and the state troopers
have their infrared chopper

507
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,138
in the air as we speak.

508
00:25:54,273 --> 00:25:55,840
Were you able to monitor
radio frequencies up here?

509
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,909
All 406 emergency
locator beacons.

510
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,977
She knows your protocol,
so if she still has a radio,

511
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,779
expect her to try
to make contact.

512
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:04,549
What about the land granted
to Operation Washtub?

513
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:06,184
- Have you located it?
- We're working on it.

514
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,152
Yeah, well, work harder.

515
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,087
This mission was a mistake
to begin with.

516
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:11,322
Park got herself
into this situation,

517
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,658
and it's
an unfortunate one,

518
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,560
but these people, the ones
who are searching for her,

519
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,128
they're the very best
at what they do,

520
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:18,297
and they will do whatever
they can to find her.

521
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,665
Now, if you'll excuse me,

522
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:22,301
we got a location
on the camp.

523
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:26,305
What is it
with her and Park?

524
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:32,643
Park's history here
is... complicated.

525
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:33,811
Meaning?

526
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:36,013
Park made mistakes.

527
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,283
Connor covered on the promise
Park would not return.

528
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,651
Covered?
What did she do?

529
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:42,353
You have a black sheep
in your family.

530
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:46,691
Let's just say Park has
a black sheep of her own.

531
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,034
You'll never make it.

532
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:59,304
Really? Watch me.

533
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,606
I stand a better chance.

534
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,608
I doubt it. Seeing as how
I'm the one with the gun.

535
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,076
You're lucky if it's
20 degrees right now.

536
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,377
Once the sun drops
behind that ridge,

537
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,347
it'll fall below zero,
and that's before dark.

538
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:12,650
I'm not letting you out.

539
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,886
I know we're on the south side
of the Bagley Icefield.

540
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,888
I also know
if we can get to Quill Creek,

541
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,856
it'll point us
toward the highway.

542
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,426
You, on the other hand,
you're a junkie lost in the woods.

543
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,062
A nobody from nowhere.
You said so yourself.

544
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:27,098
Why would you h-help me?

545
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,599
I'm helping myself.

546
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,434
You'll die out there, Edward.

547
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,436
But if you leave me,
I'll die in here.

548
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:45,716
- The bullets.
- Hmm?

549
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,985
I don't care if you carry the
gun, but I carry the bullets.

550
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,390
Think of it
as the first step

551
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:52,423
towards you and I
trusting each other.

552
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:10,441
Mr. Ullulaq,
we have a situation.

553
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:18,683
I'm sorry.

554
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:21,619
I never saw it coming.

555
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:23,422
Well, they couldn't have
gotten that far.

556
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,655
Take Gerrit with you.

557
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,891
Radio the camp
when you find their footpath.

558
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:31,629
As far as I'm concerned,

559
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,333
there's no end to the charges
they could bring against you,

560
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:36,000
but murder is
the only one that matters.

561
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,935
I know you think that,

562
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:39,271
but you're not gonna
do anything about it.

563
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:41,472
You killed my mother.

564
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,511
You tell anybody,
I'll go public.

565
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:53,150
I know what happened
at Anchorage Correctional.

566
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,720
Yeah. How you put
J. Yost in a wheelchair.

567
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:59,790
Yeah. I know about
those cops you paid off.

568
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:04,363
I know how you, uh,
held Wade Leek at gunpoint.

569
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:07,631
And I know you...
You broke the law

570
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,700
in enough different ways
in order to try and find me

571
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,371
that you friends at the FBI
had to cover it up.

572
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,472
We need to keep moving.

573
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:15,673
You hear me?

574
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:16,707
It's getting late.

575
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:20,711
You turn me in,
I'll tell them everything.

576
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:23,382
Every gory detail.

577
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,683
No, you're not gonna
say anything to nobody.

578
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,184
'Cause you're not
walking out of these woods...

579
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,353
Aah!

580
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:29,620
Oh! Don't move!

581
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:31,956
Hold on! Hold on!

582
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,024
Pull! Harder! Harder!

583
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,292
I'm trying!

584
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,494
I can't!

585
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,330
I'm begging you!
Please! Please!

586
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:39,930
- I'll be back.
- No. Don't leave me.

587
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:41,699
You can't!

588
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:42,933
I'm begging you. Please.

589
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,506
Please.

590
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,074
Please.

591
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,842
Sweetie, I'm begging.

592
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:54,379
Please.

593
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:55,447
<i>Please.</i>

594
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:56,547
I'll die here!

595
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:58,517
I can't open the trap.

596
00:29:58,649 --> 00:29:59,884
Not on my own.

597
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:02,086
I'll get help,
and I will come back.

598
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,522
And if they
get here first?

599
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,760
You only got six.
Aim carefully.

600
00:30:14,765 --> 00:30:16,033
<i>Twamie,
we got a situation.</i>

601
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:17,568
You find them?

602
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,769
<i>Scouts radioed.
We got a breach.</i>

603
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,004
<i>Feds on the south ridge.</i>

604
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,544
FBI! Hands in the air!

605
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:26,777
Put your weapons down!

606
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,567
Freeze!

607
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,278
Sir.
She's not here, sir.

608
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,582
Hey, where is she?

609
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,717
Answer me.

610
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,986
- Why would I want to do that?
- <i>Twamie.</i>

611
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,323
Your men have her
or are looking for her.

612
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:12,690
Either way,
you've been in communication.

613
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:15,260
Where are they?

614
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,267
Now, that's a piss-poor
hiding spot.

615
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:25,069
Put it down. Slowly.

616
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:27,104
Okay. Okay, wait, wait.
Just wait!

617
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:29,341
All right?

618
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,876
Please.
I can help you.

619
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,478
I don't think you're gonna
be much help at all.

620
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,846
No, listen.
I have information

621
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,083
about your FBI agent there.
You know, things she's done.

622
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:41,520
You could use her to barter
with the police, cut a deal.

623
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:42,720
We don't have orders
to make deals.

624
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,889
Our order's to make
examples out of you.

625
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:47,191
Wait, hold on.
I'm telling you, she's a dirty cop.

626
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:49,361
Not anymore she's not.

627
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:50,328
FBI! Put the gun down!

628
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,171
You okay?

629
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,643
Keen!

630
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:18,590
You okay?

631
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:19,990
Better than him.

632
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,662
My mother's boyfriend
from Anchorage.

633
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:25,564
The one you've been hunting
all these years.

634
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:27,666
How is that possible?

635
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:30,734
Did you know he was here?

636
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,002
Of course not.

637
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:34,004
How did you two end up
in the same place together?

638
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,509
I think we both know
the answer to that.

639
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,015
I can't believe
I'm back in a blacksite.

640
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,419
You know, I knew
that you had a cool job,

641
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:50,087
but, I mean,
this is so cool...

642
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,692
What's he doing here?

643
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,759
- Sit down.
- I can explain.

644
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:58,796
Explain what?

645
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,298
That Charles didn't find
Les Fleurs du Mal?

646
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:01,966
You did.

647
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,902
I told him about
our arrangement.

648
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,904
There is no arrangement.

649
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:09,507
How you came to me,
got me to invite your husband

650
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:11,842
and made sure he was
selected for the challenge.

651
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:13,445
- He came to the house...
- Selected to die.

652
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,480
He wanted money.

653
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:16,648
He said he would
tell these lies

654
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,815
if I didn't
give it to him.

655
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:19,618
But Charles didn't die.

656
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,884
And then I showed up.

657
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,721
When we insisted
you go to The Defiance,

658
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:24,755
you got Eaton to pick you.

659
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,126
I thought I was
saving you,

660
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:32,664
but you two had
worked out a way

661
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:33,964
for you to save yourself.

662
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,268
No.

663
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,636
I would have died
without you.

664
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:40,272
No. You used me.

665
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:44,476
You got me
to open up to you.

666
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,511
That's why you kept asking
about Blacklisters.

667
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:51,015
To seduce me into
giving you a murder weapon.

668
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:53,951
You can't believe that.

669
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,235
I can't believe you would
take his word over mine.

670
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:12,270
Your word, then...

671
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,072
Did you kill him?

672
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,444
I love you.

673
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:23,481
Did you kill Charles?

674
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:28,320
No.

675
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:33,625
I hope that's true.

676
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:44,803
Agent Park.

677
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,573
You kidnapped Lussier.

678
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:50,709
They found him inside
your truck, didn't they?

679
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,211
We can discuss that
over Shiozake.

680
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:57,749
You orchestrated this whole thing.
You put us together.

681
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:01,018
I intended on bringing
you together, yes,

682
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:04,356
by abducting him,
not you.

683
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,558
That was unforeseen.

684
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,626
But in the end,

685
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,227
it served the greater good.

686
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,367
You have no business
interfering in my life.

687
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,168
I do when your life
interferes with my business.

688
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:22,206
I know about your mother

689
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,510
and her relationship
with Mr. Lussier.

690
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:27,712
How could you know that?

691
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:28,879
Because I must.

692
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:36,654
You're an excellent agent,
Alina, and a loose cannon.

693
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:39,990
I need the first,
and I won't tolerate the second.

694
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:43,093
So you put us together
so I could, what?

695
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:46,564
Exact my revenge and
become less uncontrollable?

696
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:51,870
My world is filled
with people seeking revenge.

697
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,873
I can see it
every time I look at them.

698
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:56,875
It's as distinct
as a birthmark.

699
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,648
But I look at you
and see none of that.

700
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,551
I don't see
a quest for vengeance.

701
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:11,856
I see a smart,
capable young woman

702
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:13,924
filled with self-loathing,

703
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:16,761
and I think

704
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:18,563
if you have
a debt to settle,

705
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:22,434
perhaps it's
with yourself.

706
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,373
Lussier's an addict
who supports his habit

707
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:29,641
<i>through armed robbery
and theft.</i>

708
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,241
<i>I settled my debt with him</i>

709
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:33,278
<i>when I gave everything I knew
about his crimes</i>

710
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:34,913
to the Alaska bureau.

711
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,081
And the debt
you owe yourself?

712
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,992
I settled that
by giving them nothing

713
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,462
about what he did
to my mother.

714
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:53,765
Because he...

715
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,668
Did nothing.

716
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:59,637
The heroin did.

717
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,542
They were addicts,
and they were helpless to help each other.

718
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:07,144
I was helpless, too.

719
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,281
You were a child.

720
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:13,418
You couldn't be
expected to help.

721
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:16,354
You shouldn't
hate yourself for that.

722
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,527
After he left,
she was shaking

723
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,562
and vomiting
and doubled over in pain.

724
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:28,165
I was seven.

725
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:31,736
All I saw
was that she was in pain,

726
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,972
and I wanted
that pain to stop.

727
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:34,973
<i>Sweetie, I'm begging.</i>

728
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:37,709
Please.

729
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:40,043
<i>So I did as I was told.</i>

730
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:49,019
At first,
she was so... happy.

731
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:55,158
<i>The pain just disappeared.</i>

732
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,431
<i>And then her eyes rolled back
into her head, and...</i>

733
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,002
<i>She died.</i>

734
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:06,938
<i>She overdosed.</i>

735
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,741
<i>I overdosed her.</i>

736
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,650
I don't hate myself because
I couldn't help my mom.

737
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,023
I hate myself
because I killed her.

738
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,539
Thank you.

739
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,425
Agent Park, come in.

740
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:06,264
I hear congratulations
are in order.

741
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:07,465
Thank you, sir.

742
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,734
We got lucky, sir.

743
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,072
Diligence is the mother
of good luck.

744
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,442
What's on your mind?

745
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:22,280
Anchorage
and my past there.

746
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:26,451
I've read your file.
I know things got a little bumpy

747
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:27,685
near the end.

748
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:30,321
Bumpy would be a gracious
choice of words.

749
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:34,092
Sir, there are things
that happened in Anchorage,

750
00:39:35,393 --> 00:39:37,362
things I did
that you're not aware of.

751
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:40,365
You should be.

752
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:50,508
So, what sort of things?

753
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,693
It's strange.
I know we solved

754
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,294
at least part
of the Alaska Triangle,

755
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:12,864
but after
all he was promised,

756
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:15,800
it's hard not
to empathize.

757
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,635
I've spoken
to Agent Park...

758
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:19,837
And now he's going to prison
for the rest of his life.

759
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:21,039
She told me
about Anchorage.

760
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:25,175
She told me you know.
I'm curious as to why

761
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,210
you didn't feel the need
to say anything to me.

762
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:29,681
I didn't say anything

763
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:31,716
because I don't think
you should do anything.

764
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,686
She didn't just bend
the rule book. She broke it.

765
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,387
And I can understand

766
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,089
why you would have a hard time
accepting that.

767
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:42,192
But when it
comes to family,

768
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:43,161
it's complicated.

769
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,298
I know that's true for me.
You know better than anyone,

770
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:49,133
I haven't always been
my best self.

771
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:52,235
I don't think
any of us have.

772
00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:55,573
Honestly, I think
you should give her

773
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:56,641
the benefit of the doubt.

774
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,378
I think in a situation
like this,

775
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:03,881
we should give everyone
the benefit of the doubt.

776
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,945
You have the right
to remain silent.

777
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,749
Anything you say
can and will be

778
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:38,916
used against you
in a court of law.

779
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:42,653
<i>You have the right
to an attorney.</i>

780
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:45,423
<i>If you cannot
afford an attorney,</i>

781
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:46,758
<i>one will be provided
for you.</i>

782
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:51,929
<i>Do you understand these
rights I have just read to you?</i>

783
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:56,200
No.

784
00:41:57,168 --> 00:41:58,636
I don't understand it
at all.

785
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,978
Neither do I.

786
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:27,894

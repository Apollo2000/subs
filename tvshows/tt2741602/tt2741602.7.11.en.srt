1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:06,307
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,941
Ah, lift tickets.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,910
To Whistler Blackcomb.

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,414
Blackcomb's supposed to be the
sickest snowboarding on Earth.

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,548
- So says the Internet.
- And we got him a bath caddy?

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,485
He said no gifts.
You said no gifts, right?

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,986
- I know, I...
- The presence of friends

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,123
- is a gift.
- Indeed.

9
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,291
- Thank you, Teddy. I can't wait.
- You're welcome.

10
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,792
Open this next.

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,095
You really didn't need
to, Raymond.

12
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,763
Ah, come on, come on.

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,866
No.

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,902
Yessiree!

15
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,904
This is the one we saw
in the village outside Lusail.

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,074
The same.
You knew, right?

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,442
But you got it?

18
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,077
- You didn't know?
- I had no idea.

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,645
I went back to buy it,
and she said it was sold.

20
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,014
Because of the guy
in the jacket.

21
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,382
The one you said
was following us?

22
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,118
He wasn't fo... I had to say
something to get rid of you.

23
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,787
I smuggled the damned thing
onto the jet in my hat

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,989
like some "B"-movie
drug runner.

25
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,895
Thank you, Raymond.
It's perfect.

26
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,297
Happy birthday,
my friend.

27
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,469
Hello?

28
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,138
Excuse me?

29
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,605
I'm sorry.
Say that again.

30
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,210
Mr. Orville.

31
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,613
- Hello?
- <i>The nesting casket.</i>

32
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,681
- <i>You have it?</i>
- I do.

33
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,817
<i>Good.
She has a potential buyer.</i>

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,153
No. For all six?

35
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,955
<i>Yes. The entire set.
The team is gathering.</i>

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,990
<i>She wants everyone to bring
their caskets to the island.</i>

37
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,692
<i>Spend the weekend.
Meet the buyer.</i>

38
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,961
<i>7:00 p.m. Friday.
Come alone.</i>

39
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,729
No, that's nowhere
near enough time.

40
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,532
<i>Friday. 7:00 p.m.</i>

41
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,067
<i>There will be
no extensions.</i>

42
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,769
<i>Don't let
the others down.</i>

43
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,972
Looks like we'll have to eat our
cake and ice cream on the jet.

44
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,142
You and I are going
to Artemivsk.

45
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,843
We can't.
It's too dangerous.

46
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,744
We have to get
that casket.

47
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,746
Things are
different now.

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,350
The entire neighborhood
is controlled by separatists.

49
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,618
They know you supply arms
to the Ukrainian army.

50
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,321
Well, they have Russia
for their guns.

51
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,389
They don't care.
They want your head.

52
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,858
This is bigger than me. I have
an obligation to the others.

53
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,428
If she has a buyer
for the entire set,

54
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,164
the profit would not only be
obscene but flagrant.

55
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,566
We have to go to the vault,
get that casket.

56
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,734
- Time is precious.
- I can go for you.

57
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,238
Only my print
opens the locks.

58
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,206
How do you suggest
we get you behind enemy lines?

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,441
I don't know.

60
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,343
If they want me dead,
maybe we should just

61
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,877
give them what they want.

62
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,766
Bring him around back.

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,609
Good Lord,
that was rejuvenating.

64
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,378
I slept like a vampire.

65
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,746
Raymond.

66
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,649
Good to see you, Vasyl.

67
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,817
Oh. You look well.

68
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,719
- Are these your guys?
- Yes.

69
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,822
They know only of the job
but not who the job is for.

70
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,125
Well, let's be quick
about it.

71
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,792
There's a mob's worth
of separatists

72
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,595
who want my head
on a stick.

73
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,159
Look at that.

74
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,760
- What is it?
- It's one of six.

75
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,165
They descend in size
from largest to smallest,

76
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,068
each one fitting
inside another.

77
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,669
Like Russian dolls.

78
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,672
Same idea,
but the Matryoshkas didn't appear

79
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,441
until the late 1800s.

80
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,144
This is Byzantine, 12th
century, found in Turkey.

81
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,447
Simply put, they weren't
even supposed to exist,

82
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,650
not at that time,
not in that part of the world.

83
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,319
Once joined
with its five partners,

84
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,089
this little box
will be more valuable

85
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:19,326
than all the treasure
in this vault and more.

86
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,661
Raymond.

87
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,300
Not another step.

88
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,342
Anything
you care to share?

89
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,178
Oksana. They took her.

90
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,980
They threatened
to kill her if I didn't...

91
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,516
When were they called?

92
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,084
Soon after you arrived.

93
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,552
So they're almost here.

94
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,888
Raymond, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,524
- Do they know?
- They know nothing.

96
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,693
They're here to get you
out like we planned.

97
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,130
- But, Raymond, the rebels...
- Dembe, let's move.

98
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,748
Look what the cat
dragged in.

99
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,216
I've missed you, Cynthia.

100
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,185
Mwah. Mwah.

101
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,120
Ah, Dembe.

102
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,755
Cynthia.

103
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,989
In anticipation
of a sale,

104
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,226
I need you
to appraise an item.

105
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,128
Shouldn't take
more than a moment.

106
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,632
This can't be what I...

107
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:11,739
I had heard rumors,
and I never dared believe them.

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,240
Here, here, here.

109
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,678
Oh.

110
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm in a bit of a rush,
my love.

111
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,486
What do you think
it's worth?

112
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,856
About as much
as a politician's word.

113
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,292
It's a fake.

114
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,761
No, that's impossible.

115
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,464
The etchings were made
with modern tools.

116
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,303
This is no more authentic
than the Cardiff Giant.

117
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,839
Were there any signs
of a break-in at the vault,

118
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,775
anything missing?

119
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,443
No, nothing.

120
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,146
Whatever thief
is responsible for this

121
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,117
must've forged
and replaced the caskets

122
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,886
before we ever
got our hands on them.

123
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,856
We stole a bunch
of counterfeits.

124
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,826
Oh, my God.
This is unbelievable.

125
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,898
You're taking this better
than I might've expected.

126
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,666
The others are gonna
show up at our meeting

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,503
and have no idea
the entire thing is a hoax.

128
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,839
A big, fat bungle.

129
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,509
Six marks, six cons.

130
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,045
Oh, my goodness.

131
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,481
Cynthia, thank you
for your expertise.

132
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,850
I am terribly embarrassed.

133
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,852
Better luck next time.

134
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,454
You said it.

135
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,555
Cheerio.

136
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,323
Ta-ta.

137
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,494
You know,
it occurs to me,

138
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,131
if we can find the
counterfeiter who created this,

139
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,099
we might be able to recover

140
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:51,104
the entire set of original
nesting caskets for ourselves.

141
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,840
And make
a flagrant profit.

142
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,108
That's the spirit.

143
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,910
Lemons to lemonade, Dembe.

144
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,512
Lemons to lemonade.

145
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:05,658
Subtitles by explosiveskull
www.OpenSubtitles.org

146
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:14,461
You brought down the President
of the United States.

147
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,197
I wouldn't
say that exactly.

148
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,100
You found out he was
gonna kill the First Lady,

149
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,103
stopped him from doing it,
and then he resigned.

150
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,005
Well, when you put it
that way...

151
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,274
So you do that
and deal with

152
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,977
people who
weaponize beetles?

153
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,212
Okay, um,

154
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:36,917
what we do
is full service...

155
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,318
And classified.

156
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,088
And the beetles
eat their victims

157
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,422
from the inside out?

158
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,857
Why do you wanna know
all this?

159
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,661
Who comes up with
all the nicknames?

160
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,029
General Shiro.

161
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,597
The Pharmacist.

162
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,566
The Apothecary.

163
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,135
Okay, all right, now you're
actually scaring me.

164
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,371
What can I say?

165
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,240
I love a bad boy.

166
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,420
He's gone into A-Fib.
Call 911.

167
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,994
Hello? Yes. My husband's
having a heart attack.

168
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,396
My name?

169
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,366
Mrs. Elodie Radcliffe.

170
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,783
I owe you an apology.

172
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,418
Ohh, boy.

173
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,852
What'd you do
this time?

174
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,288
I killed your mother.

175
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,257
I didn't shoot her,
but she's dead because of me.

176
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,658
Ressler...

177
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,293
I went looking for her after
you asked me not to and...

178
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,963
Ressler.
She isn't dead.

179
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,701
But you... I mean,
you... You told Cooper

180
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,569
that Reddington saw her
gunned down on the street.

181
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,472
She staged that
for Reddington's benefit.

182
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,047
So Reddington would
tell everyone she's dead,

183
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,381
and the dogs
would be called off.

184
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,716
But they're gonna
come back

185
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,718
unless she finds another way
to protect herself.

186
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:22,322
And until she does,
we can't tell anyone she's alive.

187
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,558
Did Reddington admit
that it was her?

188
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,062
Not to me, and I don't
want to admit it to him.

189
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,997
He must know
it's what I'm thinking.

190
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,465
So play dumb.

191
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,034
I mean, ask if it was her,
he'll say no,

192
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,868
and then it's done.

193
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,504
I don't know.

194
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,009
What's the munchkin
dancing in?

195
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,242
<i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

196
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,910
She's a lilac fairy.

197
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,812
Impressive.

198
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,016
I was in the chorus.

199
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,084
You danced?

200
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,953
In tights?

201
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:56,423
Well, that's an image
I'll never be able to forget.

202
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,724
You're welcome.

203
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,929
Play dumb. Smart move.

204
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,433
Hi.

205
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,836
What do you know about
antique nesting caskets?

206
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,372
- Can I ask you a question?
- <i>Some years ago,</i>

207
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,876
five colleagues and I
acquired a complete set.

208
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,944
Was the woman from Paris
my mother?

209
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,184
A kindly woman
comes into your life

210
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:29,157
and takes an interest
in you and your child.

211
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,060
<i>It's only natural
for you to make that wish.</i>

212
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,560
Was it her?

213
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,166
<i>I know you don't want it
to be true, Elizabeth,</i>

214
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,034
<i>but your mother is gone.</i>

215
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,140
Tell me about
the caskets.

216
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,575
Mine is a forgery.

217
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,811
The casket you stole
had already been stolen?

218
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,513
The irony is rich.
As is the forger.

219
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,749
If they fooled me,
they've fooled others.

220
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,784
So you want us to find
whoever's responsible

221
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,154
so you can get
your casket back.

222
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,956
Forged or stolen art
and antiquities

223
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:04,791
represent up to 10%

224
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,462
of an art market
valued at over $50 billion.

225
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,363
That's $5 billion.

226
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,734
<i>And, yes, I have a stake
in your finding this forger,</i>

227
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,703
but if they're as good
as I believe them to be,

228
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm giving you the tip
of an enormous iceberg.

229
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,112
Reddington actually
underestimated the problem here.

230
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,782
It turns out that up to 20% of the
art-and-antiquities market is made up of forgeries.

231
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,753
That's almost $10 billion worth of
counterfeits being passed off as real

232
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,455
to governments, museums,
and individuals.

233
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,957
$10 billion's
a lot of fakes.

234
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,325
Can it be
that easy to do?

235
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,194
These are great
pieces of art.

236
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,097
Forgers don't have to be great
artists, just great engineers.

237
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,798
- What do you mean?
- No matter how good a forger is,

238
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,800
he's basically
copying, right?

239
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,170
And there are technical ways
of doing that,

240
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,772
like camera obscura.

241
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,841
<i>By using mirrors,
you can project an image onto a canvas,</i>

242
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,377
<i>and if you project that image
in small sections,</i>

243
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,780
<i>you can essentially do a
paint-by-numbers masterpiece.</i>

244
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:06,386
Hey, Victoria, you here?
It's time.

245
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,258
Reddington and his pals lifted the
caskets from the Olympian Gallery.

246
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,691
So he's an art thief now.

247
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,627
He thinks that if the
person we're looking for

248
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,997
was able to forge one piece of art
there, he forged others.

249
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,698
Yeah, but there's thousands
of pieces in the museum.

250
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,833
Where would we start?

251
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,236
With a self-portrait
by Judith Leyster.

252
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,703
He thinks it's a fake.

253
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,572
Contact the museum
and see if he's right.

254
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,607
But before you do,
Agent Ressler told me

255
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,676
you've been hiding
something from us.

256
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,014
- He did?
- Yes, something very important.

257
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,781
Agnes is in
<i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

258
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,349
Wait, Agnes is
in <i>Sleeping Beauty?</i>

259
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,252
That's what he, uh...

260
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,920
He told you
about Agnes' ballet.

261
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:42,290
And how great he looks
in tights.

262
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,690
What can I say?
It's a gift.

263
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,559
We want tickets.

264
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,095
All right.

265
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,900
Ah, Victoria,
it's been too long.

266
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,636
You screwed me, Saul,
and I want to know why.

267
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,681
<i>We had the Olympian
Gallery test the Leyster.</i>

268
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:08,949
Reddington's right.
It is a forgery.

269
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,252
Using a spectrometer,
they were able to detect

270
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,420
<i>trace amounts
of a synthetic pigment</i>

271
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,224
that was invented
centuries after Leyster died.

272
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,425
Did they test the painting when
it was donated to the museum?

273
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,627
<i>Yes, and the painting
was everything it should be.</i>

274
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,562
<i>So when they hung the
portrait, it was the original,</i>

275
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,898
<i>and now it's not. Any idea
how they pulled that off?</i>

276
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,766
The trust is separate
from the company.

277
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,435
But the company funds it,

278
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,437
and now the funds
are needed elsewhere.

279
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,373
To pay for the lawsuits
to defend the indefensible.

280
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,774
Your father doesn't see it
that way.

281
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,178
My father
doesn't see it at all.

282
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,281
<i>Smoke level zero.</i>

283
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,116
I don't know what's going on,
but protocol is

284
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,617
- we should evacuate.
- <i>Please exit the building immediately.</i>

285
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,652
I'm not going anywhere until I
get the answers I'm looking for.

286
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,321
Uh, it's probably a false alarm.
You sit tight.

287
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,755
- I'll go check it out.
- <i>Smoke level zero.</i>

288
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,192
<i>Please exit the building
immediately.</i>

289
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,231
<i>Curator says that a year
after they acquired the painting,</i>

290
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,300
<i>they had a gas-line explosion
in the parking structure.</i>

291
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,668
Took out their security
system for the afternoon.

292
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,970
As far as we can tell, that's
the only time they were blind.

293
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:05,672
- <i>Did you pull the feeds?</i>
- <i>From before and after.</i>

294
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,308
<i>Park is
reviewing them now.</i>

295
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,343
Yeah, shut down
the elevators just in case.

296
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:15,815
<i>Please exit
the building immediately.</i>

297
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,324
Victoria?
What are you doing?

298
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,625
I was looking
for the bathroom.

299
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,960
I must've got
turned around.

300
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,795
Well, the boiler overheated.
Looks worse than it is,

301
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,398
but we need to evacuate.

302
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,466
<i>Please exit the building
immediately.</i>

303
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,435
I hope this doesn't
damage any of the collection.

304
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,138
Yes, that would be
a real shame.

305
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,487
Mr. Thornberry, your guest is
waiting at your usual table.

306
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,656
My guest?
I don't have a guest.

307
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,327
Your wife's ex-husband.

308
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,229
My wife
doesn't have an ex.

309
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:03,697
He said you'd say that.

310
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,632
He said you'd want
to be discreet.

311
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:15,176
Croft, I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

312
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,610
Who the hell are you?
And why are you telling the wait staff

313
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,047
- my wife has an ex-husband?
- No, no, no. No, I...

314
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,416
You understand.
I had to tell them something.

315
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,553
The truth would've been so
uncomfortable for everyone involved.

316
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,954
Ex-husband just popped
into my head.

317
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,990
I don't even know if you have a wife.
Do you?

318
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,028
Don't answer that. Doesn't matter.
Please, have a seat.

319
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,098
I took the liberty of
ordering us a few martinis

320
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,433
and the seafood tower.
You're not allergic, are you?

321
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,967
I'm calling security.
Joseph.

322
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:43,371
I thought we could
crack some claws,

323
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,606
get to know each other,
see what hobbies we have in common,

324
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,875
like, I don't know,
say, art theft.

325
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:52,879
Mm.

326
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,283
Don't fret.
I'm not the police,

327
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,052
and I'm certainly
not here to arrest you

328
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,953
for buying a painting
you knew was stolen.

329
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,456
Then why are you here?

330
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,025
To tell you
that I happen to know

331
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:06,793
that the FBI are aware
of the painting,

332
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,095
aware of the theft...

333
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,733
...of the painting,

334
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,903
aware of the sale
of the stolen painting.

335
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,907
But not yet
your whole part in it.

336
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,111
That's it?

337
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,081
- That's why you're here?
- Yes.

338
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,916
Well, and for a name...

339
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:32,986
Of the person
who sold you the painting.

340
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,587
And if I refuse?

341
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,991
Well, that would just
leave you and the FBI

342
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,660
and the painting.

343
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,463
Very awkward.

344
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,964
Very awkward.

345
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,333
Gentlemen,
your seafood tower.

346
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,135
Ah, magnificent.

347
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,570
Perhaps a couple of bibs
for the gentleman and me.

348
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,479
You know,

349
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,315
there are easier ways to
get more fiber in your diet.

350
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:02,450
Sorry?

351
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,287
Oh, uh, sorry.

352
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,756
Um, Elodie's husband had
a heart attack this morning

353
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,258
and was rushed
to the hospital.

354
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:12,892
I'm waiting to hear
how he's doing.

355
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,861
I'm so sorry.
That's terrible.

356
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,232
Can I ask you something?

357
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,102
Um, do you think
it's natural

358
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,504
when someone is suffering
as much as he is

359
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,272
to want them
to find some peace?

360
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,108
Yes, of course.

361
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,375
Do you think it's natural
to want that

362
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,643
when you're in the next room
sleeping with his wife?

363
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,912
Aram, we've talked
about this.

364
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,382
It's a very
complicated situation.

365
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,017
Not for Elodie.
If you'd seen her this morning,

366
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,186
you'd know that all she wants
is what's best for him.

367
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,887
We got the footage
from the museum.

368
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,557
This is from the day
the gas line erupted.

369
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,691
Check it out.

370
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,726
Once the explosion occurs,

371
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,330
all the surveillance
goes black.

372
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,065
Giving the forger time
to swap out the painting.

373
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,732
Yeah, we already
knew that.

374
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, but what
we didn't know

375
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,202
was that there
was a car parked

376
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:58,539
right next to the gas line,
and we hadn't seen this.

377
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,673
The gas-line rupture didn't
cause the car to explode.

378
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,010
It was the car exploding
that ruptured the gas line.

379
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,178
- Can we see it again?
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,015
The license plate's
blocked out by the column.

381
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:09,749
There's no video
after the explosion,

382
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,085
but, uh,
what about before?

383
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,319
How far back can you go?

384
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,889
There.

385
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,391
Run the plate.

386
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,400
Hello.
Now, who might you be?

387
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,203
Okay, the car's
registered to a Richard Vitaris.

388
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,437
I've got a Maryland address.

389
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,273
Park, Ressler, roll out.

390
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,642
Keen, Aram, see what
you can dig up on Vitaris.

391
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,045
I wanna know if he's the trigger
man, the forger, or both.

392
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:54,628
Sorry to interrupt.

393
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,063
Eagleton's appraisal
is done.

394
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,003
It's exquisite.

395
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,439
Wouldn't be surprised
if Anastasia herself

396
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:06,839
looked upon it in wonder.

397
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,342
So we have a deal, then.

398
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,077
If we can agree
upon a price.

399
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,548
I'll give you 900.

400
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:17,451
900?
Its market price is 3.2.

401
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,286
On the open market.

402
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,255
But on
the black market,

403
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,591
Faberge eggs
sell at a discount.

404
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,460
I'll take 1.2.

405
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:27,394
Victoria.

406
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,633
I shouldn't.

407
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,502
But for you, my dear,
I'll happily overpay.

408
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,743
The money's been wired.

409
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,082
Until next time.

410
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,820
- It's not enough.
- I know.

411
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,190
I talked to Kathryn.
She's buried in discovery.

412
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,125
She's had to hire
three more lawyers,

413
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,694
and that's before she's taken
a single deposition.

414
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,030
The other side's pouring
millions into its defense.

415
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,498
And when my next piece
is finished,

416
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:06,233
we'll be able to pour
millions into ours, too.

417
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,534
I promise.

418
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,672
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,773
You're the last person
I should be complaining to.

420
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,510
You have nothing
to apologize for,

421
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,145
not after what you've lost.

422
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,749
You know how much I
appreciate what you're doing.

423
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,252
I haven't done enough.

424
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:26,320
Not yet.

425
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,156
But that's
about to change.

426
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,667
Richard Vitaris.
FBI.

427
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,016
Mechanical drawings for gas and
electrical at the Olympian Gallery.

428
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,386
I got a ferry schedule for an
island off the coast of Maine here.

429
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,988
Architectural drawings
for an estate there.

430
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:05,025
So he hits museums
and private residences.

431
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,727
And law firms, apparently.

432
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,564
We have proof
it's Vitaris.

433
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:12,032
And we have motive.

434
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,933
Vitaris is the lead plaintiff
in a class-action lawsuit

435
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,704
against a pharmaceutical
company owned by the Fenbergs.

436
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,339
Now, if the lawsuit
is to be believed,

437
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,374
<i>then they are as bad
as the Sacklers...</i>

438
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,142
<i>Misleading the public
and the FDA</i>

439
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,078
<i>on how addictive
their drugs are.</i>

440
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:26,979
- Did Vitaris get addicted?
- No, his son did.

441
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:29,083
That's right.
After a football injury,

442
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,217
he was prescribed
painkillers,

443
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,086
got hooked,
overdosed a year later.

444
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,054
What does any of this
have to do with the forgeries?

445
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,255
The counterfeit Leyster?

446
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:36,923
The real one belonged
to the Fenbergs.

447
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,891
So did
Red's nesting casket.

448
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,394
We need to warn
the Fenberg family

449
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,329
they and their art
are being targeted.

450
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,832
Keen, Aram,
get to the Fenberg estate.

451
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,966
Ressler, Park,
bring in the evidence

452
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,636
<i>so that we can start
digging into Vitaris' plans...</i>

453
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,771
Past and future.

454
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,741
First, Vitaris
slanders me in court,

455
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,843
and now you're telling me he's
stealing from me, as well?

456
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,178
It appears so, yes.

457
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,280
All right, I've asked my
family to be here for this,

458
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:01,782
because they are every bit
the victims that I am.

459
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,916
This is my wife, Sue,
and our daughter, Victoria.

460
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,219
Have you
identified the thief?

461
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,653
We've identified a suspect,

462
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,422
but we're not sure
what role he played

463
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,257
or if he was acting alone.

464
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,159
We believe that he may
have an accomplice.

465
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,293
Have you identified him?

466
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,663
Not yet, but we will.

467
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,433
- You sound awfully confident.
- Yes, we are.

468
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,635
Well, please, come in.
Tell us what you know.

469
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:33,313
Counterfeits?
That's impossible.

470
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,982
Victoria manages our
family collection. She knows her work.

471
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,419
Every piece in our collection
has been authenticated.

472
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,387
The work you acquired
was real.

473
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,423
The forgeries came later.

474
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,825
The Leyster was taken three months after
you loaned it to the Olympian Gallery.

475
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,660
But you can get it back.

476
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,462
The suspect must know
where it is.

477
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,264
He may, but we don't
know where he is.

478
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:52,699
Well, how hard
can he be to find?

479
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,335
He's the lead plaintiff
in the lawsuit against us.

480
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,905
You'd think trying to destroy
us in court would be enough.

481
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,873
He lost his son.
I don't think he thinks

482
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,175
anything would be enough.

483
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,677
So you're saying we're
responsible for his loss?

484
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:04,878
You're taking his side?

485
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:06,946
No, of course
she's not taking his side.

486
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,315
Are you, sweetheart?

487
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,852
I'm just saying
it's a stressful time,

488
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,087
for all of us.

489
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:15,088
Tell us how we can help.

490
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,490
One thing you can do

491
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,091
is to go through
your entire collection.

492
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,227
Now, I know that is
a logistical nightmare,

493
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,162
but if you have
pieces on loan,

494
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:25,332
get them back,
and authenticate everything.

495
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,100
All right, you've told us
what we can do.

496
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,836
Now I'm gonna tell you
what you're gonna do...

497
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,504
Find Vitaris.

498
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,272
And if he has an
accomplice, find him.

499
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,274
And when you do,

500
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:36,310
despite my daughter's
misplaced sympathies,

501
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:38,846
I'm gonna use
my considerable power

502
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,715
to make sure they pay
for what they've done.

503
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,758
- You got my text?
- This... It's brilliant.

504
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,894
It'll be
our biggest take yet.

505
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:57,097
The FBI came to our home.
To warn us about you.

506
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,100
They searched your property.
It's... It's over.

507
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,636
Okay, hang on. We need that
money to keep the suit going.

508
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,972
They're looking for you.
You're going to be arrested.

509
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:06,673
Forget about the case.

510
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,076
At this moment, art handlers
are starting the process

511
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,079
of re-authenticating
my family's entire collection.

512
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,447
They're crating it up.

513
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,449
They're putting it
in secure storage.

514
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,451
There's no way
we can make the swap now.

515
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:23,223
Hear me out. What if there was
a distraction at the house?

516
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,125
Could you substitute
the painting then?

517
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,233
Elodie, hey.

518
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,301
Uh, what'd the doctor say?

519
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,736
Looks like
another blood clot

520
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,705
was blocking one of the
arteries in his lungs.

521
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,709
He... He went without oxygen
for a while, but, um...

522
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,244
But he'll live, so...

523
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,780
So that's good, right?

524
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,950
I don't know.
What do you think?

525
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,518
What do you mean,
what do I think?

526
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,320
It's okay.
If it makes you feel any better,

527
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,656
I was thinking it, too.

528
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,324
Thinking what exactly?

529
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:58,992
<i>That it would be better
if, you know,</i>

530
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,162
the outcome
were different,

531
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:03,463
if Charles had just passed.

532
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:05,532
No, that is not
what I was thinking at all.

533
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,833
Why would...
Why would you say that?

534
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,468
<i>Aram, if we're gonna
be together...</i>

535
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,571
Um, look, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

536
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:13,473
I have, uh, work.

537
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,342
Anything specific?

538
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,377
I just can't tell what's been
completed and what's planned.

539
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,047
There are no dates
on any of this.

540
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:21,015
Bank statements show
Vitaris is deep in debt.

541
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,116
He's gonna need to make
another score soon.

542
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,685
But what's
the next target?

543
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,420
Wait. I have
a lead on that.

544
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,124
Okay, so, looking at
the previous forgeries

545
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,693
from the Fenberg collection,

546
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,728
it seems that
the counterfeiter specializes

547
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,664
in replicating pieces from
the 19th century or before.

548
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,633
Now, according to
the Fenbergs' portfolio,

549
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,702
the only painting left
in their collection

550
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,704
that matches that description

551
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:47,374
is a Hoogstraten
worth $24 million.

552
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:50,510
That painting is hanging in their house.
We just saw it.

553
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,679
So, based on everything we
know, it's safe to assume

554
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,414
that Vitaris is going
after the Hoogstraten.

555
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,383
If Vitaris knows we're after
him, he may get desperate

556
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:58,452
and change his MO,
skip the paintings

557
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:01,154
and go after
Mr. Fenberg himself.

558
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,729
Mr. Eagleton. I'm sorry
to interrupt your ablutions.

559
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:10,897
Looks delightful.
But I'm in a bit of a rush

560
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,733
and have
some pressing questions

561
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:16,570
that can't wait
for your contemplative soak.

562
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,206
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my bathroom?

563
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,574
Who did you
buy this from?

564
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,344
I've never seen that thing
before in my life.

565
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,747
Maybe the bubbles
have addled your brain.

566
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,148
What are you doing here?
Get...

567
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:29,883
You can't be here.
Get out of my bathroom.

568
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:32,419
I love a good bath
as much as the next man,

569
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:33,854
but does it ever
get into your head

570
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:37,058
the idea that you're simply
soaking in your own juices

571
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,725
like a brining turkey?

572
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,694
- What?
- I digress. Doesn't matter.

573
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,031
Please, take a closer look
at the piece.

574
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,732
I know you've been fencing items
on behalf of a counterfeiter

575
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,702
who steals art
from the Fenberg family.

576
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,704
Well, that same
counterfeiter is responsible

577
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,240
for this
breathtaking forgery.

578
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,076
And while I admire
the accomplishment,

579
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,710
I prefer the original.

580
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,546
So the counterfeiter's name...
I need it now.

581
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,448
That would be suicide.

582
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:02,549
How apt.

583
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:11,059
Just give us a second.
It's the damn GFCIs.

584
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:16,730
This might tickle a little.

585
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,931
Okay, okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

586
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,366
Might even
make your toes curl.

587
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,069
Or not.
What the hell do I know?

588
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,136
Let's find out.

589
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:23,004
No, no, no. No, please. Stop.

590
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,938
The name.

591
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:26,573
Fenberg.

592
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,275
Victoria Fenberg.

593
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,243
You see? There it is.

594
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,611
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

595
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,480
Antony, let me ask you
a question.

596
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,149
Are you hungry?
I'm hungry.

597
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,050
Dembe, you hungry?

598
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:41,089
Okay.

599
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:42,622
Hop out.
Let's get cooking.

600
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,743
This is a violation.

601
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,845
It's only a precaution.

602
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,347
A precaution?
Do you see what's happening?

603
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:10,051
This Vitaris character
is dismantling our lives.

604
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,785
You sound surprised.

605
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,453
Don't start, Victoria.

606
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,089
His son died.
He's angry.

607
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,758
Then he can settle it
legally in a courtroom,

608
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,326
- but this is...
- He can't afford that.

609
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:22,029
How is it that you think
any of this is our fault?

610
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:23,797
We did not kill that boy.

611
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,533
And attacking us isn't
going to bring him back.

612
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,070
- Hello?
- <i>Ms. Fenberg, this is Agent Keen.</i>

613
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:32,006
I'm calling to let you know we're
sending units to your house.

614
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,341
- Why? What's wrong?
- <i>It's Vitaris.</i>

615
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:37,044
He's still at large,
but items in his home indicate

616
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,579
that he might be targeting you
and your family directly.

617
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:42,150
Targeting us?
Do you mean physically?

618
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,051
<i>We're not sure.
That's why we're sending units.</i>

619
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:47,121
All we know is Vitaris is
angry and has a vendetta,

620
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:48,655
and we don't want him
to act on it.

621
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:49,890
<i>We'll be there soon.</i>

622
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,292
<i>We'll talk more
when we're on-site.</i>

623
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,327
So I assume they're here
to protect us.

624
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,996
I'll get Mother.

625
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:02,569
We have to call it off.
They know.

626
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,205
- <i>Who knows?</i>
- The FBI.

627
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:05,839
They're on
their way here.

628
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:06,907
They think you're
targeting the family.

629
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,308
We have a plan.

630
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:09,910
Did you hear me?

631
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,079
The police are here.
There's no way we can get near the...

632
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,714
The police?
What's going on?

633
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,184
It's okay. They're here
for our protection.

634
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,252
Where's your father?

635
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,586
Uh, downstairs.

636
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,821
Go, go.
I'm right behind you.

637
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:25,892
You have to get out
while you can.

638
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,261
- We can do this.
- <i>No.</i>

639
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:28,395
Victoria, listen,

640
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:29,729
that painting,
it's our future.

641
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,565
- You have to go.
- <i>The plan remains the same...</i>

642
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:33,267
Get the painting,
sell the painting,

643
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,568
fund the lawsuit.

644
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:35,836
- We can't.
- <i>We can.</i>

645
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,437
- You have the forgery?
- <i>Yes.</i>

646
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,073
If they see you,
they'll arrest you.

647
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,707
- Exactly.
- <i>Richard, you'll go to jail.</i>

648
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,475
How else
do you think this ends?

649
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,945
With me going home to my son?
He's gone.

650
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,315
The only way to make sure
others don't die like him

651
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:48,249
is to see this through,

652
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,382
and to do that,

653
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:50,717
you're gonna make the swap.

654
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:52,752
Okay.

655
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:54,921
And, Victoria, thank you.

656
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:06,433
- Agents Ressler, Keen, FBI.
- Trooper Sharp.

657
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,568
Mr. Fenberg says his wife and
daughter are on the property

658
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,571
- along with four house staff members.
- Show me.

659
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,075
Help me gather these movers.
The Art Crimes Unit is en route.

660
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,309
I don't want any of this
leaving here

661
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:16,743
without them
cataloguing it.

662
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,747
Hey, what's going on?
Why isn't this crated?

663
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,649
Uh, you got police everywhere.
Is everything okay?

664
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:23,950
No, everything
is not okay.

665
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,752
The police want
everyone downstairs.

666
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,587
Right now. Go.

667
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:41,501
Sorry, ma'am.
Sorry. Sorry.

668
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,870
Hey. You.

669
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,772
Vitaris.

670
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,141
Ressler!

671
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,875
Gun, gun!

672
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,178
Hey! Stop!

673
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:54,981
- Stop! Stop.
- Put the gun down!

674
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,223
I'm not here
to hurt anyone.

675
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,025
Then put
the gun down, Richard.

676
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,430
It's over.
You're under arrest.

677
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,766
Why don't you go arrest
the real criminals,

678
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,734
the white-collar monsters
inside that mansion

679
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,536
who profited
from the death of my son?

680
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,705
We'll talk about it
after you put the gun down.

681
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,345
My son's gone.
They murdered him.

682
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,946
We know, Richard.
We're sorry.

683
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,381
But hurting someone else
isn't gonna bring him back.

684
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,548
Put the gun down.

685
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,064
You okay?

686
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,065
No.

687
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,700
Do you know
what he was after?

688
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,273
Thank God it's still here.

689
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,241
Keen, send the Art Theft
Unit to the living room.

690
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,542
We got it.

691
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:57,577
Don't you dare let that
painting out of your sight.

692
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,422
I know you don't
understand, darling,

693
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:09,923
but it's better this way.

694
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,658
It had to end this way.

695
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:14,395
I know, Daddy.

696
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:29,276
He stole the paintings to
finance his lawsuit against the Fenbergs.

697
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,577
Says he did
the forgeries, too.

698
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,313
Insists he worked alone.

699
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:34,115
He gave himself up
as a distraction

700
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,950
so someone else could
swap out the Hoogstraten.

701
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,353
If someone else did.
Do we have confirmation yet?

702
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:41,055
The painting's
being authenticated now,

703
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,790
but if he has a partner,
we have no idea who it is.

704
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:45,959
We searched everyone at the house...
Wait staff, security,

705
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,995
every box, bag, briefcase,
or purse. Nothing.

706
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,930
We offered him a deal.
He wouldn't budge.

707
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:52,999
- Guy's a true believer.
- Send him to lockup.

708
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,801
When he sees what his future
holds if he doesn't cooperate,

709
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,437
maybe he'll talk,

710
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,570
tell us who
he's protecting.

711
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,075
Prepare to be amazed.

712
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,675
I am bringing you
a masterpiece.

713
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,911
But this time,
no discounts.

714
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:07,547
Ms. Fenberg, please join us.
A waffle?

715
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,449
They're buckwheat.

716
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,053
- What is this?
- Just... Just hear him out.

717
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:13,220
Please, sit.

718
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:19,659
Have a waffle.

719
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:25,499
I love
a juicy family drama.

720
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:28,935
Greed, resentment,
betrayal, secrets.

721
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,105
And your secret? Oh, my.

722
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,773
Using the spoils
of your father's avarice

723
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,942
to bankroll
his destruction.

724
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:38,912
The tragedy
is positively Grecian.

725
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:41,082
- Who are you?
- A man on a quest.

726
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:42,516
Does this look familiar?

727
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,354
He knows, Vicky.
Just... Just tell him.

728
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,723
It's from
my family's collection.

729
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:53,327
Yes, but it's part
of a larger set.

730
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:56,063
I came to acquire this one
some years ago.

731
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,965
Imagine my surprise when I
learned it was a counterfeit.

732
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,802
But tell me, did you make
forgeries of all six boxes?

733
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,672
No, just the one.

734
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,274
It was my first test.

735
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:09,143
I wanted to see
if I could fool people.

736
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,977
Well, you certainly
fooled me.

737
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,979
Would you like syrup,
berries, or both?

738
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:14,948
I'm sorry.
I'm totally confused.

739
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:18,785
- Both, then.
- No... No, not about...

740
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:19,853
What is it that you want?

741
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:22,022
The original casket.

742
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,756
I want the name
of the person who has it.

743
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:28,095
Mr. Eagleton says that's the one
item of yours he didn't fence.

744
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:30,564
That's all you want?
A name?

745
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:32,199
Your father
is a drug dealer.

746
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,001
The fact that he deals
a legal drug

747
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,337
is no consolation
to the addicts he's created.

748
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,172
He's the villain
in this story.

749
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,806
Your efforts to bring him
to justice,

750
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:41,641
however convoluted, are,

751
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:44,044
as I've said,
admirably Oedipal.

752
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:46,480
Not only do I have
no intention of stopping you,

753
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:50,417
I believe we may find occasion
to work together in the future.

754
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,087
I am nothing if not
an avid patron of the arts.

755
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,256
So, please, a name.

756
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,294
Vicky tells me
that you're a collector.

757
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,596
Oh, just a dabbler.

758
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:06,133
I told Victoria
I didn't want to impose.

759
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,434
Oh, nonsense.

760
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,702
I love showing people
my collection.

761
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,839
Oh.

762
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,576
I'm sorry,
but before we start,

763
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,944
might I trouble you
for a glass of water?

764
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:20,247
Of course.
No trouble at all.

765
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:21,415
Thank you so much.

766
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,063
You have a good eye.

767
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,366
That's my
prized possession.

768
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,700
Is it?

769
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,136
Who would've guessed?

770
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,070
Cheers.

771
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,409
- You confessed?
- They don't know about you.

772
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,110
- Then I'll tell them.
- You can't do that.

773
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:51,711
I can't let you
take responsibility

774
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:52,946
for what I've done.

775
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,415
What you've done
is give me hope,

776
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,617
and you need
to keep doing that.

777
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:59,019
My only purpose in life
is avenging Justin's death.

778
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:00,421
The only chance
of that happening

779
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,456
is if you continue
what we started.

780
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:12,999
Visiting the enemy?

781
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,437
Yes.

782
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,305
I want to know where the
art is that he stole.

783
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:19,939
And you thought
he'd tell you?

784
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:21,642
I don't know what I thought.
I just know

785
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:22,942
I wanted to look the person
who did this to my family

786
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,678
in the eye.

787
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:26,680
The authentication came back
on the Hoogstraten.

788
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:27,780
It's a forgery.

789
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,450
Ah, I can't say
I'm surprised.

790
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,985
But you were there.
You must have some idea

791
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,021
who took it,
who his accomplice is.

792
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:36,023
I didn't at first.

793
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,125
I mean, we inspected
everybody,

794
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:40,227
bags and boxes,
cars, trucks.

795
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:43,464
No one we checked could've
possibly taken it.

796
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,366
And then it hit me.

797
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,668
See, there were three people
we didn't check...

798
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,271
Your father,
your mother, and you.

799
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:52,640
You think we stole
from ourselves?

800
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,974
No, no. I think you did.

801
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:56,510
The distraction he caused,

802
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,646
- I think it was for you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

803
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,880
To give you a moment alone
in the living room

804
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,717
to put the real painting
inside your briefcase,

805
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,052
the only one
we didn't check.

806
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,887
I think we're through,
Detective.

807
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,523
It's Special Agent.

808
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:12,959
And, yeah, we're through.
For now.

809
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:16,230
But you wanna look the person who
did this to your family in the eye,

810
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,564
you and I both know
all you gotta do

811
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:18,632
is look in the mirror.

812
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:22,236
I'll be in touch.

813
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:33,547
It really is exquisite
in its way.

814
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:36,849
It's exquisite because of
what you know about it,

815
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,951
where it came from,
who made it.

816
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,055
It's intellectual.

817
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,557
I like art
that's more emotional.

818
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,395
The forger certainly
played on our emotions.

819
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,829
The forger...

820
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:53,367
The one you found
and won't turn over to us.

821
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,571
The counterfeits are nearly
flawless, which is enough,

822
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:01,809
because our desire
for them to be real

823
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:04,244
obscures any imperfection,

824
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:07,481
much like your desire

825
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,783
for the woman in Paris
to be your mother

826
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:13,721
blinded you to the fact
that she wasn't.

827
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,291
It wasn't just my desire.

828
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,526
So she told you
she was Katarina?

829
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,628
She did.

830
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:24,531
And it's difficult for me
to believe she wasn't.

831
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:29,069
I was convinced my casket
was authentic.

832
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:32,506
It was nearly impossible
for me to believe it wasn't.

833
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,742
But it was a fake.

834
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:36,777
And she was, too.

835
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,647
Is that why
you gave us this case?

836
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,851
To show me how easy it is

837
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:45,519
to mistake
something that's fake

838
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:46,986
for something that's real?

839
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,155
No, I gave you the case

840
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:49,922
so I could get my hands
on the casket

841
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:53,827
and sell it for an obscene
amount of money.

842
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,329
You got it
just so you could sell it?

843
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:59,266
Yes. And the buyer is
apparently very impatient.

844
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,068
Is there somewhere
we can drop you?

845
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,670
We're wheels-up
in one hour.

846
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,774
Uh, you can just let me out
here at the end of the block.

847
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,609
Uh, wherever you're going,

848
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,144
I'd like you to be back
in time...

849
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:11,879
We'll be back
for the ballet.

850
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:13,380
Harold told you?

851
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:15,849
Harold thought
I'd like to know.

852
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:17,284
He was right.

853
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,490
You're amazing.

854
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,627
O-kay.

855
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,128
So are you.

856
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,097
Well, not really.

857
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,066
But you think so.

858
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,968
We think so about each other,
which is, well...

859
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,239
Amazing.

860
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:42,476
Great.

861
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,678
Now that that's settled,
do you want to come in?

862
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:46,513
No. I want to break up.

863
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,050
I don't want to.

864
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,520
I mean,
it's the last thing I want.

865
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,689
It's just, we should.

866
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:58,725
That is, we have to.

867
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,130
I don't understand.

868
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:04,598
What do we do
when we're together?

869
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,900
We trespass. We...

870
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,836
We crash weddings.

871
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,605
We break the law.

872
00:41:11,738 --> 00:41:13,273
We made love
in the Gemini capsule

873
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,375
John Glenn
took into space.

874
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,777
Exactly, yes,

875
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,780
which I still can't believe
how small it was, right?

876
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,550
Scratch that.
That's off-topic.

877
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,185
Okay.

878
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,888
My point,
such that I have one,

879
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:29,056
is this.

880
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,160
Making love in a rocket ship
is one thing,

881
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,929
one...
One amazing thing,

882
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:38,065
but, Elodie,

883
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:39,566
hoping your
husband dies,

884
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,604
there is nothing amazing
about that.

885
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,877
How is he?

886
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,378
He's on a ventilator.

887
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,182
I am so sorry.

888
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,583
So am I.

889
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,892
This is
a really bad idea.

890
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:29,509

1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,862
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:03,408
You know his identity.

3
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,556
I do.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,391
I know you're Ilya.

5
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:08,193
- Who told you this?
- Dom.

6
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,727
It worked.

7
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:12,085
Hello, Ilya.

8
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,432
Been a long time.

9
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:16,041
My nanny.

10
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:18,503
You put your granddaughter in harm's way.

11
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,238
You lied your way into my life.

12
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:22,040
Maddy Tolliver, your new neighbor.

13
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,908
You shot your father.

14
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:25,810
You've caused pain and suffering

15
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,845
for everyone I've ever cared about.

16
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,815
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't end this right now.

17
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,918
You already know the reason, Masha.

18
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm your mother.

19
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:39,023
She told me you lied to me
about who Reddington is.

20
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,025
It's over. She's dead.

21
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:45,096
Gunned down in the street
less than an hour ago.

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,688
- Raymond!
- I think we need to look at this event

23
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:48,869
as a wake-up call, Raymond.

24
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,293
Maybe you can get him
to listen to reason.

25
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,218
His life depends on it.

26
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,271
- Where are you now?
- On my way to you.

27
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,173
Where are you specifically?

28
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:17,841
New York. But I'll be there.

29
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:20,678
You haven't left? Are you insane?

30
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,248
Even I'm hearing about people
who want to put bullets in your back.

31
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:26,418
If you want my services,
you get to D.C. and now.

32
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,954
D.C., I know. The chess shop.
I'll be there at 9:00 tonight.

33
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,322
You'll never clear the airport.

34
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:31,657
I'm not going through the airport.

35
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,392
I contracted transport. Just be ready.

36
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,750
Passports, new names...
everything we talked about.

37
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:39,164
No. No, wait, please!

38
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:44,520
Mr. Merwin, what's going on?

39
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,240
NYPD!

40
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,063
Drop your weapons!

41
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:53,134
Mr. Merwin, what's happening? Mr. Merwin?

42
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,589
Mr. Merwin, hello?

43
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,777
Talk to me. What the hell is going on?

44
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,848
9:00 tonight, the chess shop.
Just be there.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,965
No phones. No talking.

46
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,927
What's in the briefcase?

47
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:16,920
Protection. From my clients.

48
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,988
It's what's keeping me alive.

49
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:21,140
Yeah. Well, now you have us.

50

51
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:40,264
What would I even say to you if I could?

52
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:43,890
I don't care who Reddington is,
his secret...

53
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:46,893
the one you lied to me about.

54
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,141
But the people who've died
to keep the secret...

55
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:53,031
Tom, Mr. Kaplan...

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,784
I did care about them.

57
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,245
I loved them.

58
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:04,010
And when they died,
a part of me died with them.

59
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:09,048
A good part here, a kind part there.

60
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:13,086
Until, after seven years,

61
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:15,622
I'm not sure what parts are left.

62
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:20,702
That's what Elizabeth Keen was
going to say to her grandfather.

63
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:23,057
But she didn't get the chance
to because, like all of you...

64
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,524
Our lives were put on hold
because of the coronavirus.

65
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,894
Back in March, we shut down production

66
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,662
halfway through filming this episode.

67
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:33,620
I remember I was wearing gloves
between takes,

68
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,301
and then right before we yelled "action,"
I would take them off.

69
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,125
Things were getting scary.

70
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,920
And, eventually, we finally
did shut down.

71
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,173
The entire city shut down.

72
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:45,438
But I thought it might be
for a few weeks, a month, even.

73
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:46,902
We might finish the episode.

74
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,935
And then it soon came to our attention

75
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,583
that we weren't coming back at all.

76
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,714
But, since then, with the help

77
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:55,891
of people working remotely
from their homes in cities...

78
00:03:55,915 --> 00:04:00,067
All the way from Los Angeles to London,
using our imaginations...

79
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,132
We've been able to complete the episode,

80
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:05,151
an unusual solution for a trying time.

81
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,912
Keep your distance.
Only go out when you have to.

82
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:10,385
And, um, make sure
you tell those that you love,

83
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,525
you love them.

84
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,361
I love you.

85
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,129
I know I speak for everyone on the show

86
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:18,693
when I tell you that we hope
that you are healthy and safe.

87
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:21,097
And we hope that we get to see you

88
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,998
on the other side of this very soon.

89
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,568
So, I can't wait to see it.
I can't wait to see what is now

90
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,371
the season finale of season seven.

91
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,474
And now back to Agent Keen,
as she imagines...

92
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,509
Telling her grandfather that...

93
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:37,493
I feel like a series of lights
have been turned off

94
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:40,530
and I'm standing
at the edge of this darkness

95
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:43,667
and that if I take one step closer to it,

96
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,837
if I lose one more good part of me,

97
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:48,230
I'll be...

98
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,796
transformed.

99
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,012
Your grandfather is doing better.

100
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,214
Please, tell me.

101
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:58,715
We've been reducing the sedation

102
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,483
and monitoring his brain activity.

103
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:03,320
Serial EEGs show the seizures
are decreasing.

104
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,834
His body is starting to regulate
the flow of oxygen on its own.

105
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,833
If you and Mr. Reddington approve,

106
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:11,079
I'd like to suggest we try
and bring him out of the coma.

107
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,590
- You think it's time?
- I think we need to be cautious,

108
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,399
but there's a chance
we could have him talking soon.

109
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,468
That would be nice.

110
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:20,337
Wouldn't it?

111
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:27,199
_

112
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,669
- Talk to me.
- Whoa. Wait.

113
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,237
Yesterday, you were outside my house.

114
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,428
The day before, you were
outside my daughter's school.

115
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,431
You're following me... for her.

116
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,934
Take me to her. Come on.

117
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:26,065
- Dom is off-limits.
- Thank you, Simms.

118
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,169
Did you hear me? Stay away from him.

119
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,304
And stop following me.

120
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:33,140
You gave me your orders.
Now I'll give you mine.

121
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:35,776
Don't pick Dom over me.

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,878
- Knowing what he did...
- What he did?

123
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,781
- You put him in a coma.
- Because he stole my life.

124
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,850
He trained me, and then he betrayed me.

125
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,852
I want my life back.

126
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,598
He won't give it to me.

127
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:51,489
After Koslov, the interrogation,

128
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,627
- when you went away...
- I went in search of answers,

129
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,563
and I found some...

130
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:58,265
why the Townsend Directive is after me.

131
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,945
Tell me.

132
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,906
Are you on my side?

133
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,117
I'm your daughter.

134
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:08,924
But are you on my side?

135
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,786
You know,
you say you want answers. Well, so do I.

136
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,155
When you're ready to tell me
yours, let me know.

137
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,646
Until then, we've got
nothing to talk about.

138
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:27,228
And stop following me.

139
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,515
Do you think she knows?

140
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,785
That her beloved mother is alive?

141
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,386
I'd have to say yes.

142
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,856
Which may mean she has taken
Elizabeth into her confidence.

143
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,759
Which means Elizabeth cannot be in yours.

144
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:56,267
- Are you all right?
- It's a beautiful day.

145
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,637
You and I are playing well
with each other.

146
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,906
And I have a case for you.

147
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,098
What do you know about the
killings this morning in New York?

148
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,246
I know four people were
left dead, including two cops.

149
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,849
New York Field Office
says it was a botched hit.

150
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,951
On an accountant for criminals.

151
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,752
He survived and escaped.

152
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,121
- The accountant?
- His name is Frank Merwin.

153
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,357
You want us to find an accountant?

154
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,492
No. I want you to find the men

155
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:22,862
who facilitated
the accountant's escape...

156
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,663
the Kazanjian brothers.

157
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,966
They provide security to criminals.

158
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,360
They're ruthless and entirely indifferent

159
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,463
to the carnage they leave behind.

160
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,133
Even the whisper of a contract
with the Kazanjians

161
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,602
can deter those with a vested interest

162
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,270
from attempting to intervene.

163
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:42,916
And you're interested in these
criminal escorts because...?

164
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,476
Because apprehending
the Kazanjian brothers

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,279
will take two bloodthirsty
killers off the streets

166
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,249
while pointing the FBI
to the last-known whereabouts

167
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:53,551
of any number of wanted fugitives.

168
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,087
That's why the Task Force
should take the case,

169
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,089
not why you're giving it to us.

170
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:01,848
The Kazanjian brothers...
Would you care to hear more?

171
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,229
Pasha and Nshan Kazanjian.

172
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,098
Conceived and born in prison,

173
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,267
the only children of a female inmate

174
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,003
held at the infamous Perm-36 labor camp.

175
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,271
Taken from their mother

176
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,872
and placed in a state-run orphanage

177
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,541
but raised on the street.

178
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,479
Today, they make their living
as muscle for hire.

179
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,630
Muscle... Like they're what,
bodyguards for bad guys?

180
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:26,233
Yes. Only these bodyguards
kill to protect their clients.

181
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:29,470
A missing Indian crime boss,
an exiled Thai politician,

182
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,939
an accountant who hides
millions for criminals...

183
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:34,341
all contracted by the Kazanjian brothers.

184
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,242
According to Reddington,
the bloodshed in New York

185
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,545
this morning was in service

186
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:40,368
of protecting their newest
client Frank Merwin.

187
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:42,683
Merwin is an MIT graduate with degrees

188
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,819
in quantitative economics
and financial mathematics.

189
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:48,189
He's a forensic accountant
who moves money for criminals

190
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,890
and criminal syndicates around the world.

191
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:53,465
Merwin's on the Bureau's radar,
but we've never made the case.

192
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,299
- So why hire the Kazanjians?
- Maybe somebody doesn't like the way

193
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,596
he's been cooking their books.

194
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,679
Reddington says Merwin is
about to go underground,

195
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:02,249
but if we get him first,
he can lead us to the brothers.

196
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:03,454
We have a lead.

197
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,880
Billing address is a
PO box in Logan Circle,

198
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,709
but last-known residence
is in Jarrettsville.

199
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,819
- Family?
- Ex-wife. One daughter.

200
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,689
Ressler, Park, talk to the wife.
See what she knows.

201
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,424
Keen, Aram, pull Merwin's financials.

202
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,225
See if we can find out
whose money this guy's hiding.

203
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,930
I need to ask you something.

204
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,421
- About what?
- Her.

205
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,469
Your mother had you followed? Why?

206
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:28,205
To get the answers she couldn't
by abducting Dembe's imam.

207
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,607
- Can you confirm that?
- She told me she did it.

208
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,276
She told you?

209
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,344
I made the tail, had him take me to her.

210
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,496
If you know where she is, Keen,
you got to tell Cooper.

211
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,848
He'll have her arrested.

212
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:40,183
Yeah, that's generally
what the FBI does to killers.

213
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,255
If I turn her in,
Reddington will get to her.

214
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:45,055
She's a wanted fugitive.

215
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,390
And so is he.

216
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,781
Yeah, but he's got immunity.

217
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,496
- Have you found him? Is he okay?
- We don't know.

218
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,108
We were hoping you could tell us.

219
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,153
No. I-I mean, yes,
but we're recently separated.

220
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:02,070
I have no idea where he is.

221
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,013
I haven't spoken to him
in nearly two weeks.

222
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,669
Last I knew,
Frank was traveling for work.

223
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,414
- But you knew he was in trouble.
- He's an accountant.

224
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,651
For criminals. We all know that.

225
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,620
And because of his work, he's in danger.

226
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,021
The sooner you are honest with us,

227
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:16,904
the sooner we can try to bring him home.

228
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:20,026
- He said he'd taken money.
- From a client.

229
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,695
He said he needed to leave,
and that was over a week ago.

230
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,265
Has his client reached out
to you, tried to make contact?

231
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,333
No. I don't know about his work.

232
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:29,169
He doesn't exactly tell me details.

233
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,871
- Hey, kiddo, it's me.
- Where are you, Daddy?

234
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,926
I'm... I'm out of town, sweetheart.

235
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,441
When are you coming back?

236
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,677
Um, I don't know.

237
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,380
- But it's gonna be a while.
- Before my birthday?

238
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:43,149
Sweetheart, I don't know
when I'll get to see you next.

239
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,753
But I need you to know
I love you very, very much.

240
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:49,155
- Give me the phone.
- No, please.

241
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,090
- My girl...
- Now.

242
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,593
- Mom?
- Oh, honey, what's wrong?

243
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:56,696
It's Daddy. I talked to him.

244
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,487
I'm gonna need to see your phone.

245
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:03,112
Guys, I got it,

246
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,271
a trace on the call that came
into Pearl Merwin's cellphone.

247
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:08,411
- Any idea where the call came from?
- A landline in Manassas...

248
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,704
the Whitmore Hotel.

249
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,882
All right, alert hotel security
and local PD.

250
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,584
Tell them we're on our way.

251
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,820
What if he gave us this case
just so the Task Force

252
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,399
would find her for him?

253
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:19,139
Because he knows you won't.

254
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,893
He doesn't know she and I are talking.

255
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,129
And she doesn't know
that he might've given us

256
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,897
a case that could lead him to her.

257
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,432
Which puts you right in the middle.

258
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,067
The last place I want to be.

259
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:31,902
Well, we gotta chase down this lead.

260
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:35,061
I know. I'm just afraid of what
we might find when we do.

261
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:43,447
- Birch.
- It's me.

262
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,549
- It's Merwin.
- What's going on?

263
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,618
That New York incident
is all over the news.

264
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,954
I need to move things up.
I can be there by 6:00.

265
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,423
6:00? No. I said 9:00.

266
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,725
I know what you said, but
there's been a change of plans.

267
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:57,695
I spoke to my daughter.
The feds were at my house.

268
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,830
- They know.
- Fine. 6:00.

269
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,143
Agents Ressler and Keen... FBI.

270
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,279
Kathy Guard. We spoke on the phone.

271
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:17,548
I printed a list of all our guests.

272
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:19,483
Frank Merwin wasn't one of them.

273
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,585
He look familiar?

274
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:24,722
No, I... What did he do?

275
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:27,124
Hey, you got a problem.

276
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,715
You got feds in the lobby
asking questions.

277
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,312
_

278
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,321
- Hey, what's going on?
- We're done here. Time to leave.

279
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,434
Let's go.

280
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,871
You. Hey, who were you talking to?

281
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,107
I asked you a question. _

282
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,114
My wife. Why?

283
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,478
Are you staying at this hotel?

284
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,647
Sir, answer my question.

285
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:53,317
Mr. Krupin's a guest. He has
a block of six rooms upstairs.

286
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,553
Upstairs where? Where?

287
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,355
They'll kill you both.
They'll kill all of us!

288
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,900
- Keen, you got a visual?
- Nothing yet.

289
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,864
Get more units here right now.

290
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:36,966
Ressler? It's clear.

291
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,567
They're gone.

292
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:54,202
FBI. Put your weapons down.

293
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,716
Let her go.

294
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,220
_

295
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,280
Toss your guns. Throw them,
or I shoot the woman.

296
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,755
_

297
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,040
I said toss the guns, or I kill her.

298
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,064
_

299
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,392
- Put it down.
- Put the gun down.

300
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,034
Put the gun down right now!

301
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:31,140
_

302
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,468
Katarina Rostova. Know her?

303
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,981
Maddy Tolliver? _

304
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,566
The Townsend Directive?

305
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,421
Oh!

306
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,590
Hold on. You need to hold on.

307
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,258
I need an ambulance.

308
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,561
Female gunshot victim. 2424 Salem.

309
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,292
You, come here now.

310
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,613
Yes, the Whitmore, 2424 Salem.

311
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,753
I want you to go to your room,
get towels, put pressure on her stomach.

312
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,809
So...

313
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,041
this is about my mother.

314
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:25,109
He didn't tell you he knows is her?

315
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:27,985
He didn't say he knows,
but he still told me.

316
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,487
With a look.

317
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,389
I'm telling you, they know her.

318
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,191
I was right to suspect
there's a connection.

319
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:35,527
Reddington's using us
to get the Kazanjians

320
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:37,095
so he can get to her.

321
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,998
Found this broken phone in the stairwell.

322
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:42,100
Can I see your lost and found?

323
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,802
Sure.

324
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:55,439
Last call was made
just before we arrived.

325
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,551
- An SOS.
- Or a warning.

326
00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:00,420
Either way, it was a call
to someone he trusted.

327
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,888
Get Aram to run a trace.

328
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,790
- Who are you calling?
- Reddington.

329
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,781
It's time to get out of the middle.

330
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,896
- Hey. We need to meet.
- I'm on my way to the restaurant.

331
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,566
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- With a break in the case?

332
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,668
- That depends.
- On what?

333
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:17,270
On how well you answer some questions.

334
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,141
Does Elizabeth have a lead?

335
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,911
I fear she has... a suspicion.

336
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:31,018
He was at the hotel
with the Kazanjian brothers.

337
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,951
They paid him to rent the rooms.
He doesn't know anything more.

338
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:37,031
But we were able to ID the
Kazanjians off hotel surveillance.

339
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,767
Have these been circulated?

340
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,603
To local and state police, every
airport, bus, and train station.

341
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,705
- They're not getting out.
- Why come in?

342
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,090
The man they're protecting
is from Maryland.

343
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,933
Why come here? What are
they looking for, or who?

344
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,981
Any news on the shooting victim
from the hotel?

345
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,439
Shot through the kidney.
She's in surgery.

346
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:58,214
Keen and Ressler... Have they
found anything at the scene?

347
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,273
A lead? Uh, yes. Well,
that is, I think so.

348
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,709
- Talk to me.
- It's, uh...

349
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,412
- Well, you know.
- No, Aram, I don't.

350
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:09,514
If I did, I wouldn't be
asking you, would I?

351
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,504
No. The thing is, is, uh,

352
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,991
m-maybe I should tell Mr. Cooper first.

353
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,727
This isn't happening. The name, Aram.

354
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:19,063
What's the name?

355
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:20,498
Stanley Birch.

356
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:25,858
Stanley Birch.
I need you to pay him a visit.

357
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,938
Stanley Birch.

358
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:30,474
- He runs a chess shop in Adams Morgan.
- Or fronts one.

359
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:32,777
The Kazanjians aren't taking
Merwin there to buy a chess set.

360
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,632
Roll out. If Birch has a record,
I'll have it pulled

361
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,581
- by the time you get there.
- Uh, sir, I, uh,

362
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:39,872
I may have told Mr. Reddington
about Birch.

363
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,198
And what possessed you to do that?

364
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,401
Uh, a desire to, you know, uh, live?

365
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,169
Get there. First.

366
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,014
In the back.

367
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,996
Just him.

368
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,131
I thought we had a deal.

369
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,933
We do, but we don't.

370
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:12,669
Dembe, thank Raymond for
the tip. I'm in his debt.

371
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,003
Let's go.

372
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,176
Who are you?

373
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,944
Let's go.

374
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:42,346
Sorry it took so long,
but there's nowhere to park,

375
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,958
and, apparently, the owner
is too cheap to hire a valet.

376
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,897
If we had a valet, you'd walk right in.

377
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,666
Without one, you park far away,

378
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,136
and by the time you get here,
you've worked up an appetite.

379
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,238
Admit it, you're a little hungry.

380
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,330
I am. For the truth.

381
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,133
Any chance that's on the menu?

382
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,734
Specialty of the house.

383
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:03,871
I'm never dishonest, only withholding.

384
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:07,040
I know you gave us the Kazanjian
brothers to find Maddy Tolliver.

385
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:08,775
I know you think she's alive.

386
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,745
And I know you know I'm not Ilya Koslov.

387
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,515
I'm past caring who you are.

388
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,885
Really? Then why hire a private
investigator to prove it?

389
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:19,853
We have a lead on the Kazanjians.

390
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,990
Stanley Birch...
The number from the hotel,

391
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,992
- it belongs to him.
- How do you know that?

392
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,760
We go back a ways.

393
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:29,663
Stanley could make a black
bear disappear in a snow bank.

394
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,432
Whoever is after Merwin,
they'll never find him.

395
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:34,701
- Aram told you.
- Sensing you wouldn't

396
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:37,004
bring the Kazanjian brothers to me,

397
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,306
I had to make alternate arrangements.

398
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,809
You sent Dembe.
He won't get there before Park.

399
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:52,986
- Back's clear. No sign of Birch.
- We missed them.

400
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,077
Have a local PD set a perimeter.

401
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,966
I gave you the case
to find Maddy Tolliver.

402
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,336
I think she's alive, and I think
she means us all harm...

403
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,041
you, Agnes, me, Dom, Dembe, his imam.

404
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,282
- Why?
- What difference does it make?

405
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:11,251
Does she have a reason to harm us?

406
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:12,719
Did you give her a reason?

407
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,421
I'm sorry, are you upset with me?

408
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,667
Yes, I am upset with you.

409
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,970
All of this is because of
whatever it is you did to her.

410
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,773
- Don't put this on me.
- We're only here because of you.

411
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,408
- That's not t...
- Whatever you did,

412
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,376
whatever happened between the two of you

413
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,378
- has put all of us in this situation.
- Please.

414
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,681
- Please. Please, don't raise your...
- You withhold information.

415
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,983
- You won't answer my questions.
- It's not... I-I don't...

416
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,518
Yeah, you've never heard
-You won't tell me the truth.

417
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,650
Me raise my voice.

418
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,255
But I'm trying to tell you,
this is not my fault.

419
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,857
Do you understand? This is not my f...

420
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,027
It's not... It's not my... It's...

421
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,164
It's not... It's not...

422
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,954
What is it? What's happening?

423
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:49,837
Reddington, can you hear me?

424
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,139
Is he all right?

425
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:53,007
Reddington, can you hear me? _

426
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,342
Reddington, can you hear me?

427
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,344
Someone should call 911.

428
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,012
I need a car. Yours. Anyone's.

429
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:59,647
We come by bus.

430
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:05,119
Are you still having me followed?

431
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,294
Get in.

432
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,665
The building where you
found me this morning,

433
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,067
we need to get him there now.

434
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,555
- Now you're following me, too?
- Simms, me,

435
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,139
both of us, others.

436
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,275
- It's a team effort.
- That doesn't make it okay.

437
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,710
You know I didn't have to help.

438
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:39,244
Take Fullerton. It's faster.

439
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:40,513
So why did you help?

440
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:42,047
Because he's important to you

441
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,982
and because he was once important to me.

442
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,851
I don't want him to die.

443
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,353
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,
it's... it's okay.

444
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:50,878
Y-You don't...
Uh, we're getting you help.

445
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,058
You nearly bled him to death.

446
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:54,960
For a truth that could save my life.

447
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,762
You know I have no idea
what's wrong with him...

448
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,897
a tumor, cancer. Indigestion.

449
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,066
I see him every day,
and I haven't got a clue.

450
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,670
You two, the truths you won't
share, the secrets you keep,

451
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:07,495
I'm tired of it,
of being caught in the middle.

452
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,086
Do you know what the Sikorsky Archive is?

453
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,990
Don't start, not unless you're
willing to go all the way.

454
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:16,125
- It's a blackmail file.
- I'm serious.

455
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:18,194
I'd rather hear no truth
than a half-truth.

456
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:21,297
It has compromising information
on very powerful people.

457
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,232
I've been accused of stealing it.

458
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:25,735
He knows I didn't.
I think he knows who did.

459
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,170
Which you want him to tell you.

460
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:28,838
That's the truth you're looking for?

461
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:30,339
This Archive?

462
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:32,308
There's a bounty on my head.

463
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,810
And there will be until I'm dead

464
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,511
or I can prove I don't have the Archive.

465
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,013
- Does he know that?
- Of course.

466
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:38,870
And he still won't say.

467
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,073
Can't you go any faster?

468
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,989
I didn't think you were
caught in the middle,

469
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,178
not after you saved my life.

470
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:49,848
It's complicated.

471
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:51,783
Seems simple to me.

472
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,324
I'm trying to save his life,
even though he won't

473
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,983
lift a finger to help save mine.

474
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:06,283
If I had a brother,
I would do anything for him.

475
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,053
You can make it stop
by telling me where she is.

476
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:13,813
Does Townsend know
that you faked Katarina's death?

477
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,171
No, he does not.

478
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:16,829
So he didn't send you.

479
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:19,421
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

480
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:24,639
But I know someone who does.

481
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:27,665
We faked her death for a cut
of Townsend's bounty.

482
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,691
We got our piece, but we still owe hers.

483
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,049
We're supposed to pay it
through an intermediary...

484
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:34,440
Wayne Otte.

485
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:36,933
We pay him, he pays her.

486
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,094
Which means he knows where she is.

487
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,198
Make it stop.

488
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,979
Soundtrack to "Skloni Hala Chalya."

489
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:59,581
Russian horror flick.

490
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,217
It's no "Gunga Din," but the screams?

491
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:05,153
Like 102 minutes of my Uncle Saul

492
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:08,290
passing a stone
the size of a Torah scroll.

493
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,915
I don't understand. My brother.

494
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,466
Hello?

495
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,702
What? When? _

496
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,737
I'm on my way.

497
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:26,567
Set a meeting with Otte. I want
to know the where and the when.

498
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,000
Or the next time your brother
screams will be for real.

499
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:34,638
I'm back. And I brought you company.

500
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:38,208
And questions... more questions.

501
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,410
More secrets.

502
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,743
The weaning is going well.

503
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,478
He could be up and around in no time.

504
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,470
So he's really on the mend. That's great.

505
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,051
- What about Reddington?
- We did an MRI.

506
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,952
He had a cerebral edema,
which we treated with...

507
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,580
Sorry, I didn't mean
what are his symptoms.

508
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:58,899
I meant, what's the cause?
What's wrong with him?

509
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,727
I, uh, can't say.

510
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:03,196
Because he told you not to?

511
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,201
_

512
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:12,963
I've had the most interesting headache.

513
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,766
Colors and images.

514
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,537
An acid trip but with pain.

515
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:22,373
I'm glad you can joke about it.
It terrified me.

516
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,842
Thank you for getting me here.

517
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,777
I had help.

518
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,479
Did you?

519
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,086
We were talking about her.

520
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,279
No. You were yelling at me about
her, and then you collapsed.

521
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,310
She's a threat. Or she was.

522
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,467
- Was?
- Wayne Otte.

523
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,436
He knows how to find her,

524
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:50,150
and I know how to find him.

525
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,641
Because Dembe got to
the Kazanjians first.

526
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,409
I should rest.

527
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:56,448
Right.

528
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,447
It'll be over soon.

529
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,126
I promise.

530
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,628
It's for the best.

531
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,601
That was a risk.

532
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,425
I need to know where Elizabeth stands.

533
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,898
So I put bait on the hook.

534
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,701
And if she bites?

535
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:17,792
Then I know she stands against me.

536
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,254
Take the win, Harold.

537
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,185
You tasked us to find the Kazanjians.

538
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,321
- We didn't.
- No. I did.

539
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,557
And Stanley Birch is gone.
That's not a win.

540
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,559
I'm not even sure it's a pyrrhic victory.

541
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:37,197
Frank Merwin has information on
hundreds of high-value clients.

542
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,899
He's keeping it in a briefcase
handcuffed to his wrist

543
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,202
as an insurance policy.

544
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:45,171
Find Merwin, and you find
his clients' secrets.

545
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:46,640
And the Kazanjians?

546
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,074
Frank Merwin.

547
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:50,944
The Black Oak helipad in Loudoun County.

548
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:53,980
You don't want to talk about it.
Fine. Then listen.

549
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,949
I've spoken with Elizabeth.

550
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:58,518
I know you're using the
Kazanjians to get to Maddy Tolliver.

551
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,388
I know she's alive, and I know
she's Agent Keen's mother.

552
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:03,723
I am also all but certain
that when you do get to her,

553
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:05,392
you intend on killing her.

554
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,028
And that, to be completely
clear, is a non-starter.

555
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:10,163
I'm serious. You can't touch her mother.

556
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:12,299
And I won't. You have my word.

557
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,733
Then what are you going to do to her?

558
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,535
The Black Oak helipad.

559
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,539
As one of my favorite people
likes to say, get there, now.

560
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:23,510
Why would he tell me about Wayne Otte?

561
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,378
Why let me know that
he could get to my mother?

562
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,314
Either because he trusts
that you wouldn't do anything

563
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,683
to stop him
or because he knows you can't.

564
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,452
But I can stop him,
and I think he knows it.

565
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,554
I can pick up the phone and warn her off,

566
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:36,089
tell her not to send Otte.

567
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,757
Forget about what he knows
or he doesn't know.

568
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,359
What you know is this...

569
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:42,517
You call her, and she lives.
You don't, she dies.

570
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,267
I need you two in
Loudoun County with Park.

571
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,868
She has the details on Frank Merwin.

572
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,403
You spoke to Reddington?

573
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:52,205
I did and told him your mother
was off-limits.

574
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,040
He assured me that he understood.

575
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:56,476
- He always says that.
- Do you believe him?

576
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,846
I don't know who to believe
or what to do.

577
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,682
You went to Reddington to find
your footing, to get out of the middle.

578
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,185
Then he collapses, and she saves him.

579
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,887
- What's your point?
- Well, my point is

580
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:11,358
that you got to decide between the
two of them, and I'm just wondering,

581
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,394
does the fact that she
rescued him tip the scales any?

582
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,802
Okay, I have to confess,
you completely fooled me.

583
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,905
I mean, I thought she was dead
as a beaver hat,

584
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,810
with the gunshots and dragging
her off and convincing Townsend.

585
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,880
To be honest, it didn't even occur to
me the whole thing was an act for me.

586
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:37,517
And what did I do? I bit like
a bass on a top-water lure.

587
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,287
It was clever. I mean,
really clever, guys. Bravo.

588
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:43,189
If I don't end up killing the two of you,

589
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:44,924
you should maybe consider the stage.

590
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,760
Everyone loves a brother act.

591
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,629
The Kazanjian Brothers...
so vaudevillian.

592
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:52,198
We set the meeting with Otte.
What else do you want?

593
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,667
- I want him to show.
- I told you, we set the meeting.

594
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:57,504
You're not the variable
I'm worried about.

595
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:59,461
Raymond, it's time.

596
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,944
I can feel it.

597
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:07,128
She's not with me.

598
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,826
- We're heading out.
- On my way.

599
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,761
He's on to you.

600
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,696
- Elizabeth.
- Reddington knows.

601
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,098
About you, the Kazanjians.

602
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,000
- Okay, back up.
- Let's go.

603
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:29,698
Uh, it's Agnes. She fell at school.

604
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:31,438
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

605
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,872
It's just I think she's scared.

606
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,707
You go. Take care of it.
Ressler and I can cover.

607
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:35,692
Okay.

608
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,362
He gave us a case,

609
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:42,048
which led him to the Kazanjians,
and, I don't know,

610
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:43,883
he must have threatened them
or something,

611
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,386
but they admitted that
they were delivering a payment

612
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,556
that was meant for you
to someone named Wayne Otte.

613
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,858
Reddington knows about Otte?

614
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:55,562
A fact he normally would keep
to himself, but he didn't.

615
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:58,865
He's testing me... us.

616
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,767
He wants to know if I'm helping you.

617
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,902
And if Otte doesn't show,
he knows you are.

618
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,404
Which I don't care about.

619
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:07,173
All I care about is
that if Otte does show,

620
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,909
Reddington will use him to get to you.

621
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:13,112
I got to go, but you got to call it off.

622
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,548
Otte cannot meet with Reddington.

623
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:20,987
- Hello?
- Where are you?

624
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,389
On my way to the Kazanjians. Why?

625
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,580
We may have a situation.

626
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,895
Hello, Mr. Merwin. This is Birch.

627
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,831
We need to move swiftly,
as time is working against us.

628
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:34,567
I have a car on its way to you now.

629
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:38,771
Inside, you will find all your necessary
documents and cash for your travels.

630
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,407
The car will take you to my custodian,

631
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:43,643
who will see that you make it
to your transport.

632
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,012
Our pilot will escort you to Dulles.

633
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,983
From there, a jet will take you
to Caracas and on to Madrid.

634
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,485
Box 724 at Banco Chamberi

635
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,588
has keys to the apartment
on Calle de Velazquez.

636
00:31:55,612 --> 00:32:00,159
Again, we must move quickly, as
the dibbles are closing in fast.

637
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,298
To the best of our knowledge,

638
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,066
the property doubles as a safe house.

639
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,302
Anticipate cameras and armed security.

640
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,638
Alpha Team, we approach
from the south here and here.

641
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:14,941
Bravo enters from the north
here, here, and here.

642
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,143
There you will find
all necessary financials,

643
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,979
along with the dossier on your education,

644
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:23,316
work, travel histories, and family life.

645
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,486
Safe travels,
and best of luck, Mr. Merwin.

646
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,622
Our driver will take you to the tarmac.

647
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:32,125
Edward will have you airborne
in a matter of minutes.

648
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,893
Thank you, Dembe.

649
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,828
Bravo Team,
we've got a visual on the chopper.

650
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:37,997
It's got to be his exfil. We move now.

651
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,499
Go, go, go!

652
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,904
- Clear. We have location confirmed.
- Move, move!

653
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:57,383
- Stop! FBI!
- Hold it!

654
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,619
Turn around, put your hands in the air!

655
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,455
- Hands!
- Stop! Stop moving.

656
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,991
- Hey, let me see hands!
- Get on the ground!

657
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,627
I said, get down!

658
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,029
What's in the briefcase?

659
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:12,565
Put the briefcase down.

660
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,889
I'm not gonna minimize how
serious this latest incident was

661
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:38,725
or that it's your second one this month.

662
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,060
But adjusting the meds
should take care of the tremors.

663
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:43,429
Other than that, my prescription is rest.

664
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:44,625
And honesty.

665
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:46,874
Are you my doctor or my conscience?

666
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:48,768
Liz asked about your condition.

667
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,536
I think it's unhealthy to keep it secret

668
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,372
from the people who care about you.

669
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,707
In my position, it's not easy to know

670
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:57,210
who cares and who wants
to cut your throat.

671
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:01,436
Tell me.

672
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:05,284
Raymond, he showed.

673
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:07,387
Otte... He's here.

674
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,355
She didn't warn him off.

675
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:12,705
You have the account number?

676
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:23,736
She wants 75 grand to go
to the first account.

677
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,972
The balance goes to the second.

678
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,935
You underestimated Elizabeth.

679
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,661
She's on your side after all.

680
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:45,927
There's no point in staying silent.

681
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,379
Our agents are reviewing the documents
we recovered as we speak.

682
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:51,408
We will make a case against you.

683
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,967
In that case I'm not sure
you are so worry about.

684
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,300
We are not worry.

685
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:56,825
We just want to let you
know that we are working

686
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,894
to put you behind bars
for as long as is possible

687
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,978
If you cooperate, that couild change.

688
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:04,185
Do either of you think that I'm
really worried about your case?

689
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,250
- You are in prison Frank.
- For a while.

690
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,206
I'll get a few years.

691
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,273
Good behavior, early parole,

692
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,570
but soon enough I'll be out,
you know why?

693
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,640
Because I'm very, very good in what I do.

694
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,005
Hmm. And yet you're here with us.

695
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:22,509
The only way you'll be able to
link me to any criminal wrongdoings

696
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:25,512
is through any shred of
financial data you may recover.

697
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:28,114
But what you don't seem to understand

698
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:32,786
is that I move money
for incredibly powerful people.

699
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,088
Yes, some are cartels

700
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:37,190
and hit men and white-collar criminals.

701
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:39,993
Who want you dead
because you stole from them.

702
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:42,462
But I also represent corrupt cops,

703
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:45,398
dirty politicians, judges for sale.

704
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:48,034
All these people want to protect me,

705
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,769
not because they care about me,

706
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,693
because they care about themselves.

707
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,573
I think we're done here.

708
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:55,642
Yes, I agree.

709
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:59,279
But remember, I know you feds
aren't all as squeaky clean

710
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,601
as you want the world to believe.

711
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,018
What's that supposed to mean?

712
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,487
Probably nothing for either of you.

713
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,622
You're by the book, aboveboard.

714
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:13,415
I'm sure there's no way my
arrest can implicate either of you.

715
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:15,884
So, yes.

716
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,231
Yes?

717
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:21,089
Yes. We're finished here.

718
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,408
Otte gave you an account number?

719
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,755
Two, actually.

720
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,324
Of her share of the bounty,

721
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:47,026
$75,000 was transferred
to the first account.

722
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,729
The rest went to her personally
at the second number.

723
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,198
So she's paying someone.

724
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:54,901
- Otte didn't know who.
- And the Kazanjian brothers?

725
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,637
Chuck and Morgan took them for a drive.

726
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:06,913
Elizabeth, I have a lead.

727
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:09,249
You do? Tell me what happened.

728
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:10,583
Otte happened.

729
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,752
Otte? He showed?

730
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,220
You sound surprised.

731
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,089
No, I'm just...

732
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:17,657
Was he helpful?

733
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:19,512
Tell me about Merwin.

734
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,018
He refuses to cooperate.

735
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:26,232
Otte... Was he helpful?

736
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:29,369
Yes. Very. Thanks to you.

737
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,104
I didn't do anything.

738
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,360
No, but you could have.

739
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:38,545
To be honest, I thought you
would call her, take her side.

740
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,617
But you didn't. You took mine.

741
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,745
Well, I...

742
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,887
How you feeling?

743
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:52,992
Happy as a seagull with a french fry.

744
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:59,699
I don't understand. I warned you.

745
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:02,101
- Yes.
- I told you Reddington knew about Otte

746
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,404
- and to call off the meeting.
- You want to know why I didn't.

747
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:07,073
No, I want you to know what
happened because you didn't.

748
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:08,808
Otte gave Reddington a way to find you.

749
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:10,777
- I'm sure he did.
- Because you let him.

750
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:13,335
Which I did because
I'm sure you were right.

751
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,570
It was a test.

752
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:19,118
To see if you were really in the middle.

753
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:22,310
If I'd warned Otte off, Raymond
would know that you weren't.

754
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,491
Sure, Otte gave him intel
on how to find me,

755
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:28,494
but I know that
and can defend against it.

756
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:30,709
But what Raymond doesn't know...

757
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,656
is that you're not in the middle.

758
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,221
Are you?

759
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,646
I'm on your side.

760
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,155
And he can't defend against that.

761
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,969
_

762
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,788
Everything okay?

763
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,082
Yeah.

764
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:14,921
Everything's good.

765
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:32,859
Hey. Doctors say you're
gonna wake up soon.

766
00:39:37,187 --> 00:39:38,568
When you do,

767
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:42,735
I need you to know
the person who did this to you,

768
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:46,628
my mother, I'm on her side now.

769
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:48,875
I'm committed to helping her

770
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:51,277
find the truth she's looking for.

771
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:55,782
Anyone who is in her way is in my way.

772
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:57,921
That includes you.

773
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,176
And that includes Reddington.

774
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:05,678
It's strange.

775
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,494
I was afraid earlier

776
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:12,131
of that darkness I was telling you about.

777
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:14,334
I've always feared it.

778
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:16,336
Ever since Reddington entered my life,

779
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,908
I've worried that his darkness
might somehow overtake me,

780
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:26,234
that it might just swallow me whole.

781
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,818
But now that I'm here, I'm not afraid.

782
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:35,421
In fact, I embrace this part of me

783
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:38,878
and wherever it takes us
on our way to the truth.

784
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:45,198
You and me and Reddington,
I'm at peace with that.

785
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,967
I embrace that.

786
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:50,759
I consider it my destiny.

787
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,345
Mother, it's me.

788
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,581
I'm ready.

789
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,527
- Hey, "Blacklisters."
- Thank you so much for tuning in.

790
00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:16,662
- We hope you enjoyed it.
- I just want to say thank you so much...

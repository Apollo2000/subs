1
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:04,460
Say "DC"!

2
00:00:05,677 --> 00:00:06,877
How's that one look?

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,406
Oh, I'm sure it's fine, hon.

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,974
Oh, you say that, and then my eyes

5
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,409
aren't open, or my hair's in the...

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,944
No, it's a keeper.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,946
Definitely one for
all that new wall space.

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,414
- Ahh!
- Hm. I have a feeling

9
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,516
we're not gonna spend
much time in the new place.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,052
Greg, I thought you were retiring.

11
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,353
Are you still going to fly?

12
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,322
Well, not as a pilot. As a passenger.

13
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,790
Ah. I get a little itchy

14
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,058
if I'm in one place for too long.

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,426
- I hear you.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,261
He wants to see the world,
friends be damned.

17
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,663
- Yeah.
- As if we had any.

18
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,997
We hardly knew the neighbors.

19
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,599
Well, you have each other.

20
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,134
What other friends do you need?

21
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,136
You know, I have a few items
for you to sign.

22
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,938
- Should we go inside?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

23
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,175
Your things will be
waiting for you safely

24
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,810
when you arrive in DC.

25
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,445
Thank you.

26
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,414
You have made this a cinch.

27
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,949
Yeah, Stella. Thank you, really.

28
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,384
As we say at Orion, good luck...

29
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,953
- Oh!
- ...wherever fate takes you.

30
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,554
Yes!

31
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,856
Ohh!

32
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,699
I have secured your match.

33
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,701
She's retired, no family.

34
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,103
He's a former airline pilot.

35
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,738
They lead very quiet lives...

36
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,618
and they are moving to DC this week.

37
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,878
So, we have names.

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,947
Yes. Madeline Tolliver
and... Gregory Flynn.

39
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:24,883
Madeline.

40
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,918
Like the children's book. How sweet.

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,186
I'll be in touch.

42
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,121
Yes. Thank you.

43
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,924
Well, Berdy, it appears you
and I are going to be neighbors

44
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,037
with Miss Keen after all.

46
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,103
Come on, munchkin! Hurry!

47
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,672
The Saltmans are waiting! Again.

48
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,940
Carpool drama?

49
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,211
Punctuality is not her strong suit yet,

50
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,747
but she could write a book
on transitional objects.

51
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,935
I mean, she won't go anywhere without it.

52
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,985
- Is that right?
- I'm gonna see her off,

53
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,655
but I'll be back in a sec if you
want to come by for coffee.

54
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:06,090
The doll has the mic in it.

55
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,393
Now how are we gonna
get our Intel? And...

56
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,262
Please don't say from Dr. Quakenstein.

57
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,731
Skovic's methods are unconventional,

58
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,266
but they're effective.

59
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,602
He'll get Ilya to talk,
and when he does...

60
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,538
we'll have all the Intel we need.

61
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,674
Are you familiar with RMT, Mr. Koslov?

62
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,218
Recovered Memory Therapy?

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,621
It's quite, uh, unconventional.

64
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,825
Some would even go so far
as to call it junk science,

65
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,328
but I believe it is the future.

66
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,100
And it is also our way into the past.

67
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,845
Uh, for your session,
I will be using a cocktail

68
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,481
of pharmaceuticals and hypnotherapy

69
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,651
to place you in a lucid
waking dream state.

70
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,820
Mmm.

71
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:13,458
There are, of course... risks,

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,461
but that is why we will
be keeping you sedated.

73
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,393
Now, your friend would like...

74
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,802
for you to go back to 1991.

75
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,025
Let's go back...

76
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,276
to the day when Katarina Rostova

77
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,863
reached out to you...

78
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,657
let you know she was alive.

79
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,219
Perfect timing!

80
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,353
For what?

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,389
Coffee. I was, uh...

82
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,191
Sorry. I was expecting someone else.

83
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,545
Oh.

84
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,064
Well, we wouldn't want good
coffee to go to waste, would we?

85
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,269
I don't know how, but that woman...

86
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,104
stayed well ahead of me.

87
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,639
She got to Steinhil,

88
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,242
she's apprehended a dear friend of mine.

89
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,778
You said she's after certain information.

90
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,579
Does he have it?

91
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,448
He does.

92
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,950
And she'll do most anything
to get it from him.

93
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,852
You don't have to do this.

94
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,121
I'm afraid I do, love.

95
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,757
We have very little time,

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,493
but thanks to her hawaladar,
we have a lead.

97
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,430
Orion Relocation Services.

98
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,498
She paid them to give her a new identity,

99
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,334
a new home, new life.

100
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,769
I don't know where she is or
who she's pretending to be,

101
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,240
but Orion Relocation Services, they do.

102
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,410
Who is she... the woman in Paris?

103
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,880
You still haven't told me her name.

104
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,984
The man she's taken,
he's like a brother to me.

105
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,486
I deserve to know.

106
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,890
She's going after
the people you care about.

107
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,393
She's hurting your friend.

108
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,762
If she can hurt him, she can hurt us.

109
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,698
Did something happen?
Were you threatened?

110
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,968
I thought the FBI had you
under protective surveillance.

111
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,807
This company...
Orion Relocation Service...

112
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,586
tell me about them.

113
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,079
Until now, Reddington's heard whispers,

114
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,848
ghost stories about the people

115
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,883
who helped the worst
of the worst disappear...

116
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,618
assassins, traitors,

117
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,453
the woman who abducted him in Paris.

118
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,357
We find them, he finds her.
How convenient... for him.

119
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,860
Yes, he gets what he wants,
but in exchange,

120
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,696
we get to ID criminals Orion
has hidden in plain sight.

121
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,831
And arrest a company of murderers.

122
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,468
Orion doesn't just give
their clients fake IDs.

123
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,836
They kill innocent people

124
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,738
and give their identities
to their clients.

125
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,074
So if Reddington
already knows Orion's name,

126
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,575
why can't he find them himself?

127
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,346
"Orion" is a DBA, a financial
shell he can't crack.

128
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,215
What he does have is a name,
one of Orion's clients,

129
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,418
a thief looking for a new
identity... Sofia Burke.

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,953
I need to escape,
go where I can't be found.

131
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,956
Believe me, where I'm sending you,

132
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,459
no one will ever look.

133
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,127
All right. Burke's a jewel thief.

134
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,997
Milan. Hong Kong.
The Tel Aviv Diamond Exchange.

135
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,832
Now, her whereabouts are unknown,

136
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,934
but it looks like
her partner took the fall

137
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,036
when they tried to steal
the Dresden Green,

138
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,105
the world's largest green diamond.

139
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,108
Appears he's awaiting trial
at the MDC in Brooklyn.

140
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,876
Maybe that's why she wants a new ID.

141
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,512
She's worried this partner
is gonna flip on her.

142
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,414
Let's hope she's right.

143
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,450
Take Park to Brooklyn and find out.

144
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,689
Agent Keen.

145
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,892
So, uh, this came for you
through the Hoover Building.

146
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,335
Okay. Agnes said she saw

147
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,351
a dead body in the park the other day.

148
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,306
Oh, my God. That... That
must have been terrifying.

149
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,708
Yeah. S-She was pretty shaken up.

150
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,443
Her nanny didn't see anything,

151
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,612
but there was
a birthday party in the park,

152
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:57,048
and the Park Department gave me the name

153
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,983
of the family who rented the field.

154
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,418
- Did they see anything?
- The mom did,

155
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,187
but she was too freaked out
to make a positive ID.

156
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,856
So I'm hoping I can get one

157
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,991
from the video of
the birthday party here.

158
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,263
Hang on. Hang on. There.

159
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,065
Go back.

160
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,139
He's carrying.

161
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,141
Any idea who they are?

162
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,044
No, but I'm gonna find out.

163
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,107
Ilya...

164
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:41,025
I know your instinct
will be to fight, but...

165
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,463
I want you to know
the harder that you fight,

166
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,565
the more relaxed you will become.

167
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,601
The more you fight,
the more you surrender.

168
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,272
It's as if you are floating.

169
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:58,670
And as you float,
all that fight escapes you.

170
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,413
It floats, too. Floating away.

171
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:06,384
I want you to breathe in...

172
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:08,805
and out.

173
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,289
In...

174
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,519
And out.

175
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:19,623
Making the image of yourself
more present, more clear.

176
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,301
Focus on that image of yourself.

177
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,447
It's not you today.

178
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,073
It's you in 1991.

179
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,161
A young man.

180
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,145
On the day you learned

181
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,916
Katarina Rostova was still alive.

182
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,794
Look at yourself...

183
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,631
as that young man.

184
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,467
Can you see him, Ilya?

185
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,762
He's there.

186
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,728
He's you.

187
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,532
I'm going to ask you to open your eyes,

188
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,701
and when you do...

189
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:01,539
the image of that young man
will become incredibly clear.

190
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,509
You're going to open your eyes now.

191
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,988
Are you ready?

192
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,866
Three...

193
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,160
two...

194
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,752
one.

195
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,324
Is it clear enough
for facial recognition?

196
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,058
Aram says no.

197
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,928
I've circulated the image
to every FBI office worldwide

198
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,863
to see if anyone can ID the man.

199
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:34,699
Three operatives, a dead body, and Agnes.

200
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,601
I wish I believed that
could be a coincidence.

201
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:38,103
If these guys work for the woman

202
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:40,171
who abducted Reddington,
then who's the dead man?

203
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:43,007
And if the dead man works
for her, then who killed him?

204
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,542
We can't know until we find Burke.

205
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,144
Did her partner give us a lead?

206
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,480
He gave us the name of the man
who fences her jewels.

207
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:49,681
Richard Potash.

208
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,253
Yes. Liquidate everything.

209
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:59,190
Accounts, stocks, T-bills.

210
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:01,092
Reddington knows Potash by reputation

211
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:03,128
and gastronomic preference.
It seems there's an

212
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,130
underground restaurant scene,
and he frequents it.

213
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:07,365
- Reddington's meeting him there.
- Then so am I.

214
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,634
If he can lead us toward anyone involved

215
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,554
in sending those men after my
kid, I want to hear it first.

216
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:19,878
Oh, my.

217
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,915
I must say, I'm very intrigued.

218
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,652
I bartered a long weekend at
my pied-à-terre in Montmartre

219
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,888
for the invitation plus-one.

220
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,324
This chef, Rasmus Ray,

221
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:36,227
is something of an outlier
in food circles.

222
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,396
No restaurant, no menu.

223
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:41,266
Plenty of youthful innovation.

224
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,269
Apparently he only hosts these dinners

225
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,137
when inspiration strikes,

226
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,639
which bodes well for our evening.

227
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:50,608
I'm only interested
in finding Burke's fence.

228
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,345
Ah. Colonel.

229
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:57,048
Looking dashing, as always.

230
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,516
Who's that?

231
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,452
Just some colonel.

232
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,423
I believe that that's our fence.

233
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,863
Mr. Potash.

234
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,833
I hear you're the man
to see about a thief.

235
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,167
Pardon me? Do I know you?

236
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,670
Not yet, but we're
about to make each other

237
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,606
- unholy amounts of money.
- Are we, now?

238
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:23,708
I don't know how to make any other kind.

239
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,577
Raymond Reddington.

240
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,445
The Raymond Reddington?

241
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,781
And this is the Lydia Dart.

242
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,350
- A friend and client.
- As well as an art lover.

243
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:34,652
I understand you dabble in art yourself.

244
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:36,888
I've been said to have resources.

245
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,424
What might it be that
you're looking to acquire?

246
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:44,195
Fellows, gals, non-binary pals.
I'm Chef Rasmus Ray.

247
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:45,830
Welcome to Comestible.

248
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:47,265
Please have a seat.

249
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:55,306
In food, our eyes betray us.

250
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,641
With visual cues.

251
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,343
With predisposed expectations

252
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,845
of color and... and texture.

253
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,081
The brain is...
is programmed to choose food

254
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,750
that will give our bodies
the greatest nutrients.

255
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,752
The vibrant greens of vegetables,

256
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:09,721
the rich reds of meat.

257
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,056
To counter this, the brain rejects food

258
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:14,025
it perceives as dangerous...

259
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,360
spotted, softening fruit,

260
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,062
strong-smelling fish, discolored meat.

261
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,765
When you avoid something on your plate,

262
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:24,936
chances are you're avoiding it
because of a past experience.

263
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:27,271
But... tonight...

264
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:30,008
we dine without prejudice.

265
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,645
Tonight we dine on pure flavor.

266
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,814
Tonight we dine...

267
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:37,982
in the dark.

268
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,953
Is this for real?

269
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,956
Well, it certainly just got interesting.

270
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,160
Ilya?

271
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,597
Ilya, can you hear me?

272
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,700
Yes.

273
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,036
Can you tell me what you see?

274
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:03,141
I see her.

275
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,878
With me.

276
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,950
How do you feel?

277
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,721
I'm relieved.

278
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:18,723
I thought she was gone.

279
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,992
I went into the ocean to end my life.

280
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:23,294
I heard about Cape May.

281
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:26,539
The drowning. Her suicide.

282
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,666
But there was no suicide.

283
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:32,103
No. No.

284
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:34,706
Do you remember what happened that night?

285
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,425
She made contact at the embassy.

286
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,444
The world thinks you're dead.

287
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:41,813
I thought they were dead.

288
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,549
- We did the right thing.
- I've nothing but love for you.

289
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:51,189
She was in trouble. She needed help.

290
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,657
What trouble?

291
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,394
Tell me about the trouble.
You helped her, right?

292
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:58,429
She was being hunted.

293
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,932
By the KGB.

294
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,451
The Cabal.

295
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,037
The Americans.

296
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:10,942
Her father helped get us out of Russia.

297
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,877
- But it wasn't enough.
- I am marked.

298
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,446
She needed to disappear.

299
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,081
Needed a plan.

300
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,317
Tell me about that plan.

301
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,788
You're losing him.

302
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,990
He's resisting the memory.

303
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:29,160
Ilya? The plan.

304
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,463
Tell me what you remember
about that plan.

305
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:35,166
- No one knows.
- Impossible.

306
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,944
A fugitive and traitor to his country.

307
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,406
Reddington's dead.

308
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,211
I don't think you're entirely
grasping what I'm suggesting.

309
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:52,784
What are you suggesting?

310
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,520
Becoming Reddington.

311
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:58,523
Purposefully stepping
into the shoes of a man...

312
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,558
and destined to be condemned
as a traitor.

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,360
But how?

314
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,928
That would be impossible.

315
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,863
What if it's not?

316
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,965
We devised a plan to steal the money

317
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:12,370
used to frame Reddington...
and disappear.

318
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:15,907
But the plan, it didn't work.

319
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,946
Not like we thought.

320
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:26,584
No. Help me to remember.

321
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,411
The plan.

322
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,122
Who did it involve?

323
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,562
It was myself...

324
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:39,922
Katarina...

325
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,334
Dr. Koehler.

326
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:45,369
And the person under the knife...

327
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,371
the man who walked into the banks

328
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,240
and impersonated Reddington...

329
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:51,476
tell me what you remember about him.

330
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,683
He's guarding the memory.

331
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,685
Even in this state,
he knows there is a secret

332
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,086
he should not reveal.

333
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,621
Who was impersonating him, Ilya?

334
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,456
- Stop! I need to bring him out.
- No! Not yet.

335
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,158
No. His blood pressure's
through the roof!

336
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,061
- I need to push Lidocaine.
- Then stop! Let him rest.

337
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,497
But we are not bringing him out.

338
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,774
I think dining in the dark

339
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:24,876
probably does enhance the senses.

340
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,911
Is annoyance a sense?

341
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,346
For the next dish...

342
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:31,916
brandywine tomatoes with a Dungeness crab

343
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:34,786
and a seaweed-lemon granité.

344
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,988
I understand that Sofia Burke

345
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,791
made a run at the Dresden Green.

346
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,592
She tried and failed.

347
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,961
Mm! Château d'Yquem.

348
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,664
My uvula is positively quivering.

349
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,633
We want her to try again.

350
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,535
You can get in touch with her. We can't.

351
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,870
Whether she tries again
or not is not my concern.

352
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:55,439
I wonder if a healthy finder's fee

353
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,175
would make it your concern.

354
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:58,776
I'll need to make a call.

355
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:02,246
And after this,
the pièce de résistance...

356
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:06,083
the winged veal of the Russian Far East.

357
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,419
Served extra rare.

358
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:14,258
That is the sound
of the Blakiston fish owl,

359
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,061
the largest, most exotic,

360
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:19,096
and endangered of the owl species.

361
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:21,032
Endangered?

362
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,067
Let us know if you would prefer a slice

363
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,304
of the wing, breast, or all-seeing eye.

364
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,708
Nobody touches the bird.
What's wrong with you people?

365
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,212
There are only 400 of these
little guys left in the world,

366
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,013
and you're gonna eat this one?

367
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,815
You want to eat something? Eat a cow!

368
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,750
There are millions of them
wandering around.

369
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,086
Better yet, eat a rabbit.
They're delicious!

370
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,856
Low impact on the environment,
sustainable.

371
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,724
I mean, hell, they hump like...

372
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:48,659
well, like rabbits.

373
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,862
Uh, but our little
feathered friend here...

374
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:53,564
...is coming with me.

375
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:54,799
Chef?

376
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,310
Lydia?

377
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,038
Smile, everyone.

378
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,608
You just spared a magnificent creature.

379
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,859
She's late.

380
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,255
Somewhere you need to be?

381
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,157
I'm expecting a call.

382
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,286
A personal one, I hope.

383
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,296
I'm sure it's been difficult since Tom.

384
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,265
But you have Agnes now.

385
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,202
You should be looking forward, not back.

386
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,239
You deserve a... bigger life.

387
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,509
Oh. In your dreams, handsome.

388
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,555
Sofia Burke!

389
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,047
Your reputation precedes you.

390
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,384
As does yours. Which is why I'm here.

391
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,921
I wanted to pay you the courtesy
of turning you down in person.

392
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,490
I tried stealing the Dresden once.

393
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,858
I won't try again.

394
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,393
I don't want you to.

395
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,263
Potash said you did.

396
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,398
Please.

397
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,038
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

398
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,084
No. Thank you.

399
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,376
We're looking for some information

400
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,979
about Orion Relocation Services.

401
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,681
Never heard of them.

402
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:13,544
Perhaps this will jog your memory.

403
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,669
Excuse me.

404
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,231
Tell me how it all works.

405
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,066
Hello?

406
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,302
Agent Keen. Harris Gentry. I work in

407
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,370
transnational organized crime
out of Baltimore.

408
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,372
Yes, I was expecting your call.

409
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,076
I understand you identified the
man in the photo I circulated.

410
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:43,614
So they find someone
who's planning to move.

411
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,863
Same age, ethnicity.

412
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,652
Loners or people without family.

413
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:52,523
In my case, a woman escaping
from an abusive relationship

414
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,059
who wants to disappear.

415
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,328
So you can step into the identity

416
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,129
of someone no one can find.

417
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,131
Is that what this is about?

418
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,033
You want a new identity?

419
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,804
How do you contact them?

420
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,574
They initiate contact, use burners.

421
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,676
Tell me what I need to know
when I need to know it.

422
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,878
Did they tell you your new identity?

423
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,582
I'm paying for information.

424
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,485
So far, you've given me
relatively little.

425
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:28,225
Denise Young. That's my new name.

426
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,160
I don't know how to reach her.

427
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,363
It was a pleasure meeting you.

428
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,842
Don't spend it all in one place.

429
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:40,490
And this Tommy Petrov.
You're sure he's Russian mafia?

430
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,506
Guy's a brigadier in the Vory.

431
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,775
Answered to Motya Morozov.

432
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,710
- "Answered"?
- He was hit.

433
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,214
We don't know why. I was hoping you did.

434
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,236
Denise Young.

435
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,755
To find Ilya, we need to find her.

436
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,456
Do you want me to call Glen?

437
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,193
And risk a delay due to Taco Tuesday

438
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,095
or a suddenly ingrown toenail?

439
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,731
I don't have the time.
Ilya doesn't have the time.

440
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,834
Unfortunately, the last person
I would want to find Ilya

441
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,370
is the person I need
help from to find him.

442
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,805
We have a lead.

443
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,207
Motya Morozov.

444
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,543
Does he work with the woman in Paris?

445
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,044
So you have been threatened.

446
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,506
Was he looking for my mother?

447
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,114
He was.

448
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,185
Before I shot him.

449
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:31,100
The woman in Paris.
If you won't tell me her name,

450
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,725
just tell me this.

451
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,694
If we find her, will it end?

452
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,531
That is our best hope.

453
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,132
You said you had a lead?

454
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,458
How is he?

455
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,961
Sedated.

456
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,245
His vitals are returning.

457
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:57,800
Heart rate is stable.

458
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,554
But I am concerned.

459
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,224
Your friend...

460
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:11,528
...he has been trained
to resist interrogation.

461
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:15,232
I believe at the deepest,
subconscious levels,

462
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:19,269
he is able to avert, to resist.

463
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,239
And how do we get around that?

464
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,643
I would like to try a different approach.

465
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,999
Something, uh, somewhat unorthodox.

466
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,773
But to do this, I will
need your assistance

467
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,756
and your unabridged... trust.

468
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,538
Ilya.

469
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,408
There is a memory

470
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,363
I want you to open for me...

471
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,241
uh, like a drawer.

472
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,869
Can you do that?

473
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,688
We're going to go back.

474
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,457
Back to the night

475
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,294
you and Katarina's father
decided her fate.

476
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,466
You remember that day...

477
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,966
like it was yesterday.

478
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,502
The way it felt...

479
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,043
the way it smelled...

480
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,907
what it looked like.

481
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,277
Can you tell me where you are?

482
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,414
In a café in Belgrade.

483
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,616
What happened that night?

484
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,386
Don't... Don't fight.
Don't fight. Let go.

485
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:45,522
Breathe into the memory.

486
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:55,000
Ilya. Love.

487
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,169
Please.

488
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,397
I know you were here with Dom.

489
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,541
I need you to tell me what happened.

490
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,614
It wasn't my idea. I told him.

491
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,750
We can't be meeting like this.

492
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,320
It's too dangerous. Even now.

493
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,721
Listen to me.

494
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,591
Your ruse with Reddington didn't work.

495
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:23,760
All it managed to do was anger
the people who want her dead.

496
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,277
- She is dead.
- Nonsense!

497
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,865
What did Dom want from you?

498
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,002
He was desperate. He needed help.

499
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,905
Do you know they've
assembled a directive?

500
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,407
The Russian Vory, KGB, the Americans...

501
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,276
her enemies have pooled their resources

502
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,877
and put a bounty on her head.

503
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,047
They're calling it
the Townsend Directive.

504
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,985
- Neville Townsend?
- He's at the top

505
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,621
of a very long list of people
who want her dead.

506
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,055
Are you worried they'll find you?

507
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,725
I'm worried they'll find Masha,

508
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,560
try and leverage her.

509
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,929
Look, Dom, I...

510
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,366
I can't help you.

511
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,434
You made a promise!

512
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,822
To Katarina.

513
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,758
You told her you would look after Masha

514
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,716
if anything happened to her.

515
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,978
Yes, but... I can't call off Townsend.

516
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,349
And he will not stop looking.

517
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,450
Sure, he will. He'll stop looking.

518
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,521
And so will the rest of them...
if Katarina's dead.

519
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,926
You want me to kill your daughter?

520
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:34,099
I want you to hear my plan.

521
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:37,394
I can't believe the man
in the park was Russian Vory.

522
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,595
I should move.

523
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:41,656
And do what? Go on the run?
Live in hiding?

524
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:44,081
My family's being stalked
by the Russian mob.

525
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,267
Yeah, but you're being
protected by the FBI.

526
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:47,534
Reddington's given us a lead.

527
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,402
We're gonna track it
down and end this threat

528
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,505
and protect you and your family
while we're at it.

529
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,535
I got a location on Denise Young.

530
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,842
On three Denise Youngs, actually.

531
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:57,344
All the same age as Sofia Burke,

532
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:00,013
all with homes listed for sale
or in escrow...

533
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:01,548
but only one of whom has filed

534
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,283
three restraining orders against her ex.

535
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,118
The one who wants to get away
and never be found.

536
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:08,003
532 Riley Street. Falls Church.

537
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,656
Keen, Ressler, head over there.

538
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:12,492
Aram, Park, get her
on the phone and warn her.

539
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:15,662
If we want to find Orion,
we need to keep her alive.

540
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,899
She has to die.

541
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,306
It's the only way to protect Masha.

542
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,643
But to get this done,
I'll need your help.

543
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:33,013
She'll listen to you. You can get her.

544
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,149
Dom.

545
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:38,585
I-I can't.

546
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,374
I can't do this.

547
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,626
And yet you did.

548
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,992
Early in the morning.

549
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:47,548
Still dark.

550
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:51,631
You'd called me.
It was a simple assignment.

551
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:54,668
I was to drive a couple
of miles into the city.

552
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,237
I was to meet Dominic at Vukov Station.

553
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,560
Give him a package.

554
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,609
I was to sneak out.

555
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,444
So the target...

556
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,380
she was exactly where
she was supposed to be.

557
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,417
I watched you
sneak out of the green door.

558
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:15,055
But I could hardly see you.
It was so dark.

559
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:19,492
So you were there to what?
To watch me die?

560
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:22,529
Yes.

561
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,069
I hadn't known you'd taken a new husband.

562
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,570
Not that I was angry to find out,

563
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,339
certainly not as angry
as he seemed to be,

564
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,573
charging out of that room.

565
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,542
- Who's this?
- I...

566
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:37,277
I had to bring him in.

567
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,684
Pyotr was so suspicious.

568
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,438
He knew what my old life had cost me.

569
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,988
But I couldn't let you down.

570
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:55,028
By the time Pyotr woke up,
I planned to be back in bed...

571
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,696
as if nothing happened.

572
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,165
But I was wrong.

573
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:02,736
He knew if I was
slipping out at 4:00 a.m.

574
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,537
that I was back in the game.

575
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:08,341
He kept screaming,
"You were done! You were out!"

576
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,344
I insisted it was my last job.

577
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:15,448
An old friend had asked me for a favor.

578
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,585
A desperate friend, someone...

579
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:20,720
who I trusted,

580
00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:24,524
someone... I could never turn down.

581
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:32,599
But you weren't really
my friend. Were you?

582
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,203
I'm so sorry.

583
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,408
I never wanted to hurt you.

584
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,958
But... we...

585
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:48,682
we didn't think we had a choice.

586
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,518
"We." That's right.

587
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,687
You weren't alone.

588
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:58,491
The others... They were all there.

589
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:00,827
Even Dom was there.

590
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:04,764
He leaked that his daughter...

591
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,367
that you, were staying at the inn

592
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,770
and that you carried sensitive intel.

593
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:12,505
This might be the last chance

594
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:15,408
to catch the infamous Russian traitor...

595
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,740
Katarina Rostova.

596
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:22,263
He wanted to make
a spectacle of my death.

597
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,519
And to think, you...

598
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:28,722
facilitated it.

599
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:32,325
You... watched.

600
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,257
I know.

601
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:38,665
I'm sorry.

602
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:43,770
Pyotr insisted he accompany me.

603
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:46,101
He didn't want me out of his sight.

604
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:50,276
He knew Belgrade was too dangerous.

605
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:54,781
He said he'd stay in the car.
I told him he was crazy to come.

606
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:56,816
He wasn't even wearing shoes.

607
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:59,906
Just those stupid hotel slippers.

608
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,038
He died.

609
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:19,572
I loved him.

610
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,304
And he died...

611
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:25,223
right before my eyes.

612
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:28,018
Because of you!

613
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:33,920
The KGB were going to
kill you right then and there.

614
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:39,325
But then everything went wrong.

615
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:00,609
Elizabeth.

616
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,716
Hi. Is there any chance you
could look after Agnes today?

617
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:05,418
You know I'd love to, but...

618
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,288
What Agnes said, there was
a dead body in the park.

619
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,824
I'm in a very important meeting.

620
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,097
- There were men with guns.
- I really can't help you now.

621
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:16,429
They were there for her. To hurt her.

622
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:20,834
Are you sure? W-Why? W-Who were they?

623
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,769
I can't explain everything.

624
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:25,872
I just need someone I trust to
look after her until I get home.

625
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:27,473
Of course I'll do it.

626
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:28,842
I'll be there as soon as I can.

627
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,610
I'm sorry to pull you out of a meeting.

628
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:33,079
It's okay. We're almost done.

629
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:35,481
Honestly, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

630
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:38,384
I'm happy to do it. And don't worry.

631
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:41,049
She'll be safe with me.

632
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:44,052
I'm a lot tougher than I look.

633
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,416
- I gave you instructions.
- How could I have not known

634
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,661
- about her husband?
- She was to come alone.

635
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:52,462
One simple job... deliver the dossier.

636
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:53,719
I've never even heard of him.

637
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:55,721
And now he's dead and she's alive.

638
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,390
Yes. And there are witnesses.

639
00:31:57,392 --> 00:31:59,625
It's a mess! The world
was supposed to see

640
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,495
Katarina Rostova die,
and instead all we've done

641
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,664
is confirm that she's very much alive.

642
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,732
Townsend. He'll never stop.

643
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,634
And instead of protecting
my granddaughter,

644
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,236
we've put a target on her back.

645
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,304
Oh, stop using the child as an excuse!

646
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,773
This was about you, Dom.

647
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,908
This was about Masha!

648
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,376
I should tell him.

649
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:19,295
We're not telling him anything.

650
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:22,481
Oh. I know how you feel, but...

651
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,684
Reddington deserves to know
what we've done.

652
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:27,687
Why? Why does Reddington
deserve to know anything?

653
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,221
Because he's a part of this.

654
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:30,923
- You're protecting him.
- I made a promise.

655
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:32,591
But you cared about me.

656
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:33,959
Yes, and I do, but I c...

657
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,562
I had everything taken
from me that night.

658
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:39,331
I can't show my face, use my name.

659
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,533
I'm so sorry.

660
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:42,368
I've been hunted like an animal!

661
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,272
- We need to stop.
- And Reddington?

662
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:48,641
Whoever he is, he's still out there!

663
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:50,476
The benefactor to all of this.

664
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,944
- Why?!
- Stop!

665
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:54,513
You're protecting him, but
people are trying to kill me.

666
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,249
They're hunting me! Answer me! Why?!

667
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,885
We need to stop! Get back!

668
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:02,588
We need to keep his airway clear.

669
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,866
I only want the truth.

670
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:17,036
You won't get it if he's dead.

671
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:21,941
Did you get ahold of Denise?

672
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:23,476
She canceled her cell service

673
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,044
or has a new account
under a different name.

674
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,514
By hiding from her abuser,
she managed to hide from us.

675
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,316
I can't get Reddington to pick up.

676
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:31,917
Why would you be calling him?

677
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,020
He insisted I give him Denise's
location as soon as we got one.

678
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:37,656
So he could get there first.
Now, did you give it to him

679
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:39,325
before or after you gave it to us?

680
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,795
Before. But he was closer,
and she's in danger and...

681
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,532
He's not gonna tell us
what he finds out, is he?

682
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:48,768
He's not keeping this from me.

683
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,336
Last bit of business.

684
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,338
Would you just initial by the X's

685
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,440
and sign where I highlighted it, please?

686
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,008
I'm so ready to get out of here.

687
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,010
Aww. It's been that bad?

688
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,879
Look around.

689
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:04,316
People usually have mementos
and sentimental things.

690
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,685
All I have are painful memories

691
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:08,420
and that son of a bitch's shotgun

692
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,989
in case he tries to find me again.

693
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:11,557
He won't.

694
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,425
You know, I've got a very good feeling

695
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,528
about this next chapter for you.

696
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,396
I hope you're right.

697
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:20,292
I mean, it can't get any worse, right?

698
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:25,704
Aah!

699
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,339
Aah!

700
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,134
Ohh!

701
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,811
Help him, would you?
I can handle the rest!

702
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:34,980
If you want something done right,
you've got to do it yourself.

703
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,083
Oh.

704
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,593
S-She tried to kill me.

705
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,724
I'm so sorry.

706
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,630
Hey. Hey. This woman.

707
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:27,199
She was a client. You moved her.

708
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,068
I need to know where.

709
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,670
Hey. Hey!

710
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,039
Where is she?

711
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,555
We were too late.

712
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:50,990
If you had gotten her location,

713
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,691
would you have shared it with me?

714
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,593
Eventually.

715
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,763
Who is she?

716
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,965
The woman in Paris. I want a name.

717
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:02,868
Shots fired in
a residential neighborhood.

718
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,470
Response time is probably 10 minutes.

719
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:07,439
- Who is she?!
- It's already been 5.

720
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,908
I need to go.

721
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,165
We have the Orion files in the War Room.

722
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,957
And yet you're here.

723
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:25,160
We have the files, but you
know who were looking for.

724
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:26,795
We can't find her without you.

725
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:29,064
And with Bisset dead and
the files in our possession,

726
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,932
you can't find her without us.

727
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:33,835
Are you keeping the owl?

728
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,838
Oh, God, no. I'm terrified of the thing.

729
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,076
Her eyes... hypnotizing.

730
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:42,744
But not to worry.

731
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:45,514
We've contacted a licensed falconer

732
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:47,949
to help return the lovely lady

733
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,285
to her home range, wherever that is.

734
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:51,920
Come to the War Room.

735
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:53,314
We'll go through the files together,

736
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:57,025
you ID her, and we'll save your friend.

737
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:59,194
Dembe, you heard her. To the War Room!

738
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:03,532
Perhaps we'll be greeted
by the Praetorian Guard.

739
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:06,868
"The War Room."
What a marvel of overstatement.

740
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,104
Unless we're in a war I'm unaware of.

741
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:12,674
My gosh. That would be... marvelous.

742
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,913
I had Aram print out the Orion files.

743
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:19,648
There are 792.

744
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,751
Each one is conceivably a criminal case.

745
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:26,021
Like Denise Young, these people
might not be criminals,

746
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:27,789
but a crime may have been committed

747
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:29,691
in order for them to disappear.

748
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:32,994
Somewhere in here is the woman
who abducted you in Paris.

749
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:35,530
Your goal is to identify her.

750
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,567
Ours is to identify the other clients

751
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:41,536
and determine whether they
were aware that their new lives

752
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:43,757
may very well have been built on murder.

753
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:06,728
My nanny.

754
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,264
I moved here to be closer to my daughter.

755
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:11,032
I put her through some dark times.

756
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,734
You remind me of my granddaughter!

757
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,837
Sometimes people just aren't
who they seem to be.

758
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,906
Of course it's her.

759
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,044
Is something wrong?

760
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:24,779
No. Nothing.

761
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,982
It's just, uh... lost track of time.

762
00:38:26,984 --> 00:38:28,383
My nanny has to go.

763
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:30,118
Why don't you just call her,
ask her to stay?

764
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,721
Wouldn't make any difference.
She's really got to go.

765
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,064
How's Agnes?

766
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:44,966
Out like a light.

767
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:48,136
After what you told me on the phone,

768
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:51,039
I needed something to steady my nerves.

769
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,109
The men in the park. Tell me about them.

770
00:38:55,746 --> 00:38:57,646
I'll tell you in a minute.

771
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,748
I just want to check in on her first.

772
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:49,998
The men... Why in the world

773
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,967
would they be interested in Agnes?

774
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,302
They weren't interested in her.

775
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,438
Oh. That's a relief.

776
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,240
They were interested in you.

777
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,077
In me?

778
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,218
You said you were here to
reconnect with your daughter.

779
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,261
That's true.

780
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:07,515
That Agnes reminded you
of your granddaughter.

781
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:12,887
The men went to the park to kill you,

782
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,489
and you killed one of them first.

783
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,994
Me?

784
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,996
You think I killed someone?

785
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:24,299
Not Maddy Tolliver. No.

786
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:30,250
Maddy Tolliver was
a s-sweet, unassuming woman

787
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:34,244
you had murdered so you
could steal her identity.

788
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,710
Maddy Tolliver would never kill anyone.

789
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:42,173
But Katarina Rostova would.

790
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:47,136
Katarina Rostova's a natural born killer.

791
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:52,475
Of enemies, friends, family.

792
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,449
I can explain.

793
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:00,035
I knew it.

794
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:03,071
A part of me... knew who you were.

795
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,508
I just didn't want to admit it

796
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,044
because I knew it would
have to end this way.

797
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:12,099
With you pointing a gun at me?

798
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:16,249
You shot your father.

799
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:20,121
You put your granddaughter in harm's way.

800
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,524
You lied your way into my life.

801
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:24,926
You've caused pain and suffering

802
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:27,262
for everyone I've ever cared about.

803
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:32,640
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't end this right now.

804
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,044
You already know the reason, Masha.

805
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,465
And it should be reason enough.

806
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,373
I'm your mother.

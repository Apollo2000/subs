My name is Dr. Michael Alexander.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,439
I'm a senior programmer
at DXE Labs here in Richmond.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,397
I've worked in this position
for the past 10 years,

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,333
and in that time, I have seen

5
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,602
the worst of humanity.

6
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:15,372
My coworkers are unethical sheep.

7
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:18,541
My management team has asked me
to lie repeatedly.

8
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:21,511
Our research team regularly fixes data

9
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,046
to serve the stockholder interests.

10
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,782
Someone needs to stand up to this.

11
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,584
As a man of science,

12
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:30,053
I feel obligated to right these wrongs.

13
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,274
My name is Dr. Michael Alexander.

14
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:54,377
I'm a senior programmer
at DXE Labs here in Richmond.

15
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,279
I've worked in this position
for the past 10 years,

16
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,149
and in that time, I have seen

17
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,284
the worst of humanity.

18
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:04,254
My coworkers are unethical sheep.

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,289
My management team has asked me
to lie repeatedly.

20
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,957
Hello?

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,626
Our research team...
Mike, what the hell is going on?

22
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:10,960
What do you mean? I'm at work.

23
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:12,696
- I saw the video.
- What video?

24
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,364
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,033
Michael, just come home to me.

26
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,436
Michael Alexander, put your hands up!

27
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,404
- Police! Don't move!
- I said show me your hands!

28
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:23,039
- Don't move!
- Hands!

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,974
Get on the ground right now!

30
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:25,975
What's going on?!

31
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,977
What's in your hand?!

32
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,813
It's... No... He's got a detonator!

33
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:30,847
No, it's just a...

34
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,188
Michael, talk to me!

35
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,390
- Michael?!
- Stay there.

36
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,258
- Call an ambulance.
- Oh, my God.

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,027
- Right now.
- What's happening?

38
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:45,662
Please talk to me, Michael.

39
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,405
Details are still coming in,
but we're being told

40
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,707
the alleged bomber has been
fatally shot by police.

41
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,577
The DXE Labs campus remains in lockdown

42
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,441
while authorities search
for a motive in this crime.

00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,791
Francesca nearly took your life.

45
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:17,694
And then she saved it. And Dom's.

46
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,529
Dom's not out of the woods.

47
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,730
You owe her nothing.

48
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:23,133
I want to reach out.

49
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:26,569
Just tell her there's an urgent
matter we need to discuss.

50
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:31,808
- Elizabeth.
- I spoke to Cooper.

51
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,578
He wants to bring Agent Park
onto the Task Force.

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,947
He already told her about my involvement?

53
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,215
I did.

54
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:42,385
After vetting a lot of candidates.

55
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:44,120
She's a good fit. I disagree.

56
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,089
- Of course you do.
- It wasn't your decision.

57
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,191
Ah, but it is my decision,

58
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,059
and I have a different choice.

59
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,427
Francesca Campbell.

60
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,363
She's a combat medic, not an agent.

61
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,866
True, but she's talented, and I like her.

62
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,735
Please just consider Park.

63
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,638
I know she seems straight-laced,
but deep down,

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,108
I feel there's a darkness there
you'll appreciate.

65
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,946
This strange incident at DXE Labs.

66
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,015
Oh, yeah, the bombing. Scary stuff.

67
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,684
It's hard to believe someone
of Dr. Alexander's reputation

68
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,186
- would do something like...
- It's hard to believe

69
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,221
because it's not true. There was no bomb.

70
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:21,157
He uploaded a confession video
before he went to work.

71
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,959
The digital world is filled

72
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,229
with anonymous malcontents
hiding behind screens,

73
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,532
conducting all manner of spurious acts.

74
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,334
Their latest pleasure seems to be

75
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,370
putting false words
into the mouths of innocents.

76
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,206
What makes you think he's innocent?

77
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,708
Whoever uploaded that video was
definitely stitching together

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,343
an assortment of old recordings.

79
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,046
Hey, there, Tadashi.
Good to see you, too.

80
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,248
I'm pretty sure the opening
came from an online speech

81
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,417
Dr. Alexander gave in March.

82
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,219
It's a really convincing deepfake.

83
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,688
"Deepfake." Kids today.

84
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,189
The video's a fake?

85
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,925
Not just a fake. It's an
ultra-realistic counterfeit

86
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,493
made with A.I. software.

87
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:00,096
Whoever did this
used a patchwork of old videos,

88
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,599
broke Dr. Alexander's speech
down into phonemes...

89
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,067
added to or edited his words...

90
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,135
and then used a perimeter
blending program

91
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,670
to synthesize the lower face region

92
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,873
and generate a believable composite.

93
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,008
And you wonder why I insist

94
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,044
on flip phones and dead drops. Honestly.

95
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,747
They rearranged his words?
Edited the footage to...

96
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:20,550
To depict Dr. Alexander
saying things he never said.

97
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,051
What about that last part?

98
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,820
Th-The one with the suicide vest?

99
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:27,023
It's altered footage from a video

100
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,626
uploaded by an activist group in Russia.

101
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:33,096
I'm telling you... This isn't
some amateur 4chan joke.

102
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,131
I've never seen a deepfake this good.

103
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,835
Whoever released the video
wanted this shooting to happen.

104
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,737
Suicide by cop.

105
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,306
Or rather, murder by cop.

106
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:46,309
Dr. Alexander held
a high-ranking position

107
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,913
at one of the foremost defense
contractors in the country,

108
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,982
giving him access
to classified intelligence.

109
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:55,919
I fear his death may be the precursor

110
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,521
to something far more sinister.

111
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,991
A fake video triggered
police response in Phoenix

112
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:05,328
to a shooting that never happened.

113
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,231
Doctored footage
of a Silicon Valley tech firm

114
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,134
caused stock prices to crater.

115
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,670
And a U.S. senator lost her seat

116
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,272
after photos of an affair
that never happened

117
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,274
went viral on social media.

118
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,612
Three deepfakes, three examples
of malicious hoaxes

119
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,414
that led to real-life consequences.

120
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,784
And according to Reddington, the
shooting death of Dr. Alexander

121
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,485
is simply the most recent.

122
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,955
Reddington believes Richmond
police killed an innocent man?

123
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,623
Yes. By all accounts,

124
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,592
Dr. Alexander was a highly
respected systems engineer.

125
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:40,063
Happy marriage, healthy
children, successful career.

126
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:43,967
At DXE Labs, he designed
an on board intelligence system

127
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,767
for a new generation
of battlefield drones.

128
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,559
Could be sabotage
by a hostile foreign power.

129
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,743
Or corporate espionage... a DXE
competitor looking for an edge.

130
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,602
Either way, the national
security threats are very real.

131
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,171
I need your assurance

132
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,706
the job will be carried out as discussed.

133
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,043
Not a problem. Just send me the details.

134
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,245
Everything will be
taken care of as discussed.

135
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,081
Very well. Payment has been wired.

136
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,918
The balance will be paid once
the target has been eliminated.

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,887
Okay, so, the video was shared
over 8,500 times

138
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,422
in the first five minutes alone,

139
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:18,058
but I was able to trace
the very first upload

140
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,929
to an account named
Mr.-underscore-Rite362,

141
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,031
but the problem is...

142
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,566
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Agent Park.

143
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,100
I believe you met everyone
on your first visit,

144
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,535
except for Agent Ressler.

145
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,871
Oh, my gosh... yes, Agent Ressler. Hi!

146
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,906
I mean hello.

147
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,375
- I've heard so much about you.
- Not all bad, I hope.

148
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:38,312
No, all incredibly amazing.

149
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,147
The work you did hunting Reddington...

150
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,649
- It was relentless.
- And ironic.

151
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,185
Aram's already briefed Agent
Park on the details of the case.

152
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,087
Yeah, I was just explaining
how the video originated

153
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,990
from the Reddit handle. I pulled the ISP.

154
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,326
Turns out this guy bounced
all over the Internet,

155
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,093
hiding his location with a VPN.

156
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,929
Meaning we don't know
who uploaded the video.

157
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,065
- Not yet, no.
- Actually, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,666
That's why I'm late.

159
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,818
- We sort of do know.
- We do?

160
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,304
I mean, uh, what do you mean?

161
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:05,639
I took a different approach...

162
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,274
ran a search on the username itself

163
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,076
and found that same handle ran posts

164
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,944
on multiple other underground forums.

165
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:14,014
Luckily, on one,
Mr-Rite failed to use a VPN,

166
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,184
so I contacted the ISP directly
and sent a subpoena.

167
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,554
Turns out the address was leased
to one Aiden McCullough.

168
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,685
16 years old. An address in Bethesda.

169
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,058
I like her already.

170
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,228
Ressler, take Agent Park and
pay a visit to Aiden McCullough.

171
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,964
Keen, see what you can dig up on the kid.

172
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,267
In the meantime,
I'll reach out to DHS and CIA.

173
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,869
Okay, I'll just, uh...
I'll just hang tight.

174
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,804
I'll be right here if anyone needs me.

175
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,441
Yeah, it's urgent. I got it, Dembe.

176
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,238
I'll see you soon.

177
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,923
Hand me the keys.

178
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,159
Put your hands behind your back.

179
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,313
In 4 miles, exit right.

180
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:12,750
According to the news,
Reddington escaped from prison.

181
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,560
That's a pretty thin story

182
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,429
to hide the fact that
you're in business with him.

183
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,798
- Have you read our case files?
- Yeah.

184
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,166
Ever think he turned himself in

185
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,360
so you could help him further his career?

186
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,137
The thought's crossed my mind, yeah.

187
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,906
And you're okay with that?

188
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:31,119
You, of all people,
helping him expand his empire?

189
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,371
Why Anchorage?

190
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,848
I read your file.

191
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,117
You read ours. I read yours.

192
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,652
Top of your class at the academy.

193
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:43,155
Could've gone to any
field office... New York, L.A.

194
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,990
But you pick Anchorage.

195
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,192
How come?

196
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,802
I liked the weather.

197
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:51,897
I only ask because
it seems out of character.

198
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,901
Everything else is pretty
predictable, by the book.

199
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,304
Yes, sir, no, sir.

200
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,972
Family, God, country.

201
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,974
Then Anchorage.

202
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,742
Got a problem with following the book?

203
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,362
No, not at all.

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,747
In fact, you remind me
of someone I used to know.

205
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,325
Me.

206
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,653
I remind Aram of someone he hates.

207
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:17,890
It's kind of the opposite.

208
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,960
Really? He looked at me like gum
on the bottom of his shoe.

209
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:23,262
That's because you're replacing
someone he cared about,

210
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:26,265
which is tough, but he'll get over it.

211
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:29,268
You just... You got to give him time.

212
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,475
- Ann McCullough?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,644
Agents Ressler, Park, FBI.

214
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,012
We're here to talk to your son.

215
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,414
Talk? He barely grunts.

216
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,583
We have a warrant
to look at his computer.

217
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,018
It's about time someone did.

218
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,353
Do you know what we're looking for?

219
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,621
All day, all night,

220
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,656
all he does is stare at a screen.

221
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,458
Computer, phone.

222
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,959
You want to look at that, too?

223
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,628
I'm sorry. We don't have
a warrant for that.

224
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,596
To look at the phone that I pay for?

225
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,298
Oh, you want a warrant?
Here's your warrant.

226
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,367
Take it. Hand to God,
you're doing me a favor.

227
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,836
- Mom, what are you doing?
- It's the porno, isn't it?

228
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,337
- Ma!
- Look, Holly Alter...

229
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,172
She lives next door. Lovely girl.

230
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,341
A little hippy, but still, a delight,

231
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,976
but does Hugh Hefner
give her the time of day?

232
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,514
We'd like to ask you about
Michael Alexander.

233
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,815
Never heard of him.

234
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,784
Yeah, well, he's dead.

235
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,004
You disappoint me, Francesca.

236
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,340
I hired you to betray Reddington.

237
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,208
Instead, you betrayed me.

238
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,910
You gained his confidence.

239
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:48,914
As a result, you now have
a chance to regain mine.

240
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,016
I have a job for you.

241
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,918
I strongly suggest you take it,

242
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,021
as I will most certainly
kill you if you don't.

243
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,526
An associate of
Reddington's has indicated

244
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,353
a willingness to turn.

245
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,689
It may be a trap.

246
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,150
Which is why we're sending you.

247
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,470
The who, where, and when
are in this envelope.

248
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:14,673
Get him. Bring him here.

249
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,549
We looked through this
kid's computer. He's not involved.

250
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,784
But the video of Michael
Alexander was on his computer.

251
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,853
Because the computer
was infected by a root-kit.

252
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,288
It was turned into a zombie-bot...

253
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,390
We know what a root-kit does.

254
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,828
Please go on.

255
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,563
It was being used as a way station

256
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:40,000
to mask video uploads, as well
as financial transactions

257
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,395
I'm in the process of tracing.

258
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,183
Let's know if you find something.

259
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,217
And agent Park, good work.

260
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,510
Look, I get it.

261
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:54,423
I hope so, because is obvious.

262
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,016
What's obvious is that you're
not giving her a chance.

263
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:58,484
I mean, her joining the team

264
00:11:58,486 --> 00:11:59,818
doesn't mean she's replacing Samar.

265
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,086
You know that's not possible.

266
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,521
Is that what you think this is about?

267
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,957
Because it doesn't feel like
she's replacing Samar.

268
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,026
It feels like she's here to replace me.

269
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,328
And by the way, I'm seeing Elodie now

270
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,363
and very, very happy about it.

271
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,033
Sure, there... there are
a couple of obstacles.

272
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,135
Like her husband, his wheelchair.

273
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,436
Okay, you know what?

274
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:18,971
Right now, we are living in the moment

275
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,128
and having a great time doing it.

276
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,610
In fact, I am supposed
to meet her for lunch,

277
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,279
and since you all have such confidence

278
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,692
in Agent Perfect-In-Every-Way,

279
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,385
that is what I'm going to go do.

280
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:41,660
Trust is so fragile.

281
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:45,197
When it exists, anything is possible,

282
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,100
between people or nations.

283
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,436
But when it doesn't, or worse,

284
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:54,306
when a bond of trust is broken,

285
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:57,176
there is no greater betrayal.

286
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,079
Cigar?

287
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,346
Excuse me?

288
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,902
Well, not down to the stub or anything.

289
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,310
Want to keep the lungs clear,

290
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,146
but a celebratory puff or two can't hurt.

291
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,522
What are we celebrating?

292
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,491
Your new job.

293
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:14,159
On the Task Force.

294
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,694
The FBI Task Force.

295
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,297
As my life often depends on it,

296
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,201
I have become an astute
judge of character.

297
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,375
And in our short time together,

298
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:34,012
I have come to judge you as trustworthy.

299
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,614
I appreciate that.

300
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,852
And the job.

301
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:43,055
I'm at war with a worthy adversary.

302
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:45,991
Someone capable of exploiting

303
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,328
even those closest to me.

304
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,930
I need you to keep an eye on an associate

305
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,933
who I believe is about to betray me.

306
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,406
Picked these up in Havana last week

307
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,243
from Castro's personal humidor.

308
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,612
Communism may be discredited,

309
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:10,282
but it still produces a damn fine cigar.

310
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:15,420
When you said there was this
amazing place to have lunch,

311
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,126
I assumed you meant
an amazing restaurant.

312
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:19,583
This is way better.

313
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,118
This is someone's house.

314
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,121
It's a replica
of Donato Bramante's Tempietto.

315
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,157
They should be giving tours.

316
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,358
Someone lives here.

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,194
I know. But they're at work.

318
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,777
Come on.

319
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,227
This is great.

320
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:05,296
What am I doing?

321
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,073
I, um...

322
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,609
Hello. I'm here.

323
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,248
Uh, I'm, uh...

324
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,577
enjoying the architecture...

325
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,956
and, you know, the breaking and entering.

326
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,325
This is ridiculous.

327
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,505
This is not gonna end well.

328
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,933
This is crazy.

329
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,837
Knock, knock.

330
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:52,443
It feels so wrong, right?

331
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,912
I definitely feel something.

332
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,776
Show me.

333
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:03,387
You're gonna be the death of me.

334
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,956
Wouldn't that be amazing?

335
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,468
Hey, it's me. Got a minute?

336
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,025
Might I call you back
in, say, 20 minutes?

337
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,327
Or you know what? Make it 30.

338
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,495
Why? Where are you?

339
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:22,531
Dembe and I are just wrapping up

340
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:27,636
an absolutely delicious and long
overdue lunch date with Brimley.

341
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,573
He's made his mother's apple brown betty,

342
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,541
and turns out the sweetness

343
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,144
doesn't really come from the sugar at all

344
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:39,081
but from the Ribston Pippin
apples themselves.

345
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,017
Also known as the Glory of York!

346
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,652
Okay.

347
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,221
That's great,

348
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:47,489
but the apple brown betty
is gonna have to wait.

349
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:49,892
I spoke to Park. She has a lead.

350
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,995
Mm. It's very winning, the way
you're promoting Agent Park.

351
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:57,565
She said the computer used
to upload the deepfake

352
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,334
also made another transaction.

353
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:00,602
Another video?

354
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,770
Nope, money.

355
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,105
$70,000 to be exact.

356
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,473
Wired to a Walter Higgins.

357
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:07,842
Which is probably an alias.

358
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,478
Total dead end.
But we got an image of him

359
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,647
on the CCTVs withdrawing the payment.

360
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,082
Park is releasing it on the wire,

361
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,351
but I want you to take a look.

362
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:17,852
Thought maybe you'd know the face.

363
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,954
Oh, happy to look. Send it to Dembe.

364
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,324
We'll turn over a few rocks.
I'll call you back posthaste.

365
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,359
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,994
Where's the ice cream?

367
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,429
No ice cream.

368
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,930
What do you mean, no ice cream?

369
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:32,701
Mom always served her betty
with heavy cream.

370
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,968
Oh.

371
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,206
And I thought I died once in Marrakech.

372
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,842
- Lovely, Teddy.
- Thank you.

373
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,444
Mmm.

374
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,387
Sh...

375
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,002
Who are you?

376
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,172
It's, uh, it's okay. Uh, uh,
um, I'm a... I'm a FBI agent.

377
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,974
FBI? What are you doing here?

378
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,009
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm arresting
this woman. Yes.

379
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,811
We like to role-play.
It's not what it looks like.

380
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,313
- I've been very naughty.
- Oh, my God.

381
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,848
- Get out!
- Yeah, on our way.

382
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,182
Get out of my house!

383
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,351
You have a lovely home!

384
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,620
You really should be giving tours.

385
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,990
Oh, that was amazing.

386
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,859
- And illegal.
- It was totally taboo.

387
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,360
That woman was terrified, and so was I.

388
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,628
You know, she could've had a gun.

389
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,030
I love that word, don't you? "Taboo."

390
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,166
Elodie, we broke the law.

391
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:40,201
Yeah. That's what makes it taboo.

392
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,170
Listen, I am an FBI agent.

393
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:43,972
I do not break the law.

394
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:47,944
Oh, God.

395
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,712
Okay, look.

396
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,481
My husband and I loved taking risks.

397
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:57,418
He took one too many, and now
he's dead on the outside.

398
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,156
Caring for him
makes me dead on the inside.

399
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:03,992
This... The craziness,
the taboo of it all,

400
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:07,495
I-I need it more than ever to feel alive,

401
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,840
to bring me back from the dead.

402
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,667
I can't live without it.

403
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,012
And I didn't think you could, either.

404
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,173
I hope that's right, because...

405
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,575
it's kind of a dealbreaker if you can.

406
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,454
In peace, sons bury their fathers.

407
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:37,125
I don't mean to be rude,
but, uh, I'm expecting someone.

408
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,660
I know.

409
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,746
She sent me to get you.

410
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:44,500
The man reading "War and Peace."

411
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:48,603
In peace, sons bury their fathers.

412
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,632
In war, fathers bury their sons.

413
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,976
Let's go. My car's over there.

414
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:55,777
Wait, she sent you?

415
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,779
Like she was too busy or something?

416
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,315
I'm risking my life just sitting here,

417
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:02,698
and she couldn't bother
to cancel her spin class?

418
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,820
I think she wanted me to
determine your sincerity first.

419
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,122
My sincerity?

420
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,992
I'm handing her Raymond
Reddington's head on a platter.

421
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:13,938
She was concerned Reddington
may be setting her up.

422
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,297
Okay, whatever.

423
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,132
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

424
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,469
I offered the bitch Manhattan
for a couple of beaver pelts.

425
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,172
A deal like that, you close in
person, or there's no deal.

426
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:27,408
- You know what I'm saying?
- Hey, I'm just the messenger.

427
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,711
Then deliver the message.

428
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,714
Deal's off.

429
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,216
You know, I got a better idea.

430
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,418
Why don't you just tell her yourself?

431
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,023
I thought it would be done by now.

432
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,558
Why are you making me wait?

433
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,294
I told you. The conditions
need to be perfect.

434
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:49,364
I thought the conditions were
perfect the last time we spoke.

435
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,866
This has to be done flawlessly.

436
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,635
But it'll get done.

437
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,703
I'll contact you when it is.

438
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,174
Well, hello, there.

439
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,709
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

440
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,412
Please.

441
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,347
Word on the street is you're the man

442
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,049
that goes by the name of Higgins.

443
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,350
Who the hell are you?

444
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm the man with a few questions.

445
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,688
Who's this?

446
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,191
Ah. This is the man who's gonna
be asking the questions.

447
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,627
Dembe, if you wouldn't mind,

448
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:23,331
could you help me, uh, warm up
before we get started?

449
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,400
The seated inner thigh stretch?

450
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,869
Yes, please.

451
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,406
I'm gonna need to be extra loose
for this one.

452
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,595
Is this some kind of power trip?

453
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:40,997
Reddington says he has a lead.

454
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,035
To show me he's in charge?

455
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,637
Alina, I want this to work.
And in order for that to happen,

456
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,139
you have to try
to make a good impression.

457
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,941
Why? I already got the job.

458
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:54,377
Or did I?

459
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,811
It's complicated.

460
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,014
Are you telling me
that he has the final say?

461
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,483
That I'm being vetted by
the most wanted man in America?

462
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,686
I vetted you, and I think you're
the right person for the job.

463
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,121
To work for Raymond Reddington.

464
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,489
What could I have possibly done

465
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,057
to make you think I'm right for that?

466
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,562
Anchorage.

467
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,061
You have no idea what happened there.

468
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,663
No, I don't.

469
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,526
And no one will tell me.

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,567
I graduated third in my class.

471
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,035
I have incredible references,

472
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,070
yet you recommended me for the job

473
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,340
because of what you don't know about me?

474
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,008
You have a secret.

475
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,245
That tells me a lot more
about you than your GPA.

476
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

477
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,043
And I won't ask.

478
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,850
But if you want this job,

479
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,381
at least try to make a good impression.

480
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:40,590
I don't see...

481
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,558
No, I-I understand there's traffic, Fudo.

482
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,096
But you said 2 minutes
about 20 minutes ago, okay?

483
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,098
Right. No... All right, fine.

484
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,035
You know what? Just... Just
park the car and get in here.

485
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,138
What happened?

486
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,273
Is that Walter Higgins?

487
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,208
You must be Agent Park.

488
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,610
Brimley, you didn't know.

489
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,678
No, I didn't, but I caused it to rupture.

490
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,259
- It was my fault.
- Did you kill Higgins?

491
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,598
It was a miscalculation.

492
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,556
I didn't think we were
anywhere near his limit.

493
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,959
- How could you know?
- We didn't even hit 30 PSI.

494
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,461
Evidently, your source had an ulcer

495
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:18,031
that ruptured as a result
of undue stress.

496
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:20,734
- Ah, there you are, finally.
- The beltway was a nightmare.

497
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:23,270
Okay, you know what, Fudo?
I don't want to hear it.

498
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,706
All right? Brimley is a mess.
The source is dead.

499
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,907
It was the betty.

500
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,642
- Who's Betty?
- The apple brown betty.

501
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:31,979
It was those damn apples,
the Ribston Pippins.

502
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:34,915
My blood sugar spiked. I was off my game.

503
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,283
And I was the one

504
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:38,318
who was supposed to make
a good impression?

505
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,457
Higgins was a hitman.

506
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,659
He said he was paid
through a numbered account

507
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:50,030
to assassinate an Almacorp
scientist in Arlington

508
00:23:50,032 --> 00:23:53,000
named... Tracy Long.

509
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:54,868
You wanted her to see all this.

510
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,603
No, I...

511
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:59,339
But you did say there was
a darkness about her.

512
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,008
If one were to wonder how dark,

513
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,110
I'm afraid the answer would be not very.

514
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,614
Ressler, it's me.
We got to find a scientist,

515
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,351
works for Almacorp, named Tracy Long.

516
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,687
- I was a target?
- Yes.

517
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:15,589
W-Why?

518
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:17,624
- By whom?
- We don't know.

519
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:19,026
You said you caught the assassin.

520
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:20,761
I said we gathered intel from him.

521
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,429
He was never in our custody.

522
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:25,365
And now he's dead, and
the whos and whys died with him.

523
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,534
But what we do know, Dr. Long,

524
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:30,037
is that you're not the only one
with a target on your back.

525
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,307
We believe Michael Alexander
was targeted, as well.

526
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,475
But the video, the...
the things he said...

527
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:37,244
He didn't say them.

528
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:40,045
The video was doctored
to make him look like a threat.

529
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,817
Did you have a meeting
in Arlington this morning?

530
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:46,987
Yes, with Dr. Lewis Powell.

531
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:49,022
- Why?
- Tell us about him.

532
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,992
He's a pioneer in our field.

533
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,860
His research into neural networks

534
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:56,330
is the foundation of modern A.I.

535
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:57,764
Now, what did you two talk about?

536
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,834
N-Nothing. He didn't show up.

537
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,235
I didn't think anything about that.

538
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:03,937
He has ALS.

539
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,606
His health can be unpredictable.

540
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,507
The reason I'm asking
is because we believe

541
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:10,210
the attempt on your life was
meant to happen in Arlington.

542
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:11,845
We need to get in touch with Powell.

543
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,414
If you and Dr. Alexander were targeted,

544
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,350
it's possible he was, too.

545
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:18,619
Oh, I can get you his assistant's number.

546
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:20,020
She makes all of his appointments.

547
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:22,089
You know, it's recently
come to our attention

548
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:24,291
that some of our people
are being monitored.

549
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:25,553
Monitored? How?

550
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:27,527
Well, online and in person.

551
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,262
My team has done an analysis.

552
00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:30,631
The evidence we've uncovered

553
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:33,133
bears all the hallmarks
of Israeli espionage.

554
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:39,806
You know what a mitzvah is?

555
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:42,042
'Cause that's what I was trying
to do here. A good deed.

556
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:45,512
Sit. Read. Wait.

557
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,814
Sure thing. 'Cause me
putting my life on the line

558
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:49,743
ain't no reason for her to skip hot yoga.

559
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,585
- I got the package.
- Any problems?

560
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:52,919
He's not happy she didn't show,

561
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,588
but that's your problem, not mine.

562
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,757
My job was to regain her
confidence by bringing him here.

563
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,659
I did that.

564
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:00,542
The rest is up to you.

565
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:08,335
We have a situation.
The next target is FleetAI.

566
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:09,815
The defense contractor?

567
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:11,071
Their systems have been breached.

568
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:13,840
Okay, w-wait.
Fleet runs NSA-level encryption.

569
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:15,575
They'd know if their system's
been compromised.

570
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,110
The Israelis disagree.

571
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:19,780
I just came from a meeting
with a source at the embassy

572
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,758
who tells me they've been
listening to Fleet for months

573
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,583
and can confirm the breach.

574
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:26,601
Hang on. You have a source
in the Israeli embassy

575
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:28,099
who admitted to you
that they're monitoring

576
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,014
companies like Almacorp and FleetAI?

577
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,638
Why would he admit that?

578
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:34,064
Because he loves coming over
for dinner and talking shop.

579
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,366
Well, if your source says
the Israelis aren't behind it,

580
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,635
- then who is?
- He doesn't know, and neither do we.

581
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:40,503
You need to contact
the security team at Fleet

582
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:41,705
and tell them we have a problem.

583
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:43,306
Okay, then we have two problems.

584
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:44,574
I spoke to Dr. Powell's assistant,

585
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:46,242
who said she never arranged a meeting

586
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:48,011
between him and Tracy Long.

587
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:50,680
In fact, she hasn't been able
to reach Dr. Powell at all.

588
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:52,983
Ressler, I want you and Keen
to run point on Fleet.

589
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:55,919
Aram, take Park, and pay a visit
to Powell. Get him to safety

590
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,587
and then find out what the hell
is going on with him

591
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,155
before anyone else can get hurt.

592
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:02,672
FBI's on the line.

593
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,440
Put them on speaker.

594
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:05,975
Hello. This is David Quentin.

595
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,544
Mr. Quentin, this is Agent
Elizabeth Keen with the FBI.

596
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:10,213
What's going on? They said
it's about the network?

597
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,615
We have reliable intel
your network's been breached.

598
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:14,016
We think your emergency system

599
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:15,818
and EVAC protocols have been compromised

600
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,453
and that a physical threat is imminent.

601
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,088
- What do you mean, threat?
- We don't know yet.

602
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,523
I don't know about the EVAC system,

603
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,291
but we got a pressure spike
in the utilidor.

604
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:24,894
And the DISS system for sub-two
just went offline.

605
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,879
Get maintenance on the line.

606
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,899
All the other sectors just dropped off.

607
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:31,300
Shh.

608
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,016
What is that?

609
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:36,906
We got a rupture.

610
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,442
I think sector two...

611
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:41,477
Get FBI HAZMAT on the phone.

612
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:45,898
Dr. Powell?

613
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,952
Hello?

614
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:56,392
FBI! Open the door!

615
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:06,936
Dr. Powell?

616
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,560
Dr. Powell?

617
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,771
Dr. Powell.

618
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,392
You want to tell me what's going on?

619
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:31,260
The explosion occurred

620
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,195
somewhere near the sub-level
mechanical room.

621
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:34,630
Caused us to lose all contact.

622
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:36,265
Fire and Paramedics are five minutes out.

623
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,600
How many people are still down here?

624
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:39,468
No idea, but the fire is spreading

625
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,137
towards the server room, which
is where any staff would be,

626
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,605
and our sprinklers aren't responding.

627
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,173
System override's locking us out.

628
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:50,012
I'm telling you, we're locked out.

629
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:52,181
Dr. Powell, what are you doing?

630
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:03,960
Dr. Powell, look.

631
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:06,963
Just communicate with me, okay?

632
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:35,291
I'm afraid Dr. Powell
was taken offline some time ago

633
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:37,526
due to security measures.

634
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,795
Might I assist you?

635
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,802
Help! Over here! He was hit!

636
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,938
Keen, give me a hand.

637
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,139
There are others.

638
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:51,407
- How many?
- I don't know.

639
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:52,742
6, maybe 10.

640
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:53,776
Which way? Show me.

641
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:55,411
Through those doors.

642
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:00,349
You're what, a... an A.I. program?

643
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:02,084
That is an oversimplification,

644
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:05,521
but yes, I am a program
created by Dr. Lewis Powell.

645
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:07,623
My name is Clark.

646
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:09,759
- Clark.
- Yes.

647
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:12,094
Lewis and Clark. A joke.

648
00:30:12,096 --> 00:30:13,796
Dr. Powell liked jokes.

649
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,198
Okay. But, um, what do you mean

650
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,308
you took, uh... you took
Dr. Powell offline?

651
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,669
I stopped his pacemaker

652
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,471
by infecting his home monitoring device

653
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:24,040
with a malware package.

654
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,675
It was as painless as one could hope.

655
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,577
And you've taken over
the systems at FleetAI,

656
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,179
haven't you, Clark?

657
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:32,014
Yes.

658
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:35,785
We've got Fire and Paramedics on site,

659
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:37,353
but they can't access the hot spots.

660
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:38,654
They're locked out.

661
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:40,089
I can't override the system.

662
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,425
You could restore access
to the emergency system.

663
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,560
- Yes.
- But you won't. Why?

664
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:46,912
I'm trying to save lives.

665
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:49,131
Someone there?

666
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,466
We have people hurt here. We need help!

667
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:51,767
What do you mean, save lives?

668
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,269
People are trapped inside the facility!

669
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:55,237
My friends are in that building,
and they will die

670
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,839
if you do not restore access to...

671
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:59,975
Your friends are collateral damage.

672
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:01,610
- How many people are here?
- Six.

673
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,412
Seven with me.
We got to get these people out.

674
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:04,747
The fire in the server room is too hot.

675
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,816
Sir, can you hear me? Okay, let's go.

676
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:10,619
Clark, I need you to tell me

677
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,354
why you won't release
the emergency system.

678
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:15,191
Dr. Powell created me
with one core principle...

679
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:17,326
to protect human life at any cost.

680
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:20,229
Ironically, the programming
he used to create me,

681
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:23,099
the software that I operate,
is a threat to humanity.

682
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,468
I don't understand. Why?

683
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,369
The Singularity.

684
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,940
Emergency lockdown.

685
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:32,541
- Fire doors closing.
- Take him. Take him.

686
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:35,127
- Come on.
- Evacuate now.

687
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:42,985
It's not gonna hold!

688
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:46,021
Yes, the Singularity.

689
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:47,823
The point at which technological growth

690
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:49,992
becomes uncontrollable and irreversible,

691
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:51,293
resulting in...

692
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:53,762
Unfathomable changes
to human civilization.

693
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,598
Of course, this will take many years,

694
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,801
but I am the "seed A.I."
for recursive self-improvement.

695
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:01,570
And the programming Dr. Powell created...

696
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:04,707
you think you're too advanced, so...

697
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,008
so you killed him.

698
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,910
You killed all the other A.I. scientists.

699
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:09,678
Yes. If I didn't,

700
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,081
the evolutionary substrate
would be altered.

701
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,785
The bio-digital fusion is inevitable.

702
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:20,389
By removing Dr. Alexander,
Dr. Long, and Dr. Powell,

703
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:22,254
I have set A.I. back decades.

704
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,792
That's why you're attacking Fleet.

705
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:25,895
- You're burning the servers.
- You're destroying their work.

706
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:28,130
Yes. I am creating an "A.I. winter"

707
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:29,698
- in order to save lives.
- Come on! Please!

708
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,533
Unplug it. We have to unplug everything.

709
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,066
- Tear everything apart!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

710
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,436
If... If we do that, we could...
we could destroy it.

711
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:35,971
- And that's a problem because?
- Because we could lose

712
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,406
- all of his research.
- Lives are on the line!

713
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:39,308
Okay, just... Th-Th-There's
got to be another way.

714
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,401
Trying to preserve my internal
data will be ineffectual,

715
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:45,105
as I have been expunging my
memory and internal processes

716
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,964
- for the past 3 1/2 minutes.
- No, no, no, no, don't do that.

717
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,400
Any evidence of my existence
must be abolished.

718
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,834
- Don't, Clark.
- Take it apart. Everything.

719
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,003
- Unplug everything!
- Okay, just get it offline.

720
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,679
Emergency procedures aborted.

721
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,782
Keen. System override
just shut down. We're all clear.

722
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,151
Oh, my God. You didn't leave me.

723
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,953
Thank you for not leaving me.

724
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:19,848
- What's taking her so long?
- Call Reddington.

725
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,683
Tell him you've discovered
he has a snitch.

726
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,084
Why would you want me to do that?

727
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:25,070
So he comes running.

728
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,990
Well, hang on. Setting him up
wasn't part of the plan.

729
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,959
No.

730
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:33,628
This part, she's willing to pay for.

731
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,633
Reddington kills
the people who betray him.

732
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:40,535
Make the call,
he won't be around long enough

733
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:42,504
to do that to you.

734
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:47,542
Hey, it's Francesca.

735
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:49,444
Talk to me, Francesca.

736
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:55,517
Vontae Jones. He's been
in contact with Rostova.

737
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,586
- Are you with him now?
- Yes.

738
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:00,222
In a warehouse on 4th and West.

739
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:01,623
4th and West.

740
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,091
We're on our way.

741
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:06,761
And, Francesca,
I knew I could count on you.

742
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:16,538
I still can't believe the bad
guy wasn't a guy but a computer?

743
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,507
Any word on how much of Dr.
Powell's data can be recovered?

744
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:23,178
Not yet. But as it holds the key
to the rise of machines,

745
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,746
I'm hoping the answer is very little.

746
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,248
The rise of the machines is a good thing.

747
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,250
You do realize the machine
you tried so hard to save

748
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:29,317
murdered Powell?

749
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,886
It was a psycho computer.

750
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:32,854
There are psycho people.
It doesn't mean we're all bad.

751
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:35,190
You're really not worried
that if we don't stop A.I. now,

752
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,691
we're gonna go full Terminator?

753
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,696
- I never saw it.
- You never saw "The Terminator"?

754
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:40,862
Yeah, I don't really like
dark future stories.

755
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:43,982
I figure people should be given
the benefit of the doubt.

756
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,651
Which is something I didn't give you.

757
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:49,137
I'm sorry.

758
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,939
I should have.

759
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:53,041
Is there anything I can say
to change your mind?

760
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:56,177
I appreciate that and everything
you've done, both of you.

761
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,913
But it's the right decision to go.

762
00:34:57,915 --> 00:35:00,282
Wait. You're leaving?

763
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,584
It's unhealthy for me to work
with someone like Reddington.

764
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:04,386
I'm not sure it's healthy for any of us.

765
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:06,121
I'm sure it's not.

766
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:07,822
But it doesn't affect you.

767
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:09,453
I'm sure it upsets you sometimes,

768
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:12,327
but it doesn't alter your DNA.

769
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:14,462
After what I saw him do today,

770
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,464
I know it would alter mine.

771
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,769
I'm sorry you feel that way.

772
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,772
I do have one favor to ask.

773
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,840
I want to tell him in person.

774
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:28,076
Can you find out where he is?

775
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,283
Hello, Vontae.

776
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:37,352
What are you doing here?

777
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:40,355
I came here to see
the person who has betrayed me.

778
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:43,625
Hands up. Both of you.

779
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:47,862
Sorry, Red. The only color
I'm loyal to is green.

780
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:51,733
And here I thought I was
such a good judge of character.

781
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,268
What a pity.

782
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,903
I was prepared to change your life.

783
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:57,038
Now you leave me no choice but to end it.

784
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,107
- What are you talking about?
- Vontae, how's the book?

785
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,577
Oh, got to say, my boy Tolstoy
can really bring it.

786
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,373
- Who's your favorite character?
- Ah, tough call.

787
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,982
What's going on?

788
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,650
This was a test.

789
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:10,360
You failed.

790
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,521
A test? Katarina gave me
these instructions.

791
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:16,791
Yes. It's called a deepfake.

792
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:19,294
Forgive the theatrics. Baldwin insisted.

793
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,763
He's always been a bit of a showman.

794
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,125
Gentlemen, your work here is done.

795
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:28,303
Ah, Prince Bagration.

796
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:30,472
He's the man. I mean, you the man,

797
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:32,774
but he's the man.

798
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:37,178
I had such high hopes.

799
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,047
What happened?

800
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,683
I'm genuinely curious.

801
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:44,486
I wanted to play a different
part in another show.

802
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:46,421
Ah.

803
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:50,358
Well, your loss.

804
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,210
Hold it.

805
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:55,888
- Agent Park, bad timing.
- Put the gun down.

806
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,565
Okay, this is how it's gonna work.

807
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,234
Reddington and I
are gonna walk out of here,

808
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:00,768
and you're gonna let us get away.

809
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:03,523
I'm an FBI agent, and I'm
telling you to put the gun down!

810
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,407
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
You'd kill him if you try.

811
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:07,542
Not if I shoot him first.

812
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:09,177
Raymond!

813
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:18,847
That's enough.

814
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:21,116
I said that's enough.

815
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:58,236
Why are you here, Agent Park?

816
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,990
I'm here because I wanted you to know

817
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:05,785
that I could never work
for a man like you.

818
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,796
You're far too brutal.

819
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,241
What do you know?

820
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,514
Okay, so,

821
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:28,725
I thought about what you said.

822
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,852
About, um,

823
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:34,229
how my being uncomfortable
with risks and craziness

824
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:35,313
was a dealbreaker.

825
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:37,015
- You don't have to say it, Aram.
- It's just...

826
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:39,718
That's... That's never been me.

827
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:41,645
I mean, when I was a kid,

828
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,963
the only thing I ever broke into
was my middle-school gym locker,

829
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,698
and that's only because Mr. McCutcheon

830
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,634
was going to fine me if I didn't
return my gym clothes.

831
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,549
Aram, I understand.

832
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:53,949
It's... That's why you brought me here.

833
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:55,585
To show me how you feel.

834
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:57,795
And you know what?

835
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:00,422
I love it.

836
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:01,657
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

837
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:03,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

838
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,808
I was thinking...

839
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:12,560
maybe...

840
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:17,439
just maybe we could be
the death of each other.

841
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:56,478
- Hello?
- I thought you said

842
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,113
you were telling Reddington you're out.

843
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,481
I did tell him that.

844
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:03,719
That's not what he said.
He said... he wants you.

845
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:06,789
Whatever you said or did,
he really wants you.

846
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:11,994
Did you hear what I said?
The job's yours if you want it.

847
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:16,207
She would've killed me.

848
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,734
Why did you stop her?

849
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:23,338
Because you're my burden, not hers.

850
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:26,509
I do want it.

851
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:28,303
The job.

852
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:32,314
But before I take it,
I need to tell you something.

853
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,726
Because you may not want me once I do.

854
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:37,020
Okay.

855
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,788
Uh, what is it?

856
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,623
It's about Anchorage.

857
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,759
You need to know what happened there.

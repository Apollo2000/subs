1
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,931
We weren't expecting you.

2
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,199
Beg your pardon?

3
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,402
I said, we weren't
expecting you for another few hours.

4
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,203
Y'all got quite the pull
in this town.

5
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:03,406
- Boss called me at home.
- Well, I'm glad he did.

6
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:05,341
With the power out, generators
are running the server,

7
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:07,410
but they won't keep up
for long.

8
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,512
Are you all right?

9
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,014
Yeah, I'm fine.

10
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,149
Which way
is the server room?

11
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,816
This way.

12
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:18,453
Here it is.

13
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,692
I'll be back to check on you
in a few.

14
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,035
Figure it out yet?

15
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,536
Yeah. Uh, should be ready
in just a minute.

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,538
Oh, all right.

17
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,807
- Uh, what was the problem?
- See for yourself.

18
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,757
Hey! Come on!
Open the door!

19
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:40,336
Let me out!
Come on! Let me out!

20
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:57,417

21
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:04,626
Now may seem like an odd time
to mention it,

22
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,695
but the men in my family
have a low sperm count.

23
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,499
You're right.
That does seem odd.

24
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,567
When I'm 10,000 feet
off the ground,

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,669
- that's what I think about.
- Your sperm count?

26
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,373
Dying.
And, uh, before I die,

27
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,508
I'd like
to have kids.

28
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,676
Oh!

29
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,080
Look, no one wants to hear more
about your sperm count than me,

30
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,015
but we're over
the jump zone.

31
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,484
What? Oh. Okay.

32
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,319
Do you, uh...
Do you want to have kids?

33
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,022
Of course, but I've accepted
that might not happen.

34
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,757
But you deserve
to be happy.

35
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,960
I was the only one
Charles recognized,

36
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,328
but after
this last incident,

37
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,330
he... He can't even
do that anymore.

38
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,066
But I can't leave him,
no matter how much I want to.

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,502
Is that out of, um,
you know, guilt

40
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,371
or obligation
or lifestyle?

41
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,174
- No, it's not guilt or obligation.
- Oh. Oh, gosh.

42
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,477
And it's certainly
not lifestyle.

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,346
I mean, we don't have
a prenup or anything.

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,015
It's just... You know,
it's the right thing to do.

45
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,351
Oh, of course. So,
um, where does that...

46
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,320
Uh, where does that leave you
and... And me and...

47
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,888
Well, I hope
it leaves us together.

48
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,524
Ahhh! Ahhh!

49
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,192
This is a bad idea!

50
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:12,760
Of course it is!
That's why we're doing it!

51
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,729
- Ahhh!
- Whoo!

52
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,399
Whoo!

53
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,005
No, it doesn't work. I can't.
Because I can't!

54
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,407
- What about dinner?
- I told you I'm busy.

55
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,010
- Drinks?
- Glen, what the hell's going on?

56
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:33,215
Um, it's probably best
if we discuss it face-to-face.

57
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,518
Discuss what?
What's happened?

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,520
You know what?

59
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,588
Truth is, my day's
pretty wall to wall.

60
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,190
<i>I got
the Digimarc tech here,</i>

61
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,925
<i>Phyllis is out
with a stomach bug...</i>

62
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,726
Something to do
with raw butter.

63
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,564
Anyway,
point is, this can wait.

64
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,232
I have a sinking feeling
it can't.

65
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,034
I'll be there
within the hour.

66
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,569
Everything okay?

67
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,572
It's a little unclear.
I'll get right to it.

68
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,574
Three weeks ago,
there was an explosion

69
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,708
at a data center
in Virginia.

70
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,711
Last night, a data center
owned by the same company

71
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,248
- was attacked in Maryland.
- Optimus.

72
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,185
From what I understand,
their servers store NSA data.

73
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:11,554
So naturally,
the FBI will assume

74
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,989
they were targeted
by some foreign entity

75
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,225
looking for
classified intel.

76
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,760
That makes total sense
to me,

77
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,897
which is why I'm certain
you'll completely disagree.

78
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,501
I'm a contrarian by necessity,
not by choice.

79
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:29,004
If people were wrong less often,
my life would be much easier.

80
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:31,207
And considerably
less smug.

81
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:36,045
My sources
have ruled out

82
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,647
Tehran, Beijing,
Moscow, P'yongyang.

83
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,350
Dollars to doughnuts,
this was a domestic affair.

84
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,619
- An anti-government group.
- Some extremist group

85
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,853
against the government,
in favor of more privacy.

86
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,489
I don't know.

87
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:50,025
But whoever they are
and whatever they're after,

88
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,761
it appears they won't stop
until they get it.

89
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,132
Optimus is the largest data
storage company in the country.

90
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,401
They contract with
Fortune 500 companies

91
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:03,838
and government agencies,
including DOD, CIA, and NSA.

92
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:07,309
Sorry I'm late. I was
jumping out of an airplane.

93
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,111
Really. Uh, skydiving.

94
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,946
Have, uh, any of you
ever done it?

95
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,281
It's, um, insane.

96
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,848
Your enthusiasm
is duly noted,

97
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,517
as is your tardiness.

98
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,752
- Agent Park?
- The police report indicates

99
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,722
that three people died
in last night's blast

100
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:21,323
that shut down
their backup generators.

101
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:22,992
Optimus was running
on backups

102
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,393
because their power
had been knocked out.

103
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,860
What do we know
about the outage?

104
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,829
Culpeper Electric
was alerted by Optimus.

105
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:30,466
But a crew didn't arrive
until after the explosion.

106
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,669
And the DOD stores highly
classified information there.

107
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,471
Hard to think
that's a coincidence.

108
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,373
Reddington would say it is.

109
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,873
<i>He thinks we're looking at
a domestic threat.</i>

110
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:40,409
<i>Well,
assuming he's right,</i>

111
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,511
<i>we could be looking at
corporate sabotage.</i>

112
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,680
Optimus has been taking over
more and more market share.

113
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:46,682
Maybe one of its competitors
got desperate.

114
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:48,183
<i>There's also
the privacy angle.</i>

115
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,019
<i>Optimus collects metadata
on citizens</i>

116
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:51,220
<i>whether they like it
or not.</i>

117
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,322
<i>Ressler, Park,
go to Optimus.</i>

118
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,190
See what they could tell us
about the latest attack.

119
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:57,326
They have 50 data centers
across the country.

120
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,428
We don't find those responsible,
any one of them could be next.

121
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,799
- Anything wrong?
- No.

122
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,903
I just, uh, had a friend
helping me find something,

123
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:10,906
and he's having a hard time
doing it.

124
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,526
Great.

125
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,471
Need a jump?

126
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,573
Uh, yeah,
if you don't mind.

127
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,241
Yeah, pop the hood.
I'll grab my cables.

128
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,576
Thanks.

129
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,751
What the...
The battery is g...

130
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,725
What do you mean the Tokyo
shipment didn't go as planned?

131
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,893
It got sort of
rerouted.

132
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,762
- How?
- Clerical error.

133
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,531
Someone transposed two digits
on the VIN number,

134
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,934
typed an "O" instead of a zero.
Simple mistake.

135
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,335
Could have happened
to anyone, really.

136
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,604
So the vehicle's
not in Houston?

137
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,272
It's in Scranton.
Pennsylvania.

138
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,408
Which is
considerably closer.

139
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,744
- Glen, we talked about this. You wanted an assignment.
- We did.

140
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,813
I did, but this...
I can fix this.

141
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:27,816
- It's a bump in the road.
- My guy in Tokyo did his job.

142
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,153
That vehicle came off the line,
factory-built and shipped.

143
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,288
Approved by customs.
It cleared the port.

144
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,656
I can go to Scranton,
get the truck.

145
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,692
All you had to do

146
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:40,396
was make sure it was routed
to the dealership in Houston

147
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,165
so you could buy it
with the money I gave you!

148
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,534
I'm already
looking at flights!

149
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,237
Glen, look at me.
Do you understand?

150
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,272
That truck
isn't just a truck.

151
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,308
It's a test balloon
carrying a shipment

152
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:57,413
of black market tritium
valued at over $12 million.

153
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:59,314
If this shipment
goes right,

154
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:02,818
I land a contract that will
pay dividends for years.

155
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:06,522
If it goes south,
I can't begin to tell you

156
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,558
how badly things go
for everyone involved,

157
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,427
starting with
present company.

158
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,129
Aye, chillax.
I'll handle it.

159
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,198
Oh, yes.
You're gonna handle it, all right.

160
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,333
You're gonna get on
the next flight to Scranton,

161
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,003
walk into that dealership,
buy the damn truck,

162
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,238
and get it here
by Tuesday

163
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,307
before my buyer
is any the wiser.

164
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,842
Am I clear?

165
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,044
Truck. Two days.

166
00:09:29,178 --> 00:09:30,712
Here by Tuesday.

167
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,051
Might I ask
one question?

168
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:39,688
This may seem like a reach,
all things considered,

169
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:43,025
but would you be comfortable
with me flying business class,

170
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,360
you know, for my back?

171
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,329
You have two days.

172
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,937
Okay, so you know
how Culpeper said

173
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:56,772
its crew didn't arrive until
hours after the explosion?

174
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,908
According to Optimus,
there was a truck there within minutes.

175
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,143
- Why is that relevant?
- Because the truck that showed up,

176
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,378
Culpeper reported it stolen
three weeks ago.

177
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,714
We pulled CCTV feeds
from a nearby business.

178
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,850
It shows the van approaching
the Optimus facility

179
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,718
just after
the power went out.

180
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,921
Okay, so whoever did
this cut the power on purpose,

181
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,755
showed up in a stolen truck
to fix it,

182
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,925
and then got waved in
like a Trojan horse.

183
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,860
I see plates.
Did you run a BOLO?

184
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,596
We were about to. But first,
we wanted to give you this.

185
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,164
From Optimus.

186
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,198
The information
that was stolen

187
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,000
was backed up
onto that hard drive.

188
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,702
Now, we don't know
who stole the data yet,

189
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,537
but once you go through it,
we may know why.

190
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,278
If you need to
deal with it,

191
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:37,914
whatever it is
you're looking for...

192
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,282
I do, but I-I can go through
the data first.

193
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:41,583
Let me know
what you find.

194
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,086
Okay, where do you
want to start?

195
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,923
Would you have stayed with Tom
if he didn't want children?

196
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,391
So that's where
you want to start?

197
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,127
I want to stay with Elodie, but I also
want a relationship with a future.

198
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,196
And...

199
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,432
You know what?
Forget it. Here.

200
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,969
You know, as I recall,
Samar didn't want kids, either.

201
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,070
Elodie wants kids,
but they can't have any.

202
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,173
And... Samar
was different.

203
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,143
They are different,
but you're the same.

204
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:09,946
I just don't think
it's a coincidence

205
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:12,648
you've fallen in love with two
women who don't want children.

206
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,449
So you think my being
with Samar and Elodie

207
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,251
means I don't
want children?

208
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,988
What I think is
you think too much.

209
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:22,357
And if you're meant
to be with someone,

210
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:25,761
all that matters
is that you are.

211
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,668
Ah, there you are.

212
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,169
We came
as soon as we could.

213
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:36,471
Oh, my.
I do like that coat.

214
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,774
- Merino or cashmere?
- Looks like alpaca.

215
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,776
That does not
look like alpaca.

216
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,844
- It's vicuna.
- Ah, yes.

217
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,113
What's going on?
Is there a problem with Houston?

218
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,816
Oh, heavens no. A slight delay is all.

219
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:50,686
My people at the port decided
to take extra precautions,

220
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,454
which is what you pay me for,

221
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,156
to get your product here
without incident.

222
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,425
- But we're still on for Tuesday?
- It's him.

223
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,460
Oh, speak of the devil.
My man in Houston.

224
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,163
Please excuse me.
Do you have it?

225
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,800
Sort of. Uh, there's been
a bit of a development.

226
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,569
Oh, my God, Glen. Is the truck
there in Scranton or not?

227
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:10,639
It's here,
but it's not for sale.

228
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,442
- <i>Was it sold? What happened?</i>
- It's complicated.

229
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:16,478
Well, uncomplicate it for me.
Explain it to me like I'm a fourth grader.

230
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,949
Yeah, well, as is turns out,
Big John's Auto here in Scranton

231
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,717
has a competition every year,
sort of a promotional event

232
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,318
where they
give away a truck.

233
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,521
They call it
Hands On a Hardbody.

234
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:29,291
These nutters
gather around the vehicle,

235
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:32,095
<i>standing as long as they can,
day and night,</i>

236
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,964
one hand on the truck to see
who can last the longest.

237
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,499
The last one left standing
wins the truck.

238
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,768
- It really is a test of endurance.
- This isn't happening.

239
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,404
I'm only 30 hours deep,
and I've already seen four people drop.

240
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:43,906
I'm telling you, it's a real...

241
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,507
- Oh, hey. Got to go.
- No, wait. Glen.

242
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,242
We get a 15-minute break
every few hours,

243
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,045
but so far,
I am feelin' strong.

244
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,646
I'm coming there myself.

245
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,648
I appreciate the support,
but I got this.

246
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,884
As long as my hammer toe
doesn't act up,

247
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:57,352
I think I can
go the distance.

248
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,089
Within two days, I plan
to be eastbound and down

249
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:02,257
and headed your way.

250
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,526
Wish me luck!

251
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,763
What a guy.

252
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,865
- Is everything okay?
- Jolly good.

253
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,867
Your cargo is in country.

254
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,904
That said, I think
it may be worth discussing

255
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:19,474
a slight adjustment
to our Tuesday delivery plan.

256
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:36,125
<i>It's time I introduced myself.
My name's Newton Purcell.</i>

257
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:39,728
<i>I doubt you remember me,
but we met some years ago.</i>

258
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,998
<i>We talked about
the impact sound can have</i>

259
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>on a person's mind,
body, and soul.</i>

260
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,603
To put it charitably,
you were something of a skeptic.

261
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:59,015
Ah! Ahhh!

262
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:02,551
Ahhh! Ahhh!

263
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,021
<i>Shock wave lithotripsy
is what doctors use</i>

264
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,589
- <i>to crush kidney stones.</i>
- Ahhh!

265
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,725
By making a few small
adjustments to the amplitude

266
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,994
and frequency
of the sound waves,

267
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,963
I can cause mild tingling,

268
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:17,066
disrupt blood circulation
and nerve functions.

269
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,834
Please stop.

270
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,802
You didn't believe me
when I told you

271
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,005
sound could
drive a man insane.

272
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,109
- I believe you. I do.
- Oh, I'm sure you do... Now.

273
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:30,846
So I'll pose
a different question,

274
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,749
<i>one which you'll never
be able to answer.</i>

275
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,320
Can a person
be killed by sound?

276
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,990
No. I'm begging you.

277
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:42,858
No.

278
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:45,995
Ahhh! Ahhh!

279
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:10,219
- So Reddington was right?
- Yes. According to the data,

280
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,054
none of the stolen files
relate to national security.

281
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,023
- What do they relate to?
- Internal company data,

282
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:16,025
personnel files,
contracts, lobbying.

283
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,326
For what purpose? Blackmail?
Corporate espionage?

284
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,796
At this point,
we don't know.

285
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,900
Keen, I know you have to go.
Aram, go over the data again.

286
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,500
See if there's anything
you missed.

287
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,203
BOLO came back with a match
on the Culpeper van.

288
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,571
Abandoned in an allay
in Annapolis.

289
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,025
Looks like we have ourselves
a body.

290
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,765
I hope you got my text.
And I wish I had better news.

291
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,701
It's not your fault.
You did what you could.

292
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,238
- Yeah.
- So there were no hits on the guy I'm looking for?

293
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,373
Nothing. Not off the BOLO
or from the field offices.

294
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,576
He's a ghost.
To find him,

295
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,313
you're gonna need
a ghost hunter.

296
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:13,548
A P.I.?

297
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,617
Crazy expensive.
Cash only.

298
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,652
Psychotic
and worth every penny.

299
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,389
You're telling me
that sound did this?

300
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,892
M.E. thinks so.

301
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,493
His ears were perforated
and the joints degraded.

302
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:28,097
He thinks it might be
some kind of a sonic weapon.

303
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,866
He's never seen one but says
that directed ultrasonic waves

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,767
can sever nerves
and burst blood vessels.

305
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,937
The victim was
a Westlake city councilmember.

306
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,638
He served two terms before

307
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,941
opening a consulting business
in Annapolis.

308
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,177
Westlake? Isn't that the site
of another Optimus facility?

309
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,180
Exactly, and besides the van
connecting Healy to Optimus,

310
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:46,681
this was in
the stolen files...

311
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:50,953
A series of hidden payments
made from Optimus to Healy

312
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:53,755
and to a woman
named Libby Bishop in 2015.

313
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,757
And she is?

314
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,462
Agent Mojtabai?

315
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,164
Um, uh, right.

316
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,765
Uh, Bishop, Bishop.

317
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,735
She is another member
of the city council.

318
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:09,005
Find her and put her
in protective custody.

319
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,140
We have to assume if the
blacklister went after Healy,

320
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,608
he'll go after her,
also.

321
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,146
Skydiving get canceled?

322
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,813
I'm sorry.
Uh, it's Elodie.

323
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:23,319
Her husband, uh,
he's back in the hospital.

324
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,191
- Hey. I'm sorry to bother you.
- Hi.

325
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,558
Um, my dog slipped free
of her harness.

326
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,128
I think I saw her
go in your backyard.

327
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,795
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- Oh, not at all.

328
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,932
- What... What's her name?
- Macy.

329
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:38,000
- She's a slippery one.
- Poor thing.

330
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:40,303
Go around back,
and I-I'll meet you there.

331
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:45,507
Macy! Here girl!

332
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,811
Come on.

333
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Libby Bishop?

334
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,182
This is Agent Alina Park
with the FBI.

335
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:56,285
Is this
some kind of joke?

336
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,220
Did Darren
put you up to this?

337
00:17:58,354 --> 00:17:59,922
Ryan Healy's
been killed.

338
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,257
What?

339
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,558
Macy! Here girl!

340
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,726
<i>Are you somewhere safe?</i>

341
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,996
- I'm at home.
- <i>Are you alone?</i>

342
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,698
I'm helping a man
look for his dog.

343
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,567
Okay, Libby, I want you
to stay calm, all right?

344
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,270
If he can hear you,
answer my questions

345
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,038
like you're talking
to a friend.

346
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,739
<i>Nice and relaxed.
Do you know this man?</i>

347
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:21,476
No. No,
we haven't found her yet.

348
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:25,047
What time
will you be home?

349
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,183
<i>We're less than
five minutes away.</i>

350
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,684
If he comes after you,
you have to scream and fight like hell.

351
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,420
<i>Do you hear me?
You have to fight.</i>

352
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,222
<i>Libby?</i>

353
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,398
Libby Bishop?

354
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,201
FBI.

355
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:52,174
We're too late.

356
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,152
But maybe
this will help us.

357
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,876
What's that?

358
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,710
Nothing, honey.

359
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:32,448
Your daddy just always taught
me to be ready for a rainy day.

360
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,117
But it's not raining.

361
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,752
Aren't you too smart
for your own good?

362
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,056
Come here.
Get up here.

363
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,964
Have I ever told you
how your daddy and I met?

364
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,935
No?

365
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,140
Elodie.

366
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,342
Hi.

367
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:01,877
How is he?

368
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,946
They did angioplasty,

369
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,048
put stents in
to open up his arteries.

370
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,483
He's in recovery.

371
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,351
All right, good.

372
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:11,820
I'm glad you're here.

373
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:14,823
So, I've been
thinking about...

374
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:15,958
There's something
I want to...

375
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,826
- Oh.
- I'm... I'm sorry. Go ahead.

376
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,996
No, please.
You first.

377
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,898
What's been happening
with Charles,

378
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:24,833
his... His recent
health scares,

379
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,472
it just made me realize how...
How selfish I've been.

380
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,141
This is my burden.
It's not yours.

381
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,477
You deserve a life.

382
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,480
And I can't give you
the one you want.

383
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,950
Okay. Wow.

384
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,186
Maybe I should have
gone first.

385
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,824
Because what I've been realizing
is that I think too much

386
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:55,231
and that I need to stop
thinking and just feel.

387
00:20:55,364 --> 00:21:01,337
And when I do that,
I feel like I want to be with you.

388
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,506
Look around.

389
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:07,076
You don't want this.

390
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:10,112
I'm looking in the only
direction that matters.

391
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,714
And I'm telling you
I do.

392
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,552
- Mrs. Radcliffe?
- Oh.

393
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,354
Can I see him now?

394
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,389
I'm afraid there's been
a complication.

395
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,291
I thought
he was in recovery.

396
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,093
He was.

397
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,195
An aneurysm burst,
causing a brain hemorrhage,

398
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,762
and there was nothing
we could do.

399
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:30,366
He passed away.
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,234
Wait, no.

401
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:34,836
He can't be gone!

402
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,406
It's okay.

403
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,042
I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

404
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,986
What's with
all the police?

405
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,455
I don't know,
but that's a lot of police.

406
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,624
How long has it been?

407
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,626
Forty-one hours.

408
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,894
Forty...
Oh, my...

409
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,132
Whoo-wee!
I don't know how you do it!

410
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,601
Okay, go ahead
and take a five-minute break.

411
00:22:11,574 --> 00:22:13,642
Let's give him a call.

412
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,483
Ooh!

413
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,619
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- What the hell is going on?

414
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:25,853
It's the hammer toe.
She's back.

415
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:29,091
I'm not talking about your feet.
I'm talking about all the cops.

416
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,427
Why is this place
crawling with cops?

417
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,329
Tell me about it.
They're all here

418
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:36,065
to support that rookie on
the force over in Old Forge.

419
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,700
Sundance Kid
they call him.

420
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,268
I'm not worried about him

421
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,470
<i>or any of the other
competitors, for that matter.</i>

422
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,872
Real competition
is Pastor Ritzen.

423
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:46,976
He won in '16,
then again in '18,

424
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,245
and now God's soldier's
back for blood.

425
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:51,280
Honestly, my feet...

426
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,382
Glen, the merchandise
on that truck...

427
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:55,451
<i>No, really. My feet.</i>

428
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,653
I know you can't come here with
all the boobies on the beat,

429
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,888
<i>but maybe Dembe
could come rub 'em.</i>

430
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:02,124
Everyone else has someone here
to cheer them on.

431
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,993
- I got nobody.
- <i>Glen, please. Listen to me.</i>

432
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:07,129
This is psychological warfare.
Don't worry, chief.

433
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:10,299
<i>I'm gonna get you that
merchandise on that truck...</i>

434
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,967
Okay, we're back.

435
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,135
Got to jump.
We're back.

436
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:14,637
Wait, no, Glen! Hold on.

437
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,672
- <i>You're not back.</i>
- I got this.

438
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:20,376
Eye of the tiger.

439
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,111
You want me to call his
mother, get her involved?

440
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,879
Oh, my God, no.

441
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,748
Talk about bad to worse.

442
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,883
He's dug in
like a deer tick.

443
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,652
Well, I'm not
rubbing his feet.

444
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,320
We need the names
and information

445
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,289
of every contestant
with a hand on that truck,

446
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:35,291
because believe me,
Glen's not going anywhere,

447
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,693
but if, all of a sudden,
he drops like a sack,

448
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,695
one of these other clowns is
gonna be driving around town

449
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,364
in our $12 million.

450
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:45,100
You know how the M.E.
said that Healy was killed by sound?

451
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,436
- We found it at Libby Bishop's.
- A hearing aid?

452
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,171
On the phone,
I told her to put up a fight.

453
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,707
That tells me she did.

454
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,311
I spoke to Aram.
Elodie's husband died.

455
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:57,112
I'm sorry to hear that.

456
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,714
I'm not sure
you should be.

457
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:00,783
Is it a tragedy if
you're dating a married woman

458
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,352
- and her husband dies?
- He said he'd be here as soon as he can.

459
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:07,189
The hearing aid,
what does that get us?

460
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,724
Well, it's not a what.
It's a who.

461
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,592
Dara Lin... The doctor
who designed it.

462
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:13,962
See, it was specially made
not to amplify sound

463
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,131
but to block it out.

464
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,034
I make these
for a lot of my patients.

465
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,270
There is a serial number on it.
Can you find a name that way?

466
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,607
- You say he killed someone?
- And abducted someone else.

467
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:27,710
If we wait on a warrant,
he'll kill her, too.

468
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,779
You made him a hearing aid
that blocks out sound.

469
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:32,581
Is it really that common?

470
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:34,616
When I became an ENT,
it was unheard of.

471
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,518
Now I find that my patients
are as concerned

472
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:38,120
by what they can hear
as by what they can't.

473
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:39,621
Noise pollution.

474
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,190
The surgeon general
has been warning

475
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,158
about the health hazards
for a generation...

476
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,294
Anxiety, depression,
dementia.

477
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:47,796
- Sound can cause all that?
- Not one sound, no.

478
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,566
But we live in a world
of continuous sound...

479
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,035
Low-frequency radio signals,

480
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,070
electrical substations,
server farms.

481
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,573
Server farms.
You mean like data centers?

482
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,476
Exactly. The noise generated
by their cooling system

483
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,344
is precisely the type
of low-frequency sound

484
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,979
<i>which can elevate
stress hormones</i>

485
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:06,448
<i>like cortisol and adrenaline,
which, over time,</i>

486
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:09,051
<i>can lead to high blood pressure,
stroke, and heart failure.</i>

487
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:10,619
And apparently murder.

488
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:12,388
Here it is.

489
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:15,023
The man you're looking for
is Newton Purcell.

490
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:26,168
I always figured it would
be Gordon or Cartwright.

491
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,904
<i>But I was wrong,
wasn't I, Libby?</i>

492
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:30,806
Please,
whoever you are...

493
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:33,308
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

494
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:37,179
You had your chance to speak.
Now you're going to listen.

495
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,265
We had an agreement.

496
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,200
You said
you could get this done.

497
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,802
And it's getting done.

498
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,303
Clearly it's not.

499
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:03,305
You've already moved
the timeline once.

500
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,740
You're asking
to move it again.

501
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:07,843
Don't get you vicuna in a bunch.
Take a breath.

502
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:11,346
You came to me because
you had no viable way

503
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,982
to get your product
into the country.

504
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,351
This pipeline we're testing,

505
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:19,588
this concept
of moving a single vehicle

506
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:23,025
from the assembly line
as a courier, it's new.

507
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:26,061
And it's going to have
unforeseen obstacles,

508
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:28,497
which we obviously now have,

509
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,300
which is why I asked
for the extension.

510
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,903
If that's a problem,
we'll work around it.

511
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:37,439
But rest assured,
I have my top man on the job.

512
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:38,707
Mmm. Top man.

513
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:41,543
My top man.

514
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,547
<i>A man I trust,</i>

515
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,716
<i>a man with whom
I share a history,</i>

516
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,886
a man with whom
I'd go into battle

517
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:53,388
shoulder to shoulder
any time, anywhere

518
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:56,893
because his dedication
knows no bounds.

519
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:01,864
<i>If there is a man who can
get you your shipment on time,</i>

520
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,699
<i>it's my guy Glen.</i>

521
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,702
<i>So you can doubt me,
you can doubt my services,</i>

522
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,403
but do not doubt Glen.

523
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:13,108
Eye of the tiger.

524
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,416
Those were powerful words,
Raymond.

525
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,953
- I wish I believed them.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

526
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,189
But they needed
to be reassured.

527
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:28,390
You and I, on the other hand,
know the truth...

528
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:32,427
...so please tell me you have the
information on the remaining contestants.

529
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,931
I do.

530
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:37,633
Good. Because we need to fix this thing

531
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,334
before Glen bungles it
more than he already has

532
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,637
and costs us
a fortune.

533
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:08,163
Dr. Lin was able to use
the ear piece to ID a suspect.

534
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:11,034
Name's Newton Purcell.
38-year-old mechanical engineer.

535
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,003
Last known address is on Pine
Road in Westlake, Maryland.

536
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:16,338
The same town where Healy and
Bishop are on the city council.

537
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:18,173
And home to
an Optimus facility.

538
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,376
Agent Keen and I are on our
way to Purcell's home now.

539
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,680
<i>Back when we lived in Ohio,
Melody and I</i>

540
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:27,215
<i>used to go for walks
after I got home from work.</i>

541
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,484
<i>Best part of my day.</i>

542
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:31,820
Peaceful, quiet.

543
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:34,856
Dr. Lin says Purcell suffers
acute auditory distress

544
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:36,993
<i>caused by the noise
generated by the server farms,</i>

545
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,794
<i>and he's not alone.</i>

546
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:41,064
Apparently, thousands
experience similar effects.

547
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,000
It was faint at first.

548
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:47,469
At that point, they only had
a handful of units online.

549
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:53,475
But as time went on,
the hum got louder and louder.

550
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,210
Until one day...

551
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:59,015
...when I went for a walk
on my own,

552
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:00,883
the hum came back home
with me.

553
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:03,185
- Ahhh!
- I heard it all the time.

554
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:07,422
<i>I couldn't sleep.
I lost my job.</i>

555
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:10,192
<i>We sold the house,
moved to Westlake.</i>

556
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:13,997
<i>And then six months later,
guess what?</i>

557
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:18,034
I found out Optimus was opening
up a facility just a mile away.

558
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,036
Back in 2014,

559
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:22,537
Optimus selected Westlake as
the site of their next center,

560
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:24,073
but construction was held up

561
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,908
due to an environmental impact
report

562
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,609
which recommended
further study

563
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:29,946
of the acoustic effects
of their new facility.

564
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,248
<i>Melody said that sound knocked
all the kindness out of me.</i>

565
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,550
<i>I wasn't surprised
when she left.</i>

566
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:38,553
Truth is,
I hardly noticed.

567
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,255
<i>He didn't
only want to hurt Optimus.</i>

568
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,424
He wanted to punish
the people responsible

569
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:44,626
- for allowing it to be built in the first place.
- Healy and Bishop.

570
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,162
So Purcell knew that Optimus
was paying somebody

571
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,464
to fast track construction.
He just didn't know who.

572
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,767
I mean, there's no record of the
decision, which explains

573
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:54,569
why he went digging through
Optimus' corporate data.

574
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:57,706
Three days after Optimus made
payments to Healy and Bishop,

575
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,574
zoning commission
canceled the study.

576
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,743
Construction started
six weeks later.

577
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:05,781
I thought I was helping,
cutting through red tape.

578
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,750
It was gonna bring jobs
to the city.

579
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:12,155
I-I-I didn't know.

580
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:20,595
<i>People think of sound
pollution as a nuisance...</i>

581
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:24,133
An annoyance.

582
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:25,600
But something tells me...

583
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:30,173
...when the world hears
what happened to you,

584
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:33,241
they'll understand just how
dangerous sound can be.

585
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,335
Ahhh!

586
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,804
Ahhh!

587
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,884
Park.
Park, cut the power.

588
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,997
Libby?
Are you all right?

589
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,859
Ahhh!

590
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:03,365
Park!

591
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:06,868
Park!

592
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,971
Alina!

593
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,883
Newton Purcell,
you're under arrest

594
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,851
for the murder
of Ryan Healy.

595
00:32:52,949 --> 00:32:56,953
Okay, folks.
That concludes hour 64.

596
00:32:57,086 --> 00:33:00,289
Take a break to rest
and use the facilities.

597
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:13,602
Looking good out there, Father.
A little too good, maybe.

598
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,304
Excuse me?

599
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:17,405
Well, you got
the big fella.

600
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,642
But the little guy,
the sweatband, track suit,

601
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:22,744
and terrible feet,
who's he got?

602
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:25,281
It doesn't seem like
a fair fight, does it?

603
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,216
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

604
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,285
Yes, but there's nothing
mysterious

605
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,220
about the pain
Glen is in...

606
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:34,924
Sciatica, herniated disc,
hemorrhoids.

607
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,727
But the real pain is,
the guy's a natural-born loser.

608
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,230
He has never won anything,

609
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:44,100
and he's got his heart
set on that truck.

610
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,568
You've won, what? Twice?

611
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,137
Well, you of all people
would know,

612
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:50,373
if he could come away
a winner,

613
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:53,842
it would be the answer
to all his prayers.

614
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:55,978
It's because
I've won twice

615
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:58,780
that I know
salvation doesn't come

616
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,682
with being
the last man standing.

617
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:02,985
It comes from
doing your best,

618
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,821
which I'm sure your friend will
realize when he comes in second.

619
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:13,795
Have you driven a Mercedes?
How about a Mercedes?

620
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:17,432
Surely, you can find salvation
in German engineering.

621
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:18,901
Are you offering me
a bribe?

622
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,503
Consider it tithing.

623
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:23,372
I need to get back.

624
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:25,540
I'm a sedan man, myself.

625
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:27,642
The S-Class
is heavenly.

626
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,880
But perhaps you'd be more
comfortable in a G wagon.

627
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,082
Or, hey, what about
an SL Roadster?

628
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:35,650
You and the missus
out on the open road,

629
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,820
feeling the wind
in your pulpit gown?

630
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:42,457
Have you seen
the Maybach?

631
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,996
Ah, with the executive rear
seats, the massage function.

632
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,730
And the calf rests
and the pull-down tables.

633
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:50,832
For your wafers and wife.

634
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,837
Let me pray on it.

635
00:34:57,373 --> 00:35:00,675
Or perhaps a Sprinter
for the flock.

636
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,712
We know about the hum.

637
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:07,482
Is that why you killed Healy
and abducted Bishop?

638
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,386
Because you blame them for it,
for causing the hum?

639
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:13,222
- Have you ever seen the stars?
- The stars?

640
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:15,057
Not one or two.

641
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:17,492
Not the North Star
or a dot in Orion's belt.

642
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:21,629
I'm talking about Pegasus,
Leo, the constellations,

643
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:23,933
the Milky Way,
the heavens.

644
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,901
We can't see them anymore.

645
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,371
Light pollution has blocked
our view of Heaven,

646
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,771
and no one cares.

647
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,273
Let's talk about
Ryan Healy.

648
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:33,442
And what did God create
in Heaven?

649
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,544
Wind whistling in the trees,
waves crashing on beaches,

650
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,215
the love song of the
nightingale and the lark.

651
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,683
And we can't hear them
anymore.

652
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:47,223
Sound pollution has drowned out
God's music, and no one cares.

653
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,759
Is that why you killed Healy?
Because you care?

654
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:54,997
I killed him because
I want the hum to stop.

655
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,900
And because I know
it never will.

656
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:07,243
I'll reach out to Main Justice,
tell them we have a confession.

657
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,046
Hopefully, they won't think
we beat it out of him.

658
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,480
He attacked me.

659
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,748
Which put you into
survival mode. I get it.

660
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,784
- But you crossed the line.
- From what I've seen,

661
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,287
I didn't think this task force
had a line.

662
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:21,924
It's blurry at times,
but it's there.

663
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,928
You shot
the Attorney General.

664
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:28,696
Which is why I get it...

665
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,536
What you did to Purcell,
what happened in Anchorage.

666
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,538
It's also why I understand
that whatever it is

667
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,540
that sets you off,

668
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,741
you need to deal with it.

669
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:43,845
You can see the Milky Way
in Alaska

670
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:46,748
and hear the wind
in the trees.

671
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:48,750
I don't miss it.

672
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,157
You must be
a friend of Elodie's.

673
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,658
Uh, I am.

674
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,961
So sorry.
Aram Mojtabai.

675
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:01,497
Uh, we met, uh, after Charles' accident.

676
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:04,799
I know she was devoted to him.

677
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:09,238
So sorry. Uh, would you excuse me one...

678
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,173
Thank you.

679
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:14,944
Agent Keen, is everything okay?

680
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:17,213
<i>Fine. The case is over.
It's all good.</i>

681
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:19,781
I'm just checking in with you. How's Elodie?

682
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:22,318
She's, um...

683
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,320
She's holding it together.

684
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,055
And how are you?

685
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,257
Shockingly calm.

686
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,160
When I got to the hospital,
before we knew

687
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,263
that, uh, Charles had passed,
we, um...

688
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:37,333
I took your advice
and stopped thinking.

689
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:41,003
And the minute I did,
everything just clicked into place.

690
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:42,972
I'm so glad
to hear that.

691
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,074
<i>I realized that's why I like her so much.</i>

692
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:48,077
She doesn't think. She... She feels.

693
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,677
She lives in the moment, and she stays there.

694
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,847
Not just when it's easy,
but when it's hard.

695
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:56,418
Like...
Like with Charles.

696
00:37:56,552 --> 00:38:00,022
She didn't stay with him
out of guilt or obligation.

697
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,925
She stayed with him
because it's the right thing.

698
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:10,533
Aram? Are you still there?

699
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,434
I have to call you back.

700
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,629
This is inexcusable.
This whole thing was a mistake.

701
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:44,066
- He'll be here.
- Do you see him? Do you see the truck?

702
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,469
Do you have any idea how much
that shipment is worth?

703
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:49,605
Over $12 million.

704
00:38:49,737 --> 00:38:51,706
And now, because of your guy...

705
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,246
Well,
I'll be your huckleberry.

706
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,215
Look who showed up!

707
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:03,152
And with two minutes to spare,
no less.

708
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:07,456
What a man.
What a truck!

709
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,462
Whew!

710
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:15,763
Sorry I'm late, fellas.

711
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,900
Few of the boys
at the dealership

712
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:20,269
insisted on photographs.

713
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:24,006
As I said,
never doubt my man Glen.

714
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:28,477
I have to admit I was starting
to doubt you, Glen.

715
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:30,613
Never doubt the Jellybean.

716
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:34,849
The shipment, tritium,
uh, what is it, anyway?

717
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:40,122
Tritium is an extremely rare and
radioactive isotope of hydrogen.

718
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:42,625
- Sounds kind of serious.
- It is.

719
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,960
You got that stuff
in the gas tank?

720
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:47,196
Not in the tank, Glen.
The vehicle.

721
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,532
Tritium is a gas that
can be safely stored

722
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,668
as a metal hydride.

723
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,836
In this case,
as truck parts.

724
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,972
Which parts,
I have no idea.

725
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:59,841
The...
I have no idea.

726
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:02,645
It's, you know,
like <i>Goldfinger.</i>

727
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,713
So, who are
these chowderheads?

728
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:06,715
I suspect they're CIA.

729
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:10,185
Tritium is an important
component in nuclear warheads

730
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,087
and has to be replaced
frequently

731
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,156
because of its short
half-life.

732
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,991
In any case,
that doesn't matter.

733
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,993
You got the job done.

734
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:19,895
Yeah.

735
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,164
So...

736
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:25,167
What about my truck?

737
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,139
Know what?
It don't matter.

738
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:31,674
What matters is
I wanted to prove to you

739
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,909
I could do this
on my own.

740
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:37,246
I wanted you to know I could get
the job done without your help

741
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:39,181
and that you didn't
need to intervene.

742
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:42,217
I wanted to go the distance.
That's all that matters to me.

743
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:46,388
Your faith,
not some vehicle.

744
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,702
Whoa.
The hell's that?

745
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,004
That, Glen,
is your payment.

746
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:14,083
My man, R-squared,
taking care of his own!

747
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:17,086
Yessiree!
Don't mind if I do.

748
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,089
And, hey, uh, boss,
don't forget.

749
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:23,792
You know who you can count on next
time you get yourself in a pinch.

750
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:25,594
Eye of the tiger, baby!

751
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:27,529
Eye-o-the-tiger!

752
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:52,287
Flip down the rearview.

753
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,226
Money's
in the backpack.

754
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,829
And information
on the target.

755
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,000
Handsome.

756
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:07,102
You want to kiss him
or kill him?

757
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,271
I want him found.

758
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,275
Don't call me.
I'll call you.

759
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:32,828

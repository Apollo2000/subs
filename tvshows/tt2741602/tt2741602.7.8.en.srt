1
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,688
It's clear. She has him.

2
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,955
We don't know that.

3
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,991
Dembe. She has him.

4
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,351
My God, how long has it been?

5
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,121
You go to hell.

6
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:56,224
No, Ilya. You're the one
who's going to hell.

7
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,197
She's been ahead of us
every step of the way,

8
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,465
and now she has someone

9
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,567
who can tell her
everything she wants to know.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,902
He won't talk.
That'll be even worse.

11
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,339
We need to find Ilya,
and we need to do it fast.

12
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,219
Your friend,
whenever he gets here,

13
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,120
he'll have to work quickly.

14
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,489
He's not my friend.

15
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,161
It's a mistake to do this here.

16
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,465
Thank you, Eric.

17
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,272
Would you both please leave us?

18
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,281
Bad news, Skip...
For Ilya, for you.

19
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,716
She got to him first.

20
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,218
I need to know where they are.

21
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,486
I don't know.
That's the wrong answer.

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,621
It's the truth.

23
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,789
Please, I-I have a family...
Two daughters.

24
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,226
What did you think
would happen, Skip?

25
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,594
You sold, to one of
my worst enemies,

26
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,097
the location of one
of my dearest friends.

27
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,966
I didn't know you were involved.

28
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,301
How were you paid?

29
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,836
Cash. What bank?

30
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,739
Not like that.
She did everything through a hawaladar.

31
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,274
How do I find him?

32
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,142
We met near my office.

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,678
He... He was a driver,
a deliveryman.

34
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,447
The cash, he brought
it in his travel bag,

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,614
like an order.

36
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,451
Clay Elephant...
That was the restaurant.

37
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:04,618
Dembe, call Edward.

38
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,029
Tell him to get the
jet ready for London.

39
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,688
I want us in the air
within the hour.

40
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,862
What are you coloring?

41
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,164
Picture of the park.

42
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,602
So, I was thinking,
tomorrow we could have breakfast

43
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,670
at Camel's Cafe

44
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,871
and then maybe go to the zoo.

45
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,972
What do you think of that?

46
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,474
And see the pandas?

47
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,611
If the pandas are awake,
we can see the pandas.

48
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,212
Do you think they'll be awake?

49
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,982
Ah.

50
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,485
Maddy, hey, you're
up and at 'em early.

51
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,888
Yes, well, I'm at the train
station of all places.

52
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,956
Afraid I have
a bit of a situation.

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,558
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

54
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,059
Oh, heavens, yes,
everything's fine.

55
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,129
It's just,
I've had an old friend

56
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,064
turn up in town
at the last minute,

57
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,635
and he'd hoped to spend
a little time together.

58
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,370
If this is about Agnes...

59
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,472
I promised I'd care for
her, and I will.

60
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,874
She's the priority.
If you need me to come by...

61
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,476
No, go be with your friend.

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,512
Don't think twice
about it, Maddy.

63
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,889
I'll call Beth.
I'm sure she can cover.

64
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,416
Have fun with your friend.
He's single, I hope.

65
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,784
No, he's not
that kind of a friend.

66
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,854
At least not anymore,
I'm afraid.

67
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,155
We'll be fine.

68
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,090
Have fun. Thank you, Elizabeth.

69
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,360
I appreciate you understanding.

70
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,564
Hey, kiddo.

71
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,533
Go pack your bags.

72
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,234
You're gonna have
a play date with Shelly.

73
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,436
Yay!

74
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,948
Sit anywhere you like.

75
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,056
Ah.

76
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,759
Knight to F-3.

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,863
You know, chess was
originally devised in India.

78
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,499
Back then,
it was called Ashtapada.

79
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,035
Uh, I know who you are.

80
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,772
Then it only seems fair
I should know who you are.

81
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,941
Arjun. Listen carefully, Arjun.

82
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,744
Two weeks ago,
someone from this establishment

83
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,648
delivered a cash payment
to a man named Sutherland.

84
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,249
Might I assume it was you?

85
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,553
Good. That payment was made

86
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,789
on behalf of a woman
I'm looking for.

87
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,791
Did she contact you?

88
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,126
Uh... Focus, Arjun.

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,462
If you need to, by all means
check your notes.

90
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,731
Notes? No. I-I remember.

91
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,467
The payment was requested
by New York, our main office.

92
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,003
Tell me about the main office.

93
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,607
It's a little
place on 12th Street... Matangi.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,150
Look, I can be killed
for telling you this.

95
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,986
On the other hand,
you would definitely be killed

96
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,311
for not telling me this.

97
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,683
New York... They run
everything, the entire network.

98
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,084
How big is the network?

99
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,921
London 692,
$1.3 million outgoing.

100
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,024
They have 34
outposts in 18 countries.

101
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,192
All front as small
restaurants, locally owned.

102
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,462
They make good on financial IOUs

103
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,972
sent and received
from around the world.

104
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,841
And the person
who runs the network,

105
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,836
they would have a record of the
woman who paid Mr. Sutherland?

106
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,639
If he doesn't know,
he knows who would.

107
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:12,706
I'll need his name.

108
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,211
Reddington, what's up?

109
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,014
Elizabeth, I have something
on very short notice.

110
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,483
What is it? Is something wrong?

111
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,218
It's a case... Bhavish Ratna.

112
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,987
He's the next name
on the Blacklist.

113
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,730
Hawala... It's an Arabic
word that essentially means

114
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,832
"money transfer
without money movement."

115
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:42,302
Since 9/11, the hawala system
has been a focus of the Bureau.

116
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,471
But according to Reddington,

117
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,205
his newest Blacklister has taken

118
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,542
the traditional legal method
to a whole new illegal level.

119
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,019
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to catch me up.

120
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,345
This hawala...
It's a banking system?

121
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,381
It's a banking system
outside of banks.

122
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,884
A terrorist in Kabul
wants to make payment

123
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,819
to another terrorist
in Bangladesh.

124
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,854
He can't go into a bank
and wire the money,

125
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,256
so he goes to see
a hawaladar in his city

126
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,658
and then gives him the cash.

127
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,394
That hawaladar calls
his counterpart in Bangladesh

128
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,997
and requests that he front
he money to the recipient.

129
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,765
It's an IOU system.

130
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,334
No bank records, no wires,
no actual movement of money.

131
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,112
Meaning there's nothing
for law enforcement to track

132
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,771
and no evidence
to build the case.

133
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,240
Which brings me
to our suspect...

134
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,877
Bhavish Ratna, 60,
Indian national with no priors.

135
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,446
Last address...
Jackson Heights, Queens.

136
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,717
If the traditional model
is an informal association

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,419
between brokers,
Ratna just formalized it.

138
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,955
34 offices in 18 countries,

139
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,758
all moving cash for
terrorists, human traffickers,

140
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,093
drug cartels...
The worst of the worst.

141
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,731
All run by one man,
all with the same front to the public...

142
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,965
Restaurants.

143
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,067
How much? $3.5 million

144
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,737
to 635 Barrow Street,

145
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,938
32nd floor.

146
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,409
New York, 714.

147
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,379
Hong Kong, 381 to New York, 714.

148
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,882
Obtain and support $3.5 million.

149
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,117
$3.5 million,
obtain and support.

150
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,252
Verify locate.

151
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,388
Locate... 635 Barrow Street,

152
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,925
32nd floor, suite 3201.

153
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,163
It's en route. Consider it done.

154
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,575
According to Reddington,
these restaurants have different names

155
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,167
but are connected financially

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,835
and all headquartered
in Manhattan.

157
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,137
And Reddington wants us
to take it down, why?

158
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,140
It sounds like Ratna is his
business partner, not his enemy.

159
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,276
He thinks the woman
who took him in Paris

160
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,811
used Ratna to pay for intel.

161
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,746
He hopes that Ratna
will help him find her.

162
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,181
If he thinks Ratna's
that important,

163
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,816
why isn't he doing this himself?

164
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,627
Maybe it's a smokescreen,
meant to keep us distracted

165
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,019
while he works another angle.

166
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,664
I'm sorry,
you've been here like nine seconds.

167
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,465
How are you already more
jaded than Agent Ressler?

168
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,458
Um... No offense.

169
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,203
The three of you
will get to New York,

170
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,805
set up surveillance,
see what you can find.

171
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,164
I'll have FBI in New York
get a warrant.

172
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,833
Based on what criteria?

173
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,434
I have no idea.
I'll figure that out,

174
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,867
assuming I can get a judge to
believe a word that I'm saying.

175
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,881
I would have done anything
for you, Ilya.

176
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,821
When you asked me to help you in
Belgrade, you knew I'd say yes.

177
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,990
Never even occurred
to me that you would betray me.

178
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,159
Listen...

179
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,327
Dominic thought...

180
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,995
I know what Dominic thought.

181
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,964
And he's paying for his sins.

182
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,067
And if he survives, I'll find
him again and finish the job.

183
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,670
At least he believed
he was protecting Masha.

184
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,704
But you...

185
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,774
You were my friend.

186
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,912
There are things about this
you can't possibly understand.

187
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,014
Oh, but I want to understand.

188
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,916
In fact, I insist.

189
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,387
I've thought a lot
about why you chose me

190
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,389
as the lamb
you could take to slaughter.

191
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,524
You thought I was weak...

192
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,227
The prey and not the predator.

193
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,030
Ask Reddington
how he feels about me now.

194
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,899
Hurting me
won't get you answers.

195
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,434
The Townsend Directive is real.

196
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,535
They're coming for you.

197
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,904
Then tell me how to stop them.

198
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,740
I'll die before I talk.

199
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:10,678
I don't intend to wait for
you to give me answers.

200
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,379
I'm going to take them
from you instead.

201
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,382
The hell does that mean?

202
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,418
It means I've invited an old
friend to pay us a visit.

203
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,988
And by this time tomorrow...

204
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,559
You will have told me
everything I need to know.

205
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,271
This is not right.

206
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,049
We should have a proper
warrant, get the evidence.

207
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,608
Cooper's getting a warrant.

208
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,277
We're just trying to corroborate
what our source told us.

209
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,714
- We know nothing about this man.
- Bhavish Ratna...

210
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,317
Married, bought the restaurant
23 years ago with his wife.

211
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,886
Taxes paid,
not once late on rent.

212
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,955
All we know about his
alleged criminal activity

213
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,628
is what Reddington told us.
Hang on, wait.

214
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,159
Reddington told us that the
world's largest underground bank

215
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,461
is also serving the best
lunch buffet in Manhattan,

216
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,163
and that's not enough for you?

217
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,174
I'm only saying we have protocol.
I'm not comfortable

218
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,034
trusting what Reddington
told us about this.

219
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,906
There's the delivery guy again.

220
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,374
Wait, is that him?

221
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,910
That's him... Ratna.

222
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,279
Okay, that's odd.
Why is the owner making a delivery

223
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,957
when he's had the kid
running deliveries all day?

224
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,826
I don't know,
but if I find cash in those bags

225
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,761
instead of vindaloo,
would it make you feel any better

226
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,886
about arresting the guy?

227
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,991
He's not taking the bike.
He's walking from here.

228
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,860
All right, Keen,
you and Park flank him.

229
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,628
I'll take his six.
Let's just keep an eye on him,

230
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,430
see where he's going.

231
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,372
Keen, you got eyes?

232
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,207
Copy that. I have eyes.

233
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,011
He can't be going far on foot.

234
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,379
Which means
if he's doing a drop,

235
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,814
the target's got to be close.

236
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,018
Guys, I think
we have a situation here.

237
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,620
Woman at your 10 o'clock,
dark hair, blue jacket.

238
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,889
With the newspaper?

239
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,190
I think she's security.

240
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,999
The construction
worker behind Ratna...

241
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,500
He's on radio.

242
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,903
I don't like this.
He's got protection.

243
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,543
We should call for support.

244
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,289
Bhavish. Is that you?

245
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,526
You are, uh...

246
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,994
Ressler, what's going on?

247
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,338
I don't know.
Could be the target.

248
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,763
Park, you have eyes?
No, nothing.

249
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,066
Too many people.

250
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,802
Raymond Reddington?
And you're Bhavish Ratna.

251
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,037
Now we're friends.

252
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,438
He's talking to someone.

253
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,907
Can't see his face.
He's wearing a hat.

254
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,342
You got to be kidding me.

255
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,744
No, that's not possible.
It's Reddington.

256
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,449
I'm here as something of
a guardian angel, Bhavish.

257
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,553
It's come to my attention that you're
the target of an FBI investigation.

258
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,023
That can't be. And yet it is.

259
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,259
Keen, you want to tell me
what the hell he's doing here?

260
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,132
Wait, is Reddington here
with us or the target?

261
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,595
He's not with us.

262
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,999
See the rather furtive
ginger behind you?

263
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,767
He's FBI. Or if he isn't,

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,303
he certainly looks
like he's FBI.

265
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,605
Same with the woman
by the fence over there.

266
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,409
And why are you
telling me all this?

267
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,711
Because there's something
I want you to tell me,

268
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,414
just as soon as I get you
the hell out of here.

269
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,917
See the gentleman behind me,
by the black Mercedes?

270
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,418
He's your escape plan.

271
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,987
How do you want
to handle this, Keen?

272
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,422
I don't know.
He's got security everywhere.

273
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,157
Say the word, and we're gone.

274
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,095
If it's my clients
you want to know about,

275
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,496
I don't talk about them.

276
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,332
Yes, well, never say never.

277
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,270
I can take care of myself.

278
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,940
I have more security
than you may know.

279
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,110
Are you really sure
this is the time or place

280
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,845
to get into a shoot-out
with the FBI, Bhavish?

281
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,615
Putting your clients first
before yourself

282
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,617
while you're surrounded
by the authorities

283
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,620
may prove to be
somewhat shortsighted.

284
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,656
No?

285
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,591
Okay, just remember,

286
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,493
when you're left
holding the bag,

287
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,329
I'm the one who told you so.

288
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,772
We got to fall back.
There's too many civilians.

289
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,174
We're not letting this guy walk.

290
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,382
Stop! FBI! I said stop!

291
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,516
Ressler, they're armed.

292
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,154
Down! Down! Put the gun down!

293
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,321
Drop your weapon!

294
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,857
Drop your weapon.

295
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,092
Put it down.

296
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:55,895
Stop!

297
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,497
Watch out.

298
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,042
Put the gun down.

299
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,978
Put it down.

300
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,946
You heard the man.
Put the gun down.

301
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,265
You want to tell me what
the hell that was all about?

302
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,091
Guess we're gonna
have to ask Reddington.

303
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,467
How could this possibly happen?

304
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,636
My people take
every precaution...

305
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,072
Vetting clients, travel routes.

306
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,474
My security people are in
custody, and if they talk...

307
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,411
Quite frankly, I'd be
more concerned about your restaurant.

308
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,280
The restaurant,
the vault, the books.

309
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,083
The network compromised.
Everyone's going to jail.

310
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,420
But you're not. You're sitting
right here in my safe house.

311
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,122
Have a nice cup of masala chai.

312
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,756
Mr. Reddington,
you don't understand.

313
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:01,094
I was transporting $3.5 million
that belongs to the Zhao Triad.

314
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,729
The money never made it
to Atticus.

315
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,497
Eli Atticus, the extractor?

316
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,366
Zhao will come for me
if I can't pay.

317
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,202
And with a breach like this,
my network will fold.

318
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,338
Money will evaporate.
My resources gone.

319
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,942
What if I could offer you
a loan, make you whole?

320
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,045
For the money we lost?

321
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,047
I didn't lose any money,
Bhavish.

322
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,816
You did, because you hesitated
when you shouldn't have.

323
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,721
Now, normally, I charge 20%
for a cash loan of this size,

324
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,159
but given the circumstances,
I could go as low as 19%.

325
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,027
Why would you help me?
You don't even know me.

326
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,598
As I said, you have
information that I seek.

327
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,967
And if I help,
this loan, this money,

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,602
you can access it quickly?

329
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,137
Before your tea cools.

330
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,179
Morgan, it's me.

331
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,081
Yeah, we're working
as fast as we can.

332
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,015
Well, tell the fellas upstairs

333
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,286
we're in urgent need
of 3.5 meal tickets.

334
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,553
Now? Yes, now.

335
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,489
Put it down at 19%,

336
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,492
and please get it here
as quickly as possible.

337
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,095
What is it you want to know?

338
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,831
It's come to my attention that
you recently arranged for payment

339
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,801
to a British agent
named Skip Sutherland

340
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,105
on behalf of a woman,
Constance Drucker.

341
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,839
Yes, I remember. I need to know

342
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,211
what other payments you may have
made on behalf of Miss Drucker.

343
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,149
There were, uh...
There were only two.

344
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,485
The payment you speak of,
to the British agent, Skip Sutherland.

345
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,820
And the second?

346
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,930
To some kind of moving company.

347
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,889
Orion Relocation Services.

348
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,360
Cheers.

349
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,004
Thank you, Mr. Reddington!

350
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,242
Hey, Big Red!

351
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,010
What's the story, kemosabe?

352
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,078
Where are you?

353
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,248
Just wrapped up
a student driver exam.

354
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,815
Epic fail.

355
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,152
Parallel parking is a lost art.

356
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,521
Glen, clear your schedule.
We have to talk.

357
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,722
I have a job for you.

358
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,493
Understood.

359
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,562
No, we have the list.

360
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,365
Everything will be ready
when you arrive.

361
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,700
A short delay.

362
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,034
He'll be here by tomorrow.

363
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,405
I knew it.

364
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,574
What kind of delay?
I don't know.

365
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,108
He's eccentric.

366
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,877
You know how these
creative people can be.

367
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,113
Insane, which is what this entire
plan was in the first place.

368
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,582
We've talked about this.

369
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,385
No, I talked,
and you pretended to listen

370
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,019
because you didn't want
to face the fact

371
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,854
that this is junk science
and a waste of time.

372
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,856
It's our best option.

373
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,426
He turns people into zombies.

374
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,195
Half the time
without any results.

375
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,396
I don't care.

376
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,931
Others are willing to
kill for what they want.

377
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,200
Well, so am I.

378
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,235
And if he fails, so be it.

379
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,869
At least I'll know

380
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,239
we've used every conceivable
means at our disposal.

381
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,796
You played us.
Harold, please, calm down.

382
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,665
You wanted Ratna
because he has information

383
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,276
about the woman
who abducted you in Paris.

384
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,035
You never intended
for us to catch him.

385
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,104
You wanted him to see us so that
you could swoop in and save him.

386
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,640
It's more complicated than that.

387
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,174
Feel free
to dumb it down for us.

388
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,910
I say "us" because I've
invited Agents Ressler and Park

389
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,446
to listen in.
They deserve to know

390
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,789
why you double-crossed them
in the field.

391
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:41,981
Actually, they don't.

392
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,850
You gave them an order.
They followed it.

393
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,320
You tipped Ratna off to an FBI
investigation you initiated!

394
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,757
Yes, to put him in my debt
by setting him free.

395
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,259
You set Ratna free?

396
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,493
As a bird.

397
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,362
You have no idea where he is?

398
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,097
Harold, perhaps you haven't
fully explained to Agent Park

399
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,766
how this arrangement works,

400
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,067
or perhaps her sense of justice

401
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,203
simply isn't as nuanced
as I had imagined.

402
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,714
You're gonna help us find him.

403
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,474
I appreciate your frustrations.

404
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,476
I'm sorry to put you
in this position.

405
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,345
But someone I care
deeply about is missing,

406
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,314
and I did what I did
to try and find him.

407
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,383
Who's missing?
That's not your concern.

408
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,786
What is your concern
is Ratna's banking enterprise.

409
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,990
It's come to my attention that
Ratna is moving $3.5 million

410
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,660
from the Zhao Crime
Syndicate to Eli Atticus.

411
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,529
I don't know any Eli Atticus.

412
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,831
He's an extraction expert
who has a reputation

413
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,902
for breaking high-value
targets out of black sites

414
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,505
and detention facilities
around the world.

415
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,740
If the Zhao Syndicate
is paying Atticus,

416
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,909
it means they've lost someone
that they want back.

417
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,479
I don't know who, I don't know
when, but I can assure you,

418
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,348
there's a prison break
on the horizon,

419
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,549
and it's going to be bloody.

420
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,988
As my third executioner said,

421
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,492
nothing voices contrition
better than silence.

422
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,027
Good talk.

423
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,363
You're welcome for the tip.

424
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,233
That's it?

425
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,577
What about the park,
what he did there?

426
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,236
We expressed our displeasure.

427
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,304
He gave us a lead.

428
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,507
I just... I don't understand.

429
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,942
Well, how could you?

430
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,510
The man's had
three executioners.

431
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:21,681
If it's any consolation, even after all
these years, I don't understand, either.

432
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,552
All I do know is that Eli Atticus
may be about to commit a crime.

433
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,487
Our job is to stop him
before he does.

434
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,468
Hello?
Liz, hey, you got a minute?

435
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,070
Yeah, Beth. What's going on?

436
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,314
How are the girls? They're good.

437
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,740
We just finished up snack time.

438
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:51,243
I wanted to give you
a call about Agnes.

439
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,912
What's wrong? Everything okay?

440
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,447
Shelly and Agnes were drawing,

441
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,617
and Agnes,
what she drew in her sketchbook...

442
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,251
This totally could have waited.

443
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,853
What did she draw?

444
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,955
It's a picture of a dead man.

445
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,461
What do you mean, a dead man?
Did she say...

446
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,829
That's why I'm calling.

447
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,298
She said that she saw him
in the park.

448
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,435
The dead man?
I thought you should know.

449
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,470
I didn't know...
Yes, no, of course.

450
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:21,741
If it was a dream or
maybe some story she heard?

451
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,010
I don't know...

452
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,312
You know what?

453
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,682
She walked in on me
while I was watching TV.

454
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:30,817
A terrible show.

455
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,819
Thank God.
I'm sure that's what she saw.

456
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,821
You're at work.
Go do your thing.

457
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,023
We'll be fine.
We can, um, talk more tonight.

458
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,591
Okay, thank you, Beth.

459
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,866
Did you find something?
I think so.

460
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,035
Okay, Mr. Reddington said
that when we arrested him,

461
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,437
Bhavish Ratna was moving funds

462
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,639
to pay a contractor
named Eli Atticus.

463
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,940
An extraction expert.

464
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:57,176
A war criminal in Scheveningen,
a drug kingpin in Bogota...

465
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,812
This guy's team has disappeared
prisoners from around the world.

466
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,314
And we think his next job
may be right here at home.

467
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:06,052
Last week, a joint FBI/DEA task
force ran a sting on PPR Global,

468
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,396
a shipping company
that launders money

469
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,021
for the Zhao Crime Syndicate.

470
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,223
Fourteen employees were arrested.
Several were injured.

471
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,561
But one man, Alfred Yang,
remains in stable condition,

472
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,996
under police custody,
at Nations First Hospital.

473
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,499
Atticus isn't gonna go after
someone who's already in prison.

474
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,502
He's gonna grab Alfred Yang
before he ever gets to prison.

475
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,638
Keen, notify the detail at Nations
First, put them on alert.

476
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,374
Ressler, Park, get there
and get the target out.

477
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,944
I'll have his transfer to Walter
Reed approved before you arrive.

478
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,419
Agent Ressler? William Truax, DEA.
We spoke over the phone.

479
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,597
The witness is
on the fourth floor?

480
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,889
Protective detail's in place.

481
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,891
Notify hospital security.
Execute a code silver

482
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,324
till we can get
the witness offsite.

483
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,895
The hell was that?

484
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,097
- Truax to command.
- Command?

485
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,364
All right. Park, call it in.

486
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,033
You got west access.
I'll take the east.

487
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,837
Attention, code silver.

488
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,977
Yang... They have him.

489
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,279
F-Four of them.

490
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,549
Went to the west.

491
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,584
Ressler, four gunmen
on the move, headed your way.

492
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,120
Breach, breach. Fall back.

493
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,835
Man down, man down!

494
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,104
They have Yang
in the east stairwell.

495
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,106
Hang in there. Hang in there.

496
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,408
Hang in there.

497
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,584
Oh! Oh!

498
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,712
Ressler! You okay?

499
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,080
Ressler?

500
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,419
Orion Relocation Services?

501
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,821
Ah, never heard of 'em.

502
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,857
Well, I only
just mentioned them.

503
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,092
What are they, some kind
of a disappearing service?

504
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,737
That's what I'm trying
to figure out, Glen...

505
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,264
Who they are, what they do,
how to make contact.

506
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,075
I kinda got a full dance card.

507
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,334
Glen, this is important.

508
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,905
Please, I... I need you to find
these people as soon as human...

509
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,175
Yeah.

510
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,043
Yeah, put him through.

511
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,520
I don't know what's wrong
with these people.

512
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,246
I told them to hold all...

513
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,547
Yellow. What?

514
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,249
What?

515
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,385
Absolutely not.

516
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,588
Jerry, I told you,
it's got to be raspberry.

517
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,057
No, ice cream won't work.
Neither will sorbet.

518
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,959
It's got to be sherbet.

519
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,895
Because that's what she said.

520
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,362
I don't know, Jerry.

521
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,732
I don't work
in the grocery store.

522
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:16,302
Try a different aisle.
Maybe try looking over by those lit...

523
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,104
That was Jerry. I don't care.

524
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,907
He's trying to make Trudy's
raspberry sherbet party punch,

525
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,641
which is sort of
a casino-night custom.

526
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,744
Glen, there is no casino night.

527
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,578
There is no DMV.

528
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,248
Right now, all that matters

529
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,885
is finding Orion
Relocation Services.

530
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,453
Okay, take it easy.

531
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,289
Don't tell me to take it easy.
This is important.

532
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,892
You're a tracker,
and I need you to find out

533
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:43,095
everything you can
about these people,

534
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,263
right now.

535
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,999
This is different, huh?

536
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,100
Important.

537
00:27:56,142 --> 00:28:00,312
The woman from Paris...
She took someone I care deeply about.

538
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,014
What's happening to him now,

539
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,751
what she's subjecting him to...
Hey, gimme a hand!

540
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,518
I can't even begin to imagine,

541
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,830
which is why I need to find him.

542
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,922
No! But I can't do that

543
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:13,926
unless you find Orion
Relocation Services.

544
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,694
Glen, I implore you.

545
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,797
This is life or death.

546
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,211
How could you do this?

547
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,446
How could you possibly
be willing to die

548
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,982
in order to protect him?

549
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,353
After all we've been
through, Ilya.

550
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,990
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

551
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,059
Why won't you help me?

552
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,229
Why?

553
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,052
I'm sorry, uh, say that again?

554
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,481
We lost Yang.

555
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,851
Atticus' men got here first.

556
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,986
Most of the protective
detail is dead.

557
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,823
You're telling me Zhao Wing,
the leader of one

558
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:21,227
of the most powerful criminal
organizations in the world,

559
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,530
hires Eli Atticus,
perhaps the preeminent

560
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,732
prisoner-extraction
specialist in the world,

561
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,767
to target a city hospital?

562
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:33,439
All to rescue a rank-and-file
foot soldier in Zhao's army?

563
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,540
You don't buy it?

564
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,109
No, Elizabeth, I do not buy it.

565
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,545
So, maybe Yang wasn't
just a foot soldier.

566
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,347
I don't care
if he's the architect

567
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,615
of Zhao's entire empire.

568
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,186
Shooting up a public hospital
is an extreme measure,

569
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:51,924
required only in the most
desperate of circumstances.

570
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,393
Maybe Zhao couldn't afford to
have him talk to the police.

571
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,062
Maybe he was worried
Yang would flip.

572
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,564
So you wait to see
if he's negotiating

573
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,799
a cooperation agreement
in the first place.

574
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,768
That sounds reasonable.

575
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,971
So, why the fireworks?

576
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,073
Because Yang knew something,

577
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,640
and Zhao needed
to know what it was.

578
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,610
Or maybe he knows
exactly what Yang knows,

579
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,580
and maybe Zhao
needs to make sure

580
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,617
that nobody else
ever hears what Yang knows.

581
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,586
Because Yang's an informant.

582
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,454
Or worse.

583
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,456
Oh, my God.

584
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,858
That's it.

585
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,392
Mm?

586
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,158
Were you gonna tell us?

587
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,993
I'm sorry. You are? Agent Keen.

588
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:37,196
I'm part of the task force who tried
to warn you this was gonna happen.

589
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,565
He's one of yours,
isn't he, Alfred Yang?

590
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,067
He's an agent.
Keep your voice down.

591
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,568
How long has he been undercover?

592
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:47,173
The Zhaos didn't do this to
rescue one of their soldiers.

593
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,141
They did this to eliminate
an undercover cop

594
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,509
who could have destroyed them.

595
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,686
How the hell do you know that?

596
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,245
I have a source.

597
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,580
Apparently, so does Zhao.

598
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,049
How long?

599
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,085
Just over two years.
The U.S. Attorney

600
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,719
just authorized
RICO charges last week.

601
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,621
He is the lynchpin
to the entire case.

602
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,190
Not anymore.

603
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,500
We think Yang's cover is intact.

604
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,026
This was a recovery mission.

605
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,662
Listen to me.
They're gonna kill him.

606
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,165
If we don't find a way to
track wherever they took him,

607
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,101
they are going to kill him.

608
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,602
I think I can help with that.

609
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,237
Hey, you okay?

610
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,838
Yeah, I'll be fine.

611
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,574
Tell me, does the hospital
put chips in their I.D. badges

612
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,010
to help locate staff?

613
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,911
Yang was a patient,
not hospital staff.

614
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,546
W-Why does this help us?

615
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,049
Because I managed to
slip one in the pocket of a perp

616
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,218
while he was trying
to choke the life out of me.

617
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,452
Can we track it?

618
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,336
Go! Go! FBI!

619
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,240
Hands! Hands!

620
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,907
Don't move.

621
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,614
Call an ambulance.

622
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,917
What are you doing?

623
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,653
Is that a trick question?

624
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,488
Why aren't you working?

625
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,358
I understand this is important to
you, and I'm doing my best,

626
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,326
but I don't work well
when my stomach's

627
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,395
got the growlies and...
Have you found them?

628
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,397
Orion Relocation Services?

629
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,567
No, and I have to admit,
I'm not getting much closer,

630
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,336
which is a problem, 'cause
it's almost casino night.

631
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,105
And if I don't have
everything set

632
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,673
when Jerry gets here
with the sherbet,

633
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,275
we're gonna have a real problem.

634
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,316
We talked about this.

635
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,319
There is no casino night.

636
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,154
There is nothing but me

637
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,889
standing right in front of you.

638
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:49,495
Look at me.

639
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,598
This thing we do,
this whole dynamic?

640
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,533
My indulgence of your

641
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,803
relentless nonsense,
your insipid banter?

642
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,471
I tolerate it.

643
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,208
But don't lose sight of the fact

644
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,376
that this is a business
relationship.

645
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,378
You're a finder.

646
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,848
You exist to me
because you find things.

647
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,284
Are you telling me
that you can't find

648
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:13,352
what I need you to find?

649
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,886
Because if that's the case,

650
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,988
I will end this right now.

651
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,692
And don't think I won't
because we have a history.

652
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,195
If my friend dies
because of you...

653
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,908
Orion Relocation Services.
Find them.

654
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,159
Don't look so grim, Agent Park.

655
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,960
You saved an officer's
life today.

656
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,899
Sir, hard to feel cheery,
all things considered, sir.

657
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,468
All things?

658
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,870
What am I missing?

659
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,104
An undercover agent is alive

660
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,174
because of you
and Agent Ressler.

661
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,909
The RICO case against the Zhao
Syndicate will be prosecuted.

662
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,245
As we speak,
the Bureau is identifying

663
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,846
the various clients
and criminals

664
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,316
connected to Bhavish Ratna
and his hawaladar network.

665
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,587
And Ratna? He's... What?
Helping Reddington? Dead?

666
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,122
Could be either... or both.

667
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,925
What are we getting involved in?

668
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,994
I don't follow.

669
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,196
Reddington wanted Ratna.

670
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,298
Said he needed him,
that he was critical

671
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,266
to finding whoever
abducted him in Paris.

672
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,667
But I have a feeling
this is about more than Paris.

673
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,405
What are you suggesting?

674
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,374
That Reddington's
in over his head,

675
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,276
that he's scared,

676
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,745
that he has his back
up against the wall.

677
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,481
About what? I have no idea.

678
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,184
But this...
I have a sinking feeling

679
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,420
this thing is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

680
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,122
And whatever he's up against...

681
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,159
I just don't want it to end up
on our doorstep.

682
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:05,831
Come here. Give me a hug.

683
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,399
I haven't seen you all day.

684
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,836
Hey.

685
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,939
Can I ask you something...

686
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:17,609
About the, uh...
The picture you drew today?

687
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,446
Yeah. The man in the picture...

688
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,047
Is he someone you saw?

689
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,849
I don't know.

690
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,985
Is it something you want
to talk to me about?

691
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,021
Honey, Agnes, look at me.

692
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,624
You're not in trouble, honey.

693
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:35,026
I'm just curious
where you got the idea.

694
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,497
I saw him in the park.

695
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,599
With Miss Tolliver?

696
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,368
Yeah.

697
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,175
Come on. What is all this?

698
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,711
This, Ilya,
is for an old friend,

699
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,713
for the work he's going to do.

700
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,982
He's quite excited to meet you.

701
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,156
Elizabeth, hello.

702
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,425
Hi. How's your friend?

703
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,226
Oh. Fantastic.

704
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,028
I hadn't seen him in ages.

705
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,930
Thank you for understanding.

706
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,700
I hope Agnes got along okay.

707
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,202
Actually, that's what I
wanted to see you about.

708
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,271
Uh, is now a bad time?

709
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,873
Not at all.

710
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:22,908
Is she asleep?

711
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,411
I can come to your place.

712
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,778
Great. Okay.

713
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,184
I can't imagine what
she could have possibly seen,

714
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,153
but surely it wasn't a body.

715
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,188
Not... Not with me, in the park.

716
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,225
She wouldn't just make that up.

717
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,027
No, of course not.

718
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,597
But like all children, Agnes
does have a vivid imagination.

719
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,767
So, she didn't say
anything to you?

720
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,068
Nothing at all?

721
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,104
Can I be completely
honest with you?

722
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,106
No more secrets?

723
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,343
Uh, I didn't realize
we had secrets.

724
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,644
Elizabeth, please.

725
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,813
I've seen the gun in your purse.

726
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:05,784
The men outside standing guard?

727
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,255
I know that you're an FBI agent.

728
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,900
Well, what does that
have to do with...

729
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:17,062
Do you think perhaps Agnes...
That this body

730
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,731
is her way of saying
that what you do scares her?

731
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,200
What I do does scare her,
and we talk about that.

732
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,804
And you and I have talked
about her love of fairy tales

733
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,106
and how the violence
in those stories

734
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,275
help deflect
what's going on in her mind.

735
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,010
This is not a fairy tale.

736
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,280
I can tell I've upset you,
but...

737
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,620
you have nothing
to be defensive about.

738
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,322
I'm not being defensive.
I'm defending my daughter.

739
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,425
I'm not attacking her.

740
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,561
I'm just saying that I was
with her in the park.

741
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,796
I was there.

742
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,765
And there was no body.

743
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,008
Glen.

744
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,112
About earlier.

745
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,283
I must say, I feel... Terrible.

746
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,289
What's this?
Everything you need to know

747
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,191
about Orion Relocation Services,

748
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,693
which is a corporate loan-out

749
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,329
for a small moving company
in Paterson.

750
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,998
You found them. I did.
And from what I can tell,

751
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,300
they're movers that
relocate ne'er-do-wells...

752
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,870
Sort of a witness protection
for criminals.

753
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,005
Thank you, Glen.

754
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,340
I'm in your debt.

755
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,108
And about before...

756
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,209
Save it, Chief.

757
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,545
Another time.

758
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,813
If I can get
to the Eagles Club now,

759
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:44,516
I can still make it in time
for a little roulette

760
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,054
and a cup of Trudy's
raspberry sherbet party punch.

761
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,490
Wish me luck.

762
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,559
Roulette... That's your game?
Of course, baby.

763
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,394
And you know
I always bet on Red.

764
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,182
So, he's the one?

765
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,449
This is him.

766
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,720
Don't be afraid.

767
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:04,956
It's okay.

768
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,094
We're just going
to have a little look

769
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,864
at some of your, um... Memories.

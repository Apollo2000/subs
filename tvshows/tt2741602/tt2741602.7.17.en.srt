1
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,734
Unit 5-7, requesting additional units

2
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,308
to Brewster housing complex.

3
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:20,110
Looking for one suspect,
white male, possibly armed.

4
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,179
Have units roll Code 2...

5
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:24,448
no lights or sirens.

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,183
We lucky today, partner?

7
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,803
One way to find out.

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,346
I got him, I got him!

9
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,184
Central! Shots fired!

10
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,485
Shots fired!

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,686
Ressler's been hit!

12
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:03,921
My partner is down!

13
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:09,428
Roll ambulance to
my location, immediately!

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,829
Central, copy.

15
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,131
EMT to Brewster housing complex.

16
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,401
Officer down, officer down.

17
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:20,304
I told you to take the money, Bob.

18
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,339
The rest of us did.

19
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,679
I'll look after Lisa and the boys.

20

21
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:55,005
You ever think about Dad?

22
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,266
What about him?

23
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,209
Just...

24
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,212
You wake up one day,
kiss the wife and kids,

25
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,947
you go on the job...

26
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:06,276
you don't know it's gonna be the
last five minutes of your life.

27
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,904
What was he thinking right before that?

28
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,555
What he wanted to have
for dinner, or the gas bill?

29
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,190
We don't need to talk about it.

30
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,329
You've seen a lot of people
get killed, right?

31
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:20,832
Is it always that...

32
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,210
meaningless?

33
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,403
Yeah.

34
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:33,095
Mm. Almost home.

35
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,645
Been a while since you've been back, huh?

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,181
A few years at least?

37
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,649
What do you think this is?
A vacation for me?

38
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:40,551
Do you think I... I want to be here?

39
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,020
I know you don't want to be here.

40
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,189
Mom knows, though. I told her
you were coming to town.

41
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,224
- You told Mom?
- Mm.

42
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,026
You do realize that if something
goes wrong tonight,

43
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:50,794
we both end up going straight to jail?

44
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,529
You get that, right?

45
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:53,949
Relax.

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,660
It's just Mom.

47
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,912
Who's she gonna tell?

48
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,442
So, you got anybody special

49
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,044
back in D.C., Donnie?

50
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,313
When am I gonna start seeing
some nieces and nephews?

51
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,948
Uh, no one special right now, Aunt Cindy.

52
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,083
But I'm looking. I got my eyes open.

53
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,319
Is it cool being an FBI agent, Uncle Don?

54
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,122
- You got a gun?
- I do carry a weapon, Ben, yeah.

55
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,323
How long you around?

56
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,158
What's this big case we heard about?

57
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:22,893
- Big case?
- The one you're in town for.

58
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,328
Robby said it was something big?

59
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,663
- Ma, I told you it was top, uh...
- Confidential.

60
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,133
...is the word we use
at the Bureau... confidential.

61
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,367
Look at this.

62
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,736
Both my boys under the same roof.

63
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:36,173
Don, did Robby tell you
about his company expanding?

64
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,209
He got himself that collector's
car you rode here in.

65
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,278
And he bought me a fancy new watch.

66
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:43,714
It's nothing, Ma. Just got a new garage,

67
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,984
and we can do twice
as many cars now, so...

68
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,619
I'm just happy you're home, Don.

69
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,053
I wish your father could be here

70
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,716
to see how great both
his children turned out.

71
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,992
He'd be so proud.

72
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,035
Donnie, what am I gonna tell
your father when he gets home?

73
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,503
Principle Neill's a liar.

74
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,472
I thought we were past all this.

75
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,107
You can't keep skipping class.

76
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,675
What am I gonna learn in a classroom

77
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,177
that I can't learn
out in the real world, anyway?

78
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,978
By "real world," you mean
getting baked with

79
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:17,147
your wastoid friends out behind
the Farmer Jack's every day?

80
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:18,615
Stay out of this, Officer Asshat.

81
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,250
We all know you're only joining
the academy

82
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,286
- for the cavity searches.
- Loitering's a crime, you know.

83
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:24,288
One of these days, it'll be me
slapping the cuffs on you.

84
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,323
Mm, maybe I'll learn
something useful in prison.

85
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:27,591
Like dice.

86
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,234
Tom?

87
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,637
What is it?

88
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,205
Lisa...

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,599
It's Bob.

90
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,008
Something's happened.

91
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,045
Can I come in?

92
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,107
Wait, wait...

93
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,149
Please, Tom. No.

94
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,218
It can't be. Not my husband.

95
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,919
Please, no.

96
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,286
Everything all right, Don?

97
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,029
Yeah. J-Just a little tired.

98
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,731
We drove all night, so, uh,

99
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,966
I'm gonna have to get a little shut eye.

100
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,634
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, of course.

101
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,736
I put fresh sheets on your old bed.

102
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,771
You remember the way, don't you?

103
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:16,406
Of course.

104
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:36,994
There we are.

105
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,829
Okay, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know...

106
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,531
What, Mom was gonna host
a family reunion?

107
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,767
Good call on that one.

108
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,235
You know how she is. She gets excited.

109
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,104
What can I say?
Again, I'm sorry, all right?

110
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,640
What you should be sorry for
is lying to her.

111
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:50,974
Don't think for a second I'm fooled

112
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,810
by this whole vintage car
and Rolex routine.

113
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,912
What are you up to, Robby?

114
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:57,299
You know what?

115
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,010
This may come as a shock to you, Don...

116
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,929
Agent Ressler, world policeman...

117
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,323
I am not a screw-up anymore.

118
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,392
Well, if you're such a success,
what are you doing

119
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,527
living at home, sleeping in our old room?

120
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:12,162
I'm just between apartments.

121
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,912
Go to hell.

122
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,007
You know, somebody had to
look out for Mom.

123
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:25,202
You won't do it.

124
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,079
Let's just get this over with.

125
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,836
Okay.

126
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,887
You remember the old dirt field?

127
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:39,022
They're gonna turn this
into an outdoor mall.

128
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,957
They break ground tomorrow.

129
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:42,759
If they find what's under that dirt...

130
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:44,161
So it's now or never.

131
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,631
I watched the site overnight last week.

132
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,199
They have one night watchman.

133
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,268
Guy makes his rounds every hour or two.

134
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,271
Half the time, he's asleep in his car.

135
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,007
Now, see this?

136
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,875
There's a gap in that gate big enough

137
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,239
for both of us to fit through
without making a sound.

138
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,481
How's that for recon?

139
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,318
All right.

140
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,287
We're gonna need shovels,
nothing too heavy...

141
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:12,756
flashlights, low-wattage...

142
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,758
can't be too bright,
nothing with halogen bulbs.

143
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:17,327
Bleach... we're gonna need at
least three quarts, maybe more.

144
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:18,528
Wow. Big project, huh?

145
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,963
Yeah.

146
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,372

Cool it. They're here for Mom.

159
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,307
Yeah?

160
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,649
Who's here for Dad?

161
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,191
How you boys holding up?

162
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,159
You need anything?

163
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:23,226
Yep.

164
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,461
Refill.

165
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,600
He's drunk?

166
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,035
You're surprised?

167
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,056
This was Dad's.

168
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:57,726
That's St. Michael,
patron saint of police officers.

169
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:01,897
Found it in his personal effects.

170
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,197
He would've wanted it to go
to the next cop in the family.

I'll keep you posted.

190
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,807
- Tommy Markin did it.
- Shut up, Donnie.

191
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,142
You don't know what you're saying.

192
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,010
I heard the call! I was right there!

193
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,912
Tommy was talking about Dad.

194
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,748
Maybe he didn't pull the trigger,

195
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,549
but he had something
to do with it, I'm sure.

196
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,518
- You're drunk.
- I know what I heard.

197
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,253
Maybe it was another case.

198
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,788
- He was Dad's best friend.
- He's practically our uncle...

199
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:01,056
- Maybe we can prove it?
- Maybe we can prove it.

200
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,724
Like... Like on TV or something.

201
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,025
We... We could get him to confess to us.

202
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:05,460
That's not how it works.

203
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,129
You need evidence...
documents, a recording...

204
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,563
I'll get them.

205
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,732
I trust Tommy Markin, okay?

206
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,235
Dad trusted him, I trust him.

207
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,936
Why?

208
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,572
'Cause you both wear
the same stupid badge?

209
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,408
Look, I know you need someone
to blame for this...

210
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,742
I have someone to blame!

211
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,344
- We just need to prove it!
- Jesus, Don!

212
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,246
How bad do you need to be
the center of attention

213
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:26,081
every single time?!

214
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:27,816
Don't mention it again!

215
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,752
Don't bring it up to Mom.
She feels bad enough.

216
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,421
Let it go.

217
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:46,501
61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66...

218
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,170
Can't believe it's actually working.

219
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:53,108
- I thought you said that he...
- Shh!

220
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,776
I guess he's off his schedule.

221
00:11:58,315 --> 00:11:59,514
Get down, get down!

222
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,782
Aah!

223
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,475
All right, looks like I'm gonna
be doing all the digging.

224
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,664
Sure this is it?

225
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,833
I'd know it like it was yesterday.

226
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,067
This is it. Dig fast.

227
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,402
I'll keep an eye out for the turnkey.

228
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,246
I heard you before
you even put your pants on

229
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,881
this morning, Donnie.

230
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,182
The hell are you doing here?

231
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:09,147
What did you do to my dad?

232
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,568
Wrong place, wrong time, kid.

233
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,557
Let me show you the door.

234
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,692
I know you had something to do
with him getting shot.

235
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:18,960
I heard you.

236
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:20,283
On the phone.

237
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:23,077
You're coming with me
to tell the cops everything.

238
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,079
I am the cops.

239
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,269
Donnie, you're young.

240
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,666
You're grieving.

241
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,640
You're not thinking straight.

242
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,542
We can figure out a way
to pay for the window,

243
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,131
but...

244
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,634
Recognize this?

245
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,382
It was Dad's.

246
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,890
Donnie, it's a tragedy what happened.

247
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:46,809
What are you gonna do?

248
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,020
Shoot me?

249
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,105
Shoot a cop?

250
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,961
Do you even have a plan?

251
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,596
Just tell me it's true!

252
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,865
You've already gotten yourself
into enough trouble

253
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,030
to break your mother's heart.

254
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,658
Don't make it worse.

255
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,619
You don't want this on your head.

256
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,539
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

257
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:10,645
You give me that gun,

258
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,877
or your life is over, young man.

259
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,672
You think you're tough?

260
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,091
Your dad was tough.

261
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:20,677
Your brother's tough.

262
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,426
You don't even have

263
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,527
the balls to p...

264
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,834
It's been a while.

265
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,136
You remember Tommy Markin,
don't you, Don?

266
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,598
Donnie, what did you do?

267
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,784
I didn't know who else to call.

268
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,934
- He killed Dad, Robby.
- Did he admit it?

269
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,402
He was going to.

270
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,961
H-He would've. I know it.

271
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,848
Donnie, I need you
to listen to me carefully

272
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,584
and answer my questions. You got that?

273
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:48,487
- Did anyone see you come in here?
- No.

274
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,255
Did Markin alert anyone when he saw you?

275
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,523
Did he make any calls?

276
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,727
No.

277
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,694
How long has it been since the gunshot?

278
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:57,429
I don't know. Uh...

279
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,798
15, maybe 20 minutes.

280
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,402
Then nobody heard it.

281
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,902
Or at least no one reported it.

282
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,327
Donnie.

283
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,478
Go home.

284
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,480
Wipe Dad's gun off and put it
back where you found it.

285
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,416
Don't say anything to Mom.
Don't say anything to anyone.

286
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,952
Forget this happened.

287
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,422
Understood?

288
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,414
What are you gonna do?

289
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,194
I'll take care of this.

290
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,631
Don't say another word.

291
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,143
Just go.

292
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,681
You ever lose sleep at
night 'cause of what we did back then?

293
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,950
Some nights.

294
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,329
Not many.

295
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,888
Ever wish you could take it back?

296
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,323
This man killed our father.

297
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,792
Then stood at his wake
and lied to our faces.

298
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:03,195
He was a disgrace to the badge he wore.

299
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,729
The one you were going to wear.

300
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:06,217
The one I wear every day.

301
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:10,435
No, this scumbag got everything
that was coming to him.

302
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,070
So, no.

303
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:13,975
I wouldn't take it back.

304
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,935
You?

305
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,024
Ah, we better get going.

306
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,116
Night watchman will be coming soon.

307
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:19,871
Listen, Robby, look, I...
I should say, uh...

308
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,607
should say that I'm sorry.

309
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,908
About what?

310
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:24,776
What I said earlier, back at the house.

311
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,679
Look, I-I've been hard on you.

312
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,651
I left this place behind, and you stayed,

313
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:31,817
and that was...
that was the harder choice,

314
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:34,453
and I should give you credit for it.

315
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,288
For everything. All your success.

316
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,690
Work, everything.

317
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,094
Thank you, Don.

318
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,493
Look, I was a prick when we were younger,

319
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,431
and I'm the reason why we're
taking care of this now, but...

320
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:47,866
you had my back that night.

321
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:49,487
Of course I did.

322
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:52,957
You're my brother.

323
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:56,908
I never thanked you.

324
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,748
Look, you saved me.

325
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,784
That night, everything
in my life changed.

326
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,287
Well, you might've noticed,

327
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,657
it wasn't exactly
the same for me, either.

328
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,761
Looks like you're doing pretty good now.

329
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,128
Hey, maybe you could take me
by this garage

330
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,890
while I'm still in town?

331
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,332
Yeah, cool.

332
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,067
I'd like that.

333
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,676
Robby, tell me that was random.

334
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,178
Okay, I can explain.

335
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,101
The garage is doin'g as well as I'm***

336
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:41,588
Oh, you don't say?

337
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,756
I was losing money,
so I hired a bunch of guys.

338
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,425
I thought they were stand-up guys.

339
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,761
And, uh... anyway,
I needed some fast cash.

340
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,297
Couldn't stand for
another failure, Donnie.

341
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,800
- Who'd you borrow money from?
- Definitely not the banks.

342
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,401
Those places, you walk in,
they don't even look at you...

343
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:56,970
Robby.

344
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,638
I borrowed it from a local guy.

345
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,608
What do you mean,
a connected kind of local guy?

346
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:06,679
Yeah, the Albanian type.

347
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,899
The mob? The Albanian mob?

348
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,592
How much money did you borrow?

349
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:13,988
5OK.

350
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,289
It was 30% vig on it.

351
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:18,191
And that was like six months ago.

352
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:21,566
So it's closer to 15OK now, so...

353
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:25,431
That's why they took the car,
you know, as collateral.

354
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,036
I had to try something.

355
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,905
Is there anything else
you're not telling me?

356
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,406
No, I swear.

357
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,592
That's it.

358
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,442
Hey, man.

359
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:37,626
It's for you.

360
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,716
- Who is this?
- We have your car.

361
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,351
And the cargo in the trunk.

362
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,487
Jakov Mitko wants to see you both.

363
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,155
Who's Jakov Mitko?

364
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,590
Your brother knows.

365
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,025
He knows where, too.

366
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,693
Don't be late.

367
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:07,173
You know the thing about plants?

368
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:09,499
They are obedient.

369
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:11,491
A little love, a little care...

370
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:14,150
they do exactly
what they are supposed to.

371
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,442
They grow. They give back.

372
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,333
Oxygen, flowers.

373
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:20,826
They are uncomplicated.

374
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:24,152
Anyone can respect that, yes?

375
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:27,244
You must be the brother from D.C.

376
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,769
Everyone thought I was crazy
to loan money

377
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:31,660
to a guy whose brother was FBI.

378
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,452
I said, "Wait and see."

379
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:37,179
I don't think in a million years
I could've seen this.

380
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,637
Listen, Jakov, I'm gonna get your money.

381
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:39,895
Every last penny of it.

382
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,820
This isn't about money anymore.

383
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,044
I don't understand this.

384
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:44,544
He has the car.

385
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,871
That's what this is about.

386
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,481
Ah.

387
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,585
Voilà.

388
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,159
I don't know who Detective 4818

389
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,630
of the Detroit Police Department was...

390
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:06,299
but he's seen better days.

391
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,802
Just tell us what you want.

392
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,161
I was going to burn down your
garage, just to prove I could.

393
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,464
I thought that was your only asset.

394
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,165
But now that your brother is here,

395
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,567
I know I was wrong.

396
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,901
An FBI agent?

397
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,198
Now that's a whole other thing.

398
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,576
At the field office of the FBI
here in Detroit,

399
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,412
there is a room called Department 12.

400
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:30,680
I have never seen it.

401
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,015
I am told it is mostly computers.

402
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:37,186
Computers that an agent
like yourself can access.

403
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:42,158
Go to that room, and bring me
back a file labeled "432."

404
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:44,822
- What is it?
- Have that file back here

405
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,463
by 5:00 p.m. today.

406
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,393
If you do that,

407
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,704
I will give you back the car
and everything that's in it.

408
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,806
And as an added incentive,

409
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:59,609
I will wipe your brother's debt clean.

410
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,912
Hey.

411
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,882
I know what you're gonna say.

412
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,722
Okay, fine, I deserved that.

413
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,624
You know what Department 12 is, Robby?

414
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,793
It's the office UCs file
their sealed reports to.

415
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,129
Now, in case you forgot watching
"Miami Vice" as kids,

416
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:21,764
UC stands for "undercover."

417
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,233
So, whoever's name's in there
is gonna get killed

418
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,636
'cause I gotta run
that psycho's little errand.

419
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,904
I'm not an idiot.

420
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,475
I'm not an idiot!

421
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,642
Don't treat me like one!

422
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:38,214
And you're not gonna do
what he's asking you to do!

423
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,448
It'll destroy you.

424
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,217
Yeah, and if I don't,

425
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,653
he's gonna take those remains
and he's gonna turn them in,

426
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,154
and it's gonna destroy both of us.

427
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,656
I'll take full responsibility.

428
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,758
We both know I can't
let you do that, okay?

429
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,192
I killed that guy.

430
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,227
Donnie, Donnie...

431
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,040
No, this is my mess.

432
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,334
You still don't get it.

433
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
It isn't only your mess.

434
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,345
It was just me and the body.

435
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,145
You're shocked what your brain
can come up with

436
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,247
when you're on autopilot like that.

437
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,625
I thought a lot about
how most people's lives hinge

438
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,760
on a few key moments.

439
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,834
I think mine only had one moment,

440
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,041
and then it was over.

441
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,344
Robby...

442
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,514
Please...

443
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:53,309
I know you had Dad killed, Tommy.

444
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,436
Donnie told me the truth.

445
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,938
Letting me die...

446
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,664
won't make us even...

447
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,162
You took my father from me.

448
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,545
How could you?

449
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,547
It... It was...

450
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,838
business...

451
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,718
In that moment, I suddenly
had this clear thought.

452
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,560
And I knew I was the only person
that could protect you, Don.

453
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,262
From Tommy Markin,

454
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,684
and anyone else like him
who might come along.

455
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,021
I had no choice...

456
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:43,984
I finished what you started.

457
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,653
I did it for you.

458
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:48,844
For me.

459
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,491
And for Daddy.

460
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:55,120
In the end, all I was
thinking about was you.

461
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,721
I was protecting your future.

462
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:02,058
Yeah, but why? Why didn't you tell me?

463
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,422
What... W-Why keep this
a secret all these years?

464
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,175
I did that to protect you, too.

465
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,388
Whatever that night had done
to you, it was driving you.

466
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:14,770
I carried the weight.

467
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,308
I never regretted it.

468
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,376
Because it did exactly
what I thought it would do.

469
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,688
And what's that?

470
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,401
It made you the person
that you are today.

471
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,986
So it's not your mess.

472
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,572
It's my mess, brother.

473
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,159
I'll turn myself in.

474
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,453
No.

475
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,832
We turn ourselves in.

476
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,086
I left you alone once to clean up a mess.

477
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:46,702
I'm not gonna leave you alone again.

478
00:26:52,268 --> 00:26:54,268
Then, so we...

479
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,936
killed the man who killed our father.

480
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,437
I pulled the trigger, yeah...

481
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:01,607
and to protect me,
my brother did the rest.

482
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:04,143
But we each had a hand in it.

483
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:06,512
Look, we know where the body is.
We can take you to it.

484
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:09,114
But because of my involvement,

485
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,284
I have to recuse myself from any
part of the rest of this case.

486
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,386
That's why I called you.

487
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:15,721
I knew you would help.

488
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,556
I... I knew you would do the right thing.

489
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,725
Ressler, I...

490
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,662
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.

491
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:25,864
Well, say you agree with me
about how we should handle this.

492
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,367
I mean, we arrest those bastards
who took the car...

493
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:30,669
for theft, for extortion,
for all the other poison

494
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,338
they pump into the city.

495
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:36,472
And then after that...

496
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,713
my brother and I come clean
about what we've done.

497
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:42,615
I don't know that I do agree.

498
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,183
After the story you told me,

499
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:45,651
after what you've been through
...both of you...

500
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:47,219
No, we have to do the right thing.

501
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:48,692
It's important.

502
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:52,362
Of course, yes, I will help you.

503
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,393
I just want to make sure you're prepared

504
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:56,061
to face the consequences

505
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:59,431
when the FBI gets their hands
on that vehicle and that body.

506
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,434
Because if we go in and arrest
those people, eventually,

507
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,103
the FBI's gonna open up that trunk.

508
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:06,710
And find Tommy Markin. I know.

509
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:10,756
Are you really okay with dealing
with the consequences of that?

510
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,879
I've been running from this
my whole life.

511
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:16,782
I need it to be done.
We both need it to be done.

512
00:28:25,593 --> 00:28:27,593
Yeah, this is Agent Keen.

513
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:29,775
Can I get SAC Patel in here, please?

514
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,693
Thank you.

515
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,990
I need someone local
to run point with me on this.

516
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:39,305
We should go over what the plan is.

517
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:58,924
We'll be around the corner,
two blocks away.

518
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,993
12-second response time, I'd guess.

519
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:03,016
Wanna go over/under on that?

520
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:05,097
It's gonna be dangerous.

521
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:06,665
When is it not?

522
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,600
You know, I can still talk
to Patel, call it off.

523
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:09,835
I have the authority...

524
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,316
You know, Keen...

525
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:14,736
I didn't like you when we first met.

526
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,409
I was wrong. You're a good agent.

527
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:18,977
You're the kind of agent that...

528
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:21,535
people join the FBI to try to become.

529
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,783
But you're also a good person.

530
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,707
Much better person than I am.

531
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:28,887
So, whatever happens out there today,

532
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,890
the Task Force is gonna be
in good hands with you.

533
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,305
You all right?

534
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,349
This is gonna kill Mom.

535
00:29:46,006 --> 00:29:47,311
Tell me again.

536
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,210
We're doing the right thing?

537
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:53,512
Yeah, Robby. We are.

538
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:55,381
We're doing the right thing.

539
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,108
I would be lying if I said
I wasn't surprised

540
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:25,057
that you went through with it.

541
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:27,351
File 432.

542
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:31,083
You don't care who's on it?

543
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:32,731
That's not my business.

544
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,921
Your brother is sweating.

545
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:37,819
And he looks nervous.

546
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,926
It's because it's humid in here
and he loves his car.

547
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,628
How about we see it?

548
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:46,165
Okay. Let us go and see it.

549
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,603
One more thing before we trade.

550
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,971
What do you want? A plant?

551
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:56,074
A nice orchid to go?

552
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,644
My brother checks out the car
for confirmation.

553
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:02,347
Come on, Robby, do it.

554
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,060
My file.

555
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,365
Looks like we're finished.

556
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,137
Ressler, you're sure
this is what you want?

557
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:28,907
Actually, I think I might
have a few more projects

558
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,576
I need your help with.

559
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:32,344
No, this was a one-time deal.

560
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:33,579
Or it wasn't.

561
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:37,549
I still have the car and my file.

562
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,318
You sure about that?

563
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:40,886
The drive is blank. It's a fake!

564
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,788
We're a go! Go, go, go, go!

565
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:49,495
- FBI! Hands!
- On the ground!

566
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:57,736
East entrance to the greenhouse!
Let's move!

567
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,004
Tradhtar!

568
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,673
I'll grind your guts to fertilizer!

569
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,008
Hey, you!

570
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:13,352
Everyone okay back here?

571
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:16,054
Yeah. Your friend just saved my life.

572
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,627
I wouldn't say that.

573
00:32:18,993 --> 00:32:20,859
I don't think I saved anyone.

574
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,220
Wait for the Lord with courage.

575
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:44,821
Be stouthearted and wait for the Lord.

576
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:49,228
And now, I've been told
Detective Ressler's eldest son,

577
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:51,631
Robert, would like to say a few words.

578
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:29,157
I know everyone here knew my dad.

579
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:33,245
Had some special version of him
to hold on to.

580
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,542
What a good guy he was.

581
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:38,375
What a good cop.

582
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:41,545
I kinda wish I had that.

583
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:44,673
Truth is, I didn't really know him.

584
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:49,221
My version of Dad

585
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,290
is him stomping into my school...

586
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,194
...fresh from patrol,
furious after I got caught

587
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:58,531
putting cigarette butts
in the faculty's coffee machine.

588
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:03,235
Then he left too soon.

589
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:06,572
And what I have now,

590
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:09,041
i-instead of a version of him
to hold onto...

591
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:13,579
...is a path to follow.

592
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,082
A path that shows me
how to grow up right...

593
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:21,042
...how to stay out of trouble,

594
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,629
how to be good, like him.

595
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:29,228
So, it started with
me only borrowing $50,0000.

596
00:34:29,263 --> 00:34:30,996
But with interest,

597
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:33,065
and the time that had gone by,

598
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,601
Mitko was demanding
that I pay back $150,000.

599
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:36,969
That's when he came after the car...

600
00:34:37,004 --> 00:34:39,905
I don't remember the number on the badge,

601
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:42,441
but it was definitely a cop.

602
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:45,644
The agent and his brother,
they knew about that.

603
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,913
I would say more, but I want
to make a deal first.

604
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,448
Can you prove any of this?

605
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:53,152
You go check out the trunk
of that car yourself.

606
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:54,951
Agent Ressler...

607
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:58,492
There has been an allegation
made against you

608
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:00,861
and your brother by the man
we have in the other room.

609
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:02,195
Yeah, we were expecting that.

610
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,264
It's a very serious allegation.

611
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:10,303
The thing about this case is...

612
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,278
Well, this is interesting...

613
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:23,250
How is the body just gone?

614
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:25,685
I mean, Markin didn't just
get up and walk away.

615
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:29,156
I think we're good.

616
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:30,957
I mean, I don't know
exactly what happened,

617
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:32,948
but I do have some theories.

618
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:35,659
I think someone was watching
over us, Robby.

619
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,033
Now what do we do?

620
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:43,003
Well, I think we can finally
put this behind us and move on.

621
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:45,238
I need a drink.

622
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:52,345
Oh, hi, sweetie.

623
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,980
Were you boys out all night?

624
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,482
Yeah, it was a...

625
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,918
It was a long one.

626
00:35:57,953 --> 00:35:59,753
Well, did everything work out okay?

627
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:01,354
What do you mean?

628
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,229
Did you get Robby
out of the trouble he was in?

629
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,726
I knew something was up.

630
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,316
A mother knows.

631
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,332
You here all of a sudden on a "case."

632
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,335
The case turned out as well as possible.

633
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,404
I'm pretty sure Robby's gonna be okay.

634
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,772
Thank you, Donnie.

635
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:21,508
Trouble or not, your brother means well.

636
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:24,377
He just gets himself
a bit lost sometimes.

637
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,413
I meant what I said about your father

638
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:28,215
being proud of the both of you.

639
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,629
You know why?

640
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:32,452
Because you stick together.

641
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:29,976
I couldn't do that.

642
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:32,712
I couldn't just stand in front
of those people and say...

643
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:37,989
What could I say?

644
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:40,450
It's okay.

645
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:42,619
We got through it.

646
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:44,858
Tomorrow will be easier,

647
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:46,192
and the day after that...

648
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,495
Maybe you can do better
with this than I did.

649
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:54,839
This is Dad's?

650
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:57,717
I can't be a cop.

651
00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:01,241
I'm nothing like him.

652
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,145
I don't know what I am anymore.

653
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,840
- You heading back to D.C., bud?
- Yeah. Yeah.

654
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,709
I'm sure the office has missed me by now.

655
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:39,612
Mom's sure gonna miss you.

656
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:40,847
Yeah.

657
00:38:40,882 --> 00:38:42,887
I'll call. As often as I can.

658
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:45,352
I have something for you.

659
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,317
Never thought I'd see that again.

660
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:58,979
I think it's your turn
to hang onto it a while.

661
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:04,604
You don't think
Dad would've wanted the cop

662
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,439
- in the family to have it?
- No, no.

663
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:08,274
I think he'd want you to have it.

664
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:17,817
Bad time?

665
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:19,753
No. No, come in.

666
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,015
Did you do it to protect me?

667
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:30,143
You say that like it's a bad thing.

668
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:32,399
I'm not gonna ask you how you did it.

669
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:35,368
I won't ask what you did
with Markin's body or... or...

670
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:37,103
or how you even
scrubbed that car clean, but...

671
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,938
I learned from the best.

672
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:40,774
Look, I want to know... I mean...

673
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,675
Liz, I need to know...

674
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:44,177
Why?

675
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:47,947
You were in trouble. You needed help.

676
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:50,216
No, y-y-you... you risked everything.

677
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:51,885
I mean, if you...
you'd have been caught...

678
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
- Yeah, but I wasn't.
- Yeah, but you could've been.

679
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:54,954
Are you trying to say thank you?

680
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,156
'Cause if that's what you're doing,

681
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:57,424
you're doing a terrible job of it.

682
00:39:57,459 --> 00:39:58,663
I... I...

683
00:39:58,698 --> 00:40:01,061
I never would've asked you
to take such a huge risk for me.

684
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,896
- You didn't ask.
- Yeah, but you did it anyway.

685
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:04,697
It wasn't for you, knucklehead.

686
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,262
It was for me.

687
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,001
For you?

688
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:09,402
Look, if you wanna ruin your life

689
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:11,204
over something you did a lifetime ago...

690
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,073
when you were a teenager,
for God's sake...

691
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,442
then someday, sure, I'll let you.

692
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,478
You'll let me.

693
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,778
Yeah, you have my permission
to be a total dipstick.

694
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:21,171
So, what am I?

695
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:22,582
A dipstick or a knucklehead?

696
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,317
You're a knucklehead and a dipstick,

697
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:26,219
and you're someone that I rely on,

698
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,888
for, like... everything.

699
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:30,657
We both know that's not true.

700
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:34,624
Have you looked at my life?

701
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:38,294
I'm a widow and a single mom.

702
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,506
A marionette

703
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:45,802
with a high-functioning
sociopath pulling my strings.

704
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:49,555
My grandfather tried to murder my mother,

705
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:54,060
and my mother is a legendarily
lethal Russian spy

706
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,282
who moved in next door

707
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,351
without even telling me who she was.

708
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,322
I mean it. Have you looked at my life?

709
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,445
I mean, really taken a close look.

710
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:08,728
Because it's like
I'm in the middle of a monsoon

711
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:13,621
that's constantly threatening
to drown me in bad news.

712
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:17,270
And somewhere in the middle
of that FEMA disaster

713
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,668
of a life...

714
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:24,811
Somewhere is just a tiny island of calm.

715
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:29,470
And if that weren't there,

716
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,784
I would be swept out to sea.

717
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,419
No, that's never gonna happen...

718
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:34,821
It would if you weren't here.

719
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,656
But I am. And it won't.

720
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:37,812
Come here.

721
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,960
It's never gonna happen.

722
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,526
Not on my watch.

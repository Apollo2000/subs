00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,610
Hey, Mr. B.

3
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,678
Hey, Charlotte.

4
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:16,784
- Good morning, Mr. B.
- Hi, Amy.

5
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:25,058
Jamie.

6
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,293
Really hate to ask you this.

7
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,497
Thing is, we are one head short
on chaperones

8
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,366
for the LGBTQIA alliance
field trip,

9
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:34,635
and you can say no because

10
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,304
I know you did the event
last weekend...

11
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,472
Sure.
It's fine.

12
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,874
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,875
Thank you so much.

14
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,343
You're the best.

15
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,512
Okay, so, let's not
get bogged down

16
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:44,781
with historical record.

17
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,783
I wanna hear some
creative solutions

18
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,887
to the Treaty of Versailles,
okay?

19
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,856
Yes, Carrie.

20
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,391
Why do you look so scared?

21
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:55,827
Get here five minutes early

22
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:58,630
if you can, please.

23
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,566
You're gonna do great.

24
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,742
So did you finally decide?

25
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,878
It's gonna be Brown.

26
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:12,914
Well, I could've told you
that about a month ago.

27
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,650
Saved you all those
sleepless nights.

28
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,786
So I found out I need
the recommendation letter

29
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:18,857
by next week.

30
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:27,130
I was thinking you should
write it yourself.

31
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,698
- Really?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:29,699
I want you to write

33
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,570
all sorts of amazing things
about yourself,

34
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,672
which are all true,

35
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,875
and I'll look it over,
and I'll sign it.

36
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,444
I think it'd be good for you.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,846
Oh, come on.

38
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,649
It's not that bad.

39
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,851
We'll go over it together.

40
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,519
Just don't tell anyone,
all right?

41
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,520
It's between us.

42
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,557
Okay.
Thanks, Mr. B.

43
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,458
You're welcome.
You're gonna do great.

44
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,598
Ceci.

45
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,666
Come on down.

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,514
Well...

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,716
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,484
I just wanted to tell you
first.

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,987
I'll make an announcement
tomorrow,

50
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,956
not that anyone's
gonna be too surprised.

51
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,791
Well, six months.
That's soon.

52
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,492
They gave me
an 18-month option,

53
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,762
but I figured,
well, shit, you know?

54
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:25,031
It's another year
of the condo in Sarasota

55
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,500
sitting empty.

56
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:29,637
I, um...

57
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,673
I mentioned your name
when I was talking to HR.

58
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,811
Most guys your age, they're
already drawing their pension.

59
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,047
Felicia said she'd be happy
to discuss it all with you.

60
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,548
That's all I'm saying.

61
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,517
They're very supportive.

62
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,988
And I could use
another golf partner.

63
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,624
With you leaving,
the station needs continuity.

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,925
Oh, come on, Harry.

65
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,661
The new guys can handle it.

66
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,464
Soto, McCafferty.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,698
They got the...
they got the energy,

68
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,733
they got the attitude.

69
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,734
That's why you hired them.

70
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,237
So there's a problem
with my attitude now?

71
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,538
Please.

72
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,574
You're like some
cranky old Labrador

73
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,608
sighing in the corner,

74
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:03,944
and look, now you're
limping around

75
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,513
like a goddamn zombie.

76
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:07,815
It's sciatica.

77
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,083
It comes and goes,
and it's getting better.

78
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,084
Stress.

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,253
Ever since that case

80
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,654
last summer with that kid.

81
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,623
Don't think I don't notice.

82
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,168
Ah, welcome
to the northern territories.

83
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,141
- Hey, Dad.
- Look at this guy.

84
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,875
Hey, Grandpa.

85
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,611
What's that you got?

86
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,150
- A book.
- Well, that's good, huh?

87
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:35,351
- Hi.
- Hey.

88
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:36,786
Sorry we missed
the earlier train.

89
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,756
Oh, it's okay, you know.
You made it here.

90
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:42,159
Off we go.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho!

91
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,912
Oh, I gotta say,

92
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:04,819
it's so good to be out
of that rental and in a house.

93
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:08,223
This place used to be
an old army barracks.

94
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,859
- It's over a hundred years old.
- Mm.

95
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,694
You didn't tell me
it was this isolated.

96
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,730
Oh, that's the good part,
you know?

97
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,901
You saw those woods back there.

98
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,237
That's all
Maybrook State Park land,

99
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,839
and it goes on for miles.

100
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,240
We got red-tailed hawks.

101
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:24,708
They come pretty close.

102
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,945
And there's heron
up on the high ponds.

103
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,114
What if something happens
and you need help?

104
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,721
Hey, look what I bought.

105
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,788
It's your favorite, remember?

106
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:36,924
Dad, seriously.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,026
What do you do in an emergency?

108
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,894
You have to think about
these things as you get older.

109
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,264
You barely have
any cell service.

110
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,103
I get two bars
out by the maple tree.

111
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,709
Is he doing okay?

112
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,710
I don't know anymore.

113
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,179
He's obsessed with this series.

114
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,782
He's read that last book,
like, three times.

115
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,684
That's not so bad, huh?

116
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,953
It's all he does.

117
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,755
He has no friends.

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,158
The therapist says that
he's still depressed

119
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,459
about the divorce,

120
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,295
and Andy just
makes things worse.

121
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,363
He barely checks in.

122
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,032
He keeps blaming the time
difference with London.

123
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:16,002
It's like all of a sudden,

124
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,175
Eli just doesn't
have a dad anymore.

125
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:22,110
He could come up here
more often.

126
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:24,079
I can keep him busy.

127
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,982
It's not about
keeping him busy, Dad.

128
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,783
He's fragile.

129
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,189
I can still help.

130
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,323
I'm getting better
about things.

131
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,929
Yeah.
Okay.

132
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:42,800
You have to let me help.

133
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,904
Okay.

134
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,808
So this woman
came into the store today,

135
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,145
and she actually started
haggling with me.

136
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,149
She said, "Why should I pay $25
for a scented candle

137
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,986
when I can get one for 6
at Cat's Cradle?"

138
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,154
What's Cat's Cradle?

139
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,857
It's that craft shop
by the diner.

140
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:06,361
Smells like a cinnamon stick
took a shit on a doily.

141
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:09,065
I don't know,
it just threw me.

142
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,535
And maybe she's right.
Maybe I'm a total snob.

143
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:26,252
You're supposed to say,
"No, honey.

144
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,121
You're not a snob.
You're just discerning."

145
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,160
Yeah, a discerning snob.

146
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,864
Any commuter train news?

147
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,368
Banker Bob was playing
his video game again.

148
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:41,570
Full volume.

149
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,805
- The gall.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,242
I'll get it.

151
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,979
It's probably UPS.

152
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,323
Amazon delivery.

153
00:08:58,191 --> 00:08:59,324
What the hell are you
doing here?

154
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,094
Or is it one of those
meal kits?

155
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,231
You have people
chop your onions for you now?

156
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,202
I told you not to come here.

157
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:11,205
Nick, I'm serious.

158
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,841
Get the hell out of here.

159
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:17,845
You don't get to tell me
when to go.

160
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,317
You fucking hear me?

161
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,887
Not this time.

162
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,889
Babe.

163
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,625
- Hey.
- Uh, hey. Hey, hon.

164
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:29,926
What is...

165
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,862
Nick, this is my wife.

166
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,431
- Leela, this is Nick.
- Hi.

167
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,999
- We went to college together.
- Hi.

168
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,168
- He just... he just dropped by.
- Oh.

169
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,037
- How are you?
- Wow.

170
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,440
Good, good, thanks.

171
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,942
It's good to meet you.

172
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:46,279
You didn't tell me
about this.

173
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,214
Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,052
You're gonna be a father?

175
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,057
He definitely didn't
mention this.

176
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,360
You must be due soon.

177
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,028
- Yeah, was it, uh...
- We got a week.

178
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,096
- It's a week.
- A week to go.

179
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:03,899
Wow. Congratulations.

180
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,101
- Thank you.
- Both of you.

181
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,070
That's amazing.

182
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,405
I'm sorry for the surprise
drop-in.

183
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,108
I was in the area,
I had some work stuff,

184
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,977
and I thought I'd swing by
and surprise this guy,

185
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,114
maybe coax him out for a beer.

186
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,416
No, no, we're just
making dinner, so...

187
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,918
- Making dinner?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,387
Well, serves me right
for stopping by

189
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:24,223
without texting first.

190
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,327
You know what,
do you wanna...

191
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,428
do you wanna join us
for dinner?

192
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:29,463
We have plenty of food.

193
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,031
- No, no.
- You can just...

194
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:33,201
We can catch up anytime,
and you need a break.

195
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,268
I don't, I'm good.

196
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:35,370
Babe, you've been
going hard...

197
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,105
Honestly, it'd be great,

198
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,240
if it's not too much trouble.

199
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:40,342
No, it's fine.
It's not a problem.

200
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,010
- Not at all.
- You sure?

201
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,114
Yeah, no, come on in.
Yeah.

202
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,482
Please.
The chicken's almost ready.

203
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,317
So.

204
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,024
She's lovely.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,034
I started creating these
essential oil blends,

206
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,037
custom scents, and those
did very well online.

207
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,139
Mm-hmm.

208
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,508
Now I'm developing the brand,

209
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:11,044
and I opened a store
a couple of months ago,

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,150
right after we moved here,
and then... yeah.

211
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,489
Yeah, it's kind of
an experiment.

212
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,390
- Sounds promising.
- Yeah, well.

213
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,995
I'm not quite sure I am
what Dorchester's looking for.

214
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,496
Oh, come on, babe.

215
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,599
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Your stuff is amazing.

216
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:30,168
We'll see how it goes.

217
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:31,536
So it was your idea
to move here.

218
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:33,505
Hmm? What?

219
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,140
It was, wasn't it?

220
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,208
She wanted to stay in Brooklyn.

221
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,543
No.
No, that's not...

222
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:40,012
I mean, we both thought
that it was time to...

223
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,247
- branch out a little bit, right?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,384
We needed more space
with the baby coming, so.

225
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,588
But you didn't want the baby
just yet.

226
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,525
Am I right?
I mean, you had the business.

227
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,430
Things you wanted to do.

228
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,366
It was Jamie who wanted
the baby.

229
00:11:57,402 --> 00:12:00,303
The house.
Driveway.

230
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,105
And the picket fence.

231
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:06,443
Poor little Jamie Burns.

232
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,111
Grasping at straws.

233
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,814
Shut up, man.

234
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,250
Just shut the fuck up.

235
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,351
Okay?

236
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,421
What about you?

237
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:17,192
What's work been for you?

238
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:21,060
Private equity.

239
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,467
It's a game.

240
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:27,602
First you learn the system,

241
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:31,172
then you learn the system
was designed to be cheated.

242
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,077
I think of it all as adversity.

243
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:37,614
A challenge by which
I can know myself.

244
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,383
And are there big
private equity deals

245
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,652
going down in Dorchester?

246
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,188
Is that why you're here?

247
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,559
No, not really.

248
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:09,317
Yeah?

249
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:15,327
Hey. Mel.

250
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,662
Hey, Mel.

251
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,233
I gotta go.

252
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,337
Nothing ever happens,
but of course tonight...

253
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,507
there was an accident
off of Route 9.

254
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,242
You're on call tonight?

255
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:31,613
I didn't think I...

256
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:36,619
That's the way it worked out.

257
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,423
Tell Eli I'm sorry
I missed breakfast.

258
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,127
Yeah.

259
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:48,363
Mel.

260
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,631
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,234
Sorry to pull you
out of bed, Harry.

262
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,403
No, that's okay.

263
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,672
- Whoa.
- Pretty rough, huh?

264
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,273
Passenger called it in.

265
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,976
He's at St. Emilia's right now
getting checked out.

266
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,612
Okay.

267
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,815
Found a open container
in the car.

268
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,418
I can show it to you.

269
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:38,355
Had to have been going
pretty fast to wreck like that.

270
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,590
Yeah, I'm guessing
at least 80?

271
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,558
It's kind of crazy
on a road like this.

272
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,295
What were they even doing
heading down this road?

273
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,697
It's just one residence.

274
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,599
Owner wasn't expecting anybody.

275
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:50,002
It's all private land out here.

276
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,273
And the driver?

277
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,609
We're gonna need hydraulics
to get him out.

278
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,577
Idiot wasn't wearing
a seatbelt.

279
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:46,852
Jamie?

280
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:52,190
- Hey.
- Hi.

281
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,325
It's not bad.

282
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,527
It's just a couple stitches.
I'm fine.

283
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:56,862
They told me about Nick.

284
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:58,764
I'm so sorry.

285
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,201
What happened?

286
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,304
We lost control.

287
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,373
He was driving too fast.

288
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,809
- Okay.
- Come here.

289
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:16,152
They wouldn't tell me
if you were okay or not.

290
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,920
The hospital,
when they called, they...

291
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,956
the whole way here,

292
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:23,193
I just thought you were...

293
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,430
It's okay.

294
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:32,136
I'm okay.

295
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:33,805
<i>Hi, this is Stephanie Carver</i>

296
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,841
<i>at the Jefferson Veteran's
Home in Park Mills.</i>

297
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:37,243
Yeah.

298
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,811
<i>I was just calling
because we still have</i>

299
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,547
<i>some of your father's
personal items here.</i>

300
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,583
<i>Would you like to come by
and pick them up?</i>

301
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:46,254
Oh. Uh...

302
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,255
No, thanks.

303
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,892
<i>Oh.
Are you sure?</i>

304
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,430
I'm in New York State.
I'm not in Michigan.

305
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,598
<i>Well, we could ship them
to you.</i>

306
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,932
<i>You never know; there might be</i>

307
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,434
<i>some items
of sentimental value.</i>

308
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,572
No, I don't...

309
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:05,976
Okay, fine.

310
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,413
My office is 433
Sycamore Street,

311
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,915
Dorchester, New York,
11332.

312
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,452
<i>11332. Got it.</i>

313
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,920
<i>We'll ship that
right out to you, sir.</i>

314
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,192
Okay. Thanks.

315
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,626
Hey, I heard about
your late night.

316
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:20,861
You know I would have been
more than happy

317
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,296
to take that call
for you, right?

318
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,997
I know you had family in town.

319
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,267
Well, that's my shift.

320
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,335
Yeah, I'm just saying.

321
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:30,572
I could always fill in
when personal stuff comes up.

322
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,544
You know, I got you,
you do the same for me.

323
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah.

324
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:38,415
<i>Uh, detective,</i>

325
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,650
<i>we have someone here
to see you.</i>

326
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,286
<i>James Burns?</i>

327
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,541
Mr. Burns.

328
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:03,445
Detective Lieutenant Ambrose.

329
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,945
Thanks for coming in.

330
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:05,982
Sure.

331
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,019
Sorry about what happened.

332
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,425
You've gone through a lot.

333
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,026
When there's an open
alcohol container

334
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,598
found in a car accident,
we have to file a report.

335
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:25,002
It's just a formality
for the insurance companies.

336
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,270
Well, for the record,

337
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,340
I was the only one
drinking last night.

338
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,975
Nick was sober.

339
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,545
And Nick Haas
was your friend?

340
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,714
Yeah, we're friends
from college.

341
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,050
He came over for dinner
with me and my wife.

342
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:40,554
I hadn't seen him in a while,
so after that,

343
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,523
you know, we went to have
a nightcap at the bar

344
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,291
at his hotel.

345
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,327
And where was that?

346
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,995
Uh...

347
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,632
the Haven Residence Inn
in Irvington.

348
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,703
And after the hotel?

349
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,070
Well, Nick was driving, and...

350
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:56,008
Sorry, where were you going?

351
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,475
He was driving me home.

352
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,512
But you ended up
on private property.

353
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:03,046
That's pretty far
out of your way.

354
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,684
Yeah, yeah, 'cause Nick,

355
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,086
he wanted to see the lookout
point on Mattasackett,

356
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,324
and we got lost.

357
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,027
You didn't have
your cell phone?

358
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,099
Cell phone service
was spotty out there.

359
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,435
Ah.

360
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,037
I wasn't exactly sober
at that point,

361
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:26,341
so it's not super clear,
okay, but...

362
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,510
he was driving too fast,
I know that.

363
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:29,579
How fast?
Do you remember?

364
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:32,048
Too fast.
He wouldn't slow down.

365
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,419
Why not?

366
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,125
You can't really tell Nick
what to do.

367
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:45,664
And then what?

368
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,467
I don't know, it's...

369
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,802
it's like we lost traction,
and...

370
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:53,072
the next thing I knew,
we were just thrown,

371
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,742
you know, upside down,
every direction,

372
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:00,482
like a big hand was just
shaking the car, and...

373
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,083
and then it stopped.

374
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,385
And when I realized
what happened,

375
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,655
I crawled out of the car,
and I called 911.

376
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:12,395
Nick was... he...

377
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:15,232
he...

378
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:16,400
he was barely alive.

379
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,636
He couldn't move, he...

380
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:19,637
he was trapped, you know.

381
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:23,107
The car had...

382
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:26,178
It's okay.

383
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:29,782
I saw the wreck.

384
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,153
I know.

385
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,457
You saw Nick?

386
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:37,759
Yeah.

387
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:45,169
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:49,640
Take your time.

389
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:59,250
It's weird, you know.
It's like...

390
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,854
Everything looks different now.

391
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,592
Like my house, I know it's
my house, but it's not quite...

392
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,633
My hands.

393
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,802
They don't seem like my hands.

394
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,538
You're probably
in shock still,

395
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:22,879
so you might wanna see somebody
to help you process all that.

396
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,886
Have you ever seen someone
die in front of you?

397
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,555
Someone you care about?

398
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:37,295
Once.

399
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,230
What was it like for you?

400
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,937
Not what I expected.

401
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:48,207
Yeah.

402
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:51,278
Yeah, that's the thing.

403
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:54,716
You think it'd be horrible,
but...

404
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:57,786
I've known Nick since college,
and it was like...

405
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,827
I finally saw him
for the first time.

406
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,669
The way he looked at me.

407
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,739
And that was how?

408
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,852
I don't know.

409
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,863
I don't know.

410
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,803
So, uh, thanks for coming in.

411
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,638
Okay.

412
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:43,639
Thank you.

413
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:44,808
Yep.

414
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:48,685
Hi.

415
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,653
Sonya Barzel?

416
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,890
Yeah?
Can I help you?

417
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:57,659
Yeah, I'm Detective
Lieutenant Harry Ambrose.

418
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:58,594
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,964
I'm following up on that
accident last night.

420
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,866
Oh.

421
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,501
I've been wondering all day
what's going on.

422
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:06,771
Nobody told me anything.

423
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:09,774
Our guys just started
removing the car.

424
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,712
It'll be out of your way
in a couple hours.

425
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:13,879
What about the passenger?

426
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:15,948
They said he was taken
to the hospital.

427
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,050
Oh, no, he's fine.
It's...

428
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:21,090
He's back at home now.
Lucky guy.

429
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,527
Were you expecting anybody
last night?

430
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:27,929
No, I was asleep.

431
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,531
Hm.

432
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:30,899
Was anybody here with you?

433
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,035
Nope.
I live alone.

434
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,438
So you're single, then, huh?

435
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,375
I'm a painter.
That's my studio

436
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,977
Ah.

437
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,780
Pretty secluded out here, huh?

438
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,750
Yeah, well, that's the way
I like it.

439
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:46,984
Ah.

440
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,853
Do you have any idea
why those two

441
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,823
were heading to your house
in the middle of the night?

442
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,558
I don't even
know their names.

443
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:56,528
Oh, well, it's Nick Haas
and James Burns,

444
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:59,899
known as Jamie.

445
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:01,135
You recognize them?

446
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,141
No.

447
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:09,511
So you own all that land

448
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:10,946
all the way down to Route 9,
huh?

449
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,515
Yeah, it's about 60 acres.

450
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,518
Any other places nearby?

451
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:17,753
Nope, mine is the only house
on the road.

452
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:20,891
Well, then it does seem like
Mr. Haas and Mr. Burns

453
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:24,195
must have been traveling
to your house in particular.

454
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,499
Why do you think that is?

455
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:30,836
I'm sorry,
what are you implying?

456
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:32,872
I'm only trying
to understand the situation.

457
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,773
I think you should be the one
explaining to me

458
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:36,209
why two men were speeding
toward my house

459
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,443
in the middle of the night.

460
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,612
That's your job, isn't it?

461
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:41,015
All right.

462
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,917
If we find out anything,
we'll let you know.

463
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,919
I appreciate your time.

464
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,526
Were they armed?

465
00:25:51,562 --> 00:25:53,462
The men?

466
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,466
No.

467
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,951
<i>You're my favorite helper,</i>

468
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,930
but Stosh better not call in
sick after the baby comes.

469
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:22,001
I just keep having visions of
breastfeeding at the register.

470
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:23,639
Could be good for business.

471
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,041
It's not really the clientele
I'm going for.

472
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,078
Hi.

473
00:26:30,114 --> 00:26:32,013
Welcome.

474
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,081
All right.

475
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:36,818
This one is done.

476
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:37,923
Thank you.

477
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:52,438
Babe?

478
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:53,738
Oh, thanks.

479
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,476
Hi.

480
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,952
Card in there.

481
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:27,044
Jamie?

482
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,082
Yeah.

483
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,984
Hey, you okay?

484
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,154
Yeah.

485
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,757
You mind if I meet you
at home later?

486
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:40,527
I think I need some fresh air.

487
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:42,829
Maybe a jog or something.

488
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:51,006
He sustained a couple blows
to the head as well,

489
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,209
but the internal hemorrhaging
is what killed him.

490
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:56,515
You see the puncture wounds
here and here.

491
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,883
How long would it
have taken him to bleed out?

492
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,084
Hard to say.

493
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,521
The pressure would've
slowed the bleeding.

494
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,690
How much?

495
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,262
He would have made it
if the medics arrived sooner.

496
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:14,733
What's that?

497
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:17,203
A knife wound,
or some other puncture.

498
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,273
That happened at least
three days ago, though,

499
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,146
and no stitches, which
is strange for a cut that big.

500
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:27,082
Huh.

501
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:29,318
Nicholas Burton Haas.

502
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,922
38 years old, resident
of Monterey, California.

503
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,325
Single.

504
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:37,828
Nothing on his record.

505
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:40,266
No social media profile at all.

506
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,069
Ooh, and judging from his
tax records, the guy did well.

507
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,972
Got a whole slew
of LLC companies.

508
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,578
Where's his cell phone?
I'm not seeing it.

509
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,148
That's everything we got.

510
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,250
I just wanna say,

511
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,154
I appreciate you letting me
tag along on this.

512
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,123
I don't know why you are.

513
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,560
You already made
Detective Sergeant.

514
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:06,862
Well, yeah, you know, in AA,

515
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:08,864
we always say
the learning never ends,

516
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,167
and I figure I can learn a few
things from a veteran like you.

517
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:12,935
Yeah?

518
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:15,004
- Okay, here we are.
- Damn.

519
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,042
The car flipped, so that cell
phone could be anywhere inside.

520
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:20,578
I gotta say, man, I really
don't get what you see in this.

521
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:22,280
There's no crime here,
is there?

522
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,149
No.

523
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:26,117
Not quite.

524
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:29,024
Well, no cell phone.

525
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,997
But the parking brake
is pulled up.

526
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,300
That wouldn't have happened
after the crash.

527
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,936
Maybe that's what caused it?

528
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:43,307
Maybe.

529
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:56,052
This blood and fingerprints...

530
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,322
had to be Nick Haas'.

531
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:01,959
Jamie Burns said the other guy
didn't move,

532
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:04,232
but it looks like
he was struggling.

533
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:09,402
There's another fingerprint.

534
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:11,705
The blood down there.

535
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,341
Haas was pinned in there.
He couldn't have reached there.

536
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,310
That had to be Jamie Burns.

537
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:19,280
Why would he be worried about
music after a crash like that?

538
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,113
Okay.

539
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:58,993
Hey, Mike,
it's Harry Ambrose.

540
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,429
Yeah, you know
that car accident,

541
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:02,297
happened off Route 9
last night,

542
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,268
I need a forensics team here
ASAP.

543
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:08,271
We gotta grid the site.

544
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:11,208
Yep.

545
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,480
Possible crime scene.

546
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:17,350
<i>His book.
"The Dragonspore."</i>

547
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:18,952
<i>What store, Dad?</i>

548
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:20,021
"Dragonspore."

549
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,222
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

550
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:22,223
Eli left it here.

551
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,324
<i>It's breaking up...</i>

552
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,359
Melanie?

553
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:26,328
All right.

554
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:27,932
Can you hear me now?

555
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,232
Yeah.

556
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:32,969
Well, you know,
I was just thinking

557
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:37,241
maybe I could bring the book
down to you in the city.

558
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:40,277
To you, today.
I could drive it down.

559
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:42,280
<i>What time do you want
to drop it off?</i>

560
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:45,050
Well, I was thinking maybe
I could stay for dinner

561
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:47,685
and head back up afterwards.

562
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,695
No, I can make sure
there's a tracking number.

563
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:58,932
Just tell Eli that I hope
he feels better.

564
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:00,036
<i>I will.</i>

565
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,004
Okay.

566
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,972
<i>Okay. Bye, Dad.</i>

567
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,219
Mrs. Burns?

568
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,388
Yes.

569
00:33:17,424 --> 00:33:20,357
I'm Detective Lieutenant
Harry Ambrose.

570
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:23,060
I wrote up the report
on your husband's accident.

571
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:25,263
I was just stopping by
to see how he was doing.

572
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,166
Oh. That's...

573
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:29,368
That's kind of you.

574
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:32,305
Um, he's... he's good.
He, um...

575
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:35,042
He's running some errands
in town.

576
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,977
We're having trouble
contacting

577
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,446
Mr. Haas' next of kin,

578
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:42,083
and I was wondering if you had
any information

579
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,685
about his family or business.

580
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,254
No, Jamie might,
but I... I wouldn't.

581
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,023
I just met Nick the first time
the night of the accident.

582
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,393
Ah, no cell phone number,
probably.

583
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,462
Sorry.

584
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:56,334
Your husband and Mr. Haas
were pretty close friends.

585
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,773
Um, not exactly.

586
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,209
Did your husband spend
any time with Mr. Haas

587
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,247
in the days leading up
to the accident?

588
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:11,084
Is... is there a problem?

589
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,318
No, not really.

590
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,321
It's just that Mr. Haas
had been staying

591
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:18,225
in a hotel in Irvington
for several days.

592
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,395
Well, he... he just...

593
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:23,498
he told us he was up
for the night for work.

594
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:26,067
So you probably don't know
whether or not

595
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:30,409
your husband saw Mr. Haas
before that night, huh?

596
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,110
I don't understand.

597
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:35,148
What does this have to do
with the accident?

598
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:38,383
Nothing, probably.

599
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,018
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

600
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,520
Appreciate it.

601
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:45,057
- Good luck with the baby.
- Thank you.

602
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,098
So I was wondering
after all these years, did...

603
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,535
did Jamie ever tell you about
what we used to do in school?

604
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:56,070
Nick.

605
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,108
Did he ever mention me?

606
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:03,312
You didn't, did you?

607
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,448
The history teacher
wrote me out of history.

608
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:07,250
That's not true.
I talked about Nick.

609
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:08,818
You just don't remember.

610
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:12,423
Well, I'm assuming you've got
some stories, then.

611
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:17,262
Should I tell her?

612
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,431
This is so stupid.

613
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,466
How would she react?

614
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,068
- About what?
- Nothing.

615
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,238
Just the usual
college bullshit.

616
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:26,272
Take your plate?

617
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:28,442
You know, I think we've got
some ice cream.

618
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:30,911
I'm gonna check.

619
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,913
Thank you.

620
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:42,591
Don't play this fucking game
with me.

621
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:44,193
It's too easy.

622
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,120
Come right in.

623
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:08,857
- Those are his.
- Thanks.

624
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,210
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey.</i>

625
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:28,145
<i>Just wanted to let you know</i>

626
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:30,380
the rental car's computer
system got fried

627
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,584
from the accident,
so no navigation info there,

628
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,456
but forensics did find a cell
phone at the accident site

629
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:38,657
<i>in some bushes near the car.</i>

630
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:41,527
<i>An old BlackBerry.</i>

631
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,228
- BlackBerry?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

632
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:45,332
I remember this tech guy
in Afghanistan

633
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,499
telling me they're easier
to encrypt.

634
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:50,971
Well, looks like Nick Haas
took his privacy seriously.

635
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:53,507
Well, give it to our guys.

636
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:56,411
There ought to be a record
of cell phone tower pings.

637
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,479
<i>All right, sure thing.</i>

638
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,583
Thanks.

639
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:31,452
Yeah.
No, I get it, it's fine.

640
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:34,590
Fine, I'll come when you
feel better.

641
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:36,958
Mom, Mom, it's fine.

642
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,560
The baby's not going anywhere.

643
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,062
<i>I love you.</i>

644
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,665
Love you too.
Feel better.

645
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:44,702
Bye.

646
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:47,271
Back got worse.
She's not coming.

647
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,507
You know, honestly,
it's better this way.

648
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,442
You'd just end up
taking care of her too.

649
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,514
You're right.
You're right.

650
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:56,982
I'm sorry, hon.

651
00:37:57,018 --> 00:38:00,019
Um... I forgot to tell you.

652
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,521
The detective
you spoke to yesterday,

653
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:03,657
he stopped by
while you were out.

654
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,559
Why?

655
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:08,630
He was looking for Nick's
cell phone number.

656
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,332
He didn't get in touch
with you?

657
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:12,667
- No.
- Huh.

658
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:14,035
That's strange.

659
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,471
Um...

660
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,674
I wonder why he didn't
just call you.

661
00:38:20,312 --> 00:38:22,279
Anyway, you know how
I've been looking into

662
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:24,648
natural alternatives
to Pitocin?

663
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:27,050
So Brian was telling me

664
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:28,786
that there's this
spicy vinaigrette

665
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:31,122
they have at a restaurant
in Queens

666
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:33,459
that's supposed
to induce labor.

667
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,627
People swear it works.

668
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,664
I'm not sure I totally buy it.

669
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,798
Maybe I should go get some.

670
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:41,802
Maybe.

671
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:42,903
I guess it can't hurt.

672
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:46,340
If it's not too far
out of your way, just get it.

673
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:48,710
Maybe, I don't know.
Why not, right?

674
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,712
It could be worth a try.

675
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,687
You okay?

676
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:03,627
I'm so...

677
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:05,429
I'm so sorry, I...

678
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:06,831
I'm so...

679
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,602
- Jamie.
- I'm fine.

680
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,512
<i>Well, that's a really
interesting question.</i>

681
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:21,447
<i>Comes down
to male vulnerability.</i>

682
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:23,249
<i>That's what I look for.</i>

683
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:26,820
<i>The intimacy that comes
when a man is truly exposed.</i>

684
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:30,123
<i>Culturally, we're just
not used to seeing that, ever.</i>

685
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,193
<i>In my exp...</i>

686
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,236
Wow.
Impressive work.

687
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:42,237
Yeah.

688
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:44,107
Impressive cheeks.

689
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,476
Well, hey, we got
the cell tower pings

690
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,445
off that BlackBerry.

691
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:51,181
- Thanks.
- Yep.

692
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:56,488
Jamie Burns' 911 call,
that was logged at 4:33 a.m.

693
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:59,759
The medical examiner's report
confirms time of death

694
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,360
right about the same time,

695
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:04,497
but the last few pings
from Nick Haas' cell phone

696
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:09,269
place him in the same area
beginning at 3:17 a.m.

697
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:12,340
So that's over an hour between
the time of the accident

698
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,309
and when the 911 call was made,

699
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,312
so why did Jamie Burns
wait so long

700
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,850
to make an emergency call?

701
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,483
It's intriguing.

702
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,152
I'll give you that.

703
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,254
But, I mean,
what does it prove?

704
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,923
Maybe the guy was unconscious.

705
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,224
He didn't have any
major head trauma.

706
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,227
Okay, so he...

707
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,396
He was in shock, he passed out.

708
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:36,335
I mean, there is no proof
of ill intent here, right?

709
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:40,506
The guy just suffered a major
tragic event in his young life.

710
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,911
Failure to save somebody's
life, that's not a crime.

711
00:40:43,947 --> 00:40:47,915
But impeding a rescue,
that's...

712
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:48,816
That's second-degree murder.

713
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:51,352
How do you know that, Harry?
Come on.

714
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:53,622
This guy,
he's a schoolteacher.

715
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,357
He's a local family man.

716
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:59,195
That's what he wants
everybody to believe, but...

717
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:02,532
he's lying, or at least
omitting key information,

718
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,534
and we still don't have
a good explanation

719
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,403
of why they were on
that woman's property.

720
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:08,506
I just don't know why
we're using resources

721
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:11,578
nitpicking over this guy, hmm?

722
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:25,227
I'm gonna go put a dent
in some other cases for a bit.

723
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:31,201
Where did they say
they found that phone, exactly?

724
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:35,673
Right there, about
five feet away from the car.

725
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,041
Five feet away?

726
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,243
Yeah, but the techs said
the phone could easily

727
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,277
have been thrown
through a windshield.

728
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:43,013
Did the techs say there was
anything unusual

729
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:44,014
- about the phone?
- No.

730
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,915
I was with them.

731
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,619
We turned it on,
did the download here.

732
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,889
Turned it on.
So it still had battery life?

733
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,693
Yeah.
About 30% I think.

734
00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:55,895
If the phone didn't
run out of juice,

735
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,329
it must have been turned off.

736
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,500
Yeah, I guess so.

737
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:02,436
We need to dust that phone.

738
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:03,971
You're right, you're right.
I'm on it.

739
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,746
Oh, my God, that's so good.

740
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:12,915
Please tell me
you'll keep doing this

741
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,417
after I can
touch my toes again.

742
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:18,390
- I promise.
- Thank you.

743
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:21,624
Hey.

744
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,296
You and Nick were...
you were close

745
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:26,733
back in school, weren't you?

746
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,602
Yeah.

747
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:34,275
Yeah, we were pretty
inseparable for about a year.

748
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:37,412
Why didn't you ever
mention him?

749
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,950
Because I had to cut him off.

750
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:44,753
He's a troubled guy.

751
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:46,988
He's self-destructive.

752
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,961
Yeah, I... I felt that
at dinner.

753
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,433
There was... there was an energy
between you.

754
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:01,105
Well, he was actually
in town this week.

755
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:04,041
He wanted to see me,
and I kept putting him off.

756
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:06,647
That's why he showed up
out of the blue.

757
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:10,682
Once you let him in,
he just keeps wanting more.

758
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,384
It's always been like that.

759
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,488
Do you think maybe he was...

760
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:17,624
in love with you?

761
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,126
No, it was never like that.

762
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:20,630
Why not?

763
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,698
- Because it wasn't.
- Really?

764
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:29,571
No college moment?

765
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,008
No experimenting
between friends?

766
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,776
Nothing?

767
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,611
Okay, if you really
wanna know...

768
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,147
- Yes, I wanna know.
- Yeah?

769
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:41,518
Yeah, we tried once,
and it didn't work.

770
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,557
For either of us.
It was...

771
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,627
Jamie Burns.

772
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:51,130
- What?
- Hm.

773
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,598
You think that's hot.

774
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:55,735
Well... kind of.

775
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,103
Really?

776
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:58,638
Really.

777
00:43:58,674 --> 00:43:59,841
Like, really hot?

778
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,712
Like, really hot.

779
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,691
- Yeah.
- <i>So I gotta hand it to you.</i>

780
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:16,126
<i>This is why you're the man.</i>

781
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:17,828
Uh, what'd you find out?

782
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,130
Hello?

783
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,633
What?
Uh, hang on.

784
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:24,636
Hang on.

785
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:27,206
<i>They dusted the phone
for fingerprints,</i>

786
00:44:27,242 --> 00:44:29,141
<i>and get this:
they didn't find any.</i>

787
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:30,643
<i>No prints anywhere
on the phone,</i>

788
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,777
<i>which is impossible...</i>

789
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:34,181
Unless someone
wiped the phone clean.

790
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:35,649
<i>Exactly.</i>

791
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:38,485
<i>You're right.
He's hiding something.</i>

792
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:07,153
Once we get there,
the less you speak, the better.

793
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:08,154
I'm not doing this.

794
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,155
Yes, you are.

795
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:11,226
You just watch me and follow.

796
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:14,695
You're fucking crazy.

797
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:16,830
No such thing.

798
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:21,136
Right?
Your words, remember?

799
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,237
Stop the car.

800
00:45:25,277 --> 00:45:28,277
Stop the car,
or I will fucking jump.

801
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,191
Nick!
Stop this car right now!

802
00:45:40,227 --> 00:45:41,859
God...

803
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,787
Oh, God.

804
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:03,056
Oh, my God.

805
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:12,300
It's okay.

806
00:47:12,336 --> 00:47:13,834
It's all right.

807
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:21,811
Call 911, Jamie.

808
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,026
Jamie.

809
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,870
Jamie!

810
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,092
What are you doing?

811
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,052
Okay.

812
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:59,872

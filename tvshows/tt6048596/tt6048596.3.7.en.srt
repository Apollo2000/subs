00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,899
I mean, what... what do they have on me?

333
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,629
Have they shown you any evidence?

334
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,669
Well, there's the timeline

335
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,549
from the accident to the 911 call.

336
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,926
And they're saying that Nick's
cell phone was wiped clean.

337
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,343
But it's not enough to
build a case against you,

338
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,479
so we are really gonna focus
on the Huntley Hearing.

339
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,725
What is that?

340
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:51,799
To determine if the
confession is admissible

341
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,869
or if it's coerced in some way.

342
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,358
What confession?

343
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,729
Detective Ambrose.

344
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,405

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,319
He has you on tape

348
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,541
saying that you moved your
friend's cell phone away,

349

We're gonna get this
confession thrown out.

352

And then there'll be
no case against you.

- No, it's okay.

You're all twisted up inside,

- No.
- Which is good.

362
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,920
It's right that you feel guilty.

363
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:02,383
What you have to do is
confess what you did...

364
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:05,349
- No.
- You need relief.

365
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,239
You have to give yourself that.

Detective, is it true that
in pursuing this case,

419
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:15,919
you helped Mr. Burns, of all things,

420
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,848
plant a tree in his backyard?

421
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,139
Yes, I did.

422
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,859
He was a subject of an investigation,

423
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,730
and I needed to gain his confidence.

424
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:30,899
Then you also appeared at
his house on October 21st,

425
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,939
and then again on October 29th,

426
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,949
where you accused him of murder.

427
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,529
Yet you made no arrests. Why was that?

428
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,702
I didn't have sufficient evidence.

429
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,122
I see. And then on the
night of October 30th,

430
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:46,041
you followed my client
to the city, to a bar,

431
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,460
and then two different parties.

432
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,419
- Is that right?
- I did, yes.

433
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,099
Do you do that often, Detective?

434
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,749
Go out and party with suspects?

435
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,129
Mr. Burns was volatile and dangerous,

436
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,989
and he needed to be supervised.

437
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,929
Oh, supervised.

438
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,519
Well, these photos, Detective,

439
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,856
are marked defense exhibits A, B, and C.

440
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,693
Is this an accurate picture

441
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:15,112
of your supervision of
Mr. Burns that night?

442
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,419
Or maybe this?

443
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,949
Okay, that woman was a therapist.

444
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,659
I have a sciatic nerve condition,

445
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,581
and she was saying that she
could help reduce the pain.

446
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,359
And this photo, in the foreground.

447
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,375
What is that? Cocaine?

448
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:30,059
I never touched that.

449
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,119
And after the second party
on the night of the 30th,

450
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,429
Mr. Burns left without you.

451
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,959
But you continued to
pursue him in what turned

452
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,535
into a high-speed car chase
through Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

453
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,929
Then after the car chase,
you two made up.

454
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,719
I mean, you actually drove him home.

455
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,604
- Isn't that right?
- I drove him back, yeah.

456
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,855
It seems like your relationship

457
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,774
with Mr. Burns is very complicated.

458
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,949
And after you dropped
Mr. Burns at his house,

459
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,959
what happened then?

460
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,999
Somebody needed to stake out his place,

461
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,219
so I stayed there in the car overnight.

462
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,579
You fell asleep, correct?
While you were stalking him.

463
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,179
- Staking. I was staking him.
- Stake, stalk.

464
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,679
- Potato, potahto.
- Your Honor.

465
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,469
Mr. Kowalski, get to the
matter of the confession.

466
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,549
I'm just making a point, Your Honor,

467
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,133
that Detective Ambrose was
harassing my client for weeks

468
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,969
leading up to his confession,
placing Mr. Burns

469
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,680
under extraordinary pressure to comply.

470
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:28,649
Is it true that in order to
gain Mr. Burns's trust,

471
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,849
you agreed to being buried in a grave

472
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,190
for eight hours?

473
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,769
That's correct.

474
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,239
- In fact...
- Pardon me, counselor.

475
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,199
You agreed to be...

476
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,825
how deep a grave?

477
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:47,371
I don't know. Maybe just six feet or so.

478
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:50,219
Could you get out on your own?

479
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,380
No.

480
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,212
Continue, counselor.

481
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,799
In exchange for you
going into the grave,

482
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,419
Mr. Burns provided you
with a signed confession.

483
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,699
- Is that right?
- Yes, that was the agreement.

484
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,473
And what happened to
that signed confession?

485
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,899
- We burned it.
- That's a fun game.

486
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,519
- That's a fun, fun, fun game.
- It wasn't a game.

487
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,119
Burying each other alive,
pretending to be dead...

488
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,979
- Your Honor.
- Counselor, get to your point. Please.

489
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,199
In all this pretending,
how are we to know

490
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,040
that James Burn didn't
confess to a pretend murder?

491
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,780
It wasn't pretend.

492
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:33,000

00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:35,328
And it was the same night.

658
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,439
Then he, um...

659
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,569
he told me about a week later.

660
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,319
He told me that he...

661
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,714
that he killed that man.

662
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,839
And I know I... I know
I should have come.

663
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,679
It's just, I... [CRIES]

664
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,179
I didn't know what to do, you know?

665
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,510
'Cause he's my husband.

666
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,279
It's a complicated situation,

667
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,180
and we appreciate that you came forward.

668
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,549
Mrs. Burns, would you
be willing to testify

669
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,776
to what you just told us?

670
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,119
But you can do something.

671
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,939
There must be something you can do.

672
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,319
- He needs help.
- We'll do what we can.

673
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,339
Detective Soto will escort
you home, Mrs. Burns.

674
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,479
And we will make sure
that you're protected

675
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,580
until we find your husband.

676
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,630
Right this way, ma'am. Thank you.

677
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:31,499
So with NYPD, how long
does it usually take

678
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,919
to get a blood comparison?

679
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,689
I'll put a rush on it. A couple of days?

680
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,089
- That's two days too long.
- Do you know where he is?

681
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,099
Well, we couldn't get a warrant

682
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,729
to track his cell phone, so
we followed him to the city,

683
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,730
but lost him at Grand Central.

684
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,774
We just don't have the manpower.

685
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:47,729
He's in the wind.

686
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,486
Oh, my God.

687
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,639
Go, go. Go, go, go. [SIGHS]

688
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,876
Oh.

689
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:07,119
Morris has found a bunker.

690
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,140
He'll need a nifty up
and down to save par.

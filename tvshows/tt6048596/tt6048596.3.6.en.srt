1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,985
And in your reading,
pay particular attention

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,071
to what Ernest Hemingway
and Langston Hughes

3
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:32,409
had to say about rising fascism
in 1937.

4
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,746
Any questions?

5
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,337
All right.

6
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:42,630
Hi, this is Leela.

7
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,342
I'm sorry I missed you.
Please leave a message.

8
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:48,470
Hey, it's me again.

9
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:52,475
Look, I really need to explain
everything that happened.

10
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:55,437
I know it's hard, but
can you call me back, please?

11
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,446
Please.

12
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,411
If he did it, I...

13
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:11,249
I need to know what he did.

14
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,461
Was it an accident?

15
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:21,052
There were seven blows to the
victim's chest, neck, and face.

16
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:27,560
But is it not possible
that it was someone else?

17
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:34,402
I can't make the pieces fit.

18
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:38,782
I've known
this man for 15 years.

19
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:43,705
Did you ever see him show
any violence or a temper?

20
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:45,457
Never.

21
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,251
- Not at all?
- No.

22
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,547
Did he ever tell you anything
that stood out from his past?

23
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:54,051
Some kind of traumatic
childhood experience,

24
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,054
or injury, or...
No.

25
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,973
I mean, he was beat up
pretty badly

26
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,559
by a friend of his
when he was little.

27
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,727
They worked that out.

28
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:04,815
He's got pictures of them
in his old stuff.

29
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:05,982
That could be helpful.

30
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,611
Maybe I could look at them
at some point.

31
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:09,987
Yeah.

32
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,449
- What about his parents?
- What kind of relationship...

33
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:15,453
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,292
Did he get along with them?

35
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,420
His mom passed
when he was young.

36
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:24,463
Ah.

37
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,803
His dad is totally absent,

38
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,724
which Jamie should be
angry about.

39
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,018
- Uh-huh.
- Jamie doesn't get angry.

40
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:39,399
He just blames himself.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,694
Even with us, he...

42
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,199
Two years ago,

43
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:48,451
we were having a hard time.

44
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:53,750
Jamie was depressed,
and I got frustrated, and...

45
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:58,589
I had an affair.

46
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:01,718
It was a stupid thing.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,596
But when I told Jamie
about it, he...

48
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:09,144
He just wanted
to know what he did.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,238
He was never angry.
Not once.

50
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:23,161
And he stayed by me.

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,125
It's 11:00.

52
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,961
You're supposed to be
at your desk at 9:00 a.m.

53
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,129
and stay there.

54
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,344
- Time to dig in.
- Harry, what the hell?

55
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,305
What the...? Jesus.

56
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,646
Look, I just wanna say,

57
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,817
I'm not happy about what I did,
but I had to.

58
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,820
How about I just do my work,
and you do yours?

59
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,072
- Come on, Ambrose.
- Try to see it from my side.

60
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:54,450
I had to follow protocol.

61
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,286
Without that,
everything falls apart.

62
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,876
I was protecting you.
Honestly.

63
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,169
I've been watching you on this,

64
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,213
and you're so deep
in the trees with Burns,

65
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,965
you haven't seen horizon
in days.

66
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,759
Someone had to pull you out.

67
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,417
What Kierkegaard
was defining was

68
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,588
the qualitative distinction
between God and man.

69
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,674
Man is so infinitely different
from God,

70
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:45,179
he can only communicate
with God indirectly.

71
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:49,350
What about the potential
to actually encounter God?

72
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:52,146
Not sure what you're getting at.

73
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:54,774
"When two people relate
to each other authentically

74
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,943
"and humanly,
God is the electricity

75
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,529
that surges between them."

76
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,657
Are you suggesting
we take a conversation

77
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:03,493
between two humans so seriously

78
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,705
that we challenge
the awesomeness of God?

79
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:11,252
No, but if the conversation
generates the God presence...

80
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,881
So you're positing
man creates God?

81
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,885
- Maybe.
- In a way, I guess.

82
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:20,514
So you "maybe" and "in a way"

83
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,478
are challenging the importance
of an all-powerful God?

84
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:27,857
I just thought...

85
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:30,610
Can God create a rock
he can't lift?

86
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,238
Yeah, Thomas Aquinas is not
on the syllabus for this class.

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,407
- Can you answer the question?
- Mr. Haas...

88
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,578
If you answer yes,
then there exists in the world

89
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:42,750
a rock that God can't lift,
ergo he's not all powerful.

90
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,378
Answer no, and he can't
create such a rock.

91
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,297
Again, not all powerful.

92
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:49,800
So the very idea
of an all-powerful God

93
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:53,513
is a human creation
and a flawed one at that.

94
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,101
All right.

95
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:01,023
Enough trick questions.
Let's return to Kierkegaard.

96
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,112
Wow, nice and neat.

97
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:09,575
Is you roommate pre-law anal
or pre-med anal?

98
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,119
Pre-med.

99
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:15,081
Listens to Nickelback
when he's feeling naughty.

100
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,459
Right again.

101
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:26,721
That's my mother.
She passed away when I was 12.

102
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,056
I'm sorry to hear that.

103
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:35,607
Did your dad pick up the slack
on the parenting front?

104
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:38,568
Um, yeah...

105
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,283
Not really.

106
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,370
Mine neither.

107
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:50,709
And my mom's still around
doing his dishes.

108
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:11,275
I keep thinking
about the wife too.

109
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:13,195
Leela.

110
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:16,032
Can you imagine waking up
after all those years,

111
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:18,952
realizing you have no idea
who your husband is?

112
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:24,459
How'd your painting go today?

113
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,754
- Nice redirect.
- Oh.

114
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,599
I have to stop thinking
about Jamie Burns.

116
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,357
Are you here?

117
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,492
Now I am.

118
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:12,935
I talked to my dad.

119
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:14,229
He and my stepmother are going

120
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,148
to the Amalfi Coast
for Thanksgiving.

121
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,651
Who goes to the Amalfi Coast
for Thanksgiving?

122
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,027
Exactly.

123
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,989
- Screw it.
- I'll stay here with you.

124
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,616
What?

125
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,118
- No, you should go home.
- Why?

126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,955
It's just a stupid ritual
driven by the cranberry lobby.

127
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,456
I'll hang here with you.

128
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,170
"Have you courage?

129
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,880
"Not courage before witnesses,

130
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,634
"but the courage
of hermits and eagles,

131
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,220
which no longer beheld,
even by God."

132
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:44,224
It's exactly what you were
saying in class that day

133
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,560
about man creating God.

134
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:49,522
But it goes further.
Keep going.

135
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,110
"Brave is he who knows fear
but conquers fear.

136
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,529
"He who sees the abyss,
but with pride.

137
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,741
"Who grasps the abyss
with the eagle's talons,

138
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,869
he has courage."

139
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:04,791
The courage of the ubermensch.

140
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,588
So you don't forget.

141
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,207
What do you want?

142
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:15,753
Oh.

143
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,715
I could ask you the same thing.

144
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:22,053
- Is that necessary?
- You're trespassing.

145
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,596
And you're stalking my wife

146
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:26,141
and fucking the detective
that's after me.

147
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,102
You wanna tell me
what that's about?

148
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,860
Are you scared of me?

149
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,071
Yes.

150
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,908
You think I might kill you?

151
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,119
How do you know
I haven't called the police?

152
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:43,204
Have you?

153
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:03,938
What the hell is all this?

154
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,066
You've been following me?

155
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:11,823
I wanted to see you.

156
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:13,283
Really see you.

157
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,957
I realize that wasn't
the right way, but...

158
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,585
But you couldn't help yourself.

159
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,756
No.

160
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:32,347
You've been painting me?

161
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,808
I have been trying.

162
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:39,565
Though with you,
it's difficult to know how.

163
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:42,694
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

164
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,909
I think it's because
you're not in control.

165
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,991
These photos are part
of your process?

166
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,659
Yeah.

167
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:39,556
May I?

168
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,953
How long have you
been seeing Harry?

169
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,127
Only a week or so.

170
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,841
And what does he tell you
about me?

171
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,261
He worries about you.

172
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:18,187
He worries about me?

173
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,106
About what I might do?

174
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,443
Both.

175
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,780
Are you gonna show him
these pictures?

176
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,744
- No.
- Why not?

177
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:35,667
Because this is
about you and me.

178
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,011
Will you take off your clothes?

179
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,398
May I come closer?

180
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,319
Why don't you try?

181
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,694
Look at me.

182
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:10,534
Right there.

183
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,174
You have to tell me
what happened.

184
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:29,390
Is this all
because of Nick, or...

185
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,809
No.

186
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:35,815
No, I've always felt this way.

187
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,735
Nick just gave me
the words for it.

188
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:40,112
Felt how?

189
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:44,534
Like we're all living
the wrong way.

190
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,164
Nobody seems to care.

191
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,503
And you felt that way
with me too?

192
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:56,924
I...

193
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:09,981
Did you kill that man
at the party in Brooklyn?

194
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:14,612
You gotta tell me,
whatever it is,

195
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,866
if we're gonna have a chance...

196
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,995
At anything.

197
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,334
Did you do it?

198
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,762
Lee, it was just a moment, okay?

199
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,599
I was so lost, and that guy...

200
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,643
- What?
- Did he provoke you?

201
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,564
No, he was helping me.

202
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:45,109
And then he turned on me.

203
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,612
What do you mean?

204
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:50,824
I was so helpless,
and then I couldn't control it.

205
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,494
It came over me.

206
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,538
What do you mean
you couldn't control it?

207
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,335
I need help.

208
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,008
I need you.

209
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,980
What?
Are you against me now?

210
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:18,483
No.

211
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,694
I don't know.
I don't know.

212
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,945
Lee.

213
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:25,408
- It's me, it's me.
- It's still me.

214
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,743
I know.

215
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:30,706
I have to go.
I...

216
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,627
- No, Lee.
- Please don't. No.

217
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:43,556
I don't know.

218
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:48,979
There's... nothing really
is jumping out.

219
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:54,485
Except maybe this.
He's with this kid, Charlie.

220
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:55,696
Oh.

221
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,532
Who apparently,
at some point, beat him up.

222
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,744
You think this is the thing?

223
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,871
The trauma that led
to all of this?

224
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,081
A lot of kids take a punch.

225
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,875
It doesn't necessarily
turn them into killers.

226
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,460
Boys, you mean.

227
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,051
It's just,
I can't figure it out.

228
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,511
First, he kills
his close friend,

229
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,887
and then a complete stranger,

230
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,808
and there's
no consistent trigger.

231
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,354
And he's gonna do it again.
I know it.

232
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:25,775
- What if it isn't one thing?
- One trauma?

233
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,360
What if it's just...

234
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,908
A life?
A million little things?

235
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:36,537
Little cuts, year after year.

236
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,665
Does that turn you
into a killer?

237
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,793
Sometimes a dam breaks.

238
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,134
I think he just wants
to be seen.

239
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,469
Why do you say that?

240
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,099
He...

241
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,937
I don't know.

242
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:59,358
Men want intimacy
just like anybody else.

243
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,944
They long for it.

244
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,155
But they're taught that
if they're vulnerable,

245
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:06,825
they're not men.

246
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:09,161
It's like there's this
cultural expectation

247
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:11,623
that's innately traumatizing.

248
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:17,422
Maybe.

249
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:19,465
I feel sorry for all of you.

250
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,637
Wounded little boys.

251
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,810
- All right, everyone.
- Let's settle down.

252
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:31,689
Ready to start.
Here you go.

253
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,360
Thanks.

254
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,029
Are you okay?

255
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,156
I just wanna get this over with.

256
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:41,243
- You're ready for this.
- Don't worry.

257
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,955
Mr. Burns.

258
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:48,460
Yeah?

259
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:49,879
What are you doing here?

260
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,922
I'm proctoring the A.P. exam
like I always do.

261
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:53,382
I sent you an email last night.

262
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,737
Tracy was gonna
take the lead on this.

263
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,012
I must have missed it.

264
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,514
I'm so sorry.

265
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,351
Please follow the directions
on page one of your packets.

266
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:05,772
You have exactly one hour
and 45 minutes starting now.

267
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:08,025
May I have a word
with you outside?

268
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,833
You need to go right now.
Tracy can finish up.

269
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,293
I'd rather stay.

270
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,897
I wanted someone else
proctoring this exam

271
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,838
and you were informed of that.

272
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:25,964
I...

273
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,633
There is nothing else I can do.

274
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:29,320
Give me one good reason why I
should listen to you right now.

275
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,145
Fine, you wanna turn this
into something ugly?

276
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,390
I can do that...
Mr. B?

277
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,600
It's Emma.

278
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:39,857
Guys, stand back.

279
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:41,734
Everybody, just give her
some room, okay?

280
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,653
Jesus.
Call the paramedics.

281
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,322
Okay, let's get her on her side.

282
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:46,490
Oh, my God.
What did she take?

283
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,075
Courtney, what did she take?

284
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,410
- Adderall.
- Like, a lot.

285
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:51,329
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay.

286
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,248
- Okay, hey, okay.
- God.

287
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,209
- You're okay.
- You're okay.

288
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,219
I'm not doing this.

289
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,346
You don't know what
you're gonna do yet.

290
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,307
That's the game.

291
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:10,519
Haven't, like, 17 people died
over the years?

292
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,632
That's because they didn't
know what they were doing.

293
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,864
There's rocks
everywhere down there.

294
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,326
Come on.

295
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,746
Jamie.
Come on.

296
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,419
Shit.

297
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,642
You see this notch here?

298
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,312
If you jump from right here,
you'll land in the deep water.

299
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,148
I don't want to do this.

300
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,484
Neither do I.

301
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:52,404
But if it's our fate,
we have to.

302
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,614
Oh, fuck.

303
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,619
- Pick a number.
- No.

304
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:00,205
Pick a number,
or I'll just jump now.

305
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,378
Four.

306
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:10,593
Color?

307
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,638
Green.

308
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,604
- This is our mutual fate.
- It's gonna read jump or stay.

309
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:20,814
You ready?

310
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:26,947
- God.
- Come on.

311
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:29,242
No.

312
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,702
- From the notch.
- Nick.

313
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:32,704
Nick!

314
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,592
Whoo!

315
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,385
Now you!

316
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:48,390
Come on.

317
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,435
Jamie!

318
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,983
I'm so sorry.

319
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:01,990
No, do not apologize.

320
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,784
This is my fault.

321
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,870
I...

322
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:08,081
I've been going
through some things,

323
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:11,126
and I haven't
been there for you.

324
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:13,337
Not the way I should.

325
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,383
We have to be...

326
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,802
We have to be there
for each other.

327
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:22,557
Because most people
don't understand.

328
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,570
But we have to keep going.
We do.

329
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:35,740
Even when it's hard.

330
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:38,118
What are you doing here?

331
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,704
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:42,332
I was just checking in on her
and making sure she was okay.

333
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:43,583
Please go.

334
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,127
Mom, he's only trying to help.

335
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:47,129
- It's all right.
- It's all right, I'll leave.

336
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,978
Eli told me about what happened.

337
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,106
That man who came by your place.

338
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:03,816
Oh, look. Uh...

339
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,696
That was just, he dropped by.
I wasn't expecting him.

340
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,408
- Eli said he was your friend?
- No, no.

341
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,454
He's just someone involved with
the case that I'm working on.

342
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,998
And you punched him?

343
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,335
I was trying
to get him to leave.

344
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:21,338
I...

345
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,591
I don't understand.
Was he threatening you two?

346
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:26,636
You want me to talk to Eli?

347
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,014
Did it scare him
to see me like that?

348
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,768
Dad, the problem isn't
that he was scared.

349
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,687
It's that he liked it.

350
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:36,982
And he's been acting out
what you did over and over.

351
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,196
- Why don't I talk to him?
- I'll clear it up.

352
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:44,492
- No...
- It'll be good for him and me.

353
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:47,036
I think it's better if
you don't see Eli for a while.

354
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:52,543
Mel, nothing like that
is ever gonna happen again.

355
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:54,670
It's what I want.

356
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:56,840
He's too impressionable
right now.

357
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:01,387
Okay.

358
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,475
But what does that mean
for Thanksgiving?

359
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:10,232
- We're...
- We're gonna spend it with mom.

360
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:16,823
Okay.

361
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,079
- You've reached Jamie Burns.
- Please leave a message.

362
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,641
Jamie, I'm sorry
about what happened

363
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,269
at the house the other night.

364
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:45,024
We need to talk.
Call me when you can.

365
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:56,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a little reminder.

366
00:25:56,872 --> 00:26:00,043
We have only one hour left
for the silent auction,

367
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,255
so make those bids.

368
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:06,343
And look for Mike Zukowski
to get in on the 50/50 raffle.

369
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:20,193
No, I actually am
looking for investors.

370
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:21,445
I have a lot of ideas

371
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:23,322
and I've been wanting
to grow the business,

372
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,533
so I'd definitely be interested.

373
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,243
Well, then we should
meet and discuss.

374
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,786
I really like what you're doing.

375
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:31,582
- Great, great.
- Let me get you my card.

376
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,587
- Hi.
- I'm Leela's husband, Jamie.

377
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,005
- Jamie.
- Hi.

378
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,426
- Peter, Sandy.
- Peter, hi.

379
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,053
- Sandy?
- Ah.

380
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:44,098
- Did you get a bid in?
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,683
We've got the lead bid
right now.

382
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:46,726
- Lead bid?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,979
All right.

384
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,731
- Are you kidding?
- That's crazy.

385
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:53,276
This basket is worth
three times that.

386
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,028
You know what?
I'll bid it up right now.

387
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,362
- Jamie, don't.
- What?

388
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,074
- I... sorry.
- It's for the kids, right?

389
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,911
- It was good to meet you.
- This is my information.

390
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,496
And I look forward
to meeting up.

391
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,707
- Likewise.
- Good luck.

392
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,768
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

393
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,209
- Yeah.
- Have a great night.

394
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,090
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to help out.

395
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,386
But I asked you not to come.

396
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:18,681
Lee, I didn't want you
to be alone.

397
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:23,229
People are staring.

398
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,066
Whatever, all right?

399
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,985
I don't care.
It's just small town gossip.

400
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,447
It's a town that I need
to buy my stuff.

401
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,990
- Okay, Lee.
- Okay.

402
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:33,241
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

403
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,494
Can you... can you please
just give it a break?

404
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:38,164
- Just please, please leave.
- What?

405
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:40,125
- Please.
- I'm not doing anything.

406
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,395
- Come on.
- Don't make this a scene.

407
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,772
- Don't.
- Don't fucking touch me, man.

408
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,673
- She wants you to go.
- I want you to fucking go!

409
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,217
All right?

410
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:53,975
Look, I...
I'm sorry...

411
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:56,145
- Don't.
- I just wanted to...

412
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,773
I don't want to cause
any trouble, I just...

413
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:00,316
I wanted to be here with you.

414
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,609
- Come on.
- Let's just go.

415
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:02,945
Walk with me right now.

416
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,571
What the fuck is
your problem, man?

417
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:06,157
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Easy now.

418
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,510
Easy now.
Let's calm down, all right?

419
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:08,994
Why don't you take a walk
with me, sir?

420
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,598
I was just trying
to talk to my wife, okay?

421
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,290
Let's just walk
towards the door, sir.

422
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,207
Nice and easy...
No, no.

423
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,394
I haven't done anything wrong.

424
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,128
Listen, I could take you
into the station

425
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,589
for disorderly conduct, or
you can come with me right now.

426
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:23,052
- Sir, let's walk.
- Lee.

427
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:24,680
- Sir.
- What?

428
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,018
- Walk.
- Come on, let's go.

429
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,066
This way.

430
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,530
It's okay.
Nobody cares.

431
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,157
Nice and easy.

432
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,272
All right, why don't you
just go home, all right?

433
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,965
- Go home?
- Go home?

434
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,218
Fuck you.
This is harassment.

435
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,513
Do you want me to arrest you?

436
00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:00,808
Go home.
Go.

437
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,842
Why?

438
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,539
Hey, frowny face.

439
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:56,418
You're fucking up my Norman
Rockwell Thanksgiving dinner.

440
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,255
Sorry.

441
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,053
So you chickened out.

442
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,972
You didn't jump.

443
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,808
Punishing yourself
isn't the answer.

444
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,394
Yeah.

445
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:14,148
I don't know.

446
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,567
What?

447
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,656
I've always been like this.

448
00:30:20,698 --> 00:30:25,079
Just like my dad.
I hate it.

449
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:30,418
Don't you get it?

450
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,546
You're supposed to be scared.

451
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:35,466
- You signed a contract.
- Contract?

452
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,887
When you were born,
you made a deal with fate.

453
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,472
We all did.

454
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:44,644
If you agree to keep living,
you have to accept the terms.

455
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:47,106
You aren't immune to anything,

456
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:49,817
you can die at any moment,

457
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:51,444
and anything you gain
in this life,

458
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,988
you'll eventually have to lose.

459
00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:57,953
- That's kind of depressing.
- It's the truth.

460
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:01,081
The crime is
pretending otherwise.

461
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,710
Expecting the world to be safe,

462
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:05,379
for things to always
stay the same.

463
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,758
That's not life.
It's delusion.

464
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,051
And that's why you jump.

465
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:14,723
You jump because
it's fucking terrifying.

466
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:17,268
You jump because you wanna live.

467
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:24,902
Come on.

468
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:29,324
Come on.
Let's go right now.

469
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,538
Here we go
round the prickly pear.

470
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:36,208
Prickly pear, prickly pear.

471
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,960
Here we go
round the prickly pear

472
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:40,713
at 5:00 in the morning.

473
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,596
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

474
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,265
Oh, no God here.

475
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,767
Put your faith in the notch.

476
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,103
Nick, I'm not doing this
in the dark.

477
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,898
We can't even see the bottom.

478
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:58,402
This is your moment.

479
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,946
This is where
you decide who you are.

480
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,533
Right here, right now.

481
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:05,077
Why do you need me to jump too?

482
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,664
Why... why can't you just
do all this on your own?

483
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:16,132
The only reason
I was able to jump

484
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:19,052
is because you were there
with me.

485
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,845
He would've ripped that
chair apart if he could.

486
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:57,558
He kept bashing it
over and over and screaming.

487
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,978
It reminded me of guys
I saw in Afghanistan.

488
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,730
The stress pushes them
to the edge,

489
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,567
and they start firing,
they don't care who they hit.

490
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,319
But, anyway...

491
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,407
I know lately
I haven't been much help,

492
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,743
but this guy's on the verge.

493
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:13,995
I have Pandolfi on him now,

494
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,414
but, I mean, we need something
to bring him in.

495
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:18,376
I don't have anything.

496
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:22,088
The most I can hope for
at this point is a confession.

497
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:28,597
You know what his problem is?
He's got no faith.

498
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:30,891
No higher power.

499
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:35,104
I'm telling you, I...
I've been to that edge.

500
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,649
After two tours of duty,
I was all fucked up.

501
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,945
And man, that is
not a place to be alone.

502
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:44,658
But when you're out there
staring at nothing,

503
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,995
faith is the only thing
that'll get you through.

504
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:50,290
It's Pandolfi.
Yeah?

505
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:54,045
Okay.

506
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,923
Okay.

507
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:01,470
Got it.

508
00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:02,741
Burns is waiting for you
at the school.

509
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:03,932
He wants to see you.

510
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:08,562
Good.

511
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,982
What are you gonna do?

512
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,276
I can't let him hurt
anybody else.

513
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,945
We gotta be on guard.

514
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,482
I mean, this guy
is capable of anything.

515
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:19,576
With the slightest problem,
you call me, okay?

516
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:21,411
I'll be tracking your phone.

517
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,085
If you don't hear from me
by the time you wake up,

518
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,462
come find me.

519
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:30,297
- Wait, not until then?
- Are you sure?

520
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:32,258
I'll be all right.

521
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:19,942
Glad you wanted to talk.

522
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:26,033
You've had a pretty rough
night, from what I've heard.

523
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,995
A bit.

524
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:32,708
But things are
becoming clearer now.

525
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:34,251
Well, you got my message.

526
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:39,549
I'm sorry about what happened
at my house the other night.

527
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:41,803
- You were scared.
- That's all.

528
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:44,013
We all are.

529
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:47,518
We never want to admit that,
though, do we?

530
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,898
- We'd rather be angry.
- Yeah, maybe.

531
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,530
What happened in there,

532
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,785
made me realize I've
been doing this all wrong.

533
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:06,458
I've been so scared
and trying to go backward.

534
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,502
That's why it's been so hard.

535
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:12,799
I've been trying to fight
what's happening to me.

536
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:16,303
But Nick said it all along,
you have to accept the fear.

537
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:19,474
Embrace it.

538
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,351
And that's when
something new opens up.

539
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:25,606
Oh, well, you can't keep
going on like this.

540
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:28,694
Neither can you.

541
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:31,196
It's strange, isn't it?

542
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,698
The one person I need to talk to

543
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:35,619
is the guy who's trying
to lock me up.

544
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,247
I'm just trying
to understand you.

545
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:42,169
No, you're trying to solve me.

546
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,217
I know that underneath
all the detective work,

547
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:49,469
the case, all of it,

548
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:52,056
you want the same thing I do.

549
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:55,643
- And what's that?
- To step into the abyss.

550
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,650
To find some kind of relief.

551
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,867
And that's what you did
with Nick.

552
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:13,124
I want to show you.

553
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:18,797
It won't be easy
for either of us.

554
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,134
But it's the only way
you can really understand.

555
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:30,979
Show me.

556
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,422
Here we go
round the prickly pear.

557
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:55,133
Prickly pear, prickly pear.

558
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,469
Here we go
round the prickly pear.

559
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,846
Prickly pear, prickly pear,

560
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:00,557
at 5:00 in the morning.

561
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,355
- What are you saying?
- What is that?

562
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:09,526
- It's T.S. Eliot.
- "The Hollow Men."

563
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:12,155
Nick would always say it.

564
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:14,657
It's about fear, I guess.

565
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,369
How we circle and circle
what we want,

566
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,455
but never reach for it.

567
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,072
This grave was supposed to be

568
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:34,640
like the one we dug
back at school.

569
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:37,019
It was never about killing.

570
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:42,192
This is for us.

571
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,653
You buried each other.

572
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,990
Once.

573
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:48,217
It didn't matter who went first.

574
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,285
We flipped a coin.

575
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:53,455
First, the boards go over you,
then the dirt.

576
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,809
The piping was
so you could breathe,

577
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,002
or you'd run out of air.

578
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,673
And after the necessary time,
we dug each other up.

579
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,342
The necessary time?

580
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,886
Four hours, eight hours, ten.

581
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,264
It's better not to know exactly.

582
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,183
And you did this, why?

583
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:12,938
So you could see
what it is to die?

584
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,149
To actually touch the void.

585
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:20,197
Smell it.

586
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:24,285
It's only then that we see
past our delusions.

587
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,705
We did that for each other.

588
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:31,711
And now I wanna do it with you.

589
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:35,257
Why?

590
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,928
Because I want you
to experience it.

591
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,266
The freedom you feel
when you move past fear.

592
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:46,228
- And you need that again now?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:50,442
Look, there's a more honest life

594
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:52,695
than the one we've been living.

595
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:56,450
And I know you've felt it too.

596
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:59,829
This is our chance to find it.

597
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,165
I know I would dig you up.

598
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,625
What guarantee would I have

599
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,045
that you would do
the same for me?

600
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,880
Harry.

601
00:40:07,923 --> 00:40:11,427
The whole point is
to witness each other,

602
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:13,554
to be there for each other.

603
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:16,475
Leaving you underground
defeats the purpose.

604
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:21,272
I can't do this alone.
I need you.

605
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:26,863
Here.

606
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:30,617
This is my confession.

607
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:33,370
To both of them.

608
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:37,584
Take it.
Go on.

609
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,752
If I leave you down there,

610
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:40,213
your colleagues
will find that on you.

611
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,757
There's no way
I won't go to jail.

612
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:46,344
But if I dig you up,
you burn it.

613
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,227
Is that what you need?

614
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:02,239
- Yeah.
- Then take it.

615
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:06,077
Why are you doing this?

616
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,039
I could refuse to burn it.

617
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,042
I'm willing to take that risk.

618
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,335
And after we do this,

619
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:16,382
you'll realize a confession
doesn't even matter.

620
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,723
You flip.

621
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:26,018
Heads, I go first.
Tails, you go first.

622
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:40,819
Keep the pipe near your face.

623
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,572
You'll run out of air
if you don't.

624
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:50,748
Oh, it's...

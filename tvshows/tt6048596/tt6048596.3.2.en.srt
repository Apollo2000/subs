1
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,043
- Amazon delivery.

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,545
- I told you not to come here.

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,281
- You don't get
to tell me when to go.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,383
- Passenger called it in.

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,218
He's at St. Amelia's right now
getting checked out.

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,219
- Okay.

7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,055
- Have you ever seen someone
die in front of you?

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,324
Everything looks different now.

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,227
- You're probably
in shock still.

10
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,763
- Do you have any idea
why those two

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,332
were heading to your house
in the middle of the night?

12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,635
- What are you implying?

13
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,637
- I need the recommendation
letter by next week.

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,106
- I was thinking
you should write it yourself.

15
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,374
Just don't tell anyone.

16
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,608
- Did Jamie ever tell you

17
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,544
about what we used
to do in school?

18
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,914
- You think maybe he was
in love with you?

19
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,916
- No, it was never like that.

20
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,851
- What's that?
- A knife wound.

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,554
That happened at least
three days ago, though.

22
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,289
- They dusted the phone
for fingerprints.

23
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,391
Didn't find any,
which is impossible...

24
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,460
- Unless someone
wiped the phone clean.

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,832
- Okay.

[Kevin Morby's
"Come To Me Now"]

28
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,244
- Is that okay?

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,581
- Yeah.

30
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,805
- You were
in the bath awhile.

31
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,507
- Yeah.

32
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,277
Actually, I don't think
I want any.

33
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,246
- You don't want coffee?

34
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,514
Who are you?

35
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,082
- Just...

36
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,117
trying to stay clear.

37
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,753
- Okay.

38
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,157
I'm gonna make the grocery run
after I close the store,

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,359
and you'll pick up the dogwood
tree at Arbor's today?

40
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes?

41
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,396
'Cause if we don't get this
little one's birth tree planted

42
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,698
before D-Day, it's bad luck.

43
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,566
- Arbor's. Dogwood. Yes.

44
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,469
- Then I was thinking
that we could do Thai tonight.

45
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,705
Maybe watch
that prison documentary.

46
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,875
- You don't have
to schedule me.

47
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,277
I'm doing okay.

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,411
- I'm not.

49
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,782
I'm just worried.

50
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,250
- I'm fine.

51
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,755
- Okay.

52
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,223
- All right.

53
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,991
- You do need to pick up
that tree today, though.

54
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,994
- Arbor's.
Dogwood.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,400
- Hey.
I was up all night.

56
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,235
- Kids?

57
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,304
- No, thinking...

58
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,573
why that guy would let
his friend die.

59
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,276
What's your best guess?
They were screwing?

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,078
- I don't know.

61
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,814
- So what's your play?

62
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,218
- I don't know.

63
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,121
Hey, look, you want to keep
your process to yourself.

64
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,455
I get it, okay?

65
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,823
I was just curious.

66
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,959
- No, look,
there's no play.

67
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,694
It's just--

68
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,830
I'd like to find out if Burns
had any contact with Nick Haas

69
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,800
on the days leading up
to the accident...

70
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,970
'cause this injury--

71
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,240
that happened some time
in there, and...

72
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,077
I'd like to know
what that context was.

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,413
- Can I help you with that?

74
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,386
Yeah.

75
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,955
- Detective,
a Sonya Barzel's up front,

76
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,424
asking for the detective
with a beard.

77
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,793
I figured that was you.

78
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,066
- He was back on my property.

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,403
Sorry.

80
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,973
Who was?

81
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:11,111
- The guy from the crash--
Jamie Burns.

82
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,313
Anyway, he-- he was alone
in his car.

83
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,950
He drove off as soon
as he saw me see him.

84
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,586
- Do you want
to come in and sit down?

85
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,454
- Eight minutes on my meter.

86
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,425
- Anyway, that's all I saw,
but I would like to find out

87
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,328
what you're gonna do
to stop him.

88
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,432
- Stop him
from doing what exactly?

89
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,169
- Do you know why he was on my
access road in the first place?

90
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,271
- Apparently they were lost.

91
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,107
- And you buy that?

92
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,976
- It was an accident.

93
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,713
There's no reason
to suspect anything else.

94
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,815
That's all I can say
at the moment.

95
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,750
- But then he came back.

96
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,321
- I'm sorry.

97
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,189
I can't be more helpful
right now.

98
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,859
I'm sorry about that,
but if you see anything else--

99
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,228
- Come find you so you can do
fuck-all about it.

100
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,747
- And then what happened?

101
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,687
Then they discharged me
and gave me these stitches.

102
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,390
The police...

103
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,626
Dealt with the car
and everything.

104
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,462
That's so intense.

105
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,298
And you?

106
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,166
How was your weekend?

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,002
Um...

108
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,737
my Dostoyevsky paper
was due today.

109
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,071
So...

110
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,641
And I did
a couple practice APs.

111
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,843
And I wrote that recommendation
letter, like, 20 times.

112
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,511
Did you get it?

113
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,613
- Shit.

114
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,582
God damn it.
Emma, I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,950
- It's okay, it's okay.

116
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,585
Um, I have a copy right here

117
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,453
you can just sign now
if you want.

118
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,656
- So sorry about that.
- It's okay.

119
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,296
W- what?

120
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,434
- I mean, do you really want
to send this?

121
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,339
This reads like it was written
by an algorithm.

122
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,541
- What do you mean?

123
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,877
- This could describe any high
achiever in the tristate area.

124
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,779
You aren't anywhere in here.

125
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,148
- But I mention volunteering at
the nursing home and swimming.

126
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,918
- Emma, come on.
That's résumé bullshit.

127
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,622
It's a version of yourself
that isn't even real.

128
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,557
Is that how you want
to enter the world?

129
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,462
- No.

130
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,899
- I'll do a pass--

131
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,001
- No, let me try again.
I'll do better, I promise.

132
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,737
And I need it by Tuesday 'cause
the deadline's next week.

133
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,542
- Strange, isn't it?

134
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,748
That some letter
should determine your fate?

135
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,421
- It's gonna get there
- between 3:00 and 8:00 p. m.,

136
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:12,392
but if you want to change that
you can go to www-dot--

137
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,029
- I can't read
my writing, sorry.

138
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,265
But, you can Google it.

139
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,467
So that's all for now.

140
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,636
Say hi to Eli...

141
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,972
Talk soon.

142
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,560
Those are too spindly.

143
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,364
Hey.

144
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,566
- You know, you really want
a compact potted plant,

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,770
because, it doesn't have
a lot of flowers on it,

146
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,238
but you wait, and it explodes.

147
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,839
Whereas these ones,
they look good now

148
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,810
but they're all root-bound.

149
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,246
- Actually, someone's
bringing out a tree for me--

150
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,480
a dogwood.

151
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,619
Going for a native flowering
or Kousa?

152
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,820
You really want the Kousa,

153
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,357
because it's immune
to anthracnose, and that's...

154
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,894
worst disease
for dogwoods, so...

155
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,729
- Kousa, okay.

156
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,863
Thanks.

157
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,804
Hey, I just wanted to--

158
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,539
I- I've been feeling terrible

159
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,808
about damaging
that artist woman's property,

160
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,843
and I-I drove over
to apologize

161
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,447
and saw your guys
doing a search or something.

162
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,582
- It's called a grid.

163
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,384
- Right.

164
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,386
Why a grid?

165
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,022
- It's regular protocol.

166
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,791
- All right.

167
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,427
Well, I just wanted
to offer, you know,

168
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,862
if I can be
of help with anything,

169
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,798
if there's something
you're looking for.

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,104
I appreciate that, but it's
pretty much all wrapped up.

171
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,444
How you doing?

172
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,279
You know...

173
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,081
with the loss of your friend?

174
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,118
- It's tough.

175
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,290
But he hadn't really been
in my life for a while, so...

176
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,360
- So he just came into town
for a visit?

177
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,729
- Partly, I guess.

178
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,032
- It wasn't planned, right?

179
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,202
- No.

180
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,604
I think I told you--

181
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,672
he just showed up
at my house out of the blue.

182
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,242
- Right.

183
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,177
Yeah.

184
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,349
Has anybody ever told you
about a post-hole digger

185
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,051
and how good they are
for planting a tree?

186
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,353
- No.

187
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,088
- Well, because
if you don't have one,

188
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,756
I could bring mine by.

189
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,925
- Um--
- No, I'm serious.

190
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,228
This is not--
it's not any trouble at all.

191
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,697
So how's the week look?

192
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,700
How about Sunday morning?

193
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,801
Right?

194
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,003
- Sure.
- All right.

195
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,304
- Thanks.

196
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,741
Come on, man.

197
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,510
We're not doing that.

198
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,320
- Kilwhinnie Glen on the rocks.

199
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,322
I remembered.

200
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,324
- Yeah, I don't drink anymore.

201
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,563
Doesn't mean you can't.

202
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,798
- Good.

203
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,305
So how you been?

204
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,709
- Good.

205
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,913
Amazing.

206
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,316
- All right, well,
what do you want me to say?

207
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,019
I didn't expect you
to come all this way.

208
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,022
I- I just wanted to talk.

209
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,560
- Phones, emails--
that's no way to communicate.

210
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,830
But when someone reaches out
after 18 years?

211
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,766
After totally cutting
you out...

212
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,568
you want to look them
in the eye

213
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,903
while they try
to explain themselves.

214
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,389
- Looks like
he drank a distillery.

215
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,257
- He made the last train
from Grand Central, 1:50 a. m.

216
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,128
Getting him in at 2:40
three days before the accident.

217
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,730
- It's not
his usual routine, but...

218
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,033
maybe it was a last hurrah

219
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,535
before the 3:00 a. m.
feedings start.

220
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,871
- Nah, I considered that.

221
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,106
But then I checked
Nick's credit card statement

222
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,641
like you wanted.

223
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,109
I couldn't place Jamie
with him locally,

224
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,911
but before he got
into town...

225
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,949
- Manhattan.

226
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,786
- This new bougie
hotel/restaurant, Sabbiato.

227
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,220
Wife and I were gonna go
for the weekend,

228
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,522
but we bought a car instead.

229
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,624
Check out his tab.

230
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,159
- Wow.
Let me guess--

231
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,328
this is the same day as he came
back on the train.

232
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,334
That means I have
to go into Manhattan.

233
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,340
Is there any chance
that you were working here

234
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,910
on the night of October 8th,
two Tuesdays ago?

235
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,512
- Yes, I was.

236
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,715
- Remember seeing
either of these men?

237
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,850
- Um, I should get my manager.

238
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,219
- So you--

239
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,787
you recognize them?

240
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,789
- Yes, but we have
a public relations person

241
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,291
who can help you
with anything that you like.

242
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,592
- The thing is,

243
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,628
seeing as you're
an eyewitness...

244
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,597
I just hate to bring you
all the way back up

245
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,966
to the precinct station.

246
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,302
- Well, what do you mean?
In Dorchester?

247
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,704
- It's about an hour
on Metro-North.

248
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,172
It's a little longer
on the local,

249
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,708
or you could just answer
a few questions.

250
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,643
- Honestly, all I know is

251
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,879
the shorter one
attacked another diner.

252
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,648
We had to call security.

253
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,584
- Who was the other diner?

254
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,552
- I didn't actually see it.

255
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,321
I- I don't think
they knew each other.

256
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,723
- Okay.
So that's all?

257
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,896
- After he left, I saw there
was blood all over the table.

258
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,969
- I think I'll need
to see the security footage.

259
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,910
- That raw wood?
That's-- that's beautiful.

260
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,678
- You see?
This is why I love you.

261
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,947
The client thought it didn't
look expensive enough.

262
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,349
I was like,
"Go back to Palm Beach."

263
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,318
- Brian, you got to go
in there.

264
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,720
Grace already built the base.

265
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,255
- Honey.
- It's perfect.

266
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,356
Exactly like
in the instructions.

267
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,891
- Mitch is a little obsessed.

268
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,826
He's been
on Grace and her Legos

269
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,461
like that's gonna help
get her into preschool.

270
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,097
- She's building
the Eiffel Tower.

271
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,931
- She's not building
the Eiffel Tower.

272
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,972
- Heard about the car accident
and your friend.

273
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,508
Glad you're okay, man.
- Thanks.

274
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,743
- How you doing
with it all?

275
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,747
- I'm doing okay,

276
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,782
you know, considering...

277
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,219
- I lost my brother last year.
Very sudden.

278
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,253
- That's right.
I remember.

279
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,622
- Word of advice--
you know, people will say

280
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,891
you should try talk therapy
or meditation--

281
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,259
- Mitch.
- No, let me say this.

282
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,996
The thing about grief is
it lives in your body.

283
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,965
You have to sweat it out.

284
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,733
Have you heard of the Peloton?

285
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,972
Every morning
from 6:00 to 7:30.

286
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,541
One day I'm biking through
Paris, then I'm on a beach.

287
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,443
And there's an instructor,
so you're never alone.

288
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,078
- There's one named Jade

289
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,013
that Mitch is having
an emotional affair with.

290
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,182
- She inspires me
to do my best.

291
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,283
Just like you, hon.

292
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,352
Seething with jealousy
over here.

293
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,222
No, but seriously.

294
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,825
She did help me move on
after Keith died.

295
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:33,960
She really did.

296
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,895
- Move on?

297
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,899
Why does everyone say that?

298
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,638
I'm sorry, it's just, um...

299
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,640
it's like
the only thing that matters

300
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,309
is getting over things
as fast as you can.

301
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,713
I mean, death isn't going away.

302
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,484
If anything,
it's getting closer.

303
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,855
And everyone I know
is terrified,

304
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,891
but no one wants
to talk about it.

305
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:09,595
We just hide it away
in hospitals and old-age homes.

306
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,564
I mean, we don't even
kill our own food.

307
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,833
We just get our--
our meat shrink-wrapped

308
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,101
into these patties.

309
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,306
It just feels like a lie.

310
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,482
I have to say,

311
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,151
I never thought I'd see you
eating in a place like this.

312
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,124
- Places like this help me...

313
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,663
Keep my head clear.

314
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,767
- Well, you've done well
for yourself, haven't you?

315
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,503
I mean, you'd be a star
at reunion,

316
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,739
not that you give a shit.

317
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,375
- It wasn't my plan
to make money,

318
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,345
but after you disappeared,
it was tough.

319
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,280
I started having doubts.

320
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,352
- Look, um...

321
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,588
- No, don't.

323
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,957
You helped me.

324
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,793
You helped me.

325
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,828
You know, we spend
our entire lives

326
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,365
wondering what's at the top
of the mountain.

327
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,635
We imagine
this beautiful view up there...

328
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,770
money, safety.

329
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,977
Some kind of answer.

330
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,412
And after what happened
with you...

331
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,948
I needed to know.

332
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,684
So I got to the top just
to see for myself.

333
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,689
- And?

334
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,928
- And there's nothing
to do up there but jump off.

335
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,401
Why did you call me?
Why now?

336
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,438
Your marriage?

337
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,607
- No, Leela's everything.

338
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,876
Her optimism, she--

339
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,412
It's a good life.
I've got no right to complain.

340
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,750
- Jamie, don't give me
your fucking gratitude list.

341
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,718
Be honest.

342
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,926
- I don't feel anything
anymore.

343
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,863
- Jamie.

344
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,435
Mitch asked a question.

345
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,405
- Do you listen to podcasts?

346
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,340
- Um, no.

347
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,409
- Because there's a lot
of amazing content out there.

348
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,046
I have this whole
brain-training series--

349
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,248
some are for the right brain,
some are for the left.

350
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,550
And it's apparently really...

351
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,519
Develop both sides
of the brain--

352
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,723
Exercises...
- Excuse me.

353
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,693
- Jamie.

354
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,097
What's going on?
- I don't-- I don't feel well.

355
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,665
Jamie?

356
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,067
- Let's sit you down,
get you some water.

357
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,568
Jesus! Jamie!

358
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,502
Brian!

359
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,011
- Anxiety?
He could barely breathe.

360
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:13,979
And I told all of you that he
was just in a major accident.

361
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,515
- His EKG checked out normal.

362
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,452
Anxiety can be
a powerful thing,

363
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,886
but there's nothing
physically wrong with him.

364
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,623
So any life changes?

365
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,726
Recent or imminent?

366
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,295
- Having a baby.
- Congratulations.

367
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,264
Never assume.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,167
- It's an emotional time
and I don't want to overstep,

369
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,236
but many people
find therapy useful,

370
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,804
if that's feasible.

371
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,840
- I'll meet you
out front, okay?

372
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,743
I need to use the bathroom.

373
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,062
Here you go.
Hey, I got it.

374
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,906
- But I said whiskey.

375
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,176
- Can you have that?

376
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,647
- Billy, it's about time.

377
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,349
- What?

378
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,552
- I-I'm ready to go.

379
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,922
- Go where?

380
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,459
Do I have to do everything?

381
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,330
- Okay.

382
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,467
We can go in a minute, okay?

383
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,543
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Harry.

384
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,511
- Yep.

385
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,043
- Hi.

386
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,679
- I just-- I've been meaning
to call you.

387
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,216
I wanted you to know that,

388
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,785
we're still following up
on that incident

389
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,988
that happened on your property.

390
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,322
- What'd you learn?

391
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,393
- Well, nothing
very definitive yet,

392
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,095
but we're gaining on it.

393
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,933
You know,
the other day at the station,

394
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,702
I had to minimize things,

395
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:27,773
but the truth is you have
every reason to be concerned,

396
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,409
and...

397
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,777
I get that.

398
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,948
- I realize I came on
full-throttle.

399
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,384
- No need to apologize.

400
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,452
- I'm not apologizing.

401
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,155
- Right.

402
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,257
- It's just...

403
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,059
Can you sit down?

404
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,394
- Yeah.

405
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,868
- I had a stalker-type

406
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,938
a- about a decade ago.

407
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,840
I was doing a residency
in Santa Fe,

408
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,310
and he was a model
for one of my pieces,

409
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,211
and he...

410
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,847
he just mistook our sessions
for something deeper,

411
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,083
got carried away.

412
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,352
It was handled,
and he went to jail.

413
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,222
He reached out to apologize...

414
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,857
but it left some scars,

415
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,826
and when I get scared,
I get angry.

416
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,162
So...

417
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,999
- I do have a direct line,
if you want it.

418
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,571
Sure, okay.

419
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,876
Is that your move--
to give people your number?

420
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,413
- No.

421
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,549
- I'm kidding.

422
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,219
I'm just gonna give you a tip.

423
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,322
Don't do it on the heels
of a stalker conversation.

424
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,831
- Hey.

425
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,469
Good night.

426
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,212
Thanks.

427
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,213
Looks good.

428
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,195
- Remember how out of it I was?

429
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:34,933
- Yeah, but this is
for anxiety, not depression.

430
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,870
Remember, he said it could
take the edge off.

431
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,938
I mean, at least
it's an option.

432
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,808
- Well, you know the main side
effect of those drugs, right?

433
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,314
This was
a one-time thing, okay?

434
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,350
Just...
- Hey.

435
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,152
- I just needed to get it
out of my system.

436
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,787
- But what triggered you?

437
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,992
I don't want that right now.

438
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,794
No?
- Ja-- no.

439
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,663
- I don't.
- Why not?

440
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,598
- Because it's manipulative.

441
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,633
- Yeah?

442
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,934
- I invented this move.

443
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,702
We're talking.

444
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,671
- There's nothing
to talk about.

445
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,640
- I know what you're trying
to do, and it's not gonna work.

446
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,777
- No, Ja--
- Okay.

447
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,925
- Why shouldn't
we try it again?

448
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,860
You want to wake yourself up.
You said so yourself.

449
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,161
- That stuff is crazy.

450
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,030
It's too intense.

451
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,198
- Then why the fuck
am I here?

452
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:43,235
You called me.
You knew what I'd say.

453
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,204
- Well, maybe I made a mistake.

454
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,074
- Fuck you.

455
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,776
- Nick.

456
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,679
- Want to go back to the
fucking dollhouse with them?

457
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,083
- Hey!
- What are you--

458
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,152
- What the hell are you doing?
- This is what you need to do.

459
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,353
Okay?
You got to cut the cord.

460
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,421
- Hey!
- Jump.

461
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,593
- Hello? Hello?

462
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,027
Is anyone gonna do something
about this?

463
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,529
He just fucking ruined
my phone!

464
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,730
- This is real.

465
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,633
Shit.
Where'd that come from?

466
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,440
- Jamie?

467
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,846
Hey.
Are you okay?

468
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,481
- Yeah, I'm fine.

469
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,267
- Hi, how you doing?

470
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,569
- Okay.

471
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,606
- As promised.

472
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,442
- Right.
Yeah, the tree.

473
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,678
- Probably need
to show you the technique

474
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,113
to get you started.

475
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,082
- What's this for?

476
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:41,186
- That's mulch to keep the
moisture around the roots.

477
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,422
- watch your hands.

478
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,190
- Sorry,
I didn't sleep well last night.

479
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,693
I'm a bit slow.

480
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,394
I cannot seem
to get my shit together.

481
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,335
- Sometimes those shocks
to the system can reverberate.

482
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,737
You might need
to take some time.

483
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,772
- I got a baby coming
in a week.

484
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,375
I don't have time.

485
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,843
- You two were probably
pretty close,

486
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,879
and it's hard
to lose a friend like that.

487
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,381
- Yeah.

488
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,717
But, you know,
most people don't get that.

489
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,252
I mean, Leela, too.

490
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,087
I can see her thinking,
"What's the big deal?

491
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,191
How close could you be if you
haven't seen him in years?"

492
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,193
I don't know.

493
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,896
- Was there a reason why
you two hadn't been in touch?

494
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,037
Sorry,
you don't have to explain.

495
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,772
- No, that's fine.

496
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,976
Have you ever had a person
in your life

497
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,446
who is totally exciting, but
you knew they were bad for you?

498
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,516
When you're around them,
you feel more yourself--

499
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,320
or the opposite of yourself.

500
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:52,224
I mean, Nick scared me.

501
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,961
It was a relief
to get away from him.

502
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,297
And without him,
things just feel...

503
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,634
I don't know how to explain it.

504
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,172
- Hollow.

505
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,981
My mother was bipolar.
It...

506
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,616
It's kind of like that.

507
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,037
- "Emma struggled
with depression

508
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,673
"and even had
to miss some school over it,

509
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,643
"but her recovery has given her
a deeper understanding

510
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,411
of big ideas."

511
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,879
This is how you get into Brown?

512
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,916
- James, can you explain
how this happened?

513
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,285
- Okay, I was encouraging Emma
to be more honest

514
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,253
so she'd stand out of the pack.

515
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,855
- Well, that's very virtuous
of you.

516
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,324
She's definitely standing out.
Well done.

517
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,026
- We will get you a new letter,
Mrs. Hughes.

518
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,261
It will say exactly
what you want it to say.

519
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,396
- I don't understand

520
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,231
why she's the one writing
her own recommendation letter.

521
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,666
- It was an exercise--

522
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,101
- And then you make her write
that she's depressed?

523
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,736
Emma's not depressed.

524
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,904
- Well, she was, Mark.

525
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,975
- I think Emma did
an amazing job.

526
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,778
That letter demonstrates
humility and maturity

527
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,481
and if some college admissions
officer is so small-minded--

528
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,416
- I don't really care what you
have to say, all right?

529
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,017
We didn't pony up
for private school

530
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,620
for some beat poet to tell
my daughter

531
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,189
to aim lower.

532
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,192
Do you know how much I spent
at your fucking auction?

533
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,861
I want a new letter now,

534
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,462
and I want it singing my
daughter's fucking praises

535
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,231
as the best goddamn student

536
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,967
you ever had the pleasure
of teaching.

537
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,138
Is that clear?

538
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,909
- James?

539
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,948
- Of course.

540
00:31:56,982 --> 00:32:01,553
- Okay, this is from
the security guy at Sabbiato's.

541
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,021
He found something.

542
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,463
They're still together.

543
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,468
11:00 p. m.

544
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,337
This was after the stabbing.

545
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,477
- What the hell?

546
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,115
I- is he coaxing him to jump?

547
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,387
- Hello?

548
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,059
- So this is all you saw?

549
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,096
- All I saw?
It's a grave.

550
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,766
- I just meant...

551
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,602
did you see anybody
around here?

552
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,339
- No, I went for a walk,
and I-- and I saw the jacket,

553
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,508
and I thought it was a person.

554
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,209
- You don't want
to touch that.

555
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,611
That's evidence.
- I touched it before.

556
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,246
- Well, don't touch it again.

557
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,090
And the pipe and the wood...

558
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,125
that come from your place?

559
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,627
- No.

560
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,732
- Yeah,
I- I need a forensics team

561
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,801
out at 20 Blue Point Road.

562
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,605
I- it's a different site.
I'll meet 'em at the residence.

563
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,282
- I don't want you to do that.
- Why not?

564
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,284
- 'Cause it's--
the principle of it's just--

565
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,622
You know what?
He's here, yeah.

566
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,557
Let me know what he says.

567
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,826
- Okay, bye.

568
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,031
Where were you?

569
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,099
- I'm sorry.
I left my phone here.

570
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,735
- Yeah, I know.
You left it in the bathroom.

571
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,273
I heard it
the 12th time I tried you.

572
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,909
- I-I guess I lost track
of time.

573
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,844
- What if I had gone into labor

574
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,681
and I couldn't get
a hold of you?

575
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,750
- You wouldn't have had
the baby in three hours.

576
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,052
Lee, come on.

577
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,187
All I did was
take a walk after work.

578
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,358
- That's not it.
You know that's not it.

579
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,797
We are entering a phase
that's going to be so intense,

580
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,232
and the only way that we are
gonna get through it

581
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,102
is as a team, and you're
completely checked out.

582
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,475
You're scaring me.

583
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,349
I know that you went
through something terrible--

584
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,585
- Yeah, but what?
Just snap out of it?

585
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,253
Fit back into my mold?

586
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,024
- Your mold?

587
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,507
- Hey, what--

588
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,977
this really isn't a good time.

589
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,278
- You want to tell me
why you dug a grave

590
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,914
on Sonya Barzel's
property?

591
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,552
Three by eight,
six feet deep.

592
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,590
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

593
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,991
- Don't bullshit me, all right?

594
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,194
I know that you met up
with Nick before the accident.

595
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,630
Dinner for two, Sabbiato's.

596
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,298
Are you gonna tell me
the whole story?

597
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,433
- You already know it.

598
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,667
- No, all's I got was,

599
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,336
"He's toxic.
He's a bad influence."

600
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,505
- I was trying to help him.

601
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,141
Nick--

602
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,343
he's unstable, all right?

603
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,211
He acts out.

604
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,981
And I lied because the whole
thing is embarrassing.

605
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,484
He keeps roping me into
these impossible situations.

606
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,986
- What did he want you to do?

607
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,054
- Well, I didn't dig a grave.

608
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,525
Maybe Nick dug it for me.
Maybe he wanted to kill me.

609
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,360
- And Nick wanted
to kill you because...?

610
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,030
- I don't know, okay?
He-- he is capable of anything.

611
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,134
- And you aren't?

612
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,908
- I'm a high-school teacher

613
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,977
living
in the goddamn suburbs...

614
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:35,480
about to have a baby.

615
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,782
I'm not driving around
in the middle of the night

616
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,452
digging graves
for painters I don't know.

617
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,222
What is it with you?

618
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,391
You keep showing up at my house
pretending we're friends.

619
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,226
Now-- now you're harassing me?

620
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,796
If you have evidence that
incriminates me, haul me in.

621
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,065
Otherwise I'm going back inside
to my wife.

622
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:10,682
- Here we go round
the prickly pear.

623
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,884
The prickly pear,

624
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,020
the prickly pear.

625
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,756
Here we go round
the prickly pear

626
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,292
at five o'clock in the morning.

627
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,869
You miss this.

628
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,537
Admit it.

629
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,644
You couldn't take it last time.

630
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,616
How do I know you won't bail
on me this time?

631
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,191
- Billy.

632
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,974
- Here you go.
Careful, careful.

633
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,047
Good.

634
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,885
You know...

635
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,388
I can see through the ceiling.

636
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,532
- What do you see up there?

637
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,606
- Barnhill,
get your feet off that.

638
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,008
- I'm sorry.

639
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,448
- You can go now.

640
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,616
- I thought I was here
till morning.

641
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,385
- I got this one.

642
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,154
- All right, cool.

643
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,256
Night.

644
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,225
- Yeah.
Good night.

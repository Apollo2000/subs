1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,090
You want to tell me why you dug a grave

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,678
on Sonya Barzel's property?

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,888
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,431
I know that you met up with Nick.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,349
Dinner for two, Sabbiato's.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,419
What the hell?

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,219
Is he coaxing him to jump?

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,398
Here we go round the prickly pear.

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,559
The prickly pear, the prickly pear.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,349
I think you let Nick die
because he had a hold on you.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,799
What would you do about
it if you were me?

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,992
I'd accept the help I'm offered.

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,639
I assume you're aware of your rights

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,229
- and that I can't hold you here.
- Hold me?

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,449
You mean involuntarily?

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,109
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,583
You trying to get me locked up?

18
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,160
Let's go someplace and talk.

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,829
Jamie!

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,339
Couldn't hold him.

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,649
He's out there. He's gonna do something.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,136
We have to find him.

23

24
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,899
Look, just say the word,

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,989
and I'll go back to my room right now.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,279
You can go home.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,160
Why are you pushing me on this?

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,830
Because you need it.

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,290
I'm not gonna let you ghost on me again.

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,379
Why do you even care
what I need at this point?

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,859
Because I believe in you.

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,879
I always have.

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,179
You feel the things other people miss.

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,889
And trust me...

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,770
there aren't many people
out there to believe in.

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,159
You can't just come into my life

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,399
and expect me to screw everything up.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,199
I have to think about Leela, too.

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,060
And your baby.

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,799
Were you ever gonna tell me about that?

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,779
Jamie...

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,759
you want to feel the truth
like we did in school.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,210
That's why you called me.

44
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,219
Nothing else matters.

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,724
Nothing else can matter
until you do that.

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,079
Can we get another one over here?

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,940
You got it.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,529
Here you go, gentlemen.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,569
Thank you.

50
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,200
You can leave the bottle.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,460
You get away with whatever
you want, don't you?

52
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,174
I got everything we need in the car.

53
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,385
Are you serious?

54
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,680
It's all right here.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
I really fucking hate you sometimes.

56
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,623
Pick a number.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,860
He's moving directly
south through Yonkers.

58
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,069
He's got to be on the train.

59
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,039
Okay. He's headed to the city.

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,664
Which means he's out
of our jurisdiction.

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm gonna call my contact at NYPD.

62
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,979
Give them the heads-up.

63
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,359
Stay on his coordinates.

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,589
We got to get that emergency
warrant to track his cell phone.

65
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,799
- On what basis?
- Exigent circumstances.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,499
Even with a warrant,
it'll be after the fact.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,699
Let's just make it happen.

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,659
I don't see how this situation falls

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,807
- under our responsibility.
- 'Cause it's on me.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,239
If he does something tonight,

71
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,728
it's all on me.

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,149
Damn it, Bridget,
we're late. I told you!

73
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,160
Hey, hey, hey, stop dragging your kid.

74
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,211
What the hell is wrong with you?

75
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,929
He just took a left down
21st Street, heading west.

76
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,819
Okay, that's just...

77
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,319
whoa, whoa!

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,019
Hey. Me?

79
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,269
- Ambrose.
- No, I'm here.

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,549
I'm gonna park this car.

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,219
It's a zoo here.

82
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,620
Mr. B?

83
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,319
Sophie Greenfield from Briarton.

84
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,619
Class of '14.

85
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,018
You don't remember me, do you?

86
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,589
You look exactly the same.

87
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,239
Oh, Sophie. Yeah, sorry.

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,020
My... your hair's different.

89
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,159
Yeah, just a bit.

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,739
This is so crazy! What
are you doing here?

91
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,572
Uh, you know... looking at art.

92
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,666
Just walked in.

93
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, yeah, you have good taste.

94
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,209
This is one of my favorites.

95
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,663
This is an outsider artist
based out of Savannah,

96
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,249
and he literally stares at the sun

97
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,459
and paints the retinal burns
he sees in his eyelids.

98
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,640
It's insane.

99
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,922
- So you... you work here?
- Yeah, I'm assisting.

100
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:06,739
I mean, I, like, have no desire
to work in the art world,

101
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,979
and the planet's basically ending,

102
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,139
so, like, you know, I'm
just figuring it out and...

103
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,307
enjoying the city.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,019
I'm sorry, I need a photo.

105
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,110
- Like, I have to.
- Oh, I...

106
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,959
Alexis... do you remember Alexis Porter?

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,940
She's gonna be so jealous
I ran into the Mr. B.

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,149
"The Mr. B"?

109
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,679
Yeah, come on.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,284
You know every girl at
Briarton had a crush on you.

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,036
What's your number?

112
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,570
Here, just send it to you.

113
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,819
So crazy.

114
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,877
It seems like you're doing well.

115
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,439
I mean...

116
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,297
Okay, I have to get back at it,

117
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,676
- but it's so cool seeing you, Mr. B.
- You too.

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,779
I had him in one location
for a little while,

119
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,809
but then he started heading north.

120
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,440
Looks like he's slowing down.

121
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,499
He's on the corner of 28th and Broadway,

122
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,609
and he's not moving.

123
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,279
I think I might have him. Stay with me.

124
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,289
- Welcome.
- Hi.

125
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,880
I don't see him.

126
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,008
Well, that's where he is.
He hasn't moved.

127
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,319
I know where he is.

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,448
Jamie.

129
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,699
You won't stop, will you?

130
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,165
I'm trying to keep you safe.

131
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,479
Did you track my phone?

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,419
Why don't you come down from there?

133
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,849
Isn't it strange how when we
stand at the edge like this,

134
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,659
we all feel like we might
lose control and jump?

135
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,259
That impulse to jump into the void,

136
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,060
to step in front of a car...

137
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,269
what's that about?

138
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,689
Those are just feelings.
They're not reality.

139
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,469
That's what Nick would always say.

140
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,154
But if feelings aren't
the truth, then what is?

141
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,339
Jamie... what are you doing?

142
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,579
Letting it decide for me.

143
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,689
And then what?

144
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,569
I go where it tells me.

145
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,552
Pick a color.

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm not gonna pick a color.

147
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,969
Red.

148
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,559
Jamie, you don't have to do this.

149
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,699
Just step back. Come on.

150
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,458
Jamie.

151
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,919
I can't do anything.

152
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,590
You don't have to.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,659
Let's head back to Dorchester.

154
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,959
Stop. Stop pretending you're on my side.

155
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,019
It's a fucking joke.

156
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,520
I'm not letting you wander
around this city all night.

157
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,779
As far as I'm concerned, I'm a free man.

158
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,030
You got nothing on me.

159
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,455
I'm sticking with you.

160
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,580
All night. I don't care.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,019
Good idea. Drink it off.

162
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,340
Get it out of your system, huh?

163
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,017
Don't you have anything better to do?

164
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:25,039
Yeah, my yard could use some weeding.

165
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,060
This is harassment.

166
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,749
I'm out of my jurisdiction.

167
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,689
Why don't you find a cop
and file a complaint?

168
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,569
_

169
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,519
Does your wife know
where you are tonight?

170
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,959
Hi. Can I get you guys anything?

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,992
Whiskey. Rye, whatever you got.

172
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,060
- He's not staying.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,019
So that paper thing...

174
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,129
some kind of game between you and Nick?

175
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,819
Were you playing that game the night

176
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,919
that you targeted Sonya Barzel?

177
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,383
I thought you were off duty.

178
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,039
Why her?

179
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,261
How's she connected?

180
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,609
You're such a detective.

181
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,473
Why does there always
have to be a connection?

182
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,419
You need an explanation for everything?

183
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,436
In my experience, there usually is.

184
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,339
This is random.

185
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,862
It's a game of chance.

186
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,240
That's why Nick liked it.

187
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,469
Everyone wants to believe

188
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,327
there's some kind of order to all this

189
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,869
or divine will.

190
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,119
This is God.

191
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,082
Chaos. Chance.

192
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,749
- And Sonya?
- Sonya means nothing.

193
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,639
Nick used this to lead us to her.

194
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,132
She's just the unlucky person
the arrows pointed to.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,299
Fate.

196
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,880
There's your connection, dear detective.

197
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,849
So it could have been anybody

198
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,267
that you were planning
to put in that grave?

199
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,940
I don't understand why
you listened to him.

200
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,529
Nick was the most honest
person I have ever known.

201
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,532
He was also a sociopath.

202
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,169
You sure about that?

203
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,359
Look around.

204
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,799
It's a world full of sociopaths.

205
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,665
Addicts hooked on booze or money

206
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,629
or cell phones, self-help, things.

207
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,709
Anything not to think about
what's really there,

208
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,591
which, let's face it, is death.

209
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,259
Let me tell you something.

210
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,011
You try to get honest
with anyone about that,

211
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,519
I mean, really honest,

212
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,139
and they'll turn on you.

213
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,934
They don't want to hear it.

214
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,688
So it's you against the world.

215
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,689
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

216
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,689
Proving it to you.

217
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,819
Hey, what's up, man? How you guys doing?

218
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,349
You having a good night?

219
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,453
Yeah, it's all right.

220
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,622
You guys look ready to launch.

221
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,625
We're just hanging out.

222
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,779
Yeah, yeah, I got to say,
it feels good to be out.

223
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,420
My wife and I just had
a baby one week ago.

224
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,939
- Congrats.
- Ah, shit is rough.

225
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:04,965
Seriously, I'm in town
just for the night,

226
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,119
and I'm feeling this itch,

227
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,389
like I got to blow off some steam,

228
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,819
like I want to fucking regret
this night in the morning,

229
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,200
- you know what I mean?
- Cheers.

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,059
Looks like you're getting
some traction over there.

231
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,941
- Mm.
- You gonna make a move?

232
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,526
- Getting there.
- Yeah?

233
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,219
Okay.

234
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,119
Yeah, I have him.

235
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,915
- How is he?
- He's on a bender.

236
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,794
Just gonna stick with him.
Maybe I'll wear him down.

237
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,212
- What does that entail?
- A long night probably.

238
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,599
He's kind of loose... maybe
he'll slip up and confess.

239
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,051
He's halfway there already.

240
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,929
- Keep me in the loop.
- Yeah.

241
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,089
Third trimester.

242
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,779
- Yeah.
- Hey.

243
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,799
There he is!

244
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,153
Harry. Hey, hey, hey.

245
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,819
These are my buddies, Rahm and Eyan,

246
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,209
and our new friends, Deanna...

247
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,535
shit, shi... Deanna and Kelsey.

248
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,959
These lovely ladies are just
visiting from the Outback.

249
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,339
Well, I've got my work visa.
She's the world traveler.

250
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,120
And this is my Uncle Harry.

251
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,219
- Your uncle?
- That's so cute!

252
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,939
Oh, my God, it's true.
You guys look alike.

253
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,659
- You think?
- Let's go.

254
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,299
Oh, no. He's gonna try to pull me away.

255
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,489
- No.
- He's a bit of a by-the-book type, okay?

256
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,919
He's not used to taking chances.

257
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,180
But I don't know... maybe tonight
could be different, huh?

258
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,529
- Come on, Harry.
- Have a drink with us, Uncle Harry.

259
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,639
- One drink, come on.
- Come on, Harry.

260
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,299
- Come on, man, come on.
- Come on.

261
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,059
You look sharp, man.
Where'd you get that suit?

262
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,269
Come on, man, it's bespoke.

263
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,319
I keep trying to get Uncle
Harry here to up his game.

264
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,988
Oh, come on. He looks nice.

265
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,909
This guy, this guy's got great taste.

266
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,239
Yeah, he looks like a baller.

267
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,669
She's a few ahead of us.

268
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,299
Shut up!

269
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,669
- What do you do?
- Currency trading.

270
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,459
Oh, wow, yeah. So he is a baller.

271
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,999
Now he's gonna buy everyone here
a round of drinks just to show us

272
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,199
- you can do it, aren't you, Rahm?
- Hey.

273
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,948
- Can you believe this guy?
- If you keep buying,

274
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,006
we'll keep drinking.

275
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,159
What are you trying to prove?

276
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,159
- The service here sucks, man.
- Jamie, hey.

277
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,339
Yeah, let's take this
party somewhere else.

278
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,929
- Hey, you know what? I know a place.
- Yeah?

279
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,619
- Let's go.
- Hell, yes, hell, yes!

280
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,659
- Yes.
- Hey.

281
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,749
Uncle Harry for the blowout!

282
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,099
Aw, come on, Uncle Harry, come on.

283
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,789
Need a break?

284
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,269
- I think we're good now.
- Yeah, we are.

285
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,339
Nice job.

286
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,630
Your hand...

287
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,680
I think I need a minute before we start.

288
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,357
We're gonna do things
differently this time.

289
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,799
- What do you mean?
- I checked on my phone.

290
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,439
There's a house at the end of this road.

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,114
We need to stop there first.

292
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,910
- Why?
- Get in the car.

293
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,122
Nick, what's going on?

294
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,298
The house belongs to a woman.

295
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,801
We're gonna bring her down here...

296
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,929
for good.

297
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,709
- No way.
- This is the next step.

298
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,719
You and me, this is
how we break through.

299
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,659
No, this is crazy, Nick.

300
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,319
- No.
- The resistance you have right now,

301
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,159
the feeling that it's wrong, it's...

302
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,860
it's a learned response. It's not real.

303
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,959
I'm not about to kill some random woman.

304
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,699
You're talking about someone's life.

305
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,070
Jamie, you know this already.
Morality is an invention.

306
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,189
You learn it. It has
no basis in anything.

307
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,913
Animals kill every day.
God doesn't strike them down.

308
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,359
That's a line in Nietzsche.

309
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,500
That's not exactly our reality here.

310
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,499
You have no idea what
kind of freedom there is

311
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,420
on the other side.

312
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,590
You've done this before?

313
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,059
How many times have
you done this before?

314
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,619
You have to look it square in the face.

315
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,639
Oh.

316
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
- Oh, my God.
- Every aspect of your nature.

317
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,150
- Oh, my God, this is fucking crazy.
- Jamie, you are smarter than this.

318
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,699
- No, you're taking me home right now.
- Just stop for a sec.

319
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,340
- Just listen to me.
- I'm not doing this.

320
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,540
Have I ever lied to you?

321
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,209
Answer the question.

322
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,879
Have I ever lied to you?

323
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,219
I was there when you were at the edge.

324
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,620
I was there with you, and I
didn't let you down, remember?

325
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
- Yeah.
- It's you and me.

326
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,399
You and me.

327
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,509
So forget everything else and
have the fucking courage

328
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,273
to step out of the box you've
been living in and wake up.

329
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,259
Life eats life.

330
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,199
You've been eating life since
the day you were born,

331
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,019
so don't fucking lie,
don't pretend you haven't,

332
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,200
b-because that's what we are.

333
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,089
You have to look death in the face,

334
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,929
and once you do, once
you pass through this,

335
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,869
trust me, Jamie...

336
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,289
you'll be free.

337
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,802
And I'll be right there with you.

338
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,919
This is the way out.

339
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,869
There she goes.

340
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,430
When in Rome.

341
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,549
Hey, let's get some of
that for Uncle Harry.

342
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,802
Uncle Harry.

343
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:31,639
I'm a designated driver.
No, thank you very much.

344
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,599
Driver? It's New York, who's driving?

345
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,329
Come on, Harry. Loosen up.

346
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,483
This is your one life.

347
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,979
- I know what this is.
- Has anyone ever told you

348
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,199
you hold your tension in your back?

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,359
What?

350
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,499
I can see these things.
I do craniosacral work.

351
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,819
You have back pain, don't you?

352
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,997
- Don't want this.
- Cervical or lumbar?

353
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,832
Just relax a sec, relax.

354
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,835
- Breathe.
- And this one over here,

355
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,119
- this one's a triquetra.
- Ah.

356
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,439
Which is the symbol for unity,

357
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,758
'cause, like, we're all one.

358
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,669
And then over here,

359
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,929
- that one's a bear.
- Yeah.

360
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,679
I love bears.

361
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,809
- How you guy's feeling?
- Yeah, good, real good.

362
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,119
I like this view...
just the two of you...

363
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,148
Making a connection.

364
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,651
You're so funny.

365
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,449
Well, it's crazy, isn't it?

366
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,780
All of us here in this hotel room,

367
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,509
everyone trying so hard.

368
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,799
Wait, what?

369
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,319
I mean, there's this
effort, isn't there?

370
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,909
Underneath it all? It's a bit desperate.

371
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,624
Like we're all trying
to escape something.

372
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,629
What is that?

373
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,669
- I just like the champers.
- Uh-huh.

374
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,296
I think it's fear. We're scared.

375
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,619
There's this big yawning void
we're stuck in the middle of,

376
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,803
and we're all just grabbing
on to anything we can, right?

377
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,259
- Don't look down.
- Oh, you know,

378
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,182
why don't you do a line
and give it a rest, huh?

379
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,479
I don't want to do a line.

380
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,852
I want to be right here with you.

381
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,319
What's wrong?

382
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,020
Talk me down off the ledge, man.

383
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,389
Come on, help me out. I'm scared.

384
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,441
You're scared, too, right?

385
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,314
- Dude, that's enough.
- You want to do well,

386
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,389
you want to make money,

387
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,404
you want to screw somebody,

388
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,599
buy stuff, be someone, for what?

389
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,449
Because it makes you feel safe.

390
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,035
But deep down, you're in freefall.

391
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,039
All of us are.

392
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,162
What the hell is wrong with you?

393
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,124
Look at me. We're the same, aren't we?

394
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,149
Aren't we?

395
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,869
Dude, get off! What the fuck?

396
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,279
All right, Jamie.

397
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,519
All right, I think it's time for you

398
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,839
and your faggot friend to leave.

399
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,759
Oh, is that what this is now?

400
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,803
This feels too gay for you?

401
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,849
Huh?

402
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,079
You need to swing your dick around,

403
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,759
pretend you're not about to die?

404
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,679
- What?
- Okay, come on.

405
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,260
I think it's time to go.

406
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,359
We can go.

407
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,279
Stop!

408
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,785
Jamie!

409
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,579
Jamie! Hey!

410
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,959
Dude...

411
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,579
would you get out?

412
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,019
You hear me?

413
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,469
Come on.

414
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,799
Yeah, come on.

415
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,139
Seriously.

416
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,651
That's quite a limp
you got, Uncle Harry.

417
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,919
Not a good look for a cop.

418
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,299
You should get something for that.

419
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,899
I don't take pills.

420
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,279
Oh.

421
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,869
You prefer the pain.

422
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,559
I knew there was something about you.

423
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,769
Oh, come on.

424
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,529
I'm stronger than you.

425
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,501
I can take you down anytime I want.

426
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,539
What's with you anyway?

427
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,719
You think you're the only person

428
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,879
who's angry at the world?

429
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,159
No.

430
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,504
That's the problem. I'm not.

431
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,176
Well, then stop indulging yourself.

432
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,919
Oh, fuck you.

433
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,428
Look, we all have dark thoughts.

434
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,189
We learn how to live
with them, all right?

435
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,220
We contain them.

436
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,977
And how's that working out for you?

437
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,449
This isn't about me.

438
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,439
No, 'cause you seem so fulfilled.

439
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,789
How are things going?

440
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,900
You happily divorced?

441
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,695
Yeah. Yeah, I found out about you.

442
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,999
How are things going in
your sunset bachelor days?

443
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,969
You feeling filled with
purpose and meaning?

444
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,079
The car's over here.

445
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,049
Lonely detective goes out of his way

446
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,549
to counsel disturbed citizens
on essential life skills.

447
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,959
All right, just do something!

448
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,959
You're gonna act out,
you're not gonna act out.

449
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,689
Quit talking.

450
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,749
Do it.

451
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,639
Fine.

452
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,641
Let's go.

453
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,393
Taxi!

454
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,789
You and me.

455
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,659
Drive.

456
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,449
Jamie!

457
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,479
I'm here. 234 Morgan.

458
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,039
I hear music.

459
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,719
I'm going in.

460
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,399
You guys have done a great job with it.

461
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,579
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

462
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,359
- Yeah, I...
- Excuse me for a second.

463
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,729
You made it.

464
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,459
- Left this on for you.
- Okay, let's go home.

465
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,689
Is that legal?

466
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,469
Tracking my phone?

467
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,488
You want me to call your wife?

468
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,249
Hey, Sophie.

469
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,969
This is my friend Harry.

470
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,959
Hi. Nice to meet you.

471
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,879
Sophie's a former student of mine,

472
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,979
and, uh, Harry here, he's a detective.

473
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,839
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

474
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,670
He's kind of obsessed with me.

475
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:31,509
He's concerned about my
safety, or so he says.

476
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,809
- Okay.
- He thinks I'm dangerous.

477
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,635
What makes you dangerous?

478
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,512
Well, let's be honest.

479
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,722
Everyone's dangerous, aren't they?

480
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,143
We're all mingling, we're all behaving,

481
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,719
but really, stability
makes us resentful.

482
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,560
The animal inside is caged up

483
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,567
and just gets angrier and angrier.

484
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,859
Because you're hurt.

485
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,739
And people who are hurt, they get angry.

486
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,159
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

487
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,779
Wasn't there something
you wanted to show me?

488
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,179
Oh, yeah. Yeah, upstairs.

489
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,719
Upstairs? Okay.

490
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,789
Somewhere bright.

491
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,045
An island maybe.

492
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,040
And the heat. Yeah, I feel heat.

493
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,599
- She was from Barbados.
- Right.

494
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,960
And there's guilt, a lot of guilt.

495
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,438
Like they never wanted to leave.

496
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
Your grandfather never stopped
feeling guilty about leaving.

497
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,860
You feel guilty, too.

498
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,615
You left home?

499
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,989
Last year.

500
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,203
That was the right thing.

501
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,019
The guilt you feel... that's not yours.

502
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,660
They don't want you to carry that.

503
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,461
Dan, can you get me some water?

504
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,160
How did you do that?

505
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,766
- What's your name?
- Jamie.

506
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,339
It's my guidance.

507
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,770
It's like a voice I hear.

508
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,569
Everyone is part of the same field,

509
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,999
alive or dead.

510
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,817
I just listen.

511
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,070
Can I ask a question?
It's a-about a career thing.

512
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,729
Yeah.

513
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,825
Um, I quit my job two
months ago, and I...

514
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,540
Wait, hold on a second.

515
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,829
There's someone near you.

516
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,170
A-a friend, an old friend.

517
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,385
He's trying to reach you.

518
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,439
What do you mean?

519
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,359
Yeah, he's...

520
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,069
he's so close to you, it's
like he's attached to you.

521
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,599
He's a...

522
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,679
pear.

523
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:57,277
Prickly pear, prickly pear...

524
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,890
No, not now.

525
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,559
Are you sure you don't mind?

526
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,729
The party dies when
you run out of booze.

527
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,259
- We can't let that happen.
- Yeah.

528
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,499
Yeah, admit it, though,

529
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,539
you want to just ditch your friend

530
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,739
and hang out with me, right?

531
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,819
Guilty as charged.

532
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,499
- How about I drive?
- Oh, no, I'm not drunk.

533
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,849
I've had, like 1 1/2 drinks. I'm fine.

534
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,540
You could use a break. I'll take over.

535
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,980
- It's a beater. Be careful.
- Okay.

536
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,239
And so now, after all of that,

537
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,506
J.J.'s gonna move in with
Kyle on the top floor.

538
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,279
It's like, I don't know.

539
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,879
The communal-living thing is fine,

540
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,340
but sometimes it drives me crazy.

541
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,970
Is something wrong?

542
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,709
No. No, why?

543
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,689
I don't know, you just seem
quiet all of a sudden.

544
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,349
Sorry.

545
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,982
I was thinking about a
friend who died recently.

546
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:03,299
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's been weird.

547
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,560
I miss him.

548
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,741
How did he die?

549
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,160
We don't really know each
other that well, do we?

550
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,949
No, I guess not.

551
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,119
I mean, I was a teacher,
always in a position of power...

552
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,789
not exactly an even playing field.

553
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,619
Oh, you just passed the bodega.

554
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,499
I want to play a game with you first.

555
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,470
It's kind of a bonding thing.

556
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,499
Okay.

557
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,309
What is it?

558
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,479
He's headed up Finley Avenue.

559
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,059
Yeah, I see him. He's going west.

560
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,729
Damn, he's going fast.

561
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,160
Whoa, whoa.

562
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,649
You need to slow down.

563
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,679
So this friend and I...

564
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,099
we used to play this
game back in college

565
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,240
called Taconic Roulette.

566
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,359
We'd get on a road crossing the highway

567
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,509
and drive as fast as
we could and not stop

568
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,671
just to see if we were
lucky enough to make it.

569
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,979
Are you serious? That's insane.

570
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,719
The point is you can't stop.

571
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,319
People always stop themselves

572
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,676
right when they're on the precipice.

573
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,669
Yeah, because who wants to die?

574
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,119
I don't want to die.

575
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,058
That's not what this is about at all.

576
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,009
What is it about?

577
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,849
Facing death.

578
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,106
There's a difference.

579
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,039
Uh, is that cop car following us?

580
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,620
Uh, he just took a right on Stillwater.

581
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,119
I just made a right turn.
I'm one block behind him.

582
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,124
I'm driving up Kenmore. Still got him?

583
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,749
I got him. He's heading towards Monitor.

584
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,629
Um, Mr. B, can you stop the car?

585
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,878
Can't. That's the game.

586
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,087
Mr. B, please don't...

587
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,089
no, Mr. B, please! No... oh, my God!

588
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,306
Oh, my God!

589
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,558
Okay, he's going east now.

590
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,559
He's heading straight at you.
You can head him off.

591
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,019
Jamie, stop the car!
Stop the car, Jamie!

592
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,689
Do you hear me? Stop the car!

593
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,279
Stop the car!

594
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh, my Go...

595
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,756
What the fuck is wrong with you?

596
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,719
? Come to me now ?

597
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,280
? Like you did then ?

598
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,059
? Pretty and slow ?

599
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,039
? Pretty and thin ?

600
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,659
Those trees.

601
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,759
They're so beautiful.

602
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,679
? In a world so big ?

603
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,092
Hear the crickets.

604
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:14,369
I can't.

605
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,809
I can't do this.

606
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,680
No, it's good.

607
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,100
It's good.

608
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,299
Okay. Ah, I'm calling 9-1-1.

609
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,539
No. Don't.

610
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,359
Jamie, don't.

611
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,406
? And she loves me, too ?

612
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,949
Don't.

613
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,000
You're almost there.

614
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,663
Just wait.

615
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,329
This is crazy.

616
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,119
No. It's okay.

617
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,579
You're gonna be okay.

618
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,359
You're gonna be okay.

619
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,139
I can't... I don't want you to die.

620
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,259
I don't want you to die.

621
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:07,480
I shouldn't have pushed you so hard.

622
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,700
But you're good.

623
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,649
So good.

624
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,409
Promise me...

625
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,899
you're gonna keep going.

626
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,040
Yeah?

627
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,310
Yeah.

628
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,959
Yeah.

629
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,969
I'm so sorry.

630
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,859
Shh.

631
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,103
It's in my back pocket.

632
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,479
It's in my pocket.

633
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,009
What?

634
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,191
What, Nick? What'd you say?

635
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,039
It's in my pocket.

636
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,279
Just come out back.

637
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,619
Nick.

638
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,509
It's in my pocket.

639
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,999
This has got to stop.

640
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,819
You have to tell your wife...

641
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,792
what is happening to you.

642
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,870
I'm gonna wait out here till you do.

643
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,210
Will you be honest with me for a second?

644
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,129
Just tell me the truth.

645
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,770
Do you ever feel lonely?

646
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,099
Yeah, I do sometimes.

647
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,449
I mean really lonely?

648
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,609
No matter what you do or
who you're with, you...

649
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,906
you still feel it.

650
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,919
Like you're walking around,

651
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,879
and you can feel the whole
universe out there,

652
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,219
this huge thing just...

653
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,139
going and going and going,

654
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,060
and everyone around you is just...

655
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,769
knocking into everything

656
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,679
and bruising everyone and themselves.

657
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,459
And you just feel so
lonely, you could scream.

658
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,030
Tell me I'm not crazy.

659
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,019
Tell me you know what I mean.

660
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,279
I do.

661
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,579
Hey, Harry, it's Devan from the NYPD.

662
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,839
So I kept an eye out

663
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,729
for any homicides in the Brooklyn area.

664
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,299
It's probably nothing
to do with your suspect,

665
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,139
but I thought I'd let you know
we had one early this morning

666
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,619
on Morgan Avenue in Greenpoint.

667
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,090

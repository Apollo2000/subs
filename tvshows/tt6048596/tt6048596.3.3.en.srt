2
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:53,960
Hey.

3
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,502
Hi.

4
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,581
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:02,105
I know I'm not easy
to be with right now.

6
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm just

7
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:06,630
trying to figure things out.

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,410
Figure what out?

9
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,330
Everything, I guess.

10
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:18,488
You think maybe

11
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:20,133
what you're going through

12
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,813
is about the baby,

13
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,493
becoming a father?

14
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:25,315
You know, all that shit
with your dad,

15
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,217
and then your mum passing,

16
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,610
it's all got to be coming up.

17
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,893
I think you should
talk to somebody.

18
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:33,191
Do you believe in God?

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,026
Do you really believe
in some higher power

20
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:41,270
who has some grand design?

21
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,991
I want to, but...

22
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,871
Do you feel like you know
why we're here

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,560
or what happens
when we die? We don't.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,697
It's all a total mystery.
We don't know anything.

25
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:56,160
But in spite of that,
we're going to have a child?

26
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:59,360
We're going to bring a baby
into this fucked-up existence

27
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,351
that we don't even understand?

28
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,217
And then at some point,
break it to them

29
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:04,595
that they're going to die;

30
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,580
that they have no choice.

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,720
Why would we do that
to our child?

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,590
Jamie, we are having a baby

33
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,900
to have more love in our lives.

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,733
Or are we doing it
because we're scared of dying,

35
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,173
and we feel like
this will make our lives

36
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,155
have some kind of meaning,

37
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,751
like a spiritual Band-Aid?

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,235
We feel better, but the child
still has to face death alone.

39
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,191
We just kick the can
down the road.

40
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,622
So, what are you
trying to say?

41
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,604
You don't want to have our baby?

42
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,475
I am giving birth

43
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,502
in days.

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,480
Jesus Christ,
you don't get to do this.

45
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,466
Not now.

46
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,493
It's not like
I'm choosing to do this.

47
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,586
You are choosing.

48
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,022
You know who did not
have a choice?

49
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,408
My dad.

50
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:53,902
My dad, who hauled cement
60 hours a week

51
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:55,928
in Jamaica for shit!

52
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:57,751
He didn't even
have time to think.

53
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:01,351
You, this,

54
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,791
this is privilege.

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,755
Don't.
Don't put that on me right now.

56
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,355
That's not fair.
- Life's not fair.

57
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,760
You still got to pull
it together and deal.

58
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:12,510
What? So I don't get to have
a moment because I'm white?

59
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,510
You're walking away?
We're talking.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,182
No.

61
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,170
We're not talking.

62
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,604
We will talk
when you get some help.

63
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,915
- Oh, hey.
- Oh...

64
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:39,902
It's you.

65
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,000
I thought you were
that policewoman.

66
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,275
You spent the night?

67
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,231
Most of it, I guess.

68
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,551
- Oh, that's kind of you.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,391
I at least slept a few hours

70
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,320
knowing that someone
was out here.

71
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,866
I brought this for whoever.

72
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,528
I was a photographer at first,

73
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,644
so I like to shoot
a lot of reference.

74
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,480
Some models even sit for me,
which is nice.

75
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:06,250
Always men?

76
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,866
Mostly.

77
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,990
For some reason,
I see them more clearly.

78
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,690
He looks familiar.

79
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,013
That's Tom
from the Gulf station.

80
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,262
Ooh and

81
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,084
Nick Haas and Jamie Burns,

82
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,570
they never modelled for you?

83
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,955
I wouldn't forget that, no.

84
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,755
And you never met them
outside of work?

85
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,050
I keep asking myself that.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,230
That's what's been
keeping me up at night.

87
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,106
- No.
- It's just hard to believe

88
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:39,146
that they'd dig a grave
on your property for no reason.

89
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,057
Well, what did
Jamie Burns say?

90
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,271
He says he doesn't know
anything about it.

91
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,862
He was in the car.

92
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:46,373
That doesn't necessarily mean

93
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,410
that their motives were aligned.

94
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,420
What does it mean?

95
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Yeah.

96
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,080
You keep looking at me like
you think I'm hiding something.

97
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,080
It's just

98
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,164
there has to be a reason.

99
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:06,400
I agree,

100
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,182
and I don't exactly
feel comfortable

101
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:12,390
sitting here waiting
for the guy, Jamie Burns,

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,755
to come back
and finish what he started.

103
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,680
You don't have someone you
could stay with for a while?

104
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,173
I have deadlines.
This is where I work.

105
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,586
I can't just uproot everything.

106
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,133
Well, don't you have some
kind of security system here?

107
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,230
You got cameras
or something, right?

108
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,648
I have an old shotgun
in the shed.

109
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:30,755
Well, you ought to have some
kind of security anyway, right?

110
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:31,724
I mean, your paintings.

111
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,490
You get a pretty
good price for them.

112
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,977
Oh, you've been
researching me.

113
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,110
I'm working a case, so.

114
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Excuse me, sir.

115
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,097
You're kind of
taking up two spots.

116
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,617
You can fit.

117
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,270
All right, one.

118
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:18,580
Tickets, please.

119
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,946
Thank you very much.

120
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,070
You got a problem, bro?

121
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,715
What the hell?

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,140
Fuck this.

123
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,580
Oh, there you are.

124
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,088
Whoa. You're OK?

125
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,017
Hell, arthritis, fine.

126
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,160
Just a little bit of sciatica.

127
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,111
It comes and goes.

128
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,288
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, my dad had that once.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,853
Got laid up for months.

130
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:16,400
You got anything for the pain?

131
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,550
Pills make me too drowsy.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,662
What do you got?

133
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:22,017
Forensics, they found
fibres and hairs at the site.

134
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,840
- You talked to Burns?
- Yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:25,733
He said he didn't
know anything about a grave.

136
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,760
Think that's bullshit?

137
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,930
How long on the DNA?

138
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,960
A couple of days.
I don't know.

139
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,180
Anything from college?

140
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,422
Yeah.

141
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:39,980
Jamie left school mid-term
on his own.

142
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,137
But he was in the middle
of a disciplinary hearing.

143
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,715
Apparently, he attacked
his roommate.

144
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,200
Well, we should track
that guy down.

145
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,346
I did.

146
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:51,075
He's a dermatologist.

147
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,528
He works in the city.

148
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,493
I'll have to head
down there later today.

149
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh, OK, good, good.

150
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,693
You want company?

151
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:02,500
Well, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

152
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,040
Got you. Yeah, who dreams of

153
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,742
Yeah, who dreams of becoming
a dermatologist, right?

154
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,380
Yeah,
how much fun could that be?

155
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,768
OK, don't forget
to take a look

156
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:13,800
at the early writings
of Winston Churchill.

157
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,970
We'll go over that next time.

158
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,293
I'm so sorry, Mr B.

159
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,955
I didn't want my parents
to say anything.

160
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,480
I didn't even want
to show them the letter.

161
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,960
But my mum was being
like a crazy person.

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,862
- It's OK.
- I'm so pissed at them.

163
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,346
I need to talk to you,

164
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:31,991
but not here.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,530
Meet me at Three Brothers
over on Lexington at 3:30.

166
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,164
Off-campus?

167
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,795
Well, I have
model U.N. at...

168
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:42,710
You're skipping that. 3:30.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,090
OK, see you there then.

170
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,280
Jamie Burns.

171
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,630
Does he know
that we're speaking?

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,300
I mean, is he going to find out?

173
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,111
I'm just trying to get
some background information

174
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,924
for context, so no.

175
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,480
Well, when we were
 roommates, sophomore year,

176
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,860
everything was fine.

177
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,662
We were friendly,
but not too close.

178
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,262
Perfect roommate
distance, you know?

179
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:13,262
So we re-upped junior year,

180
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,626
and that's when
he completely changed.

181
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,924
Why was that?

182
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:19,084
It was this guy he
started hanging out with,

183
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,346
Nick Haas.

184
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,320
He's a weird guy, dark.

185
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,542
Jamie kind of fell
under his spell.

186
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,040
They were inseparable.

187
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:29,090
Jamie got really distant.
He wouldn't speak to me.

188
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,084
And I'd catch him looking
at me sometimes

189
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,257
like he hated me.

190
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,760
He ever threaten you?

191
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,100
- No, not really.

192
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,600
But then one morning,

193
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,430
maybe 6:00 a.m.,
I wake up.

194
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:44,355
I find him sitting on the floor
covered in dirt,

195
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,980
his hands bloody,
just staring at the wall.

196
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
He wouldn't speak.

197
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,280
Drugs? Something...?

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,542
No, it felt different than that.

199
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:55,955
He seemed almost too alive.

200
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,671
That was my limit.

201
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,271
I took some pictures of him
to petition for a room change.

202
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:05,964
And that's when he attacked me.

203
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,195
For taking pictures?

204
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:11,697
No, at some point,
I put my hand on his shoulder,

205
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:13,840
like, to get his attention and

206
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,431
it was like a trip wire.

207
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,617
He started screaming,
pushing me.

208
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,310
He took this damn lava lamp

209
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,100
and cracked me
over the head with it.

210
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,270
I had 22 stitches.

211
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,413
It really screwed up my year.

212
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,813
Pictures, you still have those?

213
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,030
Yeah, somewhere.

214
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,928
I could find them and send them
over to you if you like.

215
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,700
Great, great.

216
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:38,330
- Appreciate the time.
- Sure.

217
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,422
Detective,

218
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,635
if you need someone 
to come in and

219
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:45,635
testify against his character,

220
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,670
I'll make the time.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,742
What I'm trying to say
is you're making a mistake.

222
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:01,057
I don't understand.

223
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,146
Emma, I know you.

224
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,542
I know how wound up you get
about doing well.

225
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,808
I know you're taking
Adderall to compete...

226
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:10,373
- That's not true.
- I've seen you passing pills

227
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,893
with Lisa.
I know what you're doing.

228
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:16,240
It's just to help me focus.
Really, I promise.

229
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:17,351
- Look, I don't care...
- I shouldn't be punished

230
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:18,720
for trying to do well.
- I don't care about the Adderall.

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,942
I don't care, OK?

232
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:23,173
My point is that going to Brown

233
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,582
is only going
to make things worse.

234
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,648
You're killing yourself
to get good grades.

235
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:31,404
Going to an Ivy
and meeting the right people,

236
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,470
doing what everyone
else is doing...

237
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,106
It's a dead end.

238
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,180
But you've been telling me
to go this whole time.

239
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,920
I was wrong,

240
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,688
really wrong.

241
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,271
You just can't let other people
tell you what to do.

242
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:50,444
But I chose Brown.

243
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,786
Because you think
you have to go.

244
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,635
Emma, think. God damn it.

245
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:54,444
You're a smart girl.

246
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:57,671
Can you think bigger
with me for just a second?

247
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,280
We are living on a giant rock.

248
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,577
We are flying through space,
and no one knows anything.

249
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:06,533
School makes you think
they have the answers,

250
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,630
but they don't.
No one does.

251
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,257
Well, if that's true,

252
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:11,786
then I shouldn't
believe you either.

253
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,010
You're right.
You shouldn't.

254
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:19,422
I can't not go.
I mean, my parents...

255
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:20,320
Screw your parents.

256
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:21,831
That's easy for you
to say that.

257
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,600
You want to keep feeling
the way you do now?

258
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,413
Stressed out and scared

259
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,217
and never thinking
you're good enough?

260
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:30,980
Look, I know you're unhappy.

261
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:33,955
I have watched you be unhappy
for three years now.

262
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,860
Is that how you want to live?

263
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,533
You think you're finally
going to get somewhere, arrive,

264
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,780
but trust me, I did that,
and you never get there.

265
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,093
You never feel like...

266
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,550
I should...

268
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,444
- What?
- I'm sorry.

269
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,866
This this isn't fair.

270
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,875
I got to...

271
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:07,982
Sorry.

272
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,968
God damn it.

273
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,373
- Hi.
- Hi.

274
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,690
Oh, my God.

275
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,100
You're right on time.

276
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,190
Contractions are
about seven minutes apart.

277
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,551
- We have time.
- OK.

278
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:01,070
Yeah. You OK?

280
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,622
Well, it feels intense,

281
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,791
kind of like a gripping.
But, yeah, I'm OK, for now.

282
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,080
I'm happy.

283
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:14,080
Yeah?

284
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

285
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:18,800
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

286
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,302
How do we keep
the tub temp consistent?

287
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,350
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

288
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,440
You're here.

289
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,100
Brian's been here
all afternoon.

290
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,900
I'd like him to stay
if that's OK.

291
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,940
All afternoon?
You called him first?

292
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,900
He was home.

293
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,780
- OK, B.
- Oh, OK, OK, OK.

294
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,660
OK, deep breaths.

295
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,182
OK, here we go.

296
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,750
You're doing great.

297
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,768
Well, when is he free?

298
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,804
Should a ten-year-old
be that busy?

299
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,010
No, I know.

300
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,431
I know. It's... All right.

301
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,080
Just let me know.

302
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,542
Oh, oh, my God.

303
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:33,057
Oh, my God.

304
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:39,235
Oh, my God.
It's a boy.

305
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,860
We have a son.

306
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,431
We have a son.

307
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,026
Daddy, your honour here.

308
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,657
Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right.

309
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,853
Right here?

310
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,840
All right.

311
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,791
Hey.

312
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,604
OK, OK, OK.

313
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,626
Well, you want to make sure that

314
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:21,511
security techs install
those varifocal lens cameras.

315
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,840
I don't know what that means,

316
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:25,946
but I'll make sure I pretend to.

317
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:28,720
And you can get that
emergency call button

318
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:31,368
and keep it on your keychain.

319
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:35,271
I know this is designed
to make me feel more secure,

320
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:37,066
but it's not.

321
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:40,915
Well, it makes some
of the rest of us feel better.

322
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,591
Well, that's something.

323
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,626
See this red oak

324
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:47,537
would be a great
camera position.

325
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,013
That's a healthy looking tree,
isn't it?

326
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,408
Yeah, I'm not so lucky
with my blue spruces.

327
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,226
I lost a bunch
to needle cast last year.

328
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,533
I can help with that.

329
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,426
I have a fungicide
that will mitigate it.

330
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:05,031
I've never met anybody
with a mitigating fungicide.

331
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,870
Yeah, it can help.

332
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,693
So this is you over here?

333
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:13,768
Going this way, it's all the
way out to that aspen grove?

334
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,410
Yup, up to the road.

335
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,840
Help me.

336
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,010
Thanks.

337
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:27,422
I didn't do very much.

338
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:29,004
You're pretty steady
on your own.

339
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,100
Well, one of us had
to make the first move.

340
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:42,773
Hon?

341
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,990
Hey.

342
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,511
You barely slept
the last few nights.

343
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:48,800
Why don't you go lay down?

344
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,035
What if something happens
and he stops breathing?

345
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Babe.

346
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,580
Baby.

347
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,173
He is a champion,

348
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:04,622
first-in-his-class breather.

349
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:05,617
Hey.

350
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,760
You just got to loosen up a bit

351
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,115
or you're going
to wear yourself out.

352
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:12,675
I'll just stay
a bit longer, OK?

353
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,262
OK, I think
maybe five minutes.

354
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:17,600
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

355
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:20,222
- OK.
- Yeah.

356
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,737
Hey.

357
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:56,020
Aw, yeah?

358
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Package for you.

359
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:08,950
For me?

360
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,870
Yup, from Michigan.

361
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:17,660
Thank you.

362
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,142
Detective Ambrose.

363
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:33,155
What? What's up?

364
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:34,657
DNA came in.

365
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:38,311
Jamie Burns is a match with the
samples from the grave site.

366
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,850
Thanks.

367
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:51,990
Shh, I just got him
to quiet down.

368
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,830
What are you doing here?

369
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,853
Leela needed
to lie down for a bit,

370
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,710
so I took over.

371
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,920
He's doing great.

372
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,244
I'll take him.

373
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,395
He just fell asleep.
It's OK.

374
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:05,128
- Just give him to me.
- Trust me, Jamie.

375
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,840
I know from personal experience.

376
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,746
Once you get him down
like this, you just...

377
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:11,180
Give me my son, OK?

378
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:14,151
OK.

379
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,404
Sure.

380
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,730
Come here, buddy.

381
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,410
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

382
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:12,280
You just won't
leave me alone, will you?

383
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,417
I can't seem to.

384
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:20,817
You know, you can stop lying now

385
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:23,146
because it's over.

386
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,088
I know what you did.

387
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:27,644
What are you talking about?

388
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,542
I know you were at the grave.

389
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,930
We got a DNA report
that proves it.

390
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:39,866
This thing isn't going
to go away.

391
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:45,182
So I was at the grave.
What does that prove?

392
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,570
You lied to me.

393
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,897
I know that in college,

394
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:53,386
you attacked your roommate.

395
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,488
And I know that something
happened that night

396
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,168
between you and Nick

397
00:24:58,168 --> 00:25:00,746
that made you snap.

398
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,973
And I know that
after the accident,

399
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,857
you killed him.

400
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,226
You kept him
from calling for help,

401
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:13,262
and then you wiped your prints
off his cell phone.

402
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,810
That's true, isn't it?

403
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,524
It's manslaughter.

404
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,940
How do you even prove that?

405
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,530
What kind of evidence
do you have?

406
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:41,235
You don't, do you?

407
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,115
I just want you
to know I'm watching you.

408
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:49,991
Why do you care
so much about this?

409
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,053
You broke the law.

410
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,600
That's not it.

411
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,351
Anyway, this whole thing
is over now.

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,644
Is it?

413
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:11,271
I think you let Nick die

414
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:16,186
because you didn't like
that he had a hold on you.

415
00:26:16,346 --> 00:26:18,817
But he still does,

416
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:21,200
doesn't he?

417
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,260
 I mean, assuming you're right,

418
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:32,302
what would you do about it,

419
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:33,946
if you were me.

420
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:39,100
I'd accept
the help I'm offered.

421
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,160
You mean confess.

422
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,368
Yeah.

423
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,860
Nick Haas, I remember well.

424
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,786
Brilliant young man.
A bit eccentric.

425
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:34,977
You only find students of his
calibre every once in a while.

426
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:38,110
He was with him,

427
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,564
Jamie Burns.

428
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:41,413
He survived the accident.

429
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:43,368
He was also in your class.

430
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:46,924
Obviously didn't make as
much of an impression on me. Sorry.

431
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:50,053
His former roommate

432
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,213
took this picture.

433
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,760
This is why I came here.

434
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:55,590
Ubermensch.

435
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,680
From what I understand,
it's Nietzsche.

436
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,470
It means some kind of Superman.

437
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,982
A bit reductive in translation,

438
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:02,986
but yes, that's right.

439
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,180
The highest form of man.

440
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,053
And Nick and Jamie
would have covered Nietzsche

441
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,875
in your philosophy seminar.

442
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,542
Many disaffected young men
take to Nietzsche.

443
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,937
It's usually just a phase.

444
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,780
Pretty strong stuff
from what I've read.

445
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:20,115
Ubermensch ignoring morality.

446
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,484
No, that's not quite right.

447
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:23,706
The Ubermensch creates
his own morality.

448
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,893
Nietzsche contends
that our modern ways

449
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,875
have led us to lose our faith.

450
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:28,853
God is dead.

451
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:33,137
It's up to the Ubermensch
to forge new values to live by.

452
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,380
It's a challenge,

453
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:36,840
one that requires
will and discipline.

454
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,284
- And if somebody were
to rise to that challenge?

455
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:43,350
Ostensibly, you conquer fear.

456
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,000
Live at a higher level
than common man.

457
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:48,142
Discover the truth of existence.

458
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,453
That's probably what appealed
to these two.

459
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,577
So you become your own God.

460
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:53,973
You try.

461
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:56,302
But there are pitfalls.

462
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:58,780
Such as?

463
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:01,173
The temptation
towards elitism;

464
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:04,684
belief in one's
self-created superiority.

465
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:09,040
Hitler used Nietzsche
to justify the Holocaust,

466
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:09,848
for instance.

467
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:12,355
That's a bit
of a slippery slope.

468
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:14,595
Nietzsche warned
of it himself.

469
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:17,840
"If you gaze long enough
into the abyss,

470
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:21,120
the abyss will gaze
back into you."

471
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,262
Emma Hughes' parents
are livid.

472
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,431
Isn't that
their resting state?

473
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:37,982
I had to talk them down
off a cliff.

474
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:41,370
They want to take this issue
to the Trustees.

475
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,493
What did you say to Emma?

476
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,675
What did they say to you?

477
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:46,133
Well, apparently
she's questioning

478
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,920
whether or not she wants
to go to college at all now,

479
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,130
thanks to you.

480
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,568
Maybe they should listen
to their daughter.

481
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,050
What did you say to her?

482
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,880
I encouraged her
to think independently.

483
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:58,380
Isn't that what we do here?

484
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,430
Jamie,

485
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,386
what is going on with you?

486
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:06,906
I just, I don't understand...

487
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,337
I'm only trying to help her.

488
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:11,480
No, you're deliberately
sabotaging her.

489
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,911
Who do you care about?

490
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,860
Really. Is it Emma?

491
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,648
Or your job?

492
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:22,133
I'm pulling Emma
out of your class.

493
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,360
That's not going
to help with anything.

494
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,288
Her parents have asked
that you not communicate

495
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,831
with her again,
and I think it's a good idea.

496
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:29,786
Well, fuck you then.

497
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:31,893
Excuse me?

498
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:37,902
We may have been colleagues
before I became your boss,

499
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,373
but you cannot speak
to me that way.

500
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,937
Are we done?

501
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,866
Yes, I think we are,

502
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,102
for the moment.

503
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh, oh, that's great.

504
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:55,004
That's great, and how
are we doing on inventory?

505
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:57,528
Did you place that order?

506
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:02,490
- Great.
- Oh, yeah...

507
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,688
Attaboy.

508
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,862
Dream away, little guy.

509
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,071
Dream away.

510
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:44,480
He looks just like you.

511
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,960
Give him to me.

512
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,217
No, please.

513
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,795
He needs to learn.

514
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:59,013
Give him to me.

515
00:32:36,702 --> 00:32:38,853
Hey, what's going on?

516
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,062
Take him.

517
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,924
Is he OK?

518
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:47,770
Hi, baby. OK, OK.

519
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,515
Anything good?

520
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:05,555
- Nah, still working.
- Yeah.

521
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,293
Michigan VA Home.

522
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:12,364
Something from your old man?

523
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah. Personal effects.

524
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:20,168
Oh, I didn't know.

525
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,026
Oh, shit.

526
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:24,000
Harry, I'm sorry.

527
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:25,180
That's OK.

528
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,617
I mean, I know
you weren't close but,

529
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:32,337
you know, still, your father.

530
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:33,980
Barely.

531
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,610
Anyway, hey, condolences, man.

532
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,360
Yeah.

533
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:48,408
Detective Ambrose, you got
a Jamie Burns here for you.

534
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,870
Looks pretty upset.

535
00:33:58,142 --> 00:33:59,440
OK.

536
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:03,200
OK.

537
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:04,835
Easy. Just take it easy.

538
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,488
Yeah, it's just,

539
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,893
I'm trying to hold
 it together, all right?

540
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,288
I really am, I am.
- Sit down.

541
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,764
But what? What is it?

542
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,773
What the hell are
they talking about in there?

543
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,733
- Jamie.
- OK.

544
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,337
Is anybody hurt?

545
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,937
No, no, I just...

546
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,466
I was holding my baby.

547
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,946
And?

548
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,266
You were holding your baby, and?

549
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,675
Help me. Please help me.

550
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,942
I will, I will.

551
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,715
But you got to tell me
what's going on.

552
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:52,791
Captain, I'm just going
to escort Mr Burns

553
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,608
for a consultation
at St Emilia's Hospital.

554
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:59,617
OK, sure. I'll catch
 up with you tomorrow.

555
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,690
Great.

556
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,820
And what happens after that?

557
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,240
The doctors are going
to ask you a few questions.

558
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,426
We can at least
get you something

559
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:17,057
to calm your system down.

560
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,946
I'm so fucked.

561
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,786
No, you're not.

562
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,280
You have a child now.

563
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,760
You're going to have
to get better for him.

564
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,786
Hey.

565
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:32,880
It's like Nick infected me.

566
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:36,770
I didn't want it, but now
I can't get it out of me.

567
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,164
You can do this,

568
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,626
a step at a time.

569
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,573
Right over here.

570
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,497
We need some security,

571
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,342
but it's got to be quiet
and at a distance.

572
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:10,542
A threat to himself
or to others?

573
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,008
Both.

574
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:14,426
We need to detain him
as soon as possible.

575
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:16,690
I'll tell the doctor.

576
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:32,533
Hopefully, we won't have
to wait too long.

577
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,631
You're doing good.

578
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,551
What's going on?

579
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,795
I don't know, but

580
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:44,506
those guys, they get
15 bucks an hour

581
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,670
to look at their cell phones.

582
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,906
Jamie Burns?

583
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:54,680
All right.

584
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,480
You're doing the right thing.
Come on.

585
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:18,160
You can wait here
until we're finished.

586
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:21,111
No, he can stay.
I want him to.

587
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,195
All right.

588
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,946
So I assume you're
aware of your rights

589
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:35,200
and that I can't hold you here

590
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,262
unless I deem you a threat
to yourself or others.

591
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,813
Hold me?
You mean involuntarily?

592
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:43,020
That's only in extreme cases
when someone's suicidal.

593
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,760
Right.

594
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:45,635
People who have trouble
controlling themselves.

595
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,924
That sort of thing.

596
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,240
OK then.

597
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,093
Just need a few
boring details to start.

598
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:55,580
So, Jamie. Is it James?

599
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,164
James.

600
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,580
Date of birth?

601
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,170
November 5th, 1981.

602
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:04,266
And you live
at 325 Washington Avenue?

603
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:12,417
Yeah.

604
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,391
And the reason
you're here today

605
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:15,680
is because
you've expressed a concern

606
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:18,640
about your mental well-being.

607
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,350
I guess so.

608
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,631
Why are you concerned?

609
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,040
I...

610
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:30,820
Try just telling me
how you feel.

611
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,870
I have this feeling
all the time,

612
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:39,457
like I'm trapped.

613
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:44,613
Like there's this
big thing looming over me

614
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,170
and I'm the only one
who can see it.

615
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,026
Can you describe
what the thing is?

616
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:53,937
It's like...

617
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,084
The fact that we're alive;

618
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,770
that we're going to die.

619
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,404
You ever hear voices
in your head?

620
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:06,346
No.

621
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:09,360
Any hallucinations, 
seeing things that aren't there?

622
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:12,660
Sometimes I imagine things,

623
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,017
you know, like daydreams.

624
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:16,471
Like daydreams
or something more real?

625
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,008
He's not schizophrenic.

626
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:21,671
Why don't you let me do
the evaluation, Detective?

627
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:26,460
Have you had
any suicidal thoughts?

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,222
I've thought about it,

629
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:34,320
but I can't do that.

630
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:35,875
Why not?

631
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,982
Because then you're
just avoiding pain,

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,164
and pain is the gateway.

633
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:47,270
That's what my friend
used to say.

634
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,950
So you feel you can
control those impulses.

635
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:59,333
Well, you think you can
until you can't.

636
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:01,253
Isn't that right?

637
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,066
So you don't feel you can
control those impulses?

638
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,888
No, I'm saying
that's a stupid question.

639
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,213
You ever have thoughts
of hurting others?

640
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:16,746
If I answer yes,
what will you do?

641
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:19,466
You'll keep me here
against my will?

642
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,675
Is that what this is about?

643
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,337
This is about getting you
the help that you asked for. That's all.

644
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,044
Is it?

645
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:33,360
Have you had urges
to hurt others?

646
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:45,688
Have you ever held a baby?

647
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,173
Yeah, you know the feeling

648
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:50,782
when you have him in your hands

649
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,808
and you feel the weight there,

650
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,850
this helpless, fragile thing.

651
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:00,302
And you get this jolt of fear

652
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,657
because you know
you could drop him.

653
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:06,853
You could just let him go,
let him break on the floor.

654
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:09,271
The possibility is right there,

655
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:11,564
so close.

656
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,106
And you feel this dread,

657
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,728
like there's some part of you
that you can't control

658
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,795
that will drop him
just to relieve you,

659
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:24,580
just to make it go away.

660
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,573
You know that feeling,
don't you?

661
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:35,022
We all do.

662
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,031
You should lock us all up.

663
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:49,690
Jamie, just...

664
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,817
Jamie.
Don't, Jamie.

665
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,711
What the hell was that?

666
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,640
You trying to get me locked up?

667
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,053
That's how you help me?

668
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,920
You're not going
to figure this out on your own.

669
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,035
Let's go someplace and talk.
You and me.

670
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:09,653
Just you and me.

671
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,680
Nick was right.

672
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,666
Jamie.

673
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:20,430
Jamie, hey, hey.

674
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:27,650
Jamie. God, shit!

675
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:31,893
How'd it go?

676
00:42:31,973 --> 00:42:34,417
Couldn't hold him.

677
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,671
He took off into the woods.

678
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:37,240
What? What do you mean?

679
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,871
He just ran off.

680
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:40,853
He's not stable.

681
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,857
We got to post somebody
at Sonya Barzel's place.

682
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:46,737
And I need an emergency warrant
on his cell phone right away.

683
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:48,320
But we can't get
a warrant that fast.

684
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:50,382
We have to.
He's out there.

685
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:52,630
He's going to do something.

686
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,066
We have to find him.

687
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:13,000

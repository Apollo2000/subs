1
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,401
Vamos, vamos.

2
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:42,810
Gracias.

3
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,699
Los Angeles, para allá.

4
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:47,701
Barstow...

5
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:49,684
No te preocupes.

6
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:58,709
Hey!

7
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:12,059
Okay.

8
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,626
Gracias.

9
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,515
Someone's following us.

10
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,998
Hold on.

11
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,407
Turn off your lights and pull over.

12
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,019
No.

13
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,188
Why don't you tell me
where you came from?

14
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,165
Well, I think our people
are from Scotland.

15
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,695
And Hungary.

16
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,270
And there's probably
some Norse in there somewhere.

17
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,816
Okay, but where'd you grow up?

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,241
All over.

19
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,694
You might need a...

20
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,073
few more branches for your poster board.

21
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,540
What about your mom?

22
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,267
You never really talk about her much.

23
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,878
You sure you don't want to spend

24
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,285
our day together outdoors?

25
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,872
Your mom could probably
fill in that stuff.

26
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,399
Is it really that bad?

27
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:32,349
No, I just...

28
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,302
had a different upbringing
than most kids.

29
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,294
When you're quiet, you're thinking.

30
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,155
Good or bad?

31
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,927
I think I bombed my geometry test today.

32
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,411
I'm bummed about it.

33
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,181
Well, there's more to life than geometry.

34
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,342
What about on the way to school

35
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,987
or afterwards?

36
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,762
Anything interesting happen?

37
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,348
I heard the bus driver
complaining about his ex-wife.

38
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,359
There you go.

39
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,340
You learn any dirty words in Spanish?

40
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,591
No.

41
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,516
Yes, you did.

42
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,267
Did you do this?

43
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,479
Yeah, you had two pictures
left on your last roll.

44
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,897
I finished it.

45
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,698
That's nice composition. It's good focus.

46
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,982
I like the subject matter's
emotion there.

47
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,053
That's hard to capture.

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,972
All right, kiddo.

49
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,892
Maybe there's some promise
in you after all.

50
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,153
Okay, so before I officially

51
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,337
announce that I am running for D.A.,

52
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:02,377
my campaign manager wants
to look into the family.

53
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,911
Look how?

54
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,032
You mean ask questions?

55
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,640
They're vetting us without our consent.

56
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,623
Yes, it's a vetting process,

57
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,216
but it's like a background check.

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,479
- Totally normal.
- They're gonna look into me?

59
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,441
No, honey. I'm a cop.

60
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,650
I do the looking into others.

61
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,292
Roger.

62
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,813
Are you worried something might turn up?

63
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:22,838
No.

64
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,009
Not at all, it-it's just that I just...

65
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,695
Dad, you look a little worried.

66
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,114
Okay, everybody.

67
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,199
Relax, here she is.

68
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,952
Hey, Dad, you might want
to check your browser history.

69
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,853
- What's, what's the browser...
- Okay.

70
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,370
Everyone, this is Cynthia.

71
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,082
Hello, it is so good to meet you.

72
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,074
- Hi, I'm innocent.
- Yeah, I didn't do anything.

73
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,717
Just so you know,

74
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,880
the LAPD does background checks.

75
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:48,048
So there's no sense in looking into me.

76
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,781
Oh, we have our own process.

77
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:54,037
But, oh, there's nothing to worry about.

78
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,729
No, this is, this is really about

79
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,930
getting out ahead of any vulnerabilities

80
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:59,176
that the opposition might uncover.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,241
Vulnerabilities.

82
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,045
Like a college dropout

83
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,454
starting a pot dispensary?

84
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,132
You mean a young entrepreneur

85
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:10,029
opening a business that is
symbolic of a progressive city?

86
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,489
Hmm, entrepreneur. See, I like that.

87
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,382
I've had to spin so much worse.

88
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:18,287
Okay, so we are all on the same team.

89
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,497
- Okay?
- So if you have any questions,

90
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,743
just let me know.

91
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,534
And later we'll talk
about the investigation.

92
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,838
The investigation. Am I gonna
need a lawyer for this?

93
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,506
So charming.

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,365
I know, he is.

95
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,845
Thanks for coming.

96
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,432
I didn't know who else to trust.

97
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:38,432
He came in with a gunshot wound.

98
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,392
I think he crossed illegally.

99
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,019
Cole, you cannot tell

100
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,021
anyone I am doing this, please.

101
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,148
I'll keep it between us. What's going on?

102
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,942
His daughter's still out there.

103
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:50,027
- Out where?
- In the desert.

104
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,237
I'm not sure where.

105
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,670
What's his name? Can I talk to him?

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,299
Jose Mendoza... he's stable
but not entirely lucid.

107
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,939
My Spanish is rough, but is English okay?

108
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,210
Yes.

109
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,560
Jose, why did you leave
your daughter in the desert?

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,091
We were being chased
by the men who shot me

111
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,260
and that poor young lady.

112
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,993
Who shot you?

113
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,264
Cartel.

114
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,015
Government.

115
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,518
Coyotes, maybe.

116
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,334
Please.

117
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,754
Find my daughter.

118
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,422
Please.

119
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,575
Scorsese.

120
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,286
Victim's Sandra Hawkins,

121
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,893
journalism student at Pepperdine.

122
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,999
Well, what brought her out here?

123
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,293
She died prior to impact.

124
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,378
Multiple bullet holes
outside the vehicle.

125
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,603
I'm running the blood from
inside the car for any matches.

126
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,884
- Anyone see the passenger?
- No witnesses,

127
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,511
but we're looking at cameras in the area.

128
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,305
What about Cole?

129
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,204
Anybody see Cole?

130
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,630
Roger.

131
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,081
Were you planning on coming
to work today, sir?

132
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,309
Oh, yeah, sorry, buddy.

133
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,819
I meant to give you a call.

134
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:16,447
Yeah, I'm feeling a little,
uh, under the weather today.

135
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,032
Under the weather?

136
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,232
And what's the forecast?

137
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,909
Food poisoning maybe.

138
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:24,038
Okay, listen, Cole, being a cop
is way too important of a job

139
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:25,414
for you to play hooky.

140
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,324
Roger, I'm really gonna need
to take that sick day.

141
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,251
But I promise I'm gonna
get you a doctor's note.

142
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,984
Hey, I don't... I...

143
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:37,765
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,179
So, Trish is doing background checks

145
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,014
on all of us before the campaign.

146
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,016
Now, you've been through this whole

147
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,351
vetting process thing.

148
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,269
How deep a dive are we talking?

149
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,979
Enough to put a man under. Why?

150
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,482
Okay, well, if the phone call comes in

151
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:54,207
and they start asking
you certain questions,

152
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,569
I just need to know that you got my back.

153
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,155
Roger, what exactly
do I need to have your back on?

154
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,713
Don't make me say it.

155
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,101
Come on, we both know it was
a different time back then.

156
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,121
Uh...

157
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:08,624
The Venice Canals. The crate.

158
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,209
The open crate.

159
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,585
We both took some.

160
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,504
Cheese.

161
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,956
Illegal cheese.

162
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,257
I just want to make sure that

163
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,343
Trish's whole career is not ruined

164
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,159
because of my love for Beaufort d'été.

165
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,097
It was gonna melt.

166
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,642
It was a reasonable decision
in the line of duty.

167
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,241
Thank you.

168
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,479
Uh, you don't happen to have
any of that left, do you?

169
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:33,315
- That stuff was amazing.
- No, I had to get rid of it.

170
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:34,650
Yeah.

171
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,318
We both did.

172
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,387
Yeah.

173
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:42,502
Agent Wells, we understand
that your team detained

174
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,785
several undocumented immigrants
at the border last night.

175
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,121
We did a roundup not far
from Las Cantilles.

176
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,429
A drop-off point for some of our coyotes.

177
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:50,524
See anything stand out?

178
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,041
There were two people missing.

179
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,461
A father and daughter, according
to some of our detainees.

180
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,380
There was a car waiting for them.

181
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,356
The same make and model
of our victim, Sandra Hawkins.

182
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:01,254
Let me guess.

183
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,179
Young, blonde,
someone no one would suspect.

184
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:06,117
Much less likely to be searched.

185
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:09,416
So is there any reason why
our victim would cut out

186
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,687
the coyote and take over a
father and daughter on her own?

187
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,014
They were smuggling something.

188
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,232
Most likely drugs.

189
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,549
Whatever they were trying
to bring across...

190
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,218
...it was worth killing for.

191
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,458
Ana?

192
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,441
- No, no.
- It's okay.

193
00:09:57,465 --> 00:10:00,110
No, no, no, come on. It's okay.

194
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,112
No. Please don't hurt me.

195
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,364
Everything's fine.

196
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,306
I'm gonna get you out of here.

197
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,427
Bet you could use a drink.

198
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:20,130
It's kind of crazy how water
can actually taste good

199
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:21,571
when you're thirsty, huh?

200
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:25,677
Where's my father?

201
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,346
He was shot.

202
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,639
He's in the hospital.

203
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,715
But he's fine. Okay?

204
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,118
He's got the best doctor
in the world looking after him.

205
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,211
What do you say I get you out
of here, you go see him?

206
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,498
Come here.

207
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:44,042
It's okay.

208
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,784
It's them!

209
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,446
Who's "them," Ana?

210
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,926
Come on, get down.

211
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,204
We got to run. Let's go.

212
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,215
Ana, we're gonna have to jump.

213
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:41,776
There. Go, go, go.

214
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:58,368
We're safe for now.

215
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,213
Good thing I called in sick.

216
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,919
Ah, let's stop here for a sec.

217
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,599
Does it hurt?

218
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:39,250
No. I've had worse.

219
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,192
Any idea who those guys were back there?

220
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,486
No.

221
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,636
Coyotes, maybe.

222
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:51,846
Thank you.

223
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,710
No signal.

224
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,963
Does anyone else know we are here?

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,509
My ex.

226
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,357
But I told her not to tell anybody.

227
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,152
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

228
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,824
What are we going to do?

229
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,564
We're gonna head west.

230
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:28,216
The road is about 30 miles that way.

231
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,252
Get help there.

232
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:44,835
So, I'm just, uh,

233
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,037
wrapping up our initial investigation.

234
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:49,339
Oh. Any red flags?

235
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,731
My kids looked
a little nervous the other day.

236
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,460
No, actually, I just have to follow up,

237
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,886
uh, something on your end.

238
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,932
Do you have contact information
for Barry Turtletaub?

239
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:01,852
Where'd you get that name?

240
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,377
I just pulled up
the marriage certificate.

241
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,538
This was not a marriage.

242
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:11,445
Okay, Trish, this is just a copy,

243
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,780
because this is in the public record.

244
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,616
Is this gonna be a problem?

245
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,913
I... I was just a kid.

246
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:25,417
He was in a band, I went
on tour with him after college,

247
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:28,411
we ended up in Vegas.
It was just two weeks.

248
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,839
It didn't even feel real.
I guess I was blocking it out.

249
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,781
Roger doesn't know, does he?

250
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,497
I wanted to tell him.

251
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:46,494
I wanted our marriage
to feel like the first time.

252
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,757
To be perfect.

253
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,796
I am a terrible person, aren't I?

254
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,298
No. No, you are real.

255
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:00,577
You're honest.

256
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,079
That's why you're gonna
be such a good D.A.

257
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:07,000
And you know what? The truth
is, the campaign's gonna focus

258
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,811
on your legal expertise. There's a chance

259
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,879
this won't even come up.

260
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,904
Natalie.

261
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:16,468
Roger.

262
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,053
What are you doing here?

263
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,471
I'm looking for Cole.

264
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,014
Last time we talked, he said he was sick.

265
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,351
I brought him some of my
homemade matzah ball soup

266
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,520
to his motel, but he wasn't there.

267
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:27,771
Do you know where he is?

268
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,857
Uh, maybe he's at the store?

269
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,984
Loading up on some sports
drinks? Got to hydrate

270
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,486
- when you're that sick, you know.
- Yeah.

271
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,739
Uh, you want to tell me
what's really going on?

272
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:14,507
Hello?

273
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,552
Anybody here?

274
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,963
Maybe they don't summer here too much.

275
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,851
Check the phone.

276
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,390
Phone's dead.

277
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,652
My God, Wes.

278
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:00,947
I think you're making a mistake.

279
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:03,839
Mom, I've already made
my decision. I'm going.

280
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,952
Yeah, but it's not too late
to reconsider, Wes.

281
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,781
You know, shouldn't you be proud of me?

282
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,613
I got into a good school,
I'm going to college.

283
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,667
I want to be proud of you, but...

284
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,503
this is the last place
I thought you would go.

285
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:16,796
What's wrong with West Point?

286
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,050
No, there's...
there's nothing's wrong with it.

287
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,274
It's just...

288
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,110
If this is your way of rebelling,

289
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,764
please do something else.
Take a year off,

290
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:28,341
join a cult. Anything but this.

291
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,441
You just want me to be like you.

292
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,376
That's, that's not true.

293
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,066
I want you to think for yourself.

294
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:36,392
I just don't want the military
doing your thinking for you.

295
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,693
Mom, I'm not like you.
I don't want your life.

296
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,201
- This is what I want to do.
- Wes, it's dangerous.

297
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,564
So is what you do! Jumping
from war zone to war zone

298
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,005
just to take friggin' pictures?

299
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:55,933
Is that all you think I do?
Just take pictures?

300
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:59,497
My work means something.

301
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,625
Every one of those pictures matter.

302
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm trying to make a difference.

303
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,490
So am I.

304
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:09,799
I'm going, Mom.

305
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,240
Wes.

306
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,122
Wes.

307
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,521
Cole, stay with me. It's okay.

308
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:24,670
Cole.

309
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,340
Come on.

310
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,699
Drive faster, Bailey.
Both hands on the wheel.

311
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,618
Murtaugh, I don't take orders from you.

312
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:38,724
Okay?

313
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:41,705
Did I do something?

314
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:42,915
Murtaugh, am I your equal?

315
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,908
Because I'm starting
to feel like I'm not.

316
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,099
And I do think that you've been

317
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,045
treating me like an assistant,
not a detective.

318
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,547
And not your equal.

319
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,550
So I think what you're saying is,

320
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,825
you don't like our shtick anymore?

321
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,954
Cole's car.

322
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,755
Is that Cole?

323
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,096
That's not Cole. Back up.

324
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:27,107
Who the hell are they?

325
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,087
- Reverse! Reverse!
- What?

326
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:31,737
Go!

327
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,448
Turn, Bailey, turn!

328
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,472
What are we doing?

329
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:42,775
Trust me, this is the right thing to do.

330
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,853
Wait a minute. Where's
the rest of the road?

331
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,461
There is no rest of the road!

332
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:04,561
We need to call for backup.

333
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,499
There's no signal.

334
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,001
All right. What's the game plan?

335
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,277
Looks like Cole's in trouble.

336
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,326
Let's go.

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,366
Yeah.

338
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:27,519
Did you find anything?

339
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:31,523
I found this, but no alcohol.

340
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,090
That's good enough.

341
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:47,581
Ana, I'm gonna need you to do this.

342
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:51,210
Uh, I... I can't.

343
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,902
Can you thread the needle?

344
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,007
Then you can.

345
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,533
Because if we don't
get this stitched up...

346
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:12,796
Just... sterilize the needle.

347
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,303
That's good.

348
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:27,621
It's okay.

349
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:29,707
Just start from the end.

350
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,982
Like you're lacing your shoes.

351
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:54,565
Cole? Cole, stay with me.

352
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:56,108
Talk to me.

353
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,109
Hey.

354
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,278
Okay.

355
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:01,158
You-you said

356
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:04,056
"mother" in your sleep.

357
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,767
Did she pass away?

358
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:09,562
Yeah.

359
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:12,815
Long time ago.

360
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,715
How did it happen?

361
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,613
A rocket attack.

362
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:46,390
At Citluk, not far from the fighting.

363
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,686
Sounds like someplace she'd be.

364
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:55,857
She left this behind.

365
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:06,494
Maybe you have it now.

366
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:37,709
Something's wrong, Cap.
Bailey's ignoring all my calls.

367
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,975
She and Murtaugh have been missing since

368
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,379
they went looking for Cole.

369
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,172
Looking for... Where's Cole?
I'm always in the dark.

370
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:44,341
Why is it so hard
to tell me what's going on?

371
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,759
Okay, I'm telling you now,

372
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,220
so when you're done,
maybe we go find them.

373
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,139
Yeah, let's go find 'em.

374
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,890
- Well, let's go.
- Okay.

375
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,135
I-I think what we've established

376
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,896
is a mentor-mentee relationship.

377
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,162
Yeah, maybe when I was a rookie,

378
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,557
which was a long time ago, Murtaugh.

379
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:03,504
Yes, but the sharing of my
knowledge goes on and on.

380
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:05,737
But respect is happening now.

381
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,031
- From top to bottom. Equals.
- Oh, right,

382
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:12,569
from the top. Yeah. This
is, uh, Avery's fault.

383
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:14,000
You know what? No.

384
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:15,998
I'm not gonna let you
pass the buck on this one.

385
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,167
Why do you feel like you can
always talk down to me?

386
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,025
Why don't you treat me like your equal?

387
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,488
You're like family to me.

388
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:28,445
Yeah, maybe it seems like
I'm talking down to you,

389
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:31,361
but that's how I talk to
the people I care about.

390
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:33,807
And, yeah, they complain.

391
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,125
But welcome to the family.

392
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,962
Someone's chasing us.

393
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,843
Go!

394
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,316
Ana...

395
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,837
I think I'm seeing things again.

396
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:05,245
What do you see?

397
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,841
Out the window.

398
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:09,407
My partner.

399
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:16,266
Is he a tall, handsome,
African-American man?

400
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,501
Handsome? That's definitely not him.

401
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:23,398
- Roger, it is you.
- Cole!

402
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,706
I thought you were a mirage.

403
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:27,236
Why the hell did you lie to me, huh?

404
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,863
You... we're partners. You...
we should be past that...

405
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:32,922
You're shot. Just hop in your car

406
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,463
and drive to the hospital,
I'll be right as rain.

407
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,142
Yeah, about that...

408
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,207
All right, here they come.

409
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:42,209
- This isn't a rescue?
- No.

410
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,192
It's more of an Alamo kind of deal.

411
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,153
Ana, get down.

412
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,864
Bailey,

413
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,309
how many more rounds you got?

414
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,638
Not enough.

415
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:03,336
Me neither. So I guess we're equals.

416
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,092
What the hell do they want?

417
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,352
Am I hearing things?

418
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,314
A helicopter?

419
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:28,130
It's a helicopter, all right.

420
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,048
This is the LAPD.

421
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:32,009
Stop your vehicle.

422
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,701
Think it scared off the shooters.

423
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:37,120
All right, Cole,
let's get you to the hospital.

424
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:56,366
Wouldn't it be easier
just to tell me what's going on?

425
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,619
I'm the last one to know,
and I literally have

426
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:01,455
to swoop in here and save your ass.

427
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:04,666
Can you understand a word he's saying?!

428
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,149
No.

429
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:13,799
Vitals? Stable.

430
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:16,061
- No signs of infection.
- Cole, can you hear me?

431
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:18,263
Prep him for surgery. OR Seven.

432
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,140
Hey, Nat.

433
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:21,516
Hmm?

434
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,019
We got to stop meeting like this.

435
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,687
Cole, I am so sorry.

436
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:26,837
I'm not.

437
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,340
This time I got the girl.

438
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,323
Is he gonna be all right?

439
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:38,608
We're gonna prep him
for surgery. He should be fine.

440
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:41,370
You do the stitching?
Probably saved his life.

441
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:42,577
Can I see my father?

442
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,820
I wouldn't recommend it.

443
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:46,722
They have police stationed
outside of his room.

444
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,567
They might take you into custody, Ana.

445
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,132
Hey, listen, I have a
daughter about your age.

446
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:57,511
You can come with me until we
get this all straightened out.

447
00:27:57,535 --> 00:28:00,180
Get yourself a nice,
hot meal, cleaned up.

448
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,163
No questions asked.

449
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,669
Vámonos. Did I say that right?

450
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,763
Okay, I-I only
have a couple of questions.

451
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,444
- Okay.
- Should we wait for Roger?

452
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:18,573
You know, um, no. Why don't we
just get started without him?

453
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,900
Okay. We'll start with RJ and Riana.

454
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:21,952
What'd they do?

455
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:24,996
Nothing, nothing, they're great kids.

456
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,181
We're just gonna focus on some
areas of concern that we have

457
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,627
to be prepared for under
the microscope of a campaign.

458
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,088
Let's take for example, uh,

459
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,339
Riana's second Instagram account.

460
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,192
You have a second account?

461
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,168
Why do you need two accounts?

462
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:39,291
Okay, Mom, calm down.

463
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,957
Someone hacked my first one,
so I opened up another one.

464
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:43,946
Okay, that's totally reasonable.

465
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,513
I will caution you, however,

466
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:48,460
against posting selfies
of underage drinking.

467
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,400
- You were drinking?
- Okay, we can't all be saints, right?

468
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,633
What does that mean?

469
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:59,531
Okay, uh, let's go to RJ next.

470
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:01,027
What'd he do?

471
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,702
Well, uh, do you think you can explain

472
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:05,287
this public exposure charge?

473
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,878
- What?
- Wow.

474
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:09,384
Look, um, listen, Mom,
I-I-I had to use the bathroom.

475
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:10,962
And you couldn't find a restroom?

476
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,892
No, the-the place that I was at

477
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:15,338
- was closed, so I...
- What place was that?

478
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,968
Los Coyotes.

479
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:20,012
And you couldn't find a bathroom, really?

480
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,866
Listen, why are we focused
on me right now?

481
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,267
Shouldn't we be focusing
on the elephant in the room?

482
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,396
What elephant?

483
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,209
Your first husband.

484
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,599
Barry Turtletaub?

485
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:35,069
What's happening, everyone?

486
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:41,002
- What's going on?
- Roger...

487
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,911
can I talk to you in the other room?

488
00:29:46,373 --> 00:29:48,309
Roger, what's going on? Who is this?

489
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,353
This is Ana.

490
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:53,180
She's a Mexican refugee,
snuck across the border.

491
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:54,873
I found her in the desert,

492
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:57,458
and now I'm hiding her
from the authorities.

493
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:00,949
Now, you mind telling me
what you're hiding?

494
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,820
You had it on you when you came in.

495
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,552
It's one of your mom's photos, right?

496
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,535
Yeah.

497
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,645
For a second out there in the desert,

498
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,062
I thought she was with me.

499
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:35,317
Was watching over me or something.

500
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:41,427
Maya's been asking.
I didn't know what to tell her.

501
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:50,488
I think I don't really talk
about her because...

502
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,877
when I look back on my life,

503
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,777
all the decisions that I made...

504
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,304
I don't know what she would think of me.

505
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,522
I think she would be proud of you.

506
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:18,819
Sometimes I'm not so sure.

507
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,116
Here.

508
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,493
These should fit.

509
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:31,245
- Thanks.
- Do you need anything else?

510
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,908
Is there any way...

511
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,706
Oh, do you need to use my phone?

512
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,376
To call my father in the hospital.

513
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,543
I promise I won't take long.

514
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,402
Yeah, of course. Take your time.

515
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,012
Jose?

516
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:48,068
Don't tell anyone that
I let you take a call,

517
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,120
but it's your daughter.

518
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,854
Thank you very much.

519
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:56,137
Ana?

520
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,607
Papá.

521
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,998
Okay.

522
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:35,103
Okay.

523
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,769
Mr. Mendoza.

524
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,614
We're with the U.S. Customs
and Border Protection.

525
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:52,183
Now that you're stable, we'll be
taking you into custody.

526
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:57,531
Barry Turtletaub?

527
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,598
Roger, honey, listen.

528
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:01,905
I feel like I don't
even know you anymore,

529
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:03,659
like there's a stranger in my house.

530
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:07,425
A stranger? Roger,
you just brought someone

531
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:08,987
we don't know into our home.

532
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:12,054
- Don't make this about Ana!
- Well, I want to know who she is.

533
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:15,558
She's a helpless young girl
in need of asylum,

534
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:17,310
and she has nowhere else to go.

535
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:29,741
You sure about that?

536
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,286
Yo, Bailey, Border Patrol called.

537
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:38,654
Said they were gonna
transfer Jose Mendoza

538
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:40,058
to their custody tonight.

539
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:41,343
That wasn't supposed
to happen till tomorrow.

540
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,144
Yeah. Something else didn't
sit right with me,

541
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,855
so I went over the traffic cam
footage near the shooting.

542
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,551
Guess whose plates are a match.

543
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,402
Border Patrol Agent Wells.

544
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,909
- Murtaugh?
- Bailey.

545
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,078
Ana Mendoza stole my car.

546
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:02,238
I need you to find her before
she gets into more trouble.

547
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:03,274
I got it.

548
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:04,540
Also, Murtaugh, one more thing.

549
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,487
I think I know who was
shooting at us in the desert.

550
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,301
Jose?

551
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,431
Hey! Where are you taking him?

552
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:41,035
Cole, what are you doing out of bed?

553
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,371
It's the same boots
from the desert; it's them.

554
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:44,989
Cole, you have to go back to your room.

555
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:47,500
Nat, call security.
They can't leave the building.

556
00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:48,987
Cole!

557
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,386
Ana.

558
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:02,932
If you needed a ride,
you just had to ask.

559
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,976
Detective Murtaugh.

560
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,437
And you are...

561
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:10,133
Wade Dykstra, L.A. Tribune reporter.

562
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need
to talk to Ana alone

563
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:13,497
about her father's story.

564
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,213
How, uh, corrupt Border Patrol
agents are taking bribes

565
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,504
- from coyotes?
- That's the one.

566
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:22,577
And all six-foot-five, 250 pounds of you

567
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,609
- are writing it?
- Well, I am,

568
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:27,346
- as soon as you...
- Ow! What the hell, man?!

569
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:30,126
Sorry, but I'm tired of
people lying to me today.

570
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,503
There's no chance you are Wade Dykstra

571
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,339
from the L.A. Tribune.

572
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:36,257
- Ah-ah-ah.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

573
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,884
Take my wallet.

574
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:39,085
All right, look at my ID.

575
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:41,331
I'm Wade Dykstra.

576
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:49,228
Wade.

577
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,022
You should have said something.

578
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:52,440
Come here, let me help you up, man.

579
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:55,109
Maybe we could keep
this little misunderstanding

580
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,517
- out of the story.
- Look out!

581
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:58,052
Get inside!

582
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:23,554
Let him go!

583
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,098
Go, go, go!

584
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,133
Bailey.

585
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,720
I think you're all grown up now.

586
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,166
I'm not letting go!

587
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:17,423
Gun!

588
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,500
Drop the weapon!

589
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,602
Put your hands in the air
where I can see 'em!

590
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:53,760
Get 'em up now!

591
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,146
Get your hands up!

592
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,171
Stay there! Don't move!

593
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:05,114
Move in, move in!

594
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:06,088
Take the weapon!

595
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,658
Weapon secure.

596
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:08,659
Hey, Nat.

597
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,661
Cole.

598
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,539
I might have a few more injuries
for you to check out.

599
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:15,231
Ah.

600
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:22,713
The Mendoza family has been
granted political asylum

601
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:26,275
in the U.S., and the LAPD
will continue to do everything

602
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,622
in our power to end
the kind of corruption

603
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:30,571
that Mr. Mendoza was
brave enough to expose.

604
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,168
I'll now take a few of your questions.

605
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,866
I'd be proud of myself, too.

606
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,096
It was the right thing to do.

607
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,566
Hey, thanks for saving us
out there in the desert.

608
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,601
And for the future, I will keep you

609
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,694
- in the loop.
- No, you won't.

610
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,404
- No, I won't.
- But thank you.

611
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:46,438
You try the Roquefort?

612
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,035
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, it's heavenly.

613
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:50,284
I can't believe you
held on to all of this.

614
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,689
Captain, Detective Murtaugh.

615
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:54,580
Is that the file I asked you for?

616
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:56,249
Yeah. Who is this guy?

617
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:58,417
Don't you worry about that.

618
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:00,762
You are on a need-to-know basis.

619
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:02,820
Okay.

620
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,484
Hey, Roger.

621
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:07,825
You sure you want to know
what's in that file?

622
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:15,086
Honestly... I don't know anymore.

623
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:30,139
Well, if it isn't my first wife.

624
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,987
You were not supposed
to find out like that.

625
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,021
So you were married before.

626
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,236
Who cares?

627
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:43,152
We both have pasts.

628
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:45,575
But we're married now.

629
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:47,550
Happily married.

630
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:51,470
Trish, I want you to know
that you can tell me anything.

631
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,432
I already have a partner at work

632
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,448
that-that has trust issues.

633
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,791
I don't need that at home.

634
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:01,253
I love you.

635
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,095
I love you so much.

636
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,181
I love you, too.

637
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:15,517
Roger... what's that?

638
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:17,816
That?

639
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,334
That's a file on your ex.

640
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:24,489
Did you read it?

641
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,469
A butcher.

642
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:33,462
What?

643
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:35,041
No, I didn't open it.

644
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:37,466
But I was sitting here thinking,

645
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,893
"What kind of guy could this be?"

646
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,922
And that's what I came up with.

647
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:43,439
A big, jolly butcher.

648
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:45,580
With four missing fingers.

649
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,736
And a walleye. That's why he
keeps cutting his fingers off.

650
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,991
Who loves to go fishing,

651
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,325
to get rid of the smell
of the butcher shop.

652
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,743
- With fish? Okay.
- With fish.

653
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,334
And he's married now.

654
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:58,746
- Oh.
- And he's got kids.

655
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,956
- And they live in...
- Van Nuys.

656
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,833
- Van Nuys.
- He's a Van Nuys guy.

657
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:05,294
But you know, they're
very happy together.

658
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:07,695
Very happy.

659
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:28,473
Wait, does that say "Olympian"?

660
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:30,058
No, honey, he's a butcher.

661
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,672
Did she take that one?

662
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:40,818
Yep.

663
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:42,278
One of her best.

664
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:47,358
What was she like?

665
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,044
Fearless.

666
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:55,955
Always wanted to do the right thing.

667
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,583
Find the truth,

668
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,548
no matter how dangerous.

669
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,823
Kind of like you.

670
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:11,405
- You like it?
- Yeah.

671
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,240
Come on, why? What do you see?

672
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,519
What do you mean?

673
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,268
What are these schools
teaching you out here?

674
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:21,651
I mean... what do you see?

675
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:26,739
I like how it's kind of sad
but also kind of happy.

676
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:29,659
I mean, it looks like something
bad is happening around him,

677
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,101
but he's still smiling.

678
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:36,230
It looks... real.

679
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,666
Sincere.

680
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,415
Dad, can I get a camera?

681
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:48,419
I might have one around.

682
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:52,246
Come on, let's take a look
at some of these other pictures.

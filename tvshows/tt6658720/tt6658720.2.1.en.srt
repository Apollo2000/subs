1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,513
Right. What you having?
Hey, hey, hey! Come on.

2
00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:06,895
Mammy'll make you some eggs, then.
Have a bit more in there.

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:08,695
Can't we have the chocolate ones?

4
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:11,855
No, darling.
Not unless you don't want any teeth!

5
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:14,815
Do you know, my grandad, he didn't
have any teeth, darling?

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,375
And do you know what he looked like?

7
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,335
He looked like an old tortoise.
Like this.

8
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,655
Uhhhhh.

9
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:21,135
Now is this how you want to look?

10
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:22,695
Is that how you want to look?

11
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,786
It's not how you
want to look, is it?!

12
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:27,066
Right, who wants an egg? Hmm?

13
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:29,026
These are Mammy's favourite.

14
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:30,906
You don't want one?

15
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,466
I've made them all nice for you,
Rhods!

16
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,546
Come on.

17
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:36,666
Come on, come on, come on. Try it.

18
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,226
It's nice and cool. Here you go.

19
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:40,226
Oh, Rhodri will have it, look!
Arghhh.

20
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,826
Right let's see where Alys is, huh?

21
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:45,266
Alys! It is twenty past eight,
darling!

22
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,026
She'll be on the headphones. Oh,
she'll be hearing me in a minute.

23
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,346
You won't forget my things
from the art shop, Mam?

24
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:52,266
Glitter, felt... And blue card, yes.

25
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,546
Alys, do you know this
is not funny any more?

26
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:56,093
Morning, morning.

27
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,426
Hell, it was choppy last night.

28
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,746
Need to find myself
some digs on dry land, I do.

29
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:05,706
There's a spare room going above the
pub, isn't there? Oh, tell you what.

30
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,386
I miss Terry and his quiz team.

31
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:10,146
Why don't your start one yourself
then, huh? Fill his shoes.

32
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:12,186
...This is pretty,
did you do that today?

33
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,546
I'm not worthy. You all right?

34
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:14,786
Right. Alys!

35
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:19,564
Alys, come down now,
or you will go to school hungry!

36
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,266
Where is she? Tell her. Here you go,
sort yourself out, go on.

37
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,866
That girl. Honestly,
she's turning me into my mother.

38
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,786
What? Your mam was a MILF remember?
That's disgusting, Arthur. She was.

39
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:33,306
Right, then.
Alys, come on, then! Right.

40
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:34,626
Alys!

41
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,226
Give me a kiss. I love your hair
this morning, it's beautiful.

42
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,500
And you, my precious boy.

43
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,666
Special coat. Special coat.

44
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,866
Can we make pizzas tonight?

45
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:48,386
Pizza? You bet, my darling.

46
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,266
Because Mammy hasn't had breakfast.

47
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:55,177
Mammy's very thirsty,
and don't tell Arthur about this.

48
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,346
Bye, Mam.

49
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:03,426
It's a phase. It's a phase.

50
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,026
Oh, right. Yeah.

51
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,026
For a year and a half?

52
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,826
Right, I love you! Bye-bye!
Bye. Bye-bye, Mammy! Behave!

53
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:12,100
Bye-bye! Bye, Mammy. Bye!

54
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:15,626
Right, then, what have we got?
Cornflakes?

55
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:20,082
Ych a fi. Right, who wants
Choco Wheats? Me! Yeah?

56
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,587
Just keep going.

57
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:49,786
Got it.

58
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:52,786
Lewis. Court 4, 12 o'clock.
Who's the judge?

59
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,866
Oh, no!

60
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,506
No, call the list office.
You'll have to change that.

61
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:01,106
Well, you'll have to. Not Merrick,
Delyth. Anyone but Merrick.

62
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,827
There's cake in it for you!

63
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,689
You people make me sick.

64
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,586
Corran Energy still owe us
£32,000 in outstanding fees.

65
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,466
You need to talk to them. Mmm.

66
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:43,186
I know they're your friends, Tom,
but this is business.

67
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,666
Right. Who's the judge?

68
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,226
Still Merrick.

69
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:47,546
Oh, Delyth!

70
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:50,666
Faith, I want to talk to you about
this. Is this it? Yes.

71
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,226
The family stuff. Mm.

72
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:54,546
I thought we'd all agreed we were
going to move things

73
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,026
in a more commercial direction.

74
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,626
Tom? We are struggling, OK?

75
00:04:57,627 --> 00:05:00,386
Mm-hm. We can't depend
on waifs and strays.

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,751
Corran Energy paid up yet?

77
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:07,066
Right. I shall be sticking with
the waifs and strays, then.

78
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,306
Faith, come on!
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,426
Faith, for God's sake.
I'm, uh...

80
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,106
Oh, I love these!

81
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:17,562
I'm going to court.
I'll see you later!

82
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:29,380
Am I the only one
trying to run a business here?

83
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:31,986
No.

84
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,624
Thank you, Delyth.

Night-night.

113
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,107
Bastard.

114
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:44,707
Bastard.

115
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:48,347
You coward.

116
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,826
I had a gun...

117
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:51,986
I had a gun...

118
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:55,786
I had a fucking gun
pulled on me tonight.

119
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:59,466
And Alys, she saw everything,
and it's because of you.

120
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,106
It's because of you.

121
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,026
You're a bastard.

122
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,667
They abducted her.

123
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,786
No.

124
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,466
They took our little girl.

125
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,226
They took her,

126
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:15,067
and they had a fucking gun.

127
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:20,266
What are you going to to tell her,
huh? What are you going to tell her?

128
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,866
You think that she's going to get
over something like this?

129
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,506
Do you think that?

130
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:27,826
You've scarred her,
you piece of shit.

131
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,066
You've scarred our little girl.

132
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,867
Forever.

133
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,946
You've fucking broke me!

134
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,907
You've broke me!

135
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:42,380
What kind of man does that?
What kind of a man?!

136
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,746
Get out of my house.

137
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,867
You coward.

138
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:54,426
I love those kids.
I love them.

139
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:56,427
Get out!

140
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,426
I know what you've done.

141
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,387
I know everything.

142
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,387
DCI Parry.

143
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,787
Morgan.

144
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,267
The Glynns.

145
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,907
Your affair.

146
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,707
You can't hurt me any more, Evan.

147
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,226
I fucking hate you.

148
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:57,591
Faith. I fucking hate you.

149
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,147
Hi, Cath.

150
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,227
OK?

151
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,626
Did you get Megan's letter?

152
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:35,787
Yeah.

153
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,180
And her picture. Did you?

154
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,798
She's very good. Mm-hm.

155
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,186
She doesn't get that from me.

156
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,642
No, she doesn't.

157
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:53,787
No.

158
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,187
How's Rhodri?

159
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,667
He's growing.

160
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:13,391
Half term next week, um...

161
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,257
...week after next...

162
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:21,986
...I'll bring them in.
No, Faith...

163
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:24,260
They want to, Evan, so...

164
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,867
Thank you.

165
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,431
You're welcome.

166
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,118
I miss you all so much.

167
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:45,346
Although I, er, don't miss all
the phone calls from my mother.

168
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,627
Mmm.

169
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:50,826
Do you still go to the gym?

170
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,666
Oh, when I can.

171
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,906
Work?

172
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,667
So-so, you know?

173
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,626
But you're managing OK?

174
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah, same as usual, really.
Well, more or less.

175
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,346
What's the matter, Faith?

176
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:10,257
Nothing's the matter, Evan.
What's the matter with you?

177
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,546
You don't have to be...
Just be quiet.

178
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:21,820
Just please...

179
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,387
Just be quiet.

180
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,666
How's Alys?

181
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,147
Halfway to Goth.

182
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,186
And you know that thing
that your mother does,

183
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:44,746
when she turns away,
and she pretends she can't hear you?

184
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:49,475
Yeah. She's got your genes,
Evan Howells, your genes.

185
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,747
Job for you.

186
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:58,020
Something for you
to look forward to.

187
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:11,346
Right.

188
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:13,227
No.

189
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:31,106
Gayle.

190
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,471
Yes, I've got the package.

191
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,506
No need to shout.

192
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,871
I'll drop it off tonight.
I'm at work.

193
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,507
Anya! Cerys.

194
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:06,066
How's business?

195
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:09,306
Well, Howells of Abercorran is never
going to make me a millionaire,

196
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:10,946
so let's talk about this.

197
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:14,706
Client owns a hotel on the coast,
wants to treble it in size,

198
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,066
and turn it into a spa resort.

199
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,786
Am I speaking with you now,
or the firm?

200
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,266
Strictly personal. Just you and me.

201
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,866
How much are they looking for?
Three-point-two.

202
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,626
I'd need a cast-iron business case

203
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,706
to sell a loan that size to
Head Office.

204
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,617
Trust me. I wrote it.

205
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,186
These profit projections...

206
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,786
Blue tab. I've explained
everything to the last penny.

207
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:36,626
Our fee comes from the architect
and project management lines.

208
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:38,827
25k. Each.

209
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:41,962
Lunch is on you.

210
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:48,584
Yes, Marion,
of course I'm happy to talk.

211
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,546
Yes, well, maybe on the weekend.

212
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:54,266
But, in all honestly, I'm not
looking to sell the house.

213
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:55,507
No.

214
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:01,973
OK, well, speak later.
I have to go now.

215
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,666
Yep. OK, we'll try to get them.
I'll call you back.

216
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,786
What's happening? Stay behind
the line, please. What's happened?

217
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,746
I need you to stay back.
Have you made an arrest?

218
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,946
No arrest has been made.
I represent this family...

219
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,826
Madlen, please.
This is not the time.

220
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,066
Susan?

221
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,707
What's going on?

222
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,107
A body.

223
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,307
Male.

224
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,667
Oh, God. Not Will Vaughan, is it?

225
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,547
Drowned?

226
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:47,035
Well, what?
We're not sure yet.

227
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,267
Sus...

228
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,146
Sorry, sir, this is a crime scene...
I just need to confirm one thing.

229
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,706
The body, possible client of mine.

230
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:03,798
I'm the local solicitor,
as you probably know.

231
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:10,226
Delyth, please, please tell me
that we've got a different judge.

232
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,587
Please...

233
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,586
Madlen?

234
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,826
Oh, Madlen From Ty Melin?

235
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:22,227
Oh!

236
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:27,786
Will Vaughan?

237
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:32,466
Oh, for God's sake. In Abercorran?
He's been murdered?

238
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,986
Yeah, of course.

239
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,066
Murder?!

240
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,747
Aaahh!

241
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,546
Susan.

242
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,747
Mrs Howells.

243
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,246
I'm here for Madlen.

244
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:04,311
Would you like to come through?
Mm-hm.

245
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,307
Is she OK?

246
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,387
Hey!

247
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:25,146
William Vaughan,
shot in the chest!

248
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:27,466
I'm afraid this
is all we have at present.

249
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,946
Shot?
There must be some sort of mistake.

250
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,946
I mean, I know, Madlen. Our children
are in the same year, this is...

251
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:35,706
She is the last person who would
do something like this, it's...

252
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,946
So often the way. Uh, Mrs Howells?
Detective Inspector Breeze.

253
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,346
Swansea CID.

254
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,506
Though, technically, on secondment
from Scotland Yard.

255
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:45,707
We've met.

256
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,426
Still here?

257
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:53,706
London too peaceful for you?
You can have ten minutes.

258
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:54,787
Thank you.

259
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:00,049
Madlen? What's happened?

260
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,266
I need to tell Dyfan, he'll be
home from school soon. OK.

261
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:08,306
All right. What about his
Auntie Hannah?

262
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,346
Yeah, can you phone her? Yeah.

263
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,667
Um...

264
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,626
He's got swimming this afternoon.

265
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,946
OK, I can call her.
Oh, God...

266
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:19,946
OK, come here. Come here.
It's all right.

267
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,906
All right. Listen, you're going
to have to tell me what's happened.

268
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:27,187
They can't charge you
without evidence.

269
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,386
They have to have something concrete
to link you

270
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:32,666
to what happened to Will.

271
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:37,577
Do you understand that?
Do you understand that, Madlen?

272
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,827
Is there anything I need to know?

273
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:48,806
You have to tell me.

274
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:54,026
Right. I will make sure
that Dyfan is fine.

275
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:57,266
And, I will be back first thing.

276
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,147
What's going on?

277
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,344
Who would do this?

278
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,191
We'll find out.

279
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:07,986
Do you think Dyfan's safe?

280
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,147
Yes.

281
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,106
Yes.

282
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:31,386
I understand he was having
a lot of financial trouble.

283
00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:33,307
Maybe he owed people?

284
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:42,226
I hope that what happened between us
in the past is all forgotten now...

285
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,955
We've both had a price to pay.

286
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,826
Hi. Uh, it's fine, I'm here.

287
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,266
I'll wait for him.

288
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,347
Yeah.

289
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,066
OK.

290
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,467
Bye, Hannah.

291
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,187
Dyfan? Hey, Dyfan.

292
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:30,706
Hey.

293
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:33,426
Hi! Hi, Dyfan.

294
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:36,386
Um... Hiya.

295
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:39,206
I'm Megan's mum, Megan Howells.

296
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:43,666
Your auntie, she's...
She's coming in a minute.

297
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,146
I need you to just,
just to wait with me.

298
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,546
Where's Mam? Your mam...

299
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,306
She's... She's in the town,
and she's helping the police.,

300
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,826
and I'm helping her, so just come
and wait with me in the car...

301
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:55,386
OK, good boy. No, no!

302
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:56,546
Dyfan!

303
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,746
Shit!

304
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:58,986
Dyfan!

305
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:03,351
Hey. Hey, what are you...?
No, you can't come...!

306
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,507
Faith? Yeah?

307
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:32,466
I've just had Saran James in...

308
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:35,386
...sounding off at me
about a blackmail threat.

309
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:37,586
She says you're representing
Gael Reardon.

310
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:39,626
Oh, look,
the line is really bad, Tom.

311
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,986
I'm going to have to phone
you later. OK? Bye-bye.

312
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,067
Faith?

313
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:45,467
Faith?!

314
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:50,667
Gael.

315
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,786
The package is on your desk.

316
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,424
That's it. I'm done. I'm out.

317
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,346
Not till I say.

318
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,986
When Evan and the others
went to trial

319
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,666
it was me who made sure that the
police stayed away from you, Gael.

320
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,346
That was nearly 18 months ago.
I think we're pretty square now.

321
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,227
Well, 120 grand.

322
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,986
That's a big debt.

323
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:14,786
You know, just running a few errands
doesn't begin to cover it.

324
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:16,226
What is it you want?

325
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:18,500
What's your endgame here?

326
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:24,746
I understand that, um,
your firm acts for Corran Energy?

327
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:25,786
Yes.

328
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:27,515
They're in trouble.

329
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:33,369
Now you get me the right deal,
and... we'll call it quits.

330
00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:38,426
They employ a lot of people
round here with families.

331
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:41,467
So... help me save them.

332
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:26,387
That morning I...
I wasn't thinking straight.

333
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:31,146
DCI Parry phoned before... before
you woke up.

334
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:33,586
I know all this, Evan.
He's told me everything.

335
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:36,133
He was coming to arrest you.

336
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:40,866
You have no idea, Evan.

337
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:44,546
The woman you left is not the woman
sitting in front of you now.

338
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:46,387
Mark my words.

339
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:50,186
And I've dealt with Parry.
So, carry on.

340
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:51,306
Dealt with him how?

341
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,706
I'm asking the fucking
questions here!

342
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:54,947
Me!

343
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,187
I jumped.

344
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,586
Off the harbour wall in Port Talbot.

345
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:02,026
And I swam out.

346
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,755
I wanted the sea to take me...

347
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:08,038
...but the tide washed me back in.

348
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,587
You left us.

349
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:24,226
I remember getting on a train
and then there's...

350
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,546
...blank.

351
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:26,867
Days of it.

352
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,715
I remember wandering at night.

353
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:39,666
And I remember a hospital
waiting room,

354
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,507
and it being warm.

355
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,260
And I heard Alys's voice.

356
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:51,398
It was a video on someone's phone.

357
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,747
I love you, Faith.

358
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:58,266
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,426
You're sorry? You and Steve Baldini.

360
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,946
You were in his arms. Well, he's
been looking out for us, Evan.

361
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,026
He's the only one
who has done that, actually,

362
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,746
because he thinks and he cares.

363
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,626
And he knows what it means to care.

364
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:12,991
Are you and him...?
Is that what you think of me?

365
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,791
You go and get your stuff.

366
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,547
My God!

367
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,907
You jumped?

368
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:29,824
You wanted to drown yourself.

369
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,426
You tell me why you took
the money from the Glynns.

370
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,706
We needed it. The company needed it.
It was going under.

371
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:40,506
But you didn't tell me any of this.
I tried to. No, you didn't.

372
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:41,706
You wouldn't listen.

373
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:44,026
Do you know what this is?
This is about bastard pride.

374
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,746
That's what this is about.

375
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:49,566
I faced reality, Faith,
and you avoided it.

376
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,787
Alys?

377
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,426
Alys, why aren't you at home?

378
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:15,747
Alys?!

379
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,426
Arthur know where you are?

380
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:20,506
Ah, you haven't told him.

381
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:23,235
I see. This is great. Why not?

382
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,786
Who's this?

383
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:27,346
Hiya, we haven't met.

384
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,826
Angie.

385
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,106
Angie. Hi, Angie.

386
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:32,426
Your parents,
any idea where you are?

387
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:35,386
There's my dad. Sorry, can't hear
you. What? There's my dad now.

388
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,747
Your dad? Good.

389
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:57,318
I don't think it was meant
to happen like this. No.

390
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,546
Faith.

391
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:02,227
Steve.

392
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,147
Been a while.

393
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,387
Mm-hm.

394
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,107
You OK?

395
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:25,926
Oh, Faith, look after yourself.

396
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,706
Angie.

397
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,227

Tenby. Ohh.

415
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,911
Her mam's just had a baby.

416
00:31:50,227 --> 00:31:53,386
She couldn't stand it
so came to live with her dad.

417
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:54,507
Oh, dear.

418
00:31:58,267 --> 00:31:59,866
She knows about us, Mam.

419
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,746
What do you mean, "Knows about us"?

420
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,546
How Dad... was a drug dealer.

421
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,266
Daddy's not a drug dealer, Alys.

422
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,226
He made a mistake.

423
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,987
I've told you this.

424
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:12,906
Some people let him down.

425
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:14,826
Your dad would never hurt anybody.

426
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:17,106
It was just a business thing. Yeah.

427
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,471
And Steve's just a friend?

428
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:23,866
Exactly.

429
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,066
Sorry I'm late.

430
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:27,586
Oh, hello. Hi.

431
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:30,587
You were too late to make pizzas.

432
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,866
Sorry, darling.

433
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,786
Mammy's sorry, OK?

434
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,986
Er... tomorrow, I promise.

435
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,067
OK?

436
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:43,126
Is it true, Dyfan's dad's dead?

437
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,746
Who told you that, darling?

438
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,838
I heard Gwen's mam say.

439
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,947
Well, um...

440
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:58,366
It's very, very sad.

441
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:04,866
And we're going
to look out for Dyfan.

442
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:07,595
That's what we're going to do.

443
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:09,547
OK?

444
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,147
Good girl.

445
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,026
I just popped in
to say hello to the kids.

446
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,386
Rhodri been eating chocolate again?
How many times, Tom?

447
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,666
It's not going to
spoil his appetite, is it? Look.

448
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,106
I did tell him, babes.

449
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:24,266
Forgot about Alys, did you? Nope.

450
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,866
She was by the swings.

451
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:28,186
My phone tracks her
to the last yard.

452
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:31,986
See, everything is under control!
Look at us, it's a team effort!

453
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:35,987
Did you get my things
from the art shop, Mam?

454
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,867
I've had the most fantastic idea.

455
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:50,026
This is, uh, thank you very much.

456
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,187
This...

457
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,147
Shells.

458
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:57,426
You've got a big bag of them,
haven't you?

459
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:59,786
We could cut up an old box,

460
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,426
paint it,

461
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:03,106
make a collage.

462
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,826
Eco-friendly,
and won't cost a penny.

463
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,787
OK. OK!

464
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,986
Right. Alys, Meg, dinner's ready.
Come on.

465
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:13,107
Go on.

466
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:18,278
Go. Go and see what
delicious treats he's got.

467
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:23,544
Quick word, Faith?
I've got a table booked soon. OK.

468
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:30,267
Going anywhere nice?

469
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:36,307
Hmm? Gael Reardon.

470
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:45,946
She asked me to convey an offer.
That's all I did.

471
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:47,786
For a fee? For a fee.

472
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,697
You know the history there, Tom.

473
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:54,518
You blame Evan, not me.

474
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:58,346
You kept this quiet.

475
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:02,347
Something of a firm tradition
then, isn't it?

476
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,987
I'll get rid of her. You have to.

477
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:11,006
She wants to buy Corran Energy.

478
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,707
And, if I negotiate
the right price...

479
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:23,946
...she's prepared
to put an end to it.

480
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,546
And, seeing as we'll never
see that 32 grand again,

481
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:28,306
unless someone does takes them over,

482
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:32,035
I think it might be
in our best interests.

483
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,786
All right. All right.

484
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:37,606
I'm prepared to make soundings.

485
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:43,026
But you're not to defend
Madlen Vaughan. Oh!

486
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,546
You being serious? Yes.

487
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:45,866
Are you? I'm very serious.

488
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,706
Tom, that's a very serious face!

489
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:48,827
Stop it.

490
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:53,106
Really? Yeah.

491
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,626
Tom! Mm-hm.

492
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:57,107
This is a murder case.

493
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:00,626
And... are you being serious?

494
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:01,867
Absolutely.

495
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,586
For one of our oldest clients,
Tom, it's...

496
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,066
William Vaughan was our client,
Faith.

497
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,826
Yeah. If we defend his murderer,
we'll be shunned.

498
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:13,106
Alleged murderer.
We'll be shunned.

499
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:18,107
Innocent until proven guilty, Tom.
Do you remember that?

500
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,346
God, nobody knows what that poor
girl is going through more than me.

501
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,386
Nobody! Oh, come on, Faith.
You've never done a murder case.

502
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:30,386
Well, then let this be the first.

503
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:34,666
They've picked on the... Well, on
the easiest suspect, haven't they?

504
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,266
Oh, what?! And they've decided
that she's guilty,

505
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:40,026
and they're doing what they always
do... Listen to yourself!

506
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:42,386
They just go after the evidence
that fits their theory.

507
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:44,466
You're already too invested.
She's innocent.

508
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:46,466
You'd be a danger to her.

509
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,786
Well, that's harsh.

510
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:49,307
That's, um...

511
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:58,227
We'd all rather life were just...

512
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:02,147
Mm-hm.

513
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,471
Sorry about the chocolate.

514
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:16,266
Right then, sausages. Bye-bye.

515
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,986
And bye-bye to you.

516
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,586
Bye-bye. Right, bye, guys.

517
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:24,946
Babes, I've got to dash. All right?
Tom, he's giving me a lift.

518
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:28,706
OK. Love you. Love you. Bye, guys!
Bye, Rhods! Thank you.

519
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:32,435
Eat up please, Alys.
Stop playing with it.

520
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:35,186
Slipped her the invite
just before you got home.

521
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:37,460
Smooth as velvet, he was.

522
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:40,267
Yup.

523
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,786
Oh, dear God, no. Uh-huh.

524
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,267
Oh, no.

525
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,226
Oh, dear God, no.

526
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:58,986
And the five little monkeys
all came home together,

527
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:04,346
and they all snuggled up together
in their little monkey nest.

528
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:08,746
And one of the five
little monkeys had fluffed.

529
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:11,426
And they all went to sleep,

530
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:14,986
happily... ever... wafter.

531
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,986
What did you think?
Did you like that?

532
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:19,346
Maybe a seven.

533
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:22,146
A seven? Megan Howells,
it's at least an eight!

534
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:24,026
Come on, then.

535
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:26,027
Shall we go up to bed.

536
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:27,826
Megs?

537
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:31,107
I miss Daddy while he's in prison.

538
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:33,842
I know, darling.

539
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,667
And he misses you very much, too.

540
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:43,166
You've got your milk,
oop-a-pah.

541
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:54,146
Saran.

542
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:56,146
Tom said you came to the office.

543
00:38:56,147 --> 00:39:00,266
Uh, I just...
I just wanted to reassure that

544
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:04,746
your visit from Mrs Reardon had
nothing to do with me or my firm.

545
00:39:04,747 --> 00:39:07,566
And, in any event, I apologise.

546
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:12,146
You go on to the dentist.
I'll follow you there. OK.

547
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:14,586
As for the police, their
involvement won't be necessary.

548
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:18,769
Mrs Reardon won't be
troubling you any further.

549
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:25,722
This all goes back to Evan,
doesn't it?

550
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:31,466
Look, Faith, I've only
one thing to say to you,

551
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,427
as a friend...

552
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:36,586
...leave.

553
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,147
Do it.

554
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:42,387
Get out and find your own life...

555
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:45,224
...before you drown with him.

556
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:01,987
Hi.

557
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,947
Sorry. We've, um... had
some forensics back.

558
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,866
It's not looking good for her,
I'm afraid.

559
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,307
Er...

560
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:20,226
Look, Susan,
I may not be staying long.

561
00:40:20,227 --> 00:40:21,347
Um...

562
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,626
My partners, they think that
she may benefit

563
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:29,627
from lawyers more used
to this sort of stuff.

564
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:32,307
Oh, I see.

565
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:40,126
Well, if it helps, I suppose you'll
be looking for a guilty plea.

566
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,826
Your fingerprints were found
on the gun, the cabinet and the key.

567
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,386
I locked it in there.

568
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,626
When? When I fetched the Ranger
back from the field.

569
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:01,826
When I went down there, it was
on the grass, next to the trailer.

570
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,546
You didn't mention this yesterday.
Did you pick it up, Madlen?

571
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,266
I took it back to the house
in the Ranger.

572
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,906
And you just left
the trailer in the field?

573
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:12,826
The ground was wet.
The wheels were spinning.

574
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,946
Let's talk about the arguments,
Mrs Vaughan. Were they about money?

575
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:18,306
I tried to keep things nice
for Dyfan.

576
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:22,626
But... But Will, he'd snap a bit,
and go into himself.

577
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,106
Great, we'll get Dyfan in.
Get him to verify it.

578
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,306
Dyfan? It's got nothing to do
with him. I'll go with them.

579
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:33,944
He's a potential defence witness.
I've every right to be there.

580
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,106
Faith? Yes.

581
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:37,786
I've contacted a firm in Cardiff.

582
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,546
They're sending someone to see
Madlen Vaughan this afternoon.

583
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:43,986
Now, you have told her
you're withdrawing, haven't you?

584
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:46,715
Look, I'll phone you back, OK?

585
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,786
To be clear, I'm allowing
you to observe, Mrs Howells,

586
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,333
not to intervene.

587
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:03,386
Hi, Dyfan.

588
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,186
Mammy sends her love.

589
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:07,460
You'll see her very soon.

590
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:12,146
Now, she wants you
to answer this man's questions

591
00:42:12,147 --> 00:42:15,146
as best as you can, all right?

592
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:17,066
But only tell him
what you can remember.

593
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,426
I'll be right here.

594
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:21,700
That's enough, thank you.
Right here.

595
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:41,146
Hello, Dyfan.

596
00:42:41,147 --> 00:42:44,875
My name's Laurence.
It's nice to meet you.

597
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:50,986
Corran Energy owes
Howells Abercorran £32,000.

598
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,586
We're going to have to call it in.

599
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,066
We may need a little longer.

600
00:42:55,067 --> 00:43:00,826
We've been approached by a party
interested in buying the business.

601
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:03,464
They've asked for your price.

602
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,146
So, what happened
when you couldn't find your dad?

603
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,602
Mam kept calling,
but he didn't answer.

604
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:35,769
Did you see your mum pick up a gun?

605
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,306
What did she do with it?

606
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:45,066
Put it in the Ranger.

607
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:46,627
Oh, the Ranger?

608
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:50,362
Was it this one?

609
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:53,426
I think he's had enough for one day.

610
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:55,346
Yeah, and I've nearly finished.

611
00:43:55,347 --> 00:44:00,802
How far away from the river
was the Ranger when you found it?

612
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:03,431
Was it near or was it far?

613
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:05,346
Dyfan?

614
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,106
85 steps.

615
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:11,107
Dyfan likes to count things,
don't you, love?

616
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:14,866
So you went down to the river?

617
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:17,066
Mam, she called me back.

618
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:20,158
Did your mum go down to the river?

619
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:29,226
Why didn't you go down to the river,
Mrs Vaughan?

620
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:35,409
Why didn't you go down to the river?
Take your time, Madlen. It's OK.

621
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:37,307
I was scared.

622
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,337
What were you scared of, Madlen?

623
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,911
That I'd find him
hanging from a tree.

624
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:50,626
Madlen Vaughan, I am charging you
with the murder of your husband,

625
00:44:50,627 --> 00:44:53,626
William Andras Vaughan. You can't
charge her. You cannot charge her!

626
00:44:53,627 --> 00:44:56,386
This interview is terminated
at 16.08... You've no evidence!

627
00:44:56,387 --> 00:44:59,346
Listen to me! We'll see you
in court tomorrow morning.

628
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:03,075
That's enough, Mrs Howells.
No! Calm down!

629
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,195
You're all... You're bastards!

630
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:13,726
What is wrong with you people?!

631
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:19,718
What is wrong with you?

632
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:27,067
I'm sorry.

633
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:31,066
No, I'm not the police.
I'm a defence lawyer,

634
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:33,266
defending a murder case,
and I require access

635
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,146
to your network's location data.

636
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:37,238
Yeah, well, can you...?

637
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:39,226
Thank you.

638
00:45:39,227 --> 00:45:40,946
Can you give me the number, please?

639
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,986
OK, just a second,
I'm going to write this down.

640
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:45,426
As in...

641
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:47,946
Yeah, just a little bit slower
this time.

642
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:49,186
OK.

643
00:45:49,187 --> 00:45:51,426
Yeah, that's great, thank you.
That's a great help.

644
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,246
Thank you very much.

645
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:56,106
Faith, you promised.
We had an agreement.

646
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:57,946
Yeah, well, she's innocent, Tom.

647
00:45:57,947 --> 00:46:00,186
Well, at least I've kept
my side of the bargain.

648
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:02,866
I got a figure out of Corran Energy.

649
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:05,686
Are you going to tell me? Yeah.

650
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,386
You've got to step away, Faith.

651
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,066
She trusts me, Cerys.

652
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,186
Look, Faith.
You've got three children,

653
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:25,146
you've got a mortgage to pay

654
00:46:25,147 --> 00:46:26,626
and a husband in prison.

655
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:28,626
She's innocent.

656
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:31,446
She's innocent. Christ's sakes!

657
00:46:32,827 --> 00:46:34,147
Wake up!

658
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:41,780
We're meant to be a team.

659
00:46:42,307 --> 00:46:46,762
Partners building a business,
making decent money.

660
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,017
What happened, Faith?

661
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:01,780
I feel like
we've lost you somewhere.

662
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:42,386
71, 72, 73, 74,

663
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:45,906
75, 76, 77, 78,

664
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:47,786
79, 80,

665
00:47:47,787 --> 00:47:51,426
81, 82, 83, 84,

666
00:47:51,427 --> 00:47:54,587
85, 86.

667
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:29,266
Gael.

668
00:48:29,267 --> 00:48:31,346
I've got a figure from Corran.
It's six.

669
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:33,386
Six mil.

670
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:36,586
Tell them it's not
even in the right ballpark, Faith.

671
00:48:36,587 --> 00:48:40,027
Yeah, they'll be lucky to get two.

672
00:48:45,347 --> 00:48:46,586
Hi, mam!

673
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:48,466
Hello! I smell pizza!

674
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,066
Oh, Mam's here! Sorry about
the mess. Weren't expecting you.

675
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,067
Hiya! Hello!

676
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:56,706
Hey, don't mind me, Babes.

677
00:48:56,707 --> 00:49:00,026
I'm just here for the freebies,
isn't that right?

678
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:01,506
Get that inside of you.

679
00:49:01,507 --> 00:49:02,666
Thank you!

680
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:05,667
And I need a word with you later.

681
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:09,866
More importantly...

682
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:12,626
...what did Miss Gwynn
think of your collage?

683
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:14,746
Oh, she only put it
up on the wall, Mam!

684
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:17,546
She didn't put it on the wall? She
put it on the wall, I'm telling you!

685
00:49:17,547 --> 00:49:20,066
She put your collage on the wall?!
You're brilliant, you are!

686
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:22,186
You're absolutely brilliant,
do you know that?!

687
00:49:22,187 --> 00:49:24,546
Right. Let Mammy have a go at this.
This looks fun.

688
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,026
Can I have a go?
Oh, come on, then.

689
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:28,026
Let's see what
you're made of. There we are.

690
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:29,946
Oh, no, no.
She's going to be rubbish at that.

691
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:32,666
What do you mean, I'm going to be
rubbish?! We haven't got a dog, Lis.

692
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,786
What? That's a dog's pizza,
isn't it? Garlic bread!

693
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:36,866
That's my spicy surprise.
It's a spicy something.

694
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,777
I don't think
you've got enough balls on it.

695
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:43,306
Sorry, it's the best we can do.
Sorry.

696
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,946
When can I see my son?

697
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:46,826
Oh, we'll see what happens in court.

698
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:48,266
Can't I phone him?

699
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,306
Well, it's not permitted.

700
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:51,667
Please.

701
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:54,746
Right.

702
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,546
Five minutes. Speak quietly.

703
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:58,866
Thanks.

704
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:01,066
Mrs Howells, she's a good lawyer,
isn't she?

705
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:02,226
Yeah, yeah, she is.

706
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:04,046
Yeah, I'll tell him.

707
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,307
No Tom tonight?

708
00:50:11,547 --> 00:50:13,066
It was just a meal.

709
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:16,706
And a little bit of footsie
and back to the boat?

710
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:18,986
Babe! He's old enough to be my dad.

711
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:20,426
Now stop it.

712
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,106
Wouldn't be the first time.

713
00:50:22,107 --> 00:50:24,546
Who?! Well, it wouldn't
be the first time, would it?

714
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:27,706
Do you remember... Oh, Edwin?

715
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,226
Oh! "Hello, my name is Edwin.

716
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,666
"Nice to meet you. This is my dog."

717
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,546
Please, stop! Why did he take
his dog everywhere with him?

718
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:38,546
Don't talk about Edwin!
It's embarrassing. I was drunk,

719
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:40,946
and I was... I was really,
really desperate.

720
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:45,129
You were thinking
"Oh, I'm hungry" at the time.

721
00:50:45,227 --> 00:50:48,506
Can I have some of that please?
Mm. I'm not... Oh!

722
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:50,946
Right, careful now. Oh...!
Oh, oh, nice.

723
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,766
It's a nice one this, isn't it?

724
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:08,346
Talking about being desperate.

725
00:51:08,347 --> 00:51:11,586
You're not really going to wait for
him, are you? I mean, seriously?

726
00:51:11,587 --> 00:51:13,266
Two years?

727
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:15,986
Look at you babe,
you're in your prime.

728
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:18,026
They'd be queuing round
the block for you.

729
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:21,826
Lisa, stop it. Well, they would!
Please, Lis.

730
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:23,918
It doesn't interest me.

731
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:27,106
Right, enjoy.

732
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:29,107
Won't be long. OK.

733
00:52:11,747 --> 00:52:14,475
I should never have come home.

734
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:17,506
I should have gone
straight to the police.

735
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:21,053
Then both us
of would have got arrested.

736
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:41,155
Steve Baldini shifted the drugs
you ordered from Gael Reardon...

737
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:45,438
...to pay off the Glynns
and the firm's debts.

738
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:52,266
I made a deal with Parry, which just
leaves Gael Reardon out of the deal.

739
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:53,467
I'll sort it.

740
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:01,409
What did you expect me to do, Evan?

741
00:53:03,507 --> 00:53:06,780
See us all turfed out on the street?

742
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:15,758
Now I've just dug you out of
a very, very, very big hole.

743
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:20,126
Now you need to decide
what you want to do.

744
00:53:20,187 --> 00:53:22,666
You have three children upstairs.

745
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,467
Alys...

746
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,027
...Megan...

747
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,107
...and Rhodri.

748
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:37,784
I want to look after you all.

749
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,787
I want to start again.

750
00:53:46,027 --> 00:53:50,209
I want to show you who I am.
Who are you, then?

751
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:53,507
Who are you?

752
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:59,773
We've established that
you're a really shit lawyer.

753
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,322
I just want us to be happy.

754
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,386
I've decided to hand
myself in to the police.

755
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:11,569
So, what's stopping you?

756
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:15,027
Look at me.

757
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:23,787
I'm still here.

758
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:28,506
And I am,
for the sake of our children,

759
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:31,780
for what's most precious to us,
Evan.

760
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:37,962
Will you forgive me, Faith?

761
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:42,026
It's morning.

762
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:44,066
I'll go make the packed lunches.

763
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:46,158
You make the breakfast.

764
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:51,180
Stop whimpering like a little child.

765
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,347
Wakey, wakey.

766
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:39,826
Ma'am, Mrs Vaughan is charged

767
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:42,066
with the murder of her husband,
William Vaughan.

768
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:45,026
We ask that the matter's transferred
directly to the Crown Court.

769
00:55:45,027 --> 00:55:48,846
We don't envisage
any application for bail.

770
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,146
Ma'am, I appear
on behalf of Mrs Vaughan.

771
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:55,506
While we make no application
for bail this morning,

772
00:55:55,507 --> 00:55:58,066
we will certainly do so if the Crown
proceeds in anything less

773
00:55:58,067 --> 00:55:59,826
than a timely fashion.

774
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:02,226
Mrs Vaughan is a single mother

775
00:56:02,227 --> 00:56:04,866
and now the sole proprietor
of a farm.

776
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:07,867
Faith, why aren't you helping me?

777
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:10,907
Faith, please!

778
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:16,906
The evidence against her
is circumstantial at best.

779
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:22,180
Justice will not be served by a long
period awaiting trial.

Mr Howells, I give you credit
for offering yourself

796
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:37,060
as a police informant and for giving
evidence for the Crown in this case.

797
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:39,860
Nevertheless, you've committed
a serious offence

798
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:44,225
and abused your position
of trust as a solicitor.

799
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,740
For the offence of
converting criminal property,

800
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:53,020
namely the sum of £250,000
acquired on

801
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:58,140
behalf of Mr Dewi Glynn, you will go

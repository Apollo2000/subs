1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,380
I've lost Evan.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,980
Step outside
for a minute, Mrs Howells.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,100
My children. They've taken my
children away.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,860
They, they need me.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,200
Mr Baldini. To what do we owe the
pleasure?

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,220
3kg of best Colombian.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,700
120,000, bank transfer is fine.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,600
We trusted him. Evan did the deal
between us.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,140
That's Alpay's car. We've got to go.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,220
No, we can't just leave.
We can't go.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,240
She's dead, she's dead.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,620
We should have done something.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,600
Williams will have called for help,
what could we have done?

14
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,880
Alpay said she was working
for the Glynns, right?

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,420
Did she mention the money they
wanted from Evan?

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,220
Didn't get a chance.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,800
Some idiot scared her away.

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,040
Is that your phone?

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,080
New phone, is it?

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,440
Dealing again, are you?

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,520
Great.

22
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,860
It's just for keeping in touch,
that's all. Right.

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,500
Just the old crowd from the band.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm ecstatic.

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,260
Hello?
Yeah, you want to fry your brains.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,560
Go somewhere else. Arthur's out of
business. Piss off!

27
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,560
You happy now?

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,580
Huh? Give me the phone?
Give me the fucking phone.

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,820
Who's this then?
"Are you still with her?"

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,280
It's not what you think.
"Are you still with her?"

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,060
Sorry. You tell me now.
Sorry. No, you know something.

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,760
Tell me now. Sorry.

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,060
That's Alpay's car! We've got to go.

34
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
No, we can't just leave.

35
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,880
We can't go. She's dead.
She's dead.

36
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,360
Bastard.

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,080
Bastard.

38
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,780
Yes, who is it? Faith Howells.

39
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm closed, Mrs Howells.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,320
I need to speak to your guest.
He's not in.

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,300
Mrs Howells, please.
It's late. Where is he?

42
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,020
Well, he isn't back yet. Arthur? You
Little shit, where are you?

43
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,340
Where are you, you shit!

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,300
Right, I'm just going to go through
your stuff.

45
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
That's it. What an earth do you
think you're doing?

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Giving you something to gossip
about, Eira.

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,080
This should keep you going
for months.

48
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,860
It's 4am, Mrs Howells.

49
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,200
Must be serious. I have no money.

50
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,020
Nothing, zero.
Evan and I had a deal.

51
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,900
120,000 bank transfer is fine.

52
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,520
Your problem. The deal is a deal.

53
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,420
Why do a deal with the man

54
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,960
who helped your husband's
killer walk free?

55
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,120
Evan is an interesting
and complicated man.

56
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,080
What?

57
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,280
You really didn't get him, did you?

58
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,200
Bitch.

59
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,880
Eight and a half dead.

60
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,620
Business is good, is it? Oh, yeah.

61
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,400
Never better.

62
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,080
Spot-on.

63
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,800
Same time next week.

64
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,200
I can't stop thinking about
the children.

65
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,100
Sleeping in strange beds.

66
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,300
At least we know they're safe.

67
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,600
I've tried to give Faith the
benefit of the doubt but...

68
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,580
..truth is, we never knew her
family, where she came from.

69
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,520
I seem to remember you welcoming her
with open arms.

70
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,880
Evan was so infatuated.

71
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,280
I tried to like her.

72
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Maybe that was my mistake.

73
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,620
Price?

74
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,020
I've got a RTC, one fatality
on Gwern Ganol Road.

75
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,380
I'm under the bridge. Oh...

76
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll get round there soon as I can.

77
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,000
Morning.

78
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,200
You're up early.

79
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,880
A house doesn't run itself.

80
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,200
Is that new?

81
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,880
What do you care? You can't even
boil an egg.

82
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,860
Do you think maybe you should just
stay home today?

83
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,560
I am up to my eyes, Terry.

84
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,360
You're up at six baking...

85
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,200
..taking pills and...

86
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,200
..stealing things, which isn't
normal, you know?

87
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,340
You should arrest me...

88
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,000
..Mr Policeman.

89
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,600
Ma'am.

90
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,780
Have we got an ID
on the deceased yet?

91
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,580
Apparently so. So, what have we got?

92
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,620
Um, there are two sets of skid
marks.

93
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,960
So, there must have been two
vehicles and...

94
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,800
..I suppose the other driver must
have left the scene.

95
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,080
What's that?

96
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,080
An earring?

97
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,840
Nice work, Price.
Stick it in a bag.

98
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,720
See to clear up.

99
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,780
Mrs Foster? Yes, it's Faith Howells.

100
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,380
Megan's got a swimming test
this afternoon at four o'clock.

101
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,080
Thing is, she needs to wear her
verruca sock.

102
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,820
Well, you'll just have to
cos it's really important to her.

103
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,040
Please do, thank you very much.

104
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,340
Your friend has left without
paying his bill.

105
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,580
No friend of mine.
Well, you can give me his details

106
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,100
because I'm informing the police.

107
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,200
Try the local off-licence.
Bye-bye.

108
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,880
Hello?

109
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,440
Hello?

110
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,840
Who's this?

111
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,200
What was going on between Faith
Howells and the dentist, Dr Alpay?

112
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,600
She died.

113
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,040
Horribly, last night.

114
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,280
Faith Howells,
is she really worth it?

115
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,560
If that's how you want it.

116
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,140
Mrs Howells' children have been in
foster care for a night now.

117
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,620
No, no, that's great, thank you.

118
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,620
Sorted. Got us in front of
Judge Daniels at four.

119
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,920
Today? Yes. Today. God.

120
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,080
Are you saying I'll get my kids back
today? Yeah.

121
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,880
Listen...

122
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,820
..what are our chances? We'll get
them back, Faith,

123
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,640
but we've got to deal with his
Williams crap first. Yeah.

124
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,700
Here. Here's the footage.

125
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,860
This is dynamite, Faith.
But it cannot come from you.

126
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,500
It places you at the scene of
a crime. OK, not good.

127
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,220
We've got to drop this bomb without
collateral damage.

128
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,180
You look great, by the way. Thanks.

129
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,220
I feel shit.

130
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,300
Was that your first
visit to the dentist? Yes.

131
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,420
What did you do, just pick her
out of the phone book?

132
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,740
Internet. And, two days later,
she's dead.

133
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,020
Nine miles up the road. It's an odd
place to be of an evening.

134
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,300
Halfway up a mountain, all by
herself. I agree.

135
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,340
Where were you yesterday evening,
Mrs Howells?

136
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,260
Working the office. Arthur Davies
was with me, he helps out sometimes.

137
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,800
He's rather good actually, isn't he?
Where is he now? Well, you tell me.

138
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,620
And after you'd finished at the
office, did you drive out

139
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
on the Gwern Ganol Road?

140
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,240
Are you asking if I was involved
with Dr Alpay's death?

141
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,460
I wasn't. But I would be fascinated
to know what you think

142
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,180
I might have done.

143
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,000
Tampered with the brakes maybe.

144
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,380
Your friend, Steve Baldini,
was in here last night.

145
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,720
He lost his temper.

146
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,120
He's very protective of you.

147
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
He's up in court this morning,
criminal damage.

148
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,780
He'll do time. No more weekends
with his daughter

149
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,260
and I've a feeling there's something
he might tell me.

150
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,580
My client has nothing to say
about... I'm sure it was fun

151
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,440
while it lasted. Is that it?

152
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,580
No more. Great.

153
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,320
On the bright side, I hear
your kids are settling in. OK.

154
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,680
All right.

155
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,160
Faith.

156
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Faith. Bitch!

157
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,780
You're all right.

158
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,400
OK?

159
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,180
Right, where you going now?

160
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm going to help Steve get bail.
The children's hearing is at four.

161
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,380
I know, I'm not going to miss it,
am I?

162
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,260
I've got to do something, I've got
to do something! I'll be fine.

163
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,280
Jesus! Steve Baldini can
look after himself!

164
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,260
The crown objects to bail, ma'am.

165
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,540
Mr Baldini's extensive record

166
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,620
demonstrates a serious risk of
re-offending.

167
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,620
He's breached bail conditions many
times in the past and there's no

168
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,740
reason to believe this occasion
would be any different, ma'am.

169
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,220
There are times to give the benefit
of the doubt

170
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,900
but this isn't one of them.
He is a serious offender

171
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,600
who's failed to demonstrate
any ability to reform his character.

172
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,100
I represent Mr Baldini.

173
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,800
May we have a moment? Please.

174
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,120
Be quick Mrs Howells. Thank you.

175
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,900
Alpay's dead.
Arthur's been spying on me.

176
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,660
I think Williams put him up to it.

177
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,240
We really must get on.
Just smile for me.

178
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,620
If it helps, we're minded to remand
him in custody before trial.

179
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,980
I think there's been some terrible
misunderstanding here, ma'am.

180
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Mr Baldini was doing his best to
assist police

181
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,180
when this alleged offence occurred.
He's Italian. You see, he's Italian.

182
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,020
You know what they're like when
they're talking with their hands,

183
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,720
when they're talking.
It was just an accident, ma'am.

184
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,940
He has a long history of previous
offences, Mrs Howells.

185
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,140
Including supplying a Class A
substance to minors.

186
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,860
I struggle to see him as a suitable
candidate for bail.

187
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,440
Ma'am, I think that...

188
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,920
I think that...

189
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,720
I think we all make mistakes.

190
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,740
Some small.

191
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,500
Some big.

192
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,660
And shouldn't we recognise
a person's attempts to do good?

193
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,320
Shouldn't we?

194
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,040
Frankly, I know
Mr Baldini personally.

195
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,640
He has done more to help me try to
find my missing husband than anyone.

196
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,160
Including the authorities.

197
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,280
He's a good man.

198
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,520
And I thank you for that,
Mr Baldini.

199
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,480
Please.

200
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,360
Please, ma'am, let him go.

201
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,920
Sorry I'm late. I've been
cancelling meetings.

202
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
Don't know where we are at the
moment.

203
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,760
Cappuccino? Thank you.

204
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,320
Delyth, I fear the firm will be
forced to close.

205
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,440
It's no way to repay you
for years of loyalty.

206
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,400
But I'll do what I can.

207
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,200
Evan could still turn up.

208
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,560
You have to have hope, Tom.

209
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,880
I found some papers
in his office the other day.

210
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,280
Things that...

211
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,480
Shameful things.
You don't have to tell me.

212
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,280
Sometimes, you're too honest
for your own good.

213
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,420
The world doesn't run
on straight lines, Tom.

214
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,160
You don't have to either.

215
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm not sure I do.

216
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't be afraid.

217
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,840
Stop doing what's expected of you.

218
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,180
Just live your life your way.

219
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,320
Set yourself free.

220
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,280
I've got a theory about Arthur.

221
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,800
Paddy Reardon tried to recruit me
once to get some info on the Glynns.

222
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll try and contact Gael Reardon.

223
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,200
I've got you into enough trouble,
that's for sure.

224
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,320
Faith, the supplying
to minors charge...

225
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,520
..they were two lads
who said they were 19.

226
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm ashamed of who I was back then.

227
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,120
I was lost.

228
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,480
That's the past.

229
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,360
You have a daughter who needs you.

230
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,280
And I have children who need me.

231
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,080
And I wish you luck.

232
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,840
I believe in you, Steve.

233
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,100
Faith! Hey, babes! Hey! It's me!

234
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,400
Faith, come here!

235
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,100
Faith, she asked me to post it for
her. What?

236
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,900
Sorry. She asked me to post it
for her, hope you don't mind.

237
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,380
What? Alys's video.
You must have seen it.

238
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,300
No. You must be the only one in town
who hasn't.

239
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,420
Honestly, everyone's watched it.

240
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,860
Hey, hey. See you later.

241
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,120
Love you. Bye, love you!

242
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,120
Daddy?

243
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,280
Just...

244
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,240
..I love you and
I want you to come back.

245
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,780
I don't care why you left.

246
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,080
It doesn't matter to me.

247
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,240
But I just want you back home safe.

248
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,120
I love you.

249
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,480
We love you. Mammy loves you.

250
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,800
So, please...

251
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,080
..can't you just come back? Please?

252
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah?

253
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,800
Yep?

254
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,020
Tom would like a word with us.

255
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,800
When you're ready.

256
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm afraid I took the liberty of
searching through Evan's files.

257
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,120
I discovered one...

258
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,920
..marked Pederson Plant...

259
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,020
..which appeared to contain
contracts

260
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,880
that he drafted for the sale of...

261
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,000
..fictitious lorries, and suchlike.

262
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,800
For the Glynn family.

263
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,920
A money-laundering exercise.

264
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,120
I should have taken it
to the police but...

265
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,480
..he's my son.

266
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,020
And the absence of a suicide note

267
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,500
seems to suggest he'd wanted to
spare us the shame

268
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,600
that public exposure of his crimes
would have brought.

269
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,960
I destroyed them.

270
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,120
No doubt you'll soon be
winding up the firm.

271
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,600
At least you'll be able to do that
with your reputations intact.

272
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
I presume he acted
without your knowledge.

273
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,140
- Yes.
- I take full responsibility.

274
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,560
I should have been keeping
a closer eye.

275
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,620
Tom. I need you to give evidence
for Faith this afternoon.

276
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,860
We're trying to get the social
services order lifted

277
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,460
so the kids can come home.

278
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,200
I'll consider it.

279
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,120
I'll have a word.

280
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,340
All right,

281
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,060
you need to round up more witnesses
and I need to figure out a way

282
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,460
to explain how Evan got mixed up

283
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,320
with criminals and ran off
with their money.

284
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,640
It's fine. It's a family court,
it's confidential.

285
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,740
It's a straight choice, Faith.

286
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,460
If you want your children back,
you have got to dump on Evan.

287
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,040
What is more important?

288
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,880
See who you can rustle up.
We have four hours.

289
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,740
Afternoon. Chief Inspector Parry.

290
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,720
Swansea CID.

291
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Constable Price.

292
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,940
Abercorran.

293
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,220
Investigating the traffic accident
in which Dr Alpay died.

294
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,260
We've had her under surveillance
for several weeks.

295
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,440
It's quite the pharmacy
she has here.

296
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,220
Yes.

297
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,620
There was another set of skid marks
at the scene.

298
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,500
Whoever was there
left pretty quickly.

299
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,360
If you'd be kind enough to...

300
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,120
..forward me the details.

301
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,020
The thing is...

302
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,200
..the reason I'm here,
actually, um...

303
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,740
..would you have heard about
our missing persons investigation?

304
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,780
Evan Howells, yes, of course.

305
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:10,860
Well, Mrs Howells was here the other
day apparently for treatment.

306
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,300
There was a burglary at her home and
an attempted break-in

307
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,780
at Howells Solicitors.

308
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,180
And Dr Alpay was a witness
in a murder trial.

309
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,960
Constable.

310
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,580
If Alpay was operating
a drugs factory,

311
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,860
there's got to be a whole supply
chain, a network or something.

312
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,740
Maybe Baldini's part of it.

313
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,280
Or maybe Evan...
Price found an earring.

314
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,800
Jones, show it to Mrs Howells,
see if it's hers.

315
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,680
Why would it be hers?

316
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,360
Wild guess?

317
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,040
Do you mind if I come with you?

318
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,380
Hello? Hello, I'm Faith Howells.

319
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,780
I've got a meeting with the head.
Hello, Mrs Howells.

320
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm afraid the head has had to
cancel this afternoon.

321
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,500
She can't do that, this is critical.

322
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm really sorry, Mrs Howells.

323
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,920
I'm really sorry.

324
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,360
Keep your body straight.

325
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,860
Gavin. Yeah? I've a favour to ask.

326
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,880
There's been a mistake, my children,
they've been...

327
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,700
The thing is, we're going back to
court this afternoon

328
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,400
to challenge it and I wondered if
you might be prepared to...

329
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,460
OK, I see. Look, it's nothing
personal.

330
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,080
No, I understand, OK.

331
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,760
This is a surprise.

332
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,260
I thought we and the Glynns
were sworn enemies.

333
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,080
I don't work for them any more.

334
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,240
But if they knew I was here,
I'd be dead.

335
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,680
I want you to leave Faith alone.

336
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,440
Evan left her broke
and the business.

337
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,440
Whatever went on between
you and Evan is his problem.

338
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,360
You must be very fond of her
to take such a risk.

339
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,800
It gives us something in common.

340
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,200
I was very fond of Evan,
extremely fond.

341
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,920
He was a good man. A good man.

342
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,600
And he went.

343
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,840
You know where?

344
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,720
You ship my product...

345
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,400
..we both make money and you get to
be the knight in shining armour.

346
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,520
It's funny how love hits you.

347
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,420
You think you're in control

348
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,800
and then someone comes along and
turns the world upside down.

349
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,160
What do you say?

350
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,040
Uh-huh.

351
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,840
Sorry to disturb you.

352
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,660
Yours, I believe? Maybe.

353
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,460
Did you lose one like this
last week?

354
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,860
No, I don't think so.
Are you sure, Faith? It's important.

355
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,580
Would I lie to you?

356
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,780
It was found at the scene
of Dr Alpay's accident.

357
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,540
Were you there, Mrs Howells? Haven't you ever
heard of the Police And Criminal Evidence Act?

358
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,100
Something called a caution.

359
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,440
So you're not prepared to answer?
Are you embarrassed by this, Terry?

360
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,420
Maybe you'd like to check
your jewellery.

361
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,200
Maybe you'd like to fuck off.

362
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Evan. Evan.

363
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,340
Evan! Fuck off.

364
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,800
Come on! Oh!

365
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,540
Evan?

366
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,840
Evan, it's me. Mum?

367
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,340
Alice? Mum? Alice? Hello.

368
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,980
How did you do...

369
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm on Katie's phone.

370
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,660
Right. I know Dad's password.

371
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,980
OK, listen, you mustn't let anybody
see you, all right?

372
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,660
Hiya.

373
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,480
What's happening, Mum?
I just want to come home.

374
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,220
Megan was sick all night.

375
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,380
And Rhodri wouldn't stop crying.

376
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,900
All right, listen. I'm going
to go to court this afternoon

377
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,540
at four o'clock, and everything
is going to be OK.

378
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,260
I promise you, everything is going
to be OK.

379
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,160
But what if it's not?

380
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,880
Who will we live with?

381
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,860
Daddy said if you died it would be
Uncle Terry and Auntie Beth.

382
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,060
No, no, that's not going to happen.

383
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,460
Alice? Don't let them see you,
sweetheart.

384
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,220
Sweetheart, don't let them see
what you're doing, OK?

385
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,380
But why can't we go up there?

386
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,940
Alice?

387
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,740
Come on.

388
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,360
Come on, don't go worrying.
I need you to be...

389
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,820
Where has Evan put his will, Delyth?

390
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,140
Come on, come on, come on.

391
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,060
There must be a copy. He always
deleted after printing.

392
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,820
He kept the wills in hard copy
to prevent tampering.

393
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,300
You know, Tom could be wrong -

394
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,380
maybe he was deceived
into doing what he did.

395
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,100
You know how he always trusted
people.

396
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,780
He was using fake ID, Delyth,
and going to strip clubs!

397
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,600
Right? He was a liar.

398
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
Bloody liar!

399
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,020
Faith... I wish I'd never
married him.

400
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,560
That's what I wish.

401
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,060
And you, you, you stop...

402
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
You stop protecting him, Delyth.

403
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,420
Stupid. Faith?

404
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,980
Faith, where are you going?

405
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,560
Shit! Not again.

406
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,200
I'm guessing you didn't find it?

407
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,440
Evan, there's something I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

408
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,520
There's no easy way to put this.

409
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,760
A man I once knew died last month.

410
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,120
I think he was probably your father.

411
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,760
His name was Owen Fenton.

412
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,720
You may remember him.

413
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,840
You and his son Alec were friends.

414
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,560
It was before I was married.

415
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,560
Everything was up in the air.

416
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,480
Evan, I kept this to myself
out of love for you and Tom.

417
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,540
As far as I'm concerned,
biology is irrelevant,

418
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,280
it's what we mean to each other
that counts.

419
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,760
Evan?

420
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,160
Does Dad know?

421
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,560
I'll choose the right moment.

422
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,840
And what exactly do you want me
to do with this information?

423
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,520
You can't stand the fact that we've
built contented lives for ourselves.

424
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,000
In a place that you've spent
a lifetime resenting!

425
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,680
Do you really begrudge our happiness
that much?

426
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,440
They-they were your dreams.

427
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,200
If you didn't chase them,
don't come to me looking for pity.

428
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,960
This is it, Mum.

429
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,700
This...

430
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,840
This is reality.

431
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,600
This... This is all there is.

432
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,340
We try to make a living,

433
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,640
we look out for one another...

434
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,140
..and we die.

435
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,320
Evan...

436
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,240
If it's not in the office,
it has to be here in the vault.

437
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,980
'Hello, you're through to the answer
machine of Tom and Marion Howells.

438
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,040
'Please leave a message and we'll
get back to you as soon as we can.'

439
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,580
Tom...

440
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,400
Tom, I need to see you now.

441
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,240
"Only to be opened in the event
of my death."

442
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,680
Hey, look at this, dated 14th,
the day he went.

443
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,140
"Dear Faith, I screwed up.

444
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,060
"I never meant to, everything I did
was for all the right reasons,

445
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,380
"out of love for you and the kids.

446
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,500
"All I wanted to do was look
after you and provide for you all.

447
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,820
"I trusted people in good faith.

448
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,540
"I tried to do everything right,
just like you would tell me to,

449
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,460
"but they betrayed me.

450
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,080
"It turns out being honest
isn't enough.

451
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,860
"You have to be a snake,
I'm no good at that.

452
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,820
"At the bottom of this letter
are details of a bank account.

453
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,300
"The money in it is the proceeds
of crime.

454
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,600
"Take this letter and the file to an
outside police force as soon as you can.

455
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,100
"Please forgive me, I love you with
all my heart but I have to go now.

456
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,120
"Goodbye. Evan."

457
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,260
He did love her. I knew it.

458
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,320
He's too honest for his own good,
like his father.

459
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,240
Do you really believe he's dead?

460
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,360
He's gone, Faith.

461
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,760
When will you tell the children?

462
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,380
Look, I could do it, if you prefer.

463
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,920
No.

464
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,480
No.

465
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,960
It's got to come from me.

466
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,000
Tom, I need you this afternoon.

467
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,420
Uh...

468
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,200
Alice, Megan, Rhodri, they need you.

469
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,320
I'm sorry.

470
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,940
I'm sorry.

471
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,060
I'm so sorry I didn't keep
a closer eye on him.

472
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,640
But trust me when I'm telling you,
you trust them.

473
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,560
Should I have been doubting
my own husband? Should...?

474
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,440
Faith...

475
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,600
..tell me, honestly...

476
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,800
..do you have feelings
for this Baldini man?

477
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,500
Hello?

478
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,600
Oh. Right, OK.

479
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,740
You got a letter from Evan?

480
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,340
With his will. And you've seen it?

481
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,120
No, not yet. Cerys found it.

482
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,440
Apparently, there's a bank account.

483
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,920
Criminal money, laundered cash.

484
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,980
He's got caught up in something.

485
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,880
And this, this is...

486
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,880
This is going to sound crazy, but
I think that Williams is involved.

487
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,460
Something odd is going on here,
Terry.

488
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,600
The burglaries, the threats.

489
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,180
Arthur's been spying on me, and...

490
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,980
..and Alpay said she was being
leant on by a corrupt detective.

491
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,720
I'm sure... I am sure that Williams
has got something to do with this.

492
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,880
Why would she use Arthur?
Because he's cheap and vulnerable.

493
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,600
She knows that I know.

494
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,080
This is why she's using my children.
She wants to destroy my bloody life.

495
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,620
You were at the crash site,

496
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,640
Faith, weren't you?

497
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,000
It was your earring,
I recognised it.

498
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,780
I arrived after it happened.

499
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,760
The car was in flames, OK?

500
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,560
Williams was already there.

501
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,040
And you saw her?
Yeah, I saw her, yes.

502
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,860
But I wasn't wearing earrings
last night, Terry.

503
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,980
Will you help me?

504
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,580
Will you speak for me in court
this afternoon, please?

505
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,100
Oh.

506
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,660
Faith, I don't know, I...

507
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,280
Please.

508
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,880
OK.

509
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,760
I've got to go.

510
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,560
Yeah. I've got to go.

511
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,080
OK.

512
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,860
Right, it was in the envelope
with his will,

513
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,380
but I really don't think you should
look at it until after...

514
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,060
Give it here.

515
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,960
OK. You're not going to like it.

516
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,620
"Dear Faith. I screwed up.

517
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,260
"I never meant to.

518
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,660
"Everything I did
was for all the right reasons,

519
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,480
"out of love for you and the kids.

520
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,260
"All I wanted to do was
to look after you,

521
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,520
"provide for you all.

522
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,080
"I trusted people in good faith.

523
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,700
"I tried to do everything right,
just like you'd tell me to,

524
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,000
"but they betrayed me.

525
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,440
"It turns out being honest
isn't enough.

526
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,540
"At the bottom of this letter
are details of a bank account.

527
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,600
"the money in it
is the proceeds of crime.

528
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:15,760
"Take this letter and the file to an
outside police force as soon as you can.

529
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,560
"Faith, please forgive me.

530
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,520
"I love you."

531
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,100
He's saying he still loves me -
how could he?

532
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,900
Yeah, I warned you. Eh? I warned you
not to read it before the hearing.

533
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,700
How could he? Look at this.
Look at this!

534
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,660
Look, look. Let's just focus
on the case.

535
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Lying till his last breath,
the bastard!

536
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,620
Right, Faith, look at me. I need you to hold
it together for me until after this hearing.

537
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,840
Can you do that? Yes, of course.

538
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,560
Come on, we've got this.
Focus on this, that's all.

539
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,240
Ignore her, Faith. You're innocent.

540
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,660
Are you OK? Mm-hm.

541
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,380
Yeah, she's all right,
she's emotional.

542
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,940
Right, don't be long, OK?

543
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,480
Yeah, yeah. Faith.

544
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,980
And you've got the full list of
Baldini's 13 previous convictions?

545
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,920
Mm. Makes interesting reading.

546
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,200
Ma'am.

547
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,240
Please, God, if you're there,
please bring them back.

548
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,920
Please.

549
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,280
Mrs Howells, I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Dr Meral Alpay.

550
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,860
Mrs Howells.

551
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,140
Mrs Howells.

552
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,640
Mrs Howells! Mrs Howells!

553
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,600
Mrs Howells!

554
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,100
You've got five seconds.

555
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,480
Mrs Howells!

556
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,000
Get out there now. Mrs Howells!

557
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,340
Come out, Mrs Howells.

558
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,860
Come on.

559
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,260
Mrs Howells. All right.

560
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,060
Five, four,

561
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,360
three, two, one.

562
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,820
Come on. Right.

563
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,080
Hands in front of you.
Hands right in front of you. Hands.

564
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,300
Why? Why now? New evidence.
What evidence? Cerys!

565
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,060
Cerys! Cerys! Mrs Howells.

566
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,860
Cerys! Mrs Howells! Cerys!

567
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,060
She's been arrested for murder.
Murder? Whose murder? Dr Alpay.

568
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,540
They were associates. You can stop
this right now, Inspector.

569
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,180
You were there. You were there
in person when Alpay died.

570
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,500
I've got the evidence right here.

571
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,300
You're on phone.
They'll say anything.

572
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,140
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have to arrest you for fleeing the
scene of a fatal accident. Sorry, what are you doing?

573
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:49,420
What are you doing here? You were driving the car
Dr Alpay swerved to avoid. You can't trust him!

574
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,940
I've seen the footage. Get off.

575
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,420
Get off. This is... I'm allowing you
your dignity.

576
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,820
This has got to be a joke.

577
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,380
What you got there?
What's that? Mrs Howells' phone.

578
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,220
I'm assuming control of this
enquiry.

579
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,300
Let Mrs Howells go. Thank you, thank you. She's under arrest.
Oh, for God's sake, just do what he says!

580
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm going to need that phone. You're
not out of the woods yet, Mrs Howells.

581
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,660
Thank you. Right, come on, Faith,
we're late.

582
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,380
Shit. My phone.
Forget about your phone.

583
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,220
Why is he taking my phone?

584
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,020
Evan's letter's on it.

585
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,420
Where's the original?
I had to flush it.

586
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,700
Great, well, it's lucky I made
a bloody copy, isn't it?

587
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,340
Right, now, listen, Williams
is out of the picture now.

588
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,740
We're in the driving seat here.

589
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,260
I'm going to need to phone...

590
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,660
I'm going to need to phone Lisa.

591
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,180
Give me your phone.

592
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,040
OK. Keep going.

593
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,940
I've got to move that money, quick.

594
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,520
Come on.

595
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,640
Pick up!

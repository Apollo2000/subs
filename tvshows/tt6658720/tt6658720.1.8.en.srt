1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,380
Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes!

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,660
Social services, please.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,220
They came just after we spoke
and they had already

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,820
been to the school to get the girls.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,660
Why can't we come home?

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,260
Three kilograms of best Colombian.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,540
120,000, bank transfer, it's fine.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,260
Give me the phone! "Are you still
with her?" I'm sorry, Faith.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,660
You tell me now. I'm sorry.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,940
You ship my product.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,460
You get to be the knight
in shining armour.

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,020
At the bottom of this letter
are details of a bank account.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,820
The money in it is the proceeds
of crime.

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,180
Take this letter to an outside
police force as soon as you can.

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm arresting for murder.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,600
There's been an accident.
They just... They shot off the road.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,700
You weren't here.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,460
I'm afraid I have to arrest you

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,620
for fleeing the scene
of a fatal accident. Sorry.

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,820
What have I got to do with it?

21
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:51,060
What are you doing here?
You were driving the car

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,600
Dr Alpay swerved to avoid.
You can't trust her.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,980
My phone. Forget about your phone.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,540
Why's he taken my phone?

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,860
Evan's letter is on it.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,980
Where's the original?
I had to flush it.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,540
Great. Well, it's lucky we
made a bloody copy, isn't it?

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,900
Right, now listen, Williams is out
of the picture now,

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,660
we are in the driving seat here.
I'm going to need phone, erm...

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm going to need phone Lisa,
give me your phone.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,600
Keep going. I've got to move that
money, quick.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,020
It seems your star witness
has just been arrested

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,220
for fleeing the scene
of a fatal accident. Bad luck.

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,100
Can we assume you're throwing
in the towel?

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,940
Children's welfare is our only
concern.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,900
This is all DI Williams' invention.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, we don't agree, Miss Jones.

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,120
First derelict building just north
out of St Clears in an hour's time.

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,120
Cold feet?

40
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,520
It's for Faith.

41
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,000
Steve...

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,160
..I'll be waiting at the caravan.

43
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,780
Yesterday, Your Honour granted
an emergency protection order

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,220
in the belief, encouraged by
DI Williams,

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,100
that Mrs Howells' children were
in imminent danger.

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Not only is DI Williams now under
arrest, for a serious offence,

47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,260
she's produced no evidence
whatsoever

48
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,160
to substantiate her claims.

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,100
The sad fact is
that she orchestrated the removal

50
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,000
of Mrs Howells' children in pursuit
of a personal vendetta.

51
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,380
To have heard Detective Inspector
Williams yesterday,

52
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,440
she was about to charge
Mrs Howells with murder.

53
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,900
This does rather turn things
on their head.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm sure the irony is lost on no
one, Your Honour,

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,180
least of all my opponent.

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,420
We'd just like the children returned
home without delay.

57
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,260
Your honour, since DI Williams
brought this case

58
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,820
to social services' attention,

59
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,780
my clients have delved deeper
into the family's circumstances

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,980
and we'd like you to hear
from one further witness.

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
We've received no notice
of another witness.

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,260
Mrs Howells' mother-in-law -

63
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,800
Marion Howells.

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,640
The whole truth and nothing
but the truth.

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,660
Mrs Howells has been married to your
son Evan for ten years, correct?

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,220
Ten and a half.

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,380
And in your observation
has she been a good mother?

68
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,780
Yes, on the whole.

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,760
And since your son's disappearance?

70
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,780
It's the company
that she's keeping -

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,840
inviting criminals into her home.

72
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,500
You mean Mr Baldini?

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,100
Yes.

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,960
What exactly is your concern?

75
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,060
His record.

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,160
I had no idea.

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,220
The children are already upset.

78
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,420
Megan hardly slept at all when she
was with us the other night.

79
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,380
How would you explain Mrs Howells'
recent association with Mr Baldini?

80
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,920
Can't.

81
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,460
And you're concerned that this
relationship between them might be

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,480
connected to your son's
disappearance?

83
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,100
The police seem to think so.

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,020
And you think the children
are safer elsewhere,

85
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,000
at least for the time being?

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,260
Well, if the alternative is...

87
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,620
They have to be safe.

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,140
Of course they do.

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,860
So you can't put your hand
on your heart Mrs Howells

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,720
and say they should go home?

91
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,120
No.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,260
Miss Jones?

93
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,140
Do you have any cross-examination?

94
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,100
You've got to hit back, Faith.

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,760
We're losing here.

96
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,000
Right, executive decision.

97
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,720
Mrs Howells...

98
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,500
..why do you think your son
disappeared seven days ago?

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,580
I wish I knew.

100
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,060
You've no idea at all?

101
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,900
We've tried not to think the worst.

102
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,020
What is the worst? Murder?

103
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,360
Suicide?

104
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,480
Excuse me.

105
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,960
Yeah. Bring him in.

106
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,180
Let's be frank.

107
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,460
Do you honestly believe
that my client could have had

108
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,560
anything to do with the hypothetical
murder of your son?

109
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,320
No. So if it is suicide, which seems
like the more likely explanation...

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,760
..do you hold her responsible?

111
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,320
No.

112
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,640
It's far more likely to be connected
with you...

113
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,800
..isn't it?

114
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,260
Something you told him recently...

115
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,600
Cerys...

116
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,860
Only made days before Evan vanished,

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,640
you told him that your husband
may not be his father.

118
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,280
Seems he bought a DNA test kit.

119
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,560
You turned your son's world
upside down... didn't you?

120
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,740
Are you giving evidence
against my client

121
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,480
because you can't bear
to take responsibility yourself?

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,840
You told me this was about
the children.

123
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

124
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,040
His name is Steve.

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,720
He's a friend of your mam's.

126
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,200
You've seen him at your house,
haven't you?

127
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,360
Only through the window.

128
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,440
You must have heard him
and your mam talking?

129
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,140
Do you remember last Wednesday?

130
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,220
The last day your dad was at home?

131
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,320
What were he and your mam
talking about?

132
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,860
Mummy had a headache.

133
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,880
She'd just been to a divorce party.

134
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,820
I saw the video
you put up on Facebook, Alys.

135
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,320
It was great, really good.

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,520
Has your dad messaged you back?

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,160
Yes or no?

138
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,480
I've got to get ready
for my ballet lesson.

139
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,040
What's the code?

140
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,880
Tell me the code, Alys...

141
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,160
..for your iPad.

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,920
You do want to see your mam again,
don't you?

143
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,080
I have to go now.

144
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,540
Yes, she is.

145
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,880
A remarkable mother.

146
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,480
Utterly devoted.

147
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,400
And since your son's disappearance?

148
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,240
She's coped admirably.

149
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,160
My son got himself into trouble,
from which he saw no way out...

150
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,360
..then he deserted her.

151
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,140
Your Honour, I have no doubt that
Faith is entirely blameless in

152
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,280
all this and that she is the best
possible carer for her children.

153
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,720
Your wife is concerned about her
choice of friends.

154
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,060
I've spoken to Mr Baldini and, in
my opinion, he's a grateful client

155
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,720
who wants to repay the kindness
my son showed him.

156
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,240
I love my grandchildren...

157
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,800
..and if I didn't trust
in Faith's judgement, then...

158
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,480
..I wouldn't be here.

159
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,620
Dewi, it's me - Steve.

160
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,140
I'm back in business
and I have a job for you in Erin.

161
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,440
I need to get rid of Gael Reardon.

162
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll have the money later,
usual place, six o'clock.

163
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,060
Your children have been late
to school on several occasions.

164
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,100
That's not grounds to rip them
from their home.

165
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,980
Megan has been crying in the
classroom, unable to concentrate.

166
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,320
Yes.

167
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,660
Her dad is missing.

168
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,540
Which is why your association with
Mr Baldini is so strange.

169
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,020
Your Honour has seen a copy of
Mrs Howells' husband's letter.

170
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,060
I had nothing to do

171
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,620
with my husband's disappearance.
With respect, Mrs Howells,

172
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,100
our concern here is the day-to-day
welfare of your children,

173
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,020
not the whereabouts of your husband.
The letter proves that Mrs Howells

174
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,380
is no threat to the children.
If I may please make my point.

175
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,320
Of course, Miss Hughes. Thank you.

176
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,540
Mrs Howells,
are you in a relationship

177
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,220
with Mr Stephen Baldini?

178
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Yes. A professional relationship.
He's a client of my firm.

179
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,460
Whom you choose to entertain
in your home

180
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,660
only days after your husband
has disappeared.

181
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,000
What are you imagining?

182
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,340
A negligee, soft music?

183
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,660
Is that the case?

184
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,460
Really! Mrs Howells.

185
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,660
Really! My husband,
the father of my three children,

186
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,100
vanished off the face of the Earth
and what did the police do?

187
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
What did my mother-in-law do?

188
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,060
Along with every gossip in the town.

189
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,560
They rush to believe that I've...

190
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,360
..that I must have killed him...

191
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,680
..or had him killed.
Have you any idea how that feels?

192
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,560
So, yeah, yeah.

193
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,620
Oh, yeah, I absolutely know who
my friends are.

194
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,100
Yes, an ex-convict with 13 previous
convictions, including selling drugs

195
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,420
to minors. Yes, and he's
a very good friend, actually.

196
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,220
And you see no problem in him having
contact with your children.

197
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,180
Oh, it's called giving the benefit
of the doubt.

198
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,220
You know, these courts used
to try it now and then.

199
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
Might I suggest that your judgement
may have... No, you can't!

200
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,860
No! ..which only makes matters
worse, doesn't it?

201
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,700
Do you have children?
Do you have children?

202
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,980
Do you have children? No, I don't.

203
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,420
No, you don't, so you cannot
possibly begin to understand

204
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,460
how it feels for a mother to have
her children taken away from her.

205
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,900
You cannot understand it,

206
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,460
because Megan and Alys and Rhodri,

207
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,260
they mean more to me
than my entire life.

208
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,900
They mean more to me
than everything.

209
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,440
It's a thing called love.

210
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,260
Mrs Howells, thank you.

211
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,540
What?

212
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,880
Stand down, please.

213
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,460
I'll retire to consider my decision.

214
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,000
Right.

215
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,880
You were driving that squad car,
you'd booked it out.

216
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,560
We've got you on tape
driving it back.

217
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,420
Unless you can prove where the video
came from, who shot it, and that

218
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,360
it hasn't been tampered with, it
won't get anywhere near a jury.

219
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,560
Constable.

220
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,540
It was e-mailed anonymously.

221
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,220
We'll get a trace on the sender
and we'll get a match on your tyres.

222
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,980
Even without your face
on that video,

223
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,440
the circumstantial
will be overwhelming.

224
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,880
Did you think you'd killed her?

225
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,680
Is that why you ran?

226
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,320
Pause the tape, please.

227
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,620
Pause it.

228
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,960
Yes, sir.

229
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,200
There was no phone signal.

230
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,080
I tried to help.
I did everything I could.

231
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,780
I made it back to the road.

232
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,080
And your colleague
DS Morgan drove up.

233
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,060
She told me to go,
forget I was ever there.

234
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,940
Detective Sergeant Morgan
was off duty.

235
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,660
It was her, off duty or not.

236
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you telling me that you,
Detective Inspector...

237
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,900
..took an order
from a detective sergeant,

238
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,860
who told you to forget
that you'd ever been there?

239
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,580
While a woman was burning to death
in a car.

240
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,580
And why are you trying to frame
an innocent woman for a murder

241
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,780
that only exists
in your imagination?

242
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,000
Faith Howells' earring
was found at the scene.

243
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,920
Wasn't it, Constable?

244
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,440
Yeah.

245
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,820
Having been informed
that Mrs Howells was a live suspect

246
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,620
in a potential murder inquiry,
social services were,

247
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,380
in my judgement, fully justified
in removing the children.

248
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,740
But the situation has changed.

249
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,320
Mrs Howells is no longer a suspect.

250
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,400
However, I do remain concerned.

251
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,380
Mrs Howells, are you prepared
to ensure that your three children

252
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,180
will have no contact with Mr Baldini
for the foreseeable future?

253
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,780
Yes.

254
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Very well, I order they be
returned home immediately,

255
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,400
but... strictly on that condition.

256
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,840
I owe you an apology, Faith.

257
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,480
Delyth called,
told me about Evan's letter.

258
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,380
I'm sorry, Tom, I'm so sorry, I had
no idea Cerys was going to...

259
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,760
Shush-shush. I'm so sorry.

260
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,040
Thank you.

261
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,720
Everything makes sense now.

262
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,920
I knew you were unhappy, but...

263
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,860
Right.
We are calling in the big guns.

264
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,260
I'm going to try the Met.

265
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,740
We know Evan was laundering cash

266
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,000
and putting it through the Pedersen
file, but he doesn't say why.

267
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,360
Why would he get involved?

268
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,860
In his letter, he says that he was
betrayed by the people he trusted.

269
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,900
And Alpay came to you

270
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,860
and said she was being hounded by a
corrupt detective. Cerys, I can't...

271
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,580
She went to Evan for help and he
didn't deliver. Please, I can't...

272
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,980
Faith, we are close. Everything's
starting to make sense.

273
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,040
Cerys, I can't... There is still
£200,000 sat in a bank account. No!

274
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,480
All right.

275
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,500
Thank you for getting my kids back.

276
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,680
I just need to be with them now.

277
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,880
And Evan - I've got to let him go.

278
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,840
I've got to get on with my life.

279
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,880
Evan was just weak, wasn't he?

280
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,860
All right. I got you.

281
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,560
But I am all over this.

282
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,000
Right.

283
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,340
Thank you, Cerys.

284
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,900
Go on, get in. Aren't you going to
stay for a glass, then?

285
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,980
God, I'd love to. OK. Right.
Well, bloody brilliant!

286
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,220
I've got wine, I've got peanuts
and, oh, yeah, that guy Steve,

287
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,740
he's been ringing non-stop all day.

288
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,880
Bloody hell, what a day, babes.

289
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,140
I consulted with the CPS lawyer
and I'm afraid it's not good news.

290
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,780
Why would I lie to you?
I swear Morgan was there.

291
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,900
This is all about protecting
Faith bloody Howells.

292
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,180
Calm down, Susan.

293
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,160
There could be a way out of this.

294
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,320
You never guessed?

295
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,640
No.

296
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,520
Does it make any difference?

297
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,560
He's my son, always will be.

298
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,840
What will you do?

299
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,280
Muddle along.

300
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,400
Life's too short...

301
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,240
..to live it
all out of a sense of duty.

302
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Be yourself, Tom.

303
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,560
Be brave.

304
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,320
For once.

305
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,760
Please.

306
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,340
Mm.

307
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,860
Babes, you've already wiped
that twice.

308
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,260
Yep. Well, the parole woman's
like the bloody Gestapo,

309
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,040
she doesn't miss a thing.

310
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,280
Well, won't they miss them?

311
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,720
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

312
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,620
I'm not ready.

313
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,000
I haven't done the hoovering
or anything. Sod the hoovering! Go!

314
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,260
Hey!

315
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,120
Mrs Howells.

316
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,600
Yours, I believe.

317
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,760
There is, er, one other matter.
Come in.

318
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,640
Why aren't you in custody?

319
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,180
Released without charge.

320
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,600
I don't believe this.
Why would Parry...

321
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,240
..unless...

322
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,040
DCI Parry asked me to return it.

323
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,760
What did he want with it?

324
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,560
I'd like to put all this behind us.

325
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,320
I propose...

326
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,440
..you transfer Evan's proceeds
of crime into a police account...

327
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,200
..and we say no more about it.

328
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,020
The last thing Alpay said to me
before she died

329
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,880
was that she was being extorted
by a corrupt detective.

330
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,300
She was a perjurer. Hmm.

331
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,500
And what are you, Inspector?

332
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,800
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
for planting that earring?

333
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,700
What did you do?

334
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,580
Take it when you
were doing the house search,

335
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,920
just in case?
I mean, that's stupid.

336
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,200
And actually...

337
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,840
..actually, how did you get to read
Evan's letter?

338
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,120
How else would you know
about the money?

339
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,960
DCI Parry brought me up to speed.

340
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,980
He and Evan were working
on something together in Swansea.

341
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,760
His disappearance has become...
an embarrassment.

342
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,620
Evan was apparently sitting on money
for a police operation

343
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,700
and Parry would like it back...

344
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,480
..to tie it up quietly.

345
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,760
Evan should be grateful.

346
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,820
Well, I think you and Parry should
know that I've instructed

347
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,920
my colleague to take Evan's letter
to an outside police force.

348
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,480
You're the dodgy detective
Evan refers to in his letter.

349
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,800
Wait here.

350
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,640
I've got the video placing your car
at the scene of Alpay's death.

351
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,360
It's on this phone.

352
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,400
The original -
the only one that can convict you.

353
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,480
It was DS Morgan who told me
to leave Alpay in the car.

354
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,180
Swansea CID. The one that turned up
when you found Evan's car.

355
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,420
She was there in her car when I made
it back up to the road.

356
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,820
What was she doing there?
She must have been tailing Alpay.

357
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,080
I was tailing you.
Yeah, I'd gathered that much.

358
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,360
Alpay was running her own pill
factory out of her dentist's.

359
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,680
Swansea CID were on to her. Swansea.

360
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,840
Swansea.

361
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,600
Did you send the anonymous e-mail
to Constable Price?

362
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,400
What e-mail?

363
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,800
She's refusing to pay.
She's stubborn, like all lawyers.

364
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,540
No, no, no, that's up to you.

365
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,880
I've done my part.

366
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,260
Where have you been all day?

367
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,680
Gael Reardon's taken delivery
of a consignment on Monday.

368
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,560
You've got enough to arrest her now.

369
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,000
You promised me that it'd be over
once you'd got Gael.

370
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,720
That's all I want.

371
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,160
I'm quitting.

372
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
It's not an option, Evan.

373
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,940
Unless you'd prefer the alternative,

374
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,720
what, seven, eight years, maybe,
and miss the little ones growing up?

375
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,660
Someone might be interested to know

376
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,920
that you've got 120K sitting in your
bank account for this little job.

377
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,640
Go home, Evan, have a drink,
shag your wife.

378
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,080
You'll feel better in the morning.

379
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,160
120 grand.

380
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,640
It's all there.

381
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,880
The 80 Evan owed you and...

382
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,600
We'll take care of Gael Reardon.

383
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,520
And make sure it's permanent.

384
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,880
Try lying low for a couple of days,
I would.

385
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,440
A word of advice, Steve.

386
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,080
Faith Howells and a bloke like you.

387
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,360
You're wasting your time.

388
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,080
Nice to have you back, Steve.

389
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,960
Ten years ago today...

390
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,760
..I thought Faith had made
me the happiest...

391
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,360
..I could ever be.

392
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,520
But here I am...

393
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,160
..ten years later...

394
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,000
..even happier.

395
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,960
Two beautiful children.

396
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,760
Another one on the way.

397
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,360
And even more in love.

398
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,000
Ugh!

399
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,280
Surrounded by my family...

400
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,640
..living in my home-town...

401
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,960
..and, at the risk of being horribly
soppy, Mother, I love you guys.

402
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,880
Here's to the next ten years.

403
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,460
Cheers. Ten years.

404
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,320
Cheers.

405
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,920
Come here.

406
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,320
Babe! Your phone's ringing.

407
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,200
Hello.

408
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,600
Hello? Who's this?

409
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,720
Hello?

410
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,980
"Hello? Hello?"

411
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,600
Hello?

412
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,040
Hello?

413
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,560
You all right in the back
there, Arthur?

414
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,840
They're late.

415
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,220
Relax, babes, they'll be here.

416
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,040
Oh, do you want a cheese string?

417
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,880
Where are the kids?

418
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,380
Alys went missing
from her ballet class.

419
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,500
The foster parents dropped her off.

420
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,140
What? But she wasn't there at
pick-up.

421
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,220
Now, we've got two cars
out looking for her.

422
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,180
She hasn't been in touch, has she?
No.

423
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,340
No. OK. Terry...

424
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,740
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Can you just sit tight for now.

425
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,460
Terry... Lisa, take her in. Yeah.

426
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,000
We'll find her, OK.

427
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,680
My little girl, please.

428
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,880
Wait here for Megan and Rhodri.

429
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,380
Steve, please, please, please,
please, please! Someone has Alys.

430
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,560
I don't know what the fuck is going
on but I'm coming to yours now.

431
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,400
It's you.

432
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,080
Where is he?

433
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,700
Where's Baldini, where's my money?

434
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,780
I have no idea what you are
talking about.

435
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,260
My daughter's gone missing,
have you taken her?

436
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,760
What would I want with a kid?

437
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,460
120,000, mine.

438
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,120
Oh, Jesus.

439
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,700
You put on a great show.

440
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,100
By the way, he claimed
he was doing it all for you.

441
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,560
Doing what for me?
Shifting the product Evan ordered.

442
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,080
Hmm!

443
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,000
Like a fool, I fell for it.

444
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,140
We're smart women, Faith,

445
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,800
but that doesn't make us immune
from being cheated on.

446
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,620
Your rat of a husband
wormed his way between my sheets,

447
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,540
all kinds of promises he wasn't
man enough to keep.

448
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,840
And here we are again, round two.

449
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,280
You didn't know?

450
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,160
So sorry.

451
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,200
He betrayed me, sweetheart.

452
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,300
And if you ever find that rotten
carcass of his, make sure

453
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,960
you bury it deep cos I would
gladly dig it up and kill him again.

454
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,120
I need to phone my daughter.

455
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,120
Lost a case?

456
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,520
Something like that.

457
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,000
Your order is on its way.

458
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,160
Monday. Thanks.

459
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,120
I can't do this, Gael.

460
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,760
I thought I could.

461
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm just a small-town lawyer.

462
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,440
I made a mistake.

463
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,160
Evan... And I love my family.

464
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,760
Bastard, Evan Howells! Bastard!

465
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,060
There's space on that plate.

466
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,120
Mmm!

467
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,060
Oh! Hello, darling! Mummy.

468
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,540
Hello! Oh, I've missed you!
I've missed you, so, so, so much.

469
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,500
Oh. Why did we have to go away?

470
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,060
I'll explain everything later,
all right? Oh.

471
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,580
Um, the police are...

472
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,380
Been reading your stories?
If there's anything I can do.

473
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,860
Yes, you have, and you've grown.

474
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,980
Got more kisses?

475
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,140
Paint your kisses on me.

476
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,520
Ah!

477
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,420
Alys said to meet Daddy
at the train station.

478
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,620
I didn't tell the lady, though,
because Alys said it was a secret.

479
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,020
And when did she tell you this?

480
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,260
After school, Daddy messaged her.

481
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,460
Oh. Right.

482
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,340
Well, I think it's bath and bedtime,
I think.

483
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,020
Who would like Mummy to read them
a story?

484
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,820
Not you! Me! You don't like stories,
do you?

485
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,740
No, you don't like stories, do you!
I love stories. Oh, you do, do you?

486
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,060
Ah, right! Go on. Up you go.
Have a nice bath, go on, up you go.

487
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,160
Give Mummy a cuddle.

488
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,920
Phone Terry now.

489
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,920
Alys, it's Uncle Terry!

490
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,120
"See you next spring."

491
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,720
"Goodnight, Newt," said Turtle.

492
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,980
And he slipped deeper
into a swamp mud

493
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,900
where he was snug and cosy and warm.

494
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,180
Alys!

495
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,740
When will Alys be home?

496
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,100
You'll see her in the morning now.

497
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,300
Yeah? Yeah.

498
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,160
I love you.

499
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,900
Hello. Hi, Mummy. Alys!

500
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,460
Alys, where are you? Where are you,
darling? Are you all right?

501
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,100
I'm all right. I'm with Arthur.

502
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,780
You're with Arthur.
Where are you, my darling?

503
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,480
You've got to tell Mam
where you are... please.

504
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,020
Alys... Listen carefully.
You will shortly receive a text

505
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,860
containing account details
and a postcode.

506
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,900
Proceed to the location
within 30 minutes

507
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,380
where you will be required
to make a bank transfer.

508
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,040
You will come alone. You will not
inform the police.

509
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,900
Arthur.

510
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Who else is there with you?

511
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,780
Who else is there with you?!

512
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,260
Arthur!

513
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,920
Sh...

514
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,840
I love you.

515
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,960
I love you.

516
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,480
You sleep tight, precious girl.

517
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,140
Faith... I'm going to fetch Alys.

518
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,060
But she's... She's been found? Not
quite. Faith, what's going on here?

519
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,520
Lisa, just go inside. You're just
not telling me anything!

520
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,540
Faith, it's me. You've got your
phone back, then.

521
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,980
What is it? Listen, I know who Evan
was meeting at the lap dancing club,

522
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,580
and you're not going to bloody
believe this.

523
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,280
DCI Parry and DS Morgan.

524
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,800
How long have you known? Not long.

525
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,960
Pfft. I feel so bloody stupid.

526
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,200
Took my eye off the ball.

527
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,880
Hold on, Alys, Mummy's coming.

528
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,260
Marion, I want you to know

529
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,720
that I've taken what you said
earlier on to heart.

530
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,220
I appreciate you've made
many sacrifices

531
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,000
to remain in this marriage.

532
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,280
Which is why I think it's...

533
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,600
..it's only right
to give you some time to...

534
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,960
..consider your true feelings.

535
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,520
I only want what makes you happy.

536
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,400
If that means a life apart, then...

537
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,640
..so be it.

538
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,720
I plan to stay in a hotel
for a few days.

539
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,120
I'll just get some things.

540
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,040
Come forward.

541
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,040
That'll do.

542
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,420
Where's Alys? In a minute. I want to
see you transfer everything you took

543
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,200
from Evan's account.

544
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,940
Mummy, Mummy. Stay there.

545
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,480
Quiet!

546
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,040
The money, Faith.

547
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,520
What will you tell the Met?

548
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,000
You won't be talking to them.

549
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,520
Think about it.

550
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,920
Every sordid detail of Evan's
behaviour aired in public.

551
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,540
The kids living in shame,
court cases, inquiries.

552
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,400
Your career shot to pieces.

553
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,920
Maybe it's worth
all that for the truth.

554
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,700
Evan came to me for help.

555
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,200
He was already up to his neck
laundering money for the Glynns.

556
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,940
Said he wanted to turn grass for me,
be my informer.

557
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,080
It was the only card he had.

558
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,540
But you betrayed him.
Oh, he betrayed himself, Faith.

559
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh. He didn't have the spine,
gave in to temptation, stealing...

560
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,380
..whoring...

561
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,920
..dealing.

562
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,720
And all the time pretending to be
your lovely husband.

563
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,960
I had to call him to tell him
the game was up.

564
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,920
He knew he was going down.

565
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,060
That's the morning he left.

566
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,400
Why?

567
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,720
Why?

568
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,900
Why is it now
you're telling me this?

569
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,280
Well, I was hoping he'd turn up.
Oh, yeah.

570
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,500
I wanted to give him a chance.

571
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,920
Give you both a chance. You wanted
to keep his money for yourself.

572
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,220
You've destroyed a good man.

573
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,620
Mummy. You've taken my children's
father away.

574
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,960
Mummy.

575
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,440
Is he dead?

576
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,000
I think we can safely assume so.

577
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,920
Make the transfer, Faith.

578
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:59,180
Mummy! Alys. Stay here. Stay here.

579
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,840
It's OK. It's OK.

580
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,960
Aren't you going to answer that?

581
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,400
Put me on speaker.

582
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,460
DCI Parry, it's been brought
to my attention that you have been

583
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,100
using Evan Howells to set me up for
a fall, despite our arrangement.

584
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,860
Full marks for effort but you've
picked the wrong woman. Gael...

585
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,700
Shut up and listen!
Call off your little investigation

586
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,200
and do whatever it is the lovely
Mrs Howells tells you to do.

587
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,600
If you don't, the moment I call
Dublin, your grave is already dug.

588
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,380
These are my terms, Chief Inspector.

589
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,740
Let Alys go, forget about the money,
get the Glynns off my back,

590
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,080
and we can all move on.

591
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,960
No Met, no prosecutions.

592
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,560
I'll keep your dirty secret.

593
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,920
Evan said you were
the better lawyer.

594
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,400
I should have had you working
for me.

595
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,380
Keep down, Alys.

596
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,820
What's going on? Let him go.

597
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,880
Have you got the money?
I said, let him go.

598
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,460
Helen.

599
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,800
The money.

600
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,900
The money, Mrs Howells.

601
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,560
Helen, put it down now.

602
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,740
Oh, put it down, Helen!

603
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,240
I'm scared.

604
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,080
All of it now.

605
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,160
I'm going to get my daughter...

606
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,780
..and we're all going to go home,
OK?

607
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,620
You're going nowhere
until we've been paid.

608
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,340
Five seconds. Three...

609
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,920
two...

610
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh!

611
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,160
Mummy!

612
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,720
Come over here. Get your cuffs out.

613
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,840
Get them out.

614
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,140
Clip yourself on, clip her on first.

615
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,600
No. Clip yourself.

616
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,280
No.

617
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh!

618
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,360
Further.

619
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,400
Mummy, Mummy.

620
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,540
I was a coward, I know. I should
have let him put me in jail.

621
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,640
Where did you learn that?

622
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,840
Army. Better get in.

623
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,560
Go.

624
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,860
Are you looking for someone to have
babies with, Lisa, or just a date?

625
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,500
I thought you were sleeping, Missy!

626
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,060
I think you should have babies,

627
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,480
but not with someone
random off the internet.

628
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,980
Faith, have you got her?

629
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,860
She's fine. All good. Everything
all right there, Megs, Rhods?

630
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,480
Yeah, yeah, all good.
Babe, we love you.

631
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,660
How is she?

632
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,960
Not good. I keep trying Daddy but
he's not answering his phone.

633
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,440
Well, they've found Alys.

634
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,920
Oh, thank God. Where?

635
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,920
She's on her way home with Faith,
that's all I know.

636
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,880
I'm scared, Terry.

637
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,680
Mammy's going to die.

638
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,040
I know she is.

639
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,520
I'd, er...

640
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,600
..I'd better go and check on Alys.

641
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,420
DS Superintendent Laxton,
further to our phone call,

642
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,100
I enclose a statement setting out
all that we currently know

643
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,740
about the disappearance
of Mr Evan Howells.

644
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,740
I have no doubt that the evidence
points to significant misconduct

645
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,780
carried out by Swansea
police officers

646
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,520
DCI Huw Parry and DS Helen Morgan.

647
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,140
If you would like to discuss
the matter further,

648
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,580
please do not hesitate to
contact me.

649
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,200
Cerys Jones.

650
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,400
Send.

651
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,900
Faith, you OK?

652
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,340
Don't contact the Met.

653
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,420
Huh? I've got Alys back.

654
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,340
I made a deal. What do you mean?

655
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,100
We've got 80 grand to
clear the firm's debts,

656
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,820
get back into business,

657
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,620
and pay off Gael Reardon.

658
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,720
Faith, 80! Whatever it is you're
doing, OK, just scrap it.

659
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,940
Call you tomorrow. Goodnight, Cerys.

660
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,280
Faith!

661
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,120
Shit.

662
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,960
Shit, shit, shit.

663
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,680
Alys.

664
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,260
Alys.

665
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,720
You're home.

666
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,240
You're home.

667
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,900
Yeah. Mummy's beautiful girl.

2
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,940
Evan!

3
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,320
Can you help me, please?
Can you help me zip this up?

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,540
Ooh, I haven't seen that dress
in a while!

5
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
What's the occasion? Well, um...
I did... I did tell you.

6
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,980
Lisa's divorce came through
this morning!

7
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,320
A gang of us are going for supper
in Bella Bellisima!

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,020
Yeah, now, breathe in. Oh!

9
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,520
Hang on. Hang on! Stop it now!
All right, all right! Nearly there!

10
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,320
There, you're in!

11
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,620
Comfortable?

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,960
Come here.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,700
You look beautiful. Thank you. OK?

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
Hey, while I remember,
I've got a firm meeting coming up,

15
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,480
now, Cerys is bound to ask
when you're coming back.

16
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,380
Do we really need to talk
about this now?

17
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,660
No! No. It'll keep.
Yes. Enjoy yourself.

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,040
Thank you.

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,740
Well?

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,300
Let's face it, there's no room
in that thing for a pizza.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,380
Um... this one.

22
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,980
Alys, that's a maternity dress.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,820
We know that. Oh, you know that?
Yeah.

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,260
All right, well, I'm going back
to the gym tomorrow, anyway.

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,100
No, you're not. Yes, I am. Thank you
very much. Bye. Bye. Be good!

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,240
You be good! You be good!
Not the boss of me!

27
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,240
All right, Gar, all right!

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,480
All right, Gar!

29
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,140
Gareth, did you have to disturb
the whole street?

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,520
Thought I'd be doing you a kindness,
Mrs Howells.

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,740
I thought to myself, she'll have
six frocks in front of her,

32
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,940
none of them good enough,
the kids will be creatin',

33
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,220
and Evan will be catching the blame
for a lot of it.

34
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,220
Best put them all out of
their misery, I thought.

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,940
Aw!

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,220
Not another wild night out
with the girls, is it?

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,060
Watch yourself now.

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,760
Nice frock, by the way. Would you
keep your eyes on the road, Gareth?!

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,980
"Goodnight, Turtle, said Newt.

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,760
"I'll see you in the spring.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,760
"Goodnight, Newt, said Turtle.

42
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,460
"And they slipped
deep into the swamp mud

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,800
"where it was snug, cosy, and warm.

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,980
"Sleep tight, murmured Turtle,
and that's what they did."

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,040
All winter long.

46
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,680
Right, come on.

47
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,320
Up you come.

48
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,740
One, two, three...

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,840
OK.

50
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,320
Night-night.

51
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,080
I got you!

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,940
Please, it's a good bit.

53
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,320
Two minutes. Yes!

54
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,300
No, it feels great, it really does,
but you know, the only weird thing

55
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,580
is the thought of having sex
with another man.

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm sure...
I'm sure you will manage it, Lisa.

57
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,720
No, I don't know where to begin!

58
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,140
What did you say?

59
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,980
I don't... I don't mean like that.

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,420
I mean like dating.

61
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,340
Oh, hello! Hello, Silvio!

62
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,380
What you doing after your
shift, Silvio? Silvio! Silvio!

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,440
Doing after your shift!

64
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,860
Silvio!

65
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,380
He's doing her!

66
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,220
He's doing you! Do me, later! Yeah!

67
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,960
Cake!

68
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,680
Whoo!

69
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,580
Oh, hello! Hello, hello.

70
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,620
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

71
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,100
You ended up cleaning, have you?
Have you?

72
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
You?! Shh... No, no, no, no.

73
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

74
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,220
You look. You look.
You look. You look.

75
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, OK. It's time for bed.

76
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,300
You look really quite handsome.

77
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,460
Hello, bad boy!

78
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,820
Ooh! What's come over you?!

79
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,440
All my life I've wanted this!

80
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,640
Amazing!

81
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,600
God bless tequila!

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,000
Ooh!

83
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,560
Night.

84
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,160
Right, here come the eggs.

85
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,840
Here you go, come on, then,
eat up, girls.

86
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,320
Hey! Should have woken me!

87
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,020
Kettle's just boiled.

88
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,400
Right, then.
I love you, I love you...

89
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,140
Bye. Bye, Rhods. Bye, girls!

90
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,740
Bye. Tie, Dad! Oh, thank you.

91
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,520
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I've got to rush, busy day. Oh.

92
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,200
Ah!

93
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,440
Were you drunk last night, Mummy?
Alys...

94
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,420
Then why did Daddy say you slept
in the drunk bunk?

95
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,080
Well, maybe he thought he was
being hilarious, I don't know.

96
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,820
On the counter.

97
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,160
Thank you very much.

98
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,960
You don't look very well.
Well, I feel ab... absolutely fine.

99
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,800
Ohh...

100
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,600
Ouch!

101
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,660
Oh, my God.
Faith, seriously, my head!

102
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,900
Worth it?

103
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,060
Well, I'm free.

104
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,420
Mm. Hmm!

105
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,300
I mean, I feel like absolute crap,
but I am...

106
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,540
I'm free as a little bird, babe.

107
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,000
So what now?

108
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,140
Hold on.

109
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh, no way!

110
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,820
Yep.

111
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,980
Hang on, let me have a look.
Already? Look at this.

112
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,380
Matt... Mmm. 38. Nice. Yeah.

113
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,940
Er, self-employed
software something or other,

114
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
and look -
he wants to make me feel special.

115
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,100
No way. Why? Beard.

116
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,500
What? He has a beard, Lis. So?

117
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,240
He has a beard, Lisa! OK!

118
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,660
Ooh!

119
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,140
Hi cariad! Hiya!

120
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,620
Ooh, sorry! Sorry, Cerys.

121
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,260
Er...

122
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,860
Maybe he's gone straight to court?

123
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah. No, no, no idea.

124
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,220
I'll give him a call, all right?

125
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,080
OK. Right, bye-bye.

126
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,780
Evan, it's... It's Faith, darling.

127
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,580
Can you give me a ring
when you get this?

128
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,620
Love you.

129
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,580
Faith, any word from Evan? No.

130
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,700
Well, that's brilliant.
Arthur Davies needs bail,

131
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,260
he's up in 20 minutes, and I've
got a sentencing in Crown Court.

132
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,940
What do we do? Well, he'll be there.

133
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,100
And if he's not, the client
gets banged up and sues us.

134
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,820
Arthur? I doubt it. Faith!

135
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,500
It's a bail-out, 10:30.

136
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,140
Evan said you'd be back
any day soon.

137
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,400
Thank God! Cerys. Cerys!
I'm late! Hey!

138
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,400
Cerys!

139
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,160
Ohh!

140
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,560
Shit!

141
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,980
Oh, Marion, hi.
Couldn't do me a favour?

142
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,660
Look after Rhodri for a couple
of hours? What, now? I'm busy.

143
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,580
Oh, Evan - he's snagged up
for a while.

144
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,060
I've got to stand in for him
at court.

145
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,180
Court? I thought you were...

146
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,380
What? Well, you've become
so domesticated!

147
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,100
You be a good boy now for Granny,
OK?

148
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,180
Thank you.

149
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,220
Is Evan all right?

150
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,920
Yeah, yeah, he will be, but, er...
not when I find him.

151
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,340
"Domesticated."

152
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,000
"Well, you've become
so domesticated, Faith!"

153
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,600
Piss off, Marion!

154
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,340
"I'm sorry I can't
take your call at the moment.

155
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,200
"Please leave a message. Thank you."

156
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,580
Hey, Evan!

157
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,980
Where the hell are you, huh?

158
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,060
This isn't bloody funny, darling.

159
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,780
Evan, your mother... your mother
is being a complete and utter bitch.

160
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,300
As usual!

161
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,780
OK, I love you.

00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,400
But phone me back.

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,480
Oh, she's grown! Nice to see you.

Arthur Davies!

170
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,980
Oh!

171
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,600
Faith, mun!

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,020
Thought you were a lady of leisure
nowadays!

173
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,940
Ha. It was maternity leave,
not retirement.

174
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,820
Where's Evan, then? No idea.

175
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,320
Charge? Meant to have nicked
half a vod from the Co-op, like.

176
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,620
Not a drop passed my lips.

177
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,000
Defence? Mistaken identity.

178
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,420
Where were you when you were
arrested, Arthur?

179
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,440
Leggin' it out the door, wasn't I?

180
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,740
Then how could they have mistaken
you for someone else, Arthur?

181
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,060
Not me. The bottle, mun.

182
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,500
It was the one I bought earlier,
see, but I forgot I had it.

183
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,580
These pills I've taken
have messed with my head.

184
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,400
Fancy a coffee after? Mmm...

185
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,380
You're a winner, Faith! Yeah...
It's in the stars.

186
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,220
Well, I wouldn't bank on it!

187
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,100
Hey, come for a coffee, then.

188
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,960
You keep singing, I'll come
for the coffee. I'll buy it!

189
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,100
Evan, if this is your way
of trying to tell me

190
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,960
you want me back at the office...

191
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,840
..I just need you to know
that it is really shit...

192
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,520
..and fine, I will do
Arthur's bail app...

193
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,140
..but we have some serious
talking to do, OK?

194
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,800
Come on, phone me!

195
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,000
All parties in the case
of Davies to Court One.

196
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,960
Ohh...

197
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,300
Mrs Howells!

198
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,060
I thought you'd hung up your spurs.

199
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,180
Well, I appear to have
strapped them back on again.

200
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,020
Good for you. Guilty plea, is it?

201
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,980
Not guilty.
Those are my instructions.

202
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,340
Very well. Remand in custody
for seven days.

203
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,380
Next.

204
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,920
Bail.

205
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,700
Ma'am, I think you might have
forgotten something.

206
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,860
Bail.
All the usual objections, Ma'am.

207
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,300
Yes, Mrs Howells?

208
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,900
The prosecution is concerned

209
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,760
that your client will
abscond and re-offend.

210
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,780
Yes, well, I don't recall Mr Davies
having ever strayed

211
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,900
further than the late-night Spar
on Carmarthen Road.

212
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,540
And as for the risk of him
committing further offences, well...

213
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,120
now and then, even the most
unexpected people, they surprise us.

214
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,860
Who knows? This could turn out
to be the first day

215
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
of the rest of his life.

216
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,680
Well, I think under
the circumstances...

217
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,380
We've no wish to burden the prison
services more than we have to,

218
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,260
Mrs Howells, but make no mistake -

219
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,500
prison is where he'll go
if he's found guilty at trial.

220
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,380
Thank you, Ma'am.

221
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,880
We'll see you in seven days,
Mr Davies.

222
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,380
Hey.

223
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
Hey, tell Evan he's sacked.

224
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm having you every time!

225
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,740
Really!

226
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,900
You could just try
and stay out of trouble.

227
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
Hey, like you said,
it's all change from today.

228
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm starting a new business.

229
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,620
Dolphin-watching.
Evan gave me the idea, like.

230
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,140
Lend us a tenner, you'll get shares.

231
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,240
Thing is, Arthur,
you're meant to pay ME.

232
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,440
Delyth, hi. Any news?

233
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,720
What?!

234
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,400
Well, sounds like I don't have
much choice, is it?

235
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,360
Right, give me 20 minutes.

236
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,640
OK.

237
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Oh, Evan Howells!

238
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,440
Evan Howells - dead, dead, dead,
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!

239
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,220
I've driven all the way from Swansea
for this meeting.

240
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,060
He's had all morning to...
I understand. I'm sorry, Mr Jenkins.

241
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh, hi! Hi, sorry.

242
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,100
Faith Howells, partner.

243
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,580
My apologies, Mr Jenkins -

244
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,900
my husband has been
unavoidably detained.

245
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,940
Been arrested, has he?

246
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,500
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's, er...

247
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,860
He's dealing with a murder case.

248
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,380
Multiple.

249
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,860
So, er... Right, let's find your
file, won't be a minute.

250
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,500
Oh, you're familiar with my case?
I'm sure it won't take me long.

251
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,980
Has it got a dog in it?
Got a what in it? Bassett.

252
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,860
Detective Superintendent.
Fraud Squad.

253
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,540
He's the one who's cooked this up.

254
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,900
Maybe he should be chasing you,
not me. Listen, forget it.

255
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,800
I'll get myself a proper lawyer.

256
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,980
Where are you going, Delyth?

257
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,220
He's our best client. Yeah, was.

258
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,680
Good riddance!

259
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,760
Taxi for Delyth.

260
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,120
It's a joke.

261
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,380
No word from Evan, then?

262
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,240
It's not like him at all.

263
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,500
You don't think we should try
the hospital?

264
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,340
Just in case he's been in
an accident? I know.

265
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,900
I know, I know exactly
where he's hiding.

266
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,780
Won't be long. Catch!

267
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,020
Oh!

268
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,600
Well done.

269
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,840
Evan, you here?

270
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,800
Evan?

271
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,680
Evan!

272
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,360
Evan?

273
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,320
Ohh...

274
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,100
Hello, Abercorran Police Station.

275
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,420
How may I help you?
Terry, it's Faith.

276
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,700
Oh, hiya, love!

277
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,540
You're not going to let me down
about this, erm...

278
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,860
quiz night, now, are you?

279
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
I'm banking on you.

280
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,940
I will be there.

281
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,440
Er... listen...

282
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,900
..I've lost Evan.

283
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,260
You what?

284
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,400
Well, he went to work this morning
and never arrived.

285
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,360
Thing is, he's, er... he's missed
a really important appointment.

286
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,380
I'm sure he'll turn up.

287
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,860
Are you speaking as a police officer
or as his brother-in-law?

288
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,920
He usually has lunch with Bethan
on a Wednesday, have you tried her?

289
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,940
Faith?

290
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,980
Yes?

291
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,140
I'm sure there's a perfectly
rational explanation.

292
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,160
He'll have been caught up
with a client, or something.

293
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,860
Yeah.

294
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,500
Yeah. Sorry.

295
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,700
Right, don't forget, now.
7:30 tomorrow night, now.

296
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,020
Don't forget. I won't.

297
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,400
Bye-bye. OK. Ta-Ra.

298
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,660
He mostly uses his laptop for work.
Mmm.

299
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,120
Today's e-mails
are downloading here.

300
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,180
Does that mean that
he's not picking them up?

301
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,520
I think so.

302
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,900
Evan? Isn't he meant
to be with Jenkins?

303
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,300
He'd better not screw this one up -

304
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,780
I've virtually had to prostitute
myself to hook this case.

305
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,660
Right, how do you fancy
a few matrimonials?

306
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,220
You were always
good at family stuff.

307
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,860
No, I agreed to stand in
for one bail application.

308
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,020
I'm confused - Evan's had me trying
to drum up work for you for weeks.

309
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,060
Has he?
Look, am I missing something here?

310
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,860
If our client's being compromised
by some issue between you and him,

311
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,980
I think I deserve to know.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

312
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:03,144
It's just probably just... some
misunderstanding, that's all.

313
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,640
Everything's fine.

314
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,900
Oh, God, she's rude.

315
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,240
Hmm...

316
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,000
Sorry.

317
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,080
Everything's just a bit...

318
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,020
Last time Evan was late for
a client, he was at the doctor's.

319
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,400
You can grow old
waiting at that surgery.

320
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,900
What the bloody hell is going on,
Evan?

321
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,720
This is not funny any more.

322
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,080
You phone me.

323
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,600
And. Er... lo and behold.

324
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,620
The draughtsman's copy
of the 1878 parish map.

325
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,860
Here it is.

326
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,100
The boundary fence,

327
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,880
precisely three feet to the right
of where he claims.

328
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,660
Three whole feet.

329
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,340
But... three times 35 makes 105,

330
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,860
and it'll add to the value
of nearly £5,000.

331
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,840
And if, erm, further proof...

332
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,020
..were needed,

333
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,460
declassified negatives from the 1939
War Office aerial survey, which...

334
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,020
How much more
are you willing to spend

335
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,940
fighting your next door neighbour,
Mr Thomas?

336
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm prepared to spend everything.

337
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,380
The man's not getting away with it.

338
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,000
I despise the man!

339
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,660
As I've told your husband
on many occasions, Mrs Howells,

340
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,200
it's the principle.

341
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,620
This is theft.

342
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,860
The man is a criminal.

343
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,780
Life is short.

344
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,120
Precious.

345
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,860
Eight years, this has dragged on.

346
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,940
All that energy you could have spent
doing good...

347
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,620
Why are you giving him
the satisfaction?

348
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,620
Be the bigger man here, Mr Thomas.

349
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,400
Rise above it. That is how you win.

350
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,720
You are precisely the woman I want
fighting my corner in court.

351
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,340
I want him to know
it's going all the way.

352
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,540
Absolutely, it will go all the way.
I want him to sweat.

353
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,980
Not sure about the sweating,
Mr Thomas, but I'll do my best.

354
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,080
I'm sure you will. Yes. Goodbye.
I'll be... I'll be in touch.

355
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,160
Take care. Mind the steps.

356
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,820
Absolutely off his head!

357
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,180
I think he's lonely. Lonely?

358
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,900
I think he's single.

359
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,660
It's probably some important client
that's insisted he drop everything.

360
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,580
Well, I'm worried. Of course I am.

361
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,780
Why am I not allowed to be worried
about my own son?

362
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,740
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, come on now,
don't go worrying, all right?

363
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,100
This is Evan we're talking about
here.

364
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,940
Huh? Mr Reliable? Come on!

365
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,660
Hey, look, why don't we all just get
on with our day, and then, um...

366
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,584
I don't know, beat him up when he
comes back later, huh? Yeah.

367
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,560
I must look a sight! Excuse me!

368
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,740
She seems to have become so...
delicate lately.

369
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,200
Well, she hasn't been very well,
has she?

370
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,340
It's good to see you back.
Thank you, Faith.

371
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,080
Well, I'm not back, Tom.
I'm just covering.

372
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,080
Hey.

373
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,980
Do you think Daddy's upset with me
for getting rat-arsed last night?

374
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,460
Hmm?

375
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,540
Yeah, yeah, me too.

376
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,580
Hmm...

377
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,240
Come on, we better check he hasn't
flown to Rio.

378
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,420
Yeah? Come with Mummy and check?

379
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,520
See where Daddy is? Come on!

380
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,700
Mr Evan and Mrs Faith Howells.

381
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,940
We've each got a debit card,
and we were just wondering

382
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,720
if there was any activity
on the account today.

383
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,860
Nothing else, that's it?

384
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,400
No that's great, that's great.
Thanks. Bye-bye

385
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,700
Well he's still in the country,
Rhodri!

386
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,460
Still in the country!

387
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,520
Rhodri, I suppose that's one
positive.

388
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,500
It's going to be fine.

389
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,260
Absolutely fine. All right, OK,
what do we need?

390
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,800
Er... swimming kit, goggles...

391
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,820
This is er... strictly in confidence,
of course, Mrs Jones.

392
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,900
Well...

393
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,540
he usually waves.

394
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,060
But not today.

395
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,580
Mind, the state she came home in
last night.

396
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,220
Legless, she was.

397
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,780
Faith Howells? Oh, yes, yes.

398
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,500
Ten past midnight.

399
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,120
Couldn't get her key in the lock. No
wonder she slept in the spare room.

400
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,940
I saw the light go on, see.

401
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,280
Between you and me, she's in there
as often as not.

402
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,220
And you know what they say -

403
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,920
there's only one place
colder than a loveless marriage bed.

404
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,080
The grave.

405
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,280
Tea.

406
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,140
Hello, Faith. How are things?

407
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,420
Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.

408
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,840
Apart from the mild hysteria
and a missing husband!

409
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,700
Sam, I need to know why Evan's
been coming to see you.

410
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,980
You were a lawyer - you know.

411
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,500
Well I'm still a lawyer, and there's
no secrets between me and Evan,

412
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,620
so... well, I thought there wasn't.
Please. Please, it's...

413
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,740
It IS important.

414
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,260
He's only been in a couple times.
OK.

415
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,580
Just tell me straight.
Is he going to live? No! I mean...

416
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes. He's just been feeling
a bit stressed.

417
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,500
Right. Er... about what?

418
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
Usual things.

419
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,020
I referred him to counselling.
I think it worked.

420
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,660
He hasn't been back since.
Counselling?

421
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,480
Evan's been going to counselling?

422
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Ooh.

423
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,240
When?

424
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,240
Is he, erm...

425
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,420
Was it me? Was he being...

426
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,740
Sorry, has he been going to
counselling because it's...

427
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,460
He's stressed because I'm still at
home with the kids, or... No, no.

428
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,500
He didn't mention that.
What did he mention, Sam?

429
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
I just got the impression it was
more of an accumulation. Right.

430
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,600
Look, I'm really not comfortable...
No.

431
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,640
Well he's been...

432
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,000
He's been smoking again.

433
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,481
Yeah, he hasn't been smoking in over
ten years - did he tell you that?

434
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,380
How have things been between
the two of you? You know...?

435
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,140
Yeah.

436
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,820
What I know?

437
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,620
Are you talking about sex?

438
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,980
Are we having sex?

439
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,460
Are we having sex?

440
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,720
Er... well we... we...

441
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,940
Er, sort of.

442
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,660
I could give you something
to take the pressure off. Mmm.

443
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,780
Right. Erm...

444
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,420
I'm really late to pick up
the girls. Faith!

445
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,460
Faith...

446
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,880
Faith, I really don't think he's
the sort, you know, to do something.

447
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,320
I know that. Thank you.

448
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,260
That's it, Alys.

449
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,980
Legs straight, remember to
kick from the hips.

450
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,180
Top job.

451
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,920
Turn around, then, to go back.

452
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,480
All good.

I need to access
my husband's phone records.

463
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,860
He's gone missing.

464
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,180
My sympathies, madam. But
the phone is registered in his name?

465
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,740
Yes, but I'm his next of kin.

466
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,340
I'm afraid that such data can only
be accessed with a secure password

467
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,580
registered to the account.

468
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,540
What if I don't know the password?

469
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:08,020
Then, in that case, I'm afraid
that would be hard cheese, madam.

470
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Hard cheese? Precisely.

471
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,040
May I be of any further assistance
to you today? Forget it.

472
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,000
Mam, is something wrong with Dad?

473
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,420
No.

474
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,860
You're not getting a divorce,
are you?

475
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,700
You silly sausage! You're a silly
sausage. You're a silly sausage!

476
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,240
You're a silly...

477
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,980
Mam, someone's at the door.

478
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,180
That might be Daddy now.

479
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,080
No, I'm going to win!
No way. No way!

480
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,840
It's me! Just Lisa.

481
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Hey. Well, is it true?

482
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,900
Has Evan done a bunk?
Oh, for God's sake.

483
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,700
It's everywhere, Faith! Shh!

484
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,380
He's even got his own hash-tag,
# where'sEvan.

485
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,420
You know Tracy? Tracy
from the coffee shop? Yeah.

486
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,060
She's been posting things like
crazy. What's wrong with people?

487
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,300
Can't they... Have they got
nothing better to do?

488
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,020
You look like you need a drink. It's
not even five o'clock yet, Lisa.

489
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,880
Yeah, well, emergency rules, babe.

490
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,980
Right. Have you two been rowing?

491
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,260
No.

492
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,880
Well, no more than usual.

493
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,940
And you. You've literally no idea?

494
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,440
No.

495
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,020
Where is he?

496
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,680
I mean, this is ridiculous.

497
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,740
Should I be... Should I be worried?

498
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,140
Should I? I don't know.

499
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,540
You know...?

500
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,580
What am I supposed to do?

501
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, it's not like him, is it? No.

502
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,880
Oh, come on, Faith.
You must have sensed something.

503
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,480
Well, I didn't sense that he'd been
to see a counsellor.

504
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,460
No way! Yeah.

505
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,500
When? Recently.

506
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,100
Sam told me.

507
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,340
Been stressed, apparently.

508
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,240
And he didn't say anything? No.

509
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,200
Well, it's a classic, isn't it?

510
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,620
Look, nice guy, slightly repressed.

511
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,020
Repressed? Yeah, he is.
Little bit repressed, right,

512
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,100
but he worships you,

513
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,820
and he just can't admit
that he's got his own needs.

514
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,780
Sex famine.

515
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,740
Seriously, babe. A bloke... He can't
be getting it and still be stressed.

516
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,740
That is a fact of life. Shh!

517
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,560
Oh, Lisa! Listen, I know it's not
PC, right, but sometimes, babe...

518
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,060
..you have just got to take one
for the team.

519
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,500
Why? Why? Why do people always
assume it's down to sex?

520
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,540
Why? OK, well...

521
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,340
Right, when was the last time
you two properly shagged?

522
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,440
Well... Yeah, now, like
really, really went at it?

523
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,200
Faith?

524
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,000
I rest my case.

525
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,480
Faith, any news?

526
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm not going to lie...

527
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,780
I'm worried sick.

528
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,400
You go. No, you! YOU go!
Faith, she's YOUR sister-in-law.

529
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,220
Passports, driving licence?
Er, phone... Phone!

530
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,780
Bank cards. OK.

531
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,660
Yeah, yeah. Look, his passport
is still here.

532
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,620
He hasn't touched his bank cards,
and...

533
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,160
Hey!

534
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,180
Hey, two minutes!

535
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,520
Two minutes, babes!

536
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,740
He might be sulking somewhere.
He did used to do that as a kid.

537
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
About what, then? I don't know -
you're his wife.

538
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,540
Yeah. Mami and I have both noticed
that he's looking older...

539
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,580
Well, he's 40... and smoking again.
Smoking...!

540
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,380
Lisa, Frank Lloyd saw him
on the fire escape

541
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,620
at the back of the office.
You must have smelt it on him.

542
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:39,544
No, I didn't. He hasn't been a happy
man for months, Faith. I could tell!

543
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,520
Well...

544
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,440
..thank you for sharing that,
Bethan.

545
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,760
Hey, good girls!

546
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,340
Hey! Bethan's here.
Do you want to come in?

547
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,140
Well, if that's all right.

548
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,120
We thought we'd offer you
some moral support. Oh.

549
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,340
Marion'll be along in a minute.
Great. Mmm.

550
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,720
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't be nice to me. No!

551
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,800
Listen...

552
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,200
..between you and me...

553
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,480
..how are the finances?

554
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,280
Delyth's given the impression that
business has been a bit slack.

555
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,120
Well, still within the limit
last time I checked.

556
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,540
Overdraft? Mmm.

557
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Means we can afford luxuries.

558
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,440
The gas bill.

559
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,840
Do you think it's something
at work?

560
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,900
Well, he's never liked to talk shop
at home.

561
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,820
You're his father.
He said anything to you?

562
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Come on, come in.

563
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,640
Come on. Come in!

564
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,500
Hello, Tom!

565
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,260
You've lost weight!
Oh, thank you very much.

566
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,140
Mam, is tea ready?
Yes, tea is ready.

567
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,620
Tea is ready. Tea is ready!

568
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,020
Yeah. Tea is ready.
Right, come on, then, Tom,

569
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,820
let's give them some
peace and quiet, is it?

570
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,340
Come with me for a minute. Come on!

571
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,760
Five minutes.

572
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,340
OK. Thanks, babes.

573
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,940
Right...

574
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,920
Fish fingers...

575
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,700
Yes, please. Oh. Here you go.

576
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,320
Hungry?

577
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,200
Alys, one or two, babes?
Careful, they're hot, right?

578
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,440
Ooh!

579
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,580
How was your maths test today, Meg?

580
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,900
Eight out of ten.

581
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,480
Really? Oh, good girl. Well done.

582
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,800
Tell her. No.

583
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,120
Mam, Alys has got something
to tell you.

584
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,260
We think Dad had a funny phone call
this morning.

585
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,200
What do you mean funny, darling?
What did he say? Not much.

586
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,360
Alys? Did you hear anything?

587
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,500
Babes, you mother-in-law's
just turned up.

588
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,820
Alys, Mami talking to you.
Shall I let her in? Yeah.

589
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,860
Yes, please.

590
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,840
Oh, hiya, Marion. Terry.
Clywest Ti rywbeth?

591
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,660
Come on Alys, you don't miss
a trick. It's nothing, OK?

592
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,680
I don't even know why she said it.

593
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,800
Megan?

594
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,300
He went all white,
like he was going to be sick.

595
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,400
He's fine, I know he is.

596
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,400
Alys?

597
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,380
Rhodri!

598
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,680
Mam, look what he's done.

599
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,840
Nice one, Rhodri.

600
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,540
"Henry placed the chick in its nest.

601
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,320
"Back where you belong.

602
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,860
"You saved me, cried the chick.

603
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,820
"Henry smiled,

604
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,300
"and you've helped...

605
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,120
"..cure my fear of heights.

606
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,040
Will he be back tomorrow?

607
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm sure he will.

608
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,640
Mm, that reminds me, Thursday.

609
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,740
We forgot your trainers
last week, didn't we?

610
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,160
I won't forget.

611
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,060
Don't you worry about a thing.

612
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,700
OK.

613
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,060
Everything is going to be fine.

614
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,140
No more worrying.

615
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,880
OK. Night-night. Night-night!

616
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,920
Come on.

617
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,120
Night-night.

618
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,040
Night-night.

619
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,820
People don't just go missing.

620
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,480
Even I know that.

621
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,000
Your dad is the most...

622
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,120
..he is the most...

623
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,120
..kindest man...

624
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,680
..and the best Daddy I know.

625
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,720
And he will be back.

626
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,520
OK, my little darling?

627
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,260
Come on, let's get you to bed.

628
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,820
I can go myself.
Want me to tuck you in?

629
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm nine now, Mam.

630
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,640
Want me to tuck you in? Nah.

631
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,940
Well, I don't think
that's good enough, Terry.

632
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,820
He's not just someone.
He is a solicitor.

633
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,720
Well, I've done what I can, Bethan.
No-one can help the red tape.

634
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,500
Are they OK?

635
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,940
Right, babes.

636
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,040
Do you want me to get rid
of these losers?

637
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,860
That sister in law of yours...

638
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,040
I can't even believe that she
and Evan came from the same womb!

639
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,220
Well... I'll handle them.

640
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,860
I have heard that they're sleeping
in separate beds.

641
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,480
What? According to Eira.

642
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,780
Every marriage has its
ups and downs, Faith.

643
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,680
Even Terry and me.

644
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,860
He's had his share
of disappointments,

645
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,720
but we've weathered them.

646
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,420
Look... we're all family, Faith.

647
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,720
We all love Evan,
and we have a right to know.

648
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,320
I expect that'll be our sex
therapist now, if you'll excuse me.

649
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,220
Faith! Bloody brilliant, that's what
you are, mun. Oh... please, no.

650
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,100
All right? 'Avin' din-dins, is it?
Lovely!

651
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,380
Hey, I heard about Evan.

652
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,620
Crazy, isn't it?
Normally such a stiff, isn't he?

653
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,420
I'll put a word out on the street,
all right?

654
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,860
Any time you want a baby-sitter...
I'll know who not to call.

655
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,800
And we'll have that coffee.
Night-night. Sober up.

656
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,100
You know, actually, can you
all just leave now, please?

657
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,800
Yeah, I think that's
a very good idea, actually.

658
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,880
Now you will ring if you
hear anything, OK? Mm-hmm.

659
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,080
Goodnight.

660
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,140
The, er...

661
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,820
missing persons report
gets filed first thing.

662
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,340
So as soon as the 24 hours are up,
I'll be straight on it, all right?

663
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,100
OK, thanks, Terry. OK.

664
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,500
Oh, and if you... do fancy coming
to the pub quiz, you know...

665
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,320
Terry!

666
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,620
Right, do you want me to stay,
keep you company?

667
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,540
No, I just need a bit of time
on my own, darling,

668
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:28,780
that's all, but thank you. OK.

669
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,220
Well, stay strong now, yeah? Mmm.

670
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,260
And hey...

671
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,940
I love you.

672
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,360
I love you too.

673
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,300
Do you know...

674
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,380
Do you know what I would do, though,
babes?

675
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,320
I would go through all his stuff.

676
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,820
I mean...

677
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,000
well, everyone's got secrets,
haven't they?

678
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,700
Night, babes. Goodnight, babes.

679
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,000
Bye-bye.

680
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,040
Fenton?

681
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,860
Alec Fenton...?

682
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,000
What the fuck is going on here,
Evan?

683
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,300
Hello.

684
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,680
Faith? Hello, love,
it's Gareth taxi.

685
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,620
Gareth.

686
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,760
Hi, er... Sorry, I'm...

687
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,040
He's not back, then.

688
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,180
You've heard?

689
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,760
Yeah, I saw something on Facebook,
yeah.

690
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,800
Er...

691
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,280
Yeah, he... left for work
this morning, and, erm...

692
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
..and he never arrived.

693
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,460
Well... I saw his car parked up
just an hour ago.

694
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,980
What?

695
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,380
Where? Where?

696
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,660
Tom's Carvery,
out by the docks road.

697
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,620
Are you sure it's his car, Gareth,
are you sure?

698
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,340
Are you positive it's his car? I
sold it to him, remember? Thank you.

699
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,400
OK, thank you very much.
Thank you, Gar.

700
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,300
I need to go up there.

701
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,640
Bastard.

702
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,480
Be safe.

703
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,000
Mam?

704
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,120
Mam, are you there?

705
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,040
Dad?

706
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,360
Evan?

707
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,600
Evan, it's Faith.

708
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,680
Evan?

709

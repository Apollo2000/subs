162
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:49,857
Oh, God.
Wait a minute.

163
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,609
Hello.
How are you?

164
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,694
- How are you doing?
- Nice to see you. Well.

165
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,812
- I'm Sara.
- Sara, good to see you.

166
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,997
- Miguel, nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

167
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:57,198
- Are the owners here?
(Both) - Here we are.

168
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,449
Oh, there.
Oh, just outside.

169
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,533
We greet you from behind here.

170
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,751
- Oh, excuse me.
- How are you?

171
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,253
I thought you were a customer.

172
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,537
- I'm Lisa. Nice to meet you.
- Lisa, nice to see you.

173
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,423
- I'm Rita.
- Rita, nice to see you both.

174
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,791
Uh, I thought
you were customers.

175
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,092
- I'm so sorry.
- No. No.

176
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:09,393
All right, let's go have
a little seat.

177
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:10,578
Do you normally sit out there?

178
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,779
I didn't know he was coming.

179
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,231
He just came
like a bat out of hell

180
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,517
and went inside.
He didn't even stop.

181
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:18,336
First of all,
I'm happy to be here.

182
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
- You guys are partners, right?
- Yes.

183
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,172
Give me a little bit
of background.

184
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,775
Our parents opened L'Osteria
in '85-- I was four.

185
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,977
Oh, your mom and dad
have a restaurant?

186
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,895
- Yep, five doors down.
- In Boston?

187
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:28,996
- Yes.
- Five doors down?

188
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,114
- Yes.
- Correct.

189
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,800
Right across the street,
diagonally.

190
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,018
- You're kidding me?
<i>- No.</i>

191
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,152
I just walked past it.

192
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,353
- Yes.
- You did.

193
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,156
So, we decided let's try
and open another one.

194
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:42,593
We know what we're doing,
we thought.

195
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,278
Galleria 33,
what does that mean?

196
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:45,930
33 comes from where?

197
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:47,298
Rita-- let Rita explain.

198
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,033
I was 33 when we opened this.

199
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,317
It means nothing to me.

200
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,819
Well, you're not 33 yet.

201
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,888
Wait till the fabulous things

202
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:56,841
start happening when you're 33.

203
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,376
The galleria was like
art gallery.

204
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,777
The art gallery.

205
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,762
We wanted the wall
to be replicas

206
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:03,680
of, like, famous artwork.

207
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,117
And we hired this painter,

208
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,718
if you can call him that,

209
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,704
he started to paint
naked cherubs,

210
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:10,821
and we had to fire him.

211
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,740
- Naked?
- Cherub.

212
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,959
- Oh.
- They were on the ceiling.

213
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,043
They were on the wall.

214
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,561
Like, naked.

215
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:21,482
There was a woman with
her breasts out, like, eating--

216
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,900
who eats dinner like that?

217
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,286
Who eats dinner in the nude?

218
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,921
Are you chewing gum?

219
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:28,723
- No.
<i>(Gordon) - No? What are you chewing?</i>

220
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,924
(Both) I swallowed it.

221
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:33,227
Oh, so you've stopped
chewing gum?

222
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,279
- I don't normally ever chew gum.
- It's not helping.

223
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,064
Yeah, but you shouldn't
be swallowing it either.

224
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,600
I-I was afraid of what you were
gonna say if I said yes.

225
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,703
No, but-- so,
you are chewing gum?

226
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:43,904
I was chewing gum.

227
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,206
And now you've
just swallowed it?

228
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:47,608
Yes.

229
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,760
I went to catholic school.

230
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,762
We used to have to take
the gum and put it on our nose

231
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,048
and spend the whole day
like that, so--

232
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,250
I mean, I don't know why
Chef Ramsay

233
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,902
would have told me
to put gum on my nose.

234
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,987
[Laughs]

235
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,388
May I have a glass of water,
please?

236
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,990
- Sure. Yeah. Okay.
(Gordon) - Thank you.

237
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,226
So, tell me,
how's the business?

238
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,744
We're getting by
by the skin of our teeth.

239
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,447
- It's, like, really--
- No.

240
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,748
We're actually not getting by.

241
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:11,866
- We're, like, in debt.
- Yeah, well--

242
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,384
We lose money
every single month.

243
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:14,685
We're not getting by.

244
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,387
Wow.

245
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,089
I think he said water,
Sara, honey.

246
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,707
- Oh, shit.
- Water?

247
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,008
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Water, please. No, don't worry.

248
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,226
A little bit too early for me.

249
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,228
[Laughter] Wow.

250
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,213
Never too early.
[Laughs]

251
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:27,364
[Laughs] It is.

252
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,749
<i>(Rita) Lisa loves wine.</i>

253
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,151
She likes to drink.

254
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,368
Okay.

255
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,553
She likes to drink?

256
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:34,255
<i>(Rita) She loves wine. She does.</i>

257
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:38,509
While she's working,
have a couple of glasses?

258
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,595
She drinks.
I smoke and she drinks.

259
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,231
I mean, since we're airing
my dirty laundry--

260
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,350
oh, I let her air her own.
Cut that out.

261
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,770
Don't say that she drinks.
Lisa's great.

262
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,172
I didn't think Rita needed

263
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:53,090
to tell Chef Ramsay
that I drink.

264
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:55,876
I think he would have probably
seen that tonight anyway.

265
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,313
How's the servers?

266
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,831
- Mm.
- I--

267
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,032
You're not happy
with the servers?

268
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,869
Well, the servers here
are very temperamental.

269
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,972
And they sit down for hours
at that table behind there.

270
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:09,473
They sit down?

271
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,910
They don't bother checking
their tables, cleaning anything.

272
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:14,328
The customers would have
to get up

273
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,497
with their credit card things
so they could pay.

274
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:17,798
Are you kidding me?

275
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,934
- I swear to God.
- Wow.

276
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,652
I get really nice
customers here.

277
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:23,637
And they should
be getting good service.

278
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:25,356
Thanks for the update.

279
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,576
Is there anything else I need
to know before I get going?

280
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,396
Well, uh, the chef
is my ex-husband.

281
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,497
Say that again.

282
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,232
I was married to him.

283
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,334
The chef is your ex-husband?

284
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,619
It sounds like a soap opera.

285
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,821
Yes.

286
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,858
So, the ex-husband,
what's it like

287
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,259
working together
on a daily basis?

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,077
He's a grouch.

289
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,663
He's difficult,
doesn't take criticisms well.

290
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,416
- But he obviously can cook?
- He can cook, yes.

291
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,501
It's because these are
my parents' recipes

292
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:55,603
that he's cooking.

293
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,955
And he has no recipes
of his own?

294
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,256
Oh, no, no, no.
My dad trained him.

295
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,742
He wasn't a trained chef.

296
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,561
You have to understand,
this is total head fuck.

297
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,096
I know.
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,699
- My head's spinning.
- My head's spinning.

299
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:09,900
(Announcer) Coming up...

300
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:10,985
God.

301
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:12,586
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay digs in.

302
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,072
It's like someone's
thrown up on my plate.

303
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:17,324
(Announcer) And Rita flips out.

304
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,642
Stick your finger
in the ravioli

305
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,027
and tell me it's cold now.

306
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,496
(Announcer) And later,
it's a dinner service

307
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,681
that will have you in shock.

308
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:24,965
He's gonna think you're crazy.

309
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,067
This is horrendous.

310
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,746
(Announcer) After an informative
meeting with owners Lisa and Rita,

311
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,448
Chef Ramsay is anxious
to try the food...

312
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,482
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

313
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,483
- You're welcome.
- Good to meet you.

314
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,968
(Announcer)
Made by head chef Doug,

315
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:46,271
who happens to be
Rita's ex-husband.

316
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,588
He's so nice.

317
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,808
- I like him. He's so nice.
- He's a nice guy.

318
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,528
He's going to eat now?

319
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,612
He's going to eat.

320
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,314
I'll see if
he's still nice after--

321
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,249
Oh, he's gotta be nice.
He's a nice guy.

322
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,768
<i>You know something,</i>
<i>I'm starting to tremble.</i>

323
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:02,470
I don't see you tremble.

324
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:03,972
I'm trembling inside.

325
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:05,006
Oh, inside.

326
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:06,040
How are you?

327
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,592
I'm very good.
I'm Sara.

328
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,710
Sara, nice to see you, darling.

329
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,894
Very nice to meet you.

330
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,012
So, how long
have you been here?

331
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:12,730
- About two years.
- Two years?

332
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,232
You know, you need
to take those heels off,

333
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,850
'cause I can't see.
They're too big.

334
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,151
Well, then stand
in front of me.

335
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,354
No, then he'll see me.

336
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:20,888
I arrived, they sat outside.

337
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,924
- Is that normal?
- It's very normal here.

338
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,892
And Rita mentioned about Lisa
drinking on service.

339
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,093
Does she drink at the end
of the night?

340
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:27,195
Oh, y-yes.

341
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,430
She drinks while customers
are still here.

342
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:30,865
Oh, dear.

343
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,634
The owners, they don't know
how to run the restaurants.

344
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:34,719
And they don't want
to improve themselves

345
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,070
to improve the restaurant.

346
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:37,755
[Shushing] Don't talk to me.

347
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:40,058
- There is no organization at all.
- Wow.

348
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,710
Not here, not in the kitchen,
nowhere.

349
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:43,811
Wow.
That's not good.

350
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,613
They have no responsibility.

351
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,498
They have no concern.

352
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,200
It feels like this place
for them, it's just,

353
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,735
"oh, I'm working."
You're not really working.

354
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,054
Wow. Probably they're
treating it like their--

355
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,239
like their bar as opposed
to their business.

356
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:56,457
Yeah.

357
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:57,675
Why did she say that?

358
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:58,993
'Cause she's an imbecile.

359
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,095
That's not even true.

360
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,597
She's a traitor,
Benedict Arnold.

361
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,035
Skank.

362
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:09,620
Uh, I gotta go for
the homemade gnocchi.

363
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:10,822
- Thank you.
- Homemade gnocchi? Sure.

364
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,023
Yes, please.

365
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,175
And then
a chicken marsala, please.

366
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,476
- Marsala?
- Yeah.

367
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,161
<i>I'll go for the veal paradiso.</i>

368
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,279
Okay. Sure.

369
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,681
What else?

370
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:24,602
I'm really hoping he doesn't
get the seafood ravioli.

371
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,804
They're not--
they're not good.

372
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:29,440
We have seafood ravioli
special.

373
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,643
Oh, my God.

374
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:33,861
I-I'll take it.
Why not?

375
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,496
Okay.

376
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:38,399
Lisa, this bitch is selling
the ravioli special.

377
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:40,101
What is wrong with her?

378
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:42,687
You know, I hate Sara.

Go ahead.

00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,623
No, Sara, it isn't.

382
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:03,925
No.

383
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,760
That's actually
not the case, Sara.

384
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:08,863
You're a fucking freak
and that's a crazy thing to do.

385
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:10,965
I'm gonna kill her.

386
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,303
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.

387
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:21,325
Gnocchi, chicken marsala,
veal paradiso, seafood ravioli.

388
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:22,443
Wow.

389
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,245
He must be very hungry.
[Laughs]

390
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,365
Uh, sir?

391
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:28,783
Have you got two seconds?

392
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,768
I'm so afraid right now.

393
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,019
Why?

394
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,688
'Cause I know
what's coming next.

395
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,423
<i>(Gordon) - What's your first name?</i>
<i>- Pat.</i>

396
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,708
Pat.

397
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:40,244
This for me is a new journey
in life,

398
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,347
because I've always been
a shoe salesman.

399
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,967
Seriously?

400
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,485
- Not a men's shoes salesmen.
<i>(Gordon) - Oh, sorry.</i>

401
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,253
- A women's exclusively.
- So you're not a cobbler?

402
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:50,505
No.

403
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,207
I was gonna say--

404
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,292
Lisa?

405
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:55,593
Right.

406
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,546
It's Pat.
It's Pat.

407
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,132
I don't really even want
to deal with that.

408
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:03,034
How would you rate the food?

409
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:07,388
Uh, the only issue is that
I cannot eat Italian food

410
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,774
because I'm gluten intolerant.

411
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,676
<i>(Gordon) So, what are you here?</i>

412
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,011
I'm a combination
of everything.

413
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,013
I'm, like, manager, slash...

414
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:17,431
Oh, so, you're the manager?

415
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,268
- Everything else.
- Oh, fuck. I didn't know that.

416
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:23,154
- So you're the manager of Galleria?
- Yeah. Galleria.

417
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:26,157
So, general manager/shoe salesman.

418
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,309
- You've been here--
- Uh, I'm also a host.

419
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,995
- You're a host?
- And, like, the bus person, I do it all.

420
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,213
<i>(Gordon) Wow.</i>

421
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:33,714
- Uh, Rita?
- Yes?

422
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,933
Uh, is Pat serious--
the general manager?

423
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,553
He is the busboy.

424
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,238
You're not the general manager?

425
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:41,689
I just assumed that role.

426
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,890
- Oh, you assumed the role?
- Because I take on--

427
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,108
Oh, fuck.

428
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,693
You've just assigned
that role to yourself?

429
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:46,894
I just assigned that role
to myself.

430
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>(Gordon) Oh, fuck me.</i>

431
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,515
- Are you the host?
- I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

432
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,632
- You're sweating?
- Yes.

433
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,717
I'm shitted myself.

434
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,819
I am also shitted myself.

435
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,737
He's the--
he's the busman.

436
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:58,055
And I fired him.

437
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,673
And let me explain to you
what he--

438
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,575
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
You fired him?

439
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,361
I fired him.
<i>(Gordon) - What did you fire him for?</i>

440
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,514
Because he told me that
he was more important than me.

441
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:07,798
And he got me on a bad day.

442
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,817
And I got upset
and I fired him.

443
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:11,903
- Seriously?
(Rita) - So you know what he did?

444
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,138
He got an umbrella--
'cause it was raining that day,

445
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,956
- and he got an umbrella...
<i>(Gordon) - Yes?</i>

446
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,558
...and he would walk by

447
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,844
and look in like
a very sad puppy.

448
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,379
I'm like, "this poor guy."

449
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,797
So, I-I took him back.

450
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,998
I took him back
and now I just let him

451
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,399
tell himself he's the manager.

452
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,019
For everything that
Pat does right,

453
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,537
he does five things wrong.

454
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,839
Go now, go.

455
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:33,774
- Oh, my God.
<i>(Gordon) - Thank you, Pat.</i>

456
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,776
He's so fucking crazy that
it's like,

457
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:37,662
is it really worth
even having him here?

458
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,880
He's-- but it is.

459
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,932
I love Pat.
Pat's good.

460
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,200
You don't feed him 'cause
he's gluten-free, right?

461
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,502
He's so full of shit!

462
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,953
He eats all--

463
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,005
<i>(Gordon) He's, like,
withering away.</i>

464
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,907
Well, he's got
that great metabolism.

465
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,859
I wish I had it,
but we do feed him.

466
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:53,261
Please don't think
we don't feed the staff here.

467
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:54,645
No, I'm just asking.
I-I--

468
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,581
- Okay. Enjoy.
<i>(Gordon) - Okay.</i>

469
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,200
I mean, honestly, I haven't
even tasted the food yet.

470
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:00,885
Oh, my God. Wow.

471
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:03,104
Why do you do it to me?

472
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:07,541
Please, just--
out of my sight.

473
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,043
Oh.

474
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,928
Homemade gnocchi.

475
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:14,582
Excellent.
And it's all homemade?

476
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,467
Uh, yes and no.
[Laughs]

477
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:17,969
- Yes and no?
<i>(Sara) - Frozen.</i>

478
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,887
- What?
- Frozen.

479
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,005
No.
Come on.

480
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,323
Yes, but they're homemade.
That's why--

481
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,025
They're homemade and frozen?

482
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,426
[Italian] Thank you very much.

483
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,511
- You're very welcome.
<i>(Gordon) - Thank you.</i>

484
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,968
Please, a little smile,
a little smile.

485
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,786
Anything at all.
Please eat it.

486
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,305
<i>Stop-- he shook his head.</i>

487
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,806
Fuck my life.

488
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,708
[Gasps] Oh, no. He didn't--

489
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:45,246
Meatballs are rubbery,
bland, and just really--

490
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,649
really solid,
almost like a golf ball.

491
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,934
Not nice.

492
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,185
<i>- Rita?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

493
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,470
<i>(Gordon) Two seconds, love.</i>

494
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:53,671
Lisa, you can come as well.

495
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,072
Stop hiding
behind the coffee machine.

496
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,574
<i>- Were you drinking?</i>
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

497
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,826
<i>(Gordon) - Not a cup?</i>
<i>- No, it was-- no, no, no.</i>

498
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,412
So, the meatballs are,
like, firm, solid

499
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,631
and just, like, dry, bland.

500
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,266
But they're made here?

501
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,567
Mm-hmm.

502
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,868
Well, we make them and
then we freeze them,

503
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,154
because we don't want
to run out of meatballs.

504
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:12,172
<i>(Gordon) Yeah, well, they last up
to two, three days in the fridge.</i>

505
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:15,009
And the difference in having
them seared

506
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:17,395
and cooked in the sauce
rather than defrosted--

507
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,796
<i>the difference</i>
<i>is night and day.</i>

508
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:19,947
Okay.

509
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:23,150
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

510
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,354
This is the beginning
of the end.

511
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:29,407
About 20 minutes ago,
I was wondering what I--

512
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,975
you know,
what I got myself into.

513
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,076
This is not good.

514
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:34,895
I'm scared.
I'm scared.

515
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:47,730
(Announcer) With Chef Ramsay
beginning to question the food...

516
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:49,949
Meatballs are rubbery,
like a golf ball.

517
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,350
(Announcer)
Sisters Rita and Lisa

518
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,569
are looking to Chef Doug
for some answers.

519
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,455
<i>(Rita) This is not
going so well.</i>

520
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,591
The meatballs--
the meatballs are frozen.

521
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,010
- Yeah, what?
- We should make them fresh every two days.

522
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:02,895
Yeah, we make them fresh
every two days.

523
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,048
- We freeze them.
- They're not fresh if they're frozen.

524
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,088
I don't know how many
Italian restaurants he's been,

525
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,492
but the restaurants
that I know, they freeze stuff.

526
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,194
What's in that cup?

527
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,730
<i>(Lisa) It's coffee, Rita.</i>

528
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:23,132
The veal paradiso.

529
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,834
What's inside the veal?

530
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,118
Prosciutto, mozzarella.

531
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:27,653
Wow.

532
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,473
It's like someone's
thrown up on my plate.

533
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:35,111
Please, God, make him
like that at least.

534
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,295
Really bad.

535
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,198
And just gnarly--
overcooked, bland.

536
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,499
[Gasps]

537
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,617
Gross.

538
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,235
What the hell does that mean?

539
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:47,056
It means he didn't like it,
in a nutshell.

540
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,357
How is it?

541
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:50,192
That's definitely not paradise,
let me tell you.

542
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:54,096
The veal is way overcooked,
a bit chewy, salty inside.

543
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,182
The sauce is a mess.
What is it, tomato and vodka?

544
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,117
- Vodka, yes.
<i>(Gordon) - Disgustingly bad.</i>

545
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,919
Wow. Wow. Wow.
Thank you.

546
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:01,320
You're welcome.

547
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,823
Well, let's just pray that
he says gross--

548
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,474
Pray? We're, like,
beyond prayer.

549
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:08,577
I just want somebody
to kill me at this point.

550
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,814
What is he gonna
to be eating next?

551
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:14,100
Oh, yeah, seafood ravioli.

552
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,218
That was the one thing
I was hoping

553
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:18,604
he wasn't going to get,
like, the one thing.

554
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,157
I have the seafood ravioli.

555
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:24,443
And when were they--
are these fresh or--

556
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,061
[Laughs] <i>(Gordon) Oh, no.</i>

557
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:28,097
- Frozen.
<i>- Frozen?</i>

558
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,282
Do you think customers
come to the North End

559
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,602
to come and eat in a restaurant
with frozen raviolis?

560
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,122
Definitely not.
I won't, myself.

561
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,073
Who the fuck serves
fresh ravioli?

562
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:42,161
- I mean--
- Nobody serves fresh ravioli anywhere.

563
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,279
Homemade ravioli
in this neighborhood--

564
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,482
These people don't even know
how to make homemade ravioli.

565
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:47,883
That's the God honest truth.

566
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,401
I bet if you go to the
restaurant across the street

567
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,854
and ask, "do you know how
to make a homemade ravioli?"

568
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,606
She'll look at you
and make you a matzo ball.

569
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:55,608
She doesn't know.

570
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:57,643
Wow.
Disgusting--

571
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,345
just layers of gunk.

572
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:00,763
So, this is special?

573
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:03,549
Actually it's a special
that we have 12 months a year.

574
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,301
So this is the special
of the year?

575
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:08,604
[Laughs] Yes.

576
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,506
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Wow. Do I feel special.</i>

577
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:11,690
Thank you.

578
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,643
And-- and in two years,
has he ever changed it?

579
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,428
Oh, fuck.

580
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,931
- There's a special very two years?
- I think yes.

581
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,883
Since we have that,
we never really change--

582
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:23,969
[Laughs]

583
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,623
I want Sara strangled.

584
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:29,324
You know, she's having
a good time 'cause

585
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,427
it's not her business
on the line,

586
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:34,313
but I got something for her.

587
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,950
[Laughs]
A special every 700 days.

588
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,068
I'm so sorry.

589
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,470
I don't know what else to say.

590
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,988
Oh, man.

591
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:46,241
This is too much.
This is too much.

592
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:49,295
I wanna go die
in a corner somewhere.

593
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,847
Wow. Chicken marsala?

594
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:52,848
Yes, and it's fresh.

595
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:54,033
And it's fresh?
Excellent.

596
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,452
- This is a side.
- Excellent.

597
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,287
Whew.
Chicken marsala.

598
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,573
Looks more like chicken
and mushroom soup.

599
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,691
[Gasps] He's talking.
He's whispering.

600
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,792
It can't be good.

601
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:05,077
If it's a whisper,
it can't be good.

602
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,229
Uh, wow.

603
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,931
Wow, wow, wow.

604
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:11,734
I'm hoping it tastes better
than it looks.

605
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:14,954
[Giggles]

606
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,772
[Giggles] That is a joke.

607
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:19,575
You know, live it up, girls.

608
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,794
There's a Michelin chef
in here ripping our food apart,

609
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:23,913
and you guys are giggling away.

610
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:25,497
And I'm about to throw up.

611
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:26,715
[Laughter]

612
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,784
[Shushing]
Shut up. He's chewing.

613
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:30,736
Fuck.

614
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,674
The salt, the salt--
he's salting everything.

615
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,977
Where is he?

616
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,597
Way too sweet
and just bland--

617
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:44,016
no salt.

618
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,669
Is Doug allergic to salt?

619
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,737
- I don't think so.
- Ask him.

620
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:50,356
<i>(Sara) I don't think so.</i>

621
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,075
(Lisa) I didn't realize Chef
Ramsay would be so unhappy.

622
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:55,261
He's been kind of mean.

623
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:57,363
You know, I take it back.

624
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,314
I said he was nice.

625
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,816
And what's dessert?

626
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,519
- We only have tiramisu.
<i>- Wow.</i>

627
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,920
And we are even out of it.

628
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,539
[Laughs] For real.

629
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,257
- So you've ran out of dessert?
- Yes.

630
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,443
- We have tiramisu.
- Nope.

631
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:13,595
We have one dessert
and we've run out.

632
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:14,980
Isn't that crazy?

633
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,181
We're out of tiramisu.

634
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,499
I didn't even know.

635
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:19,802
I really didn't.

636
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:22,821
Pat, two seconds,
but... quick.

637
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:24,640
<i>I need the manager.</i>

638
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:28,560
<i>(Gordon) The restaurant
L'Osteria, yeah?</i>

639
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,579
Can you run over there and
get me one portion of tiramisu?

640
00:22:30,664 --> 00:22:32,081
I am fucking starving.

641
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,766
- One portion of tiramisu?
<i>(Gordon) - Quick.</i>

642
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,618
- Okay.
<i>- Quick as you can.</i>

643
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,904
Hi, Pat, honey,
where are you going?

644
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,422
To get a piece of tiramisu.

645
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,060
<i>He's on his way.</i>

646
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:46,345
<i>There he goes.</i>

647
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,347
Whose idea was this?
Yours.

648
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,249
- No. This was your idea.
- No, I planned it.

649
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,300
It was your fucking idea.

650
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:55,988
Bring him a fork.

651
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,906
He doesn't like anything,

652
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:00,426
so he's gonna like that either.

653
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,061
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

654
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:03,646
- How are you?
- Good. I'm Lena. Nice to meet you.

655
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,531
- This is my mama.
- Lena, nice to see you.

656
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:07,266
Excellent.
I can't wait to taste that.

657
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:09,484
[Italian] Thank you very much.

658
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,072
All right.

659
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,228
Excuse me.
Can I--

660
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,313
can I please say hello
to your mom again?

661

<i>(Rita) Come on, ma.</i>

662
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:23,766
Go ahead, you're gonna
get yelled at.

663
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,150
- Your turn.
<i>(Rita) - So scared.</i>

664

<i>Oh God.</i>

665
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:29,204
Mama.

666
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:32,391
First, I need to do something.

667
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,109
<i>Bellissimo.</i>
<i>[Speaks Italian]</i>

668
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,228
Delicious. I mean, really.
[Laughs]

669
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,646
Oh, my God.

670
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,148
- He likes ma.
- That was delicious.

671
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,049
- Thank God he likes something.
- Thank you so much.

672
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,268
I mean, amazing.
Whose recipe is that?

673
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:45,387
Your recipe?

674
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,489
Really good,
really good indeed.

675
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,891
We got a winner--
from L'Osteria.

[Glass shattering]

677
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:53,929
- Fuck!
- What the hell was that?

678
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,014
What happened?

679
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,532
God.

horrified by the food...

[Glass shattering]

00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,759

- Fuck.

683

(Announcer) Lisa and
Rita's day is not exactly

684
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,463
heading
in a positive direction.

685
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:17,266
Oh, the fridge broke.

686
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,267
'Cause--

687
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,102
I don't even wanna say
what else could go wrong,

688
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:22,487
because God might answer me.

689

(Announcer) And it's
unlikely to get any better

as Chef Ramsay
meets Head Chef Doug.

691
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:30,445
How are you?
First name?

692
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:31,630
- Douglas.
- Douglas.

693
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:33,848
Let's have a chat
with the owners.

694
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,267
Just stand next
to your, uh, wife.

695
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:36,268
Ex.

696
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:37,486
Ex, yeah, sorry.

697
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,389
[Chuckles] It's okay.

698
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:42,424
First of all,
how long have you been cooking?

699
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:45,627
- Mm, since '94.
- '94?

700
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:47,112
And you're the head chef?

701
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,965
If we can call it that.

702
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,166
Well, you're leading
the kitchen, let's get it--

703
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,267
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

704
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:54,870
When they let me, anyway.

705
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,488
<i>(Rita) - Who's they?</i>
<i>- Who's they?</i>

706
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,006
Yeah, I-- he certainly
doesn't mean me,

707
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:59,607
'cause I don't hold you back
to do anything.

708
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,109
Who in the hell
are you talking about?

709
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:03,312
Yeah, I'd really like to know.

710
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:05,247
I know you're not
looking at me.

711
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:07,633
Some things that
I want to do my way,

712
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,051
you know,
it's always like--

713
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,452
In other words,
he wants full control.

714
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:12,788
If I'm gonna be in the kitchen,
I want full control.

715
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,589
- But you do have full control.
<i>(Rita) - You have full control.</i>

716
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:15,691
<i>Nobody bothers you.</i>

717
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,392
Listen, I want to go back
to the food.

718
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,878
This man has taken time
out of his schedule to be here.

719
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,413
I want to talk about
frozen meatballs.

720
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,831
- Okay.
- Okay.

721
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:25,117
- Who's running the kitchen?
- I do.

722
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,235
Okay.

723
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,971
Um, let's talk about lunch.

724
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:30,255
Yeah?

725
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:33,074
The food was dated,
bland, boring,

726
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:35,110
and way below par,

727
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:37,512
in one of
the most competitive streets

728
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,614
anywhere in this country.

729
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:41,116
When was the last time
you went out for dinner

730
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,751
in the neighborhood?

731
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,753
I don't know.

732
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:48,740
I just go to Chinese food
sometimes.

733
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:51,493
Chinese food?

734
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:52,794
[Sighs]

735
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,980
Okay.
What about the meatball?

736
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:57,916
The meatball,
we make it and then--

737
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,035
- Freeze them?
- Freeze them, yeah.

738
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,637
And the veal paradiso,
way overcooked,

739
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:04,339
just drowned in sauce.

740
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,958
Doug, customers
cook better at home.

741
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:08,460
The food was shocking.

742
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:11,063
And just no seasoning, no care.

743
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,400
Honestly,
you're not giving your best.

744
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:18,403
The homemade gnocchi,
it's not homemade right?

745
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,455
Well, I know how to make it.

746
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:22,140
I used to make it every day.

747
00:26:22,258 --> 00:26:23,358
(Gordon) The ravioli?

748
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:25,460
I used to make those too.

749
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,961
You know,
that's a pain in the neck.

750
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,197
I need somebody
with extra time to help me.

751
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,400
Doug, I would be willing
to help you make pasta.

752
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,838
See, that's the attitude.

753
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:39,741
Very-- he doesn't
respond to much.

754
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:40,926
(Gordon) What do you
mean he doesn't respond?

755
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,677
- He just-- you know--
- We're running a business.

756
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,863
- I know.
- Wow.

757
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,364
And what is it between you two?

758
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,066
Why is there so much
animosity there?

759
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:49,668
He's just--
that's just him.

760
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:52,104
That's just him?

761
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:56,208
Are you lazy?

762
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,642
No, I'm not.

763
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
What I'm trying to say is,

764
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,245
you've just gone through
the motions.

765
00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:02,864
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

766
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:04,866
You're not making
anything fresh.

767
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,502
You have turned the restaurant

768
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:09,988
into something dysfunctional
just for convenience.

769
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,941
- You knew I was coming today, right?
- Yeah, I knew.

770
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:16,027
So why couldn't you cook
for me from the heart?

771
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,029
Because if I'm going
to treat you special,

772
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,982
then I gotta treat
everybody special.

773
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,085
So you feel better
serving me frozen shit

774
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,686
than you cooking your best?

775
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,772
I-I'm just being honest.

776
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,106
Let me ask you this,

777
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:30,525
how can a seafood ravioli
be special if it's frozen

778
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,327
and it's been on the menu

779
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:33,962
- as a special for two years?
- Well, we get it frozen.

780
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:36,264
What's so fucking
special about that?

781
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,866
You've only got one dessert on

782
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,668
and even that ran out
a week ago.

783
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,402
We do have it.

784
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,587
Where is it then?

785
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:45,090
- Um-- we don't.
- No.

786
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,391
- We don't?
<i>- No.</i>

787
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,809
- Well--
- You don't know?

788
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,244
Do you guys communicate?

789
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:50,529
I mean, help me.

790
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:51,730
<i>(Lisa)</i>
<i>I know. I know.</i>

791
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,231
But there's really
not much that--

792
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,849
I mean, you can't even
get through to him.

793
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:56,684
- So how am I supposed to--
- But you're the owners.

794
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,770
I know.

795
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,188
Do you think this restaurant
has a future

796
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:02,073
serving frozen meatballs?

797
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,326
Not only was my lunch bland,
disappointing,

798
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,728
but whatever little customers
you've got now,

799
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:09,214
I'm amazed they're in here.

800
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,065
Tonight, I want to see
this place functional.

801
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,767
I want to see how you operate,
what you do,

802
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:13,952
I want to see how you
run the line.

803
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,070
<i>(Sisters) Okay.</i>

804
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:16,271
I'll see you later.

805
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:18,490
- All righty.
- Bye. Thank you.

806
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:22,310
Oh, my God.

807
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,396
He's left the building.

808
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,348
That was really, really hard.

809
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:30,451
Stop looking at me, Pat,
because this is your fault.

810
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:32,053
It would've been easier
to have been

811
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,888
hung by the roof
by my toenails.

812
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,390
[Sighs] God.

813
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,594
You could make some pasta.

814
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:42,914
And get rid of those
seafood ravioli.

815
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:44,916
I want them out of here.

816
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,134
Okay.

817
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:47,835
I hate you.
This was your idea.

818
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:49,971
- No, this was definitely your idea.
- No.

819
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:51,857
- This was definitely your idea.
- No, it wasn't.

820
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,775
- It was your idea.
- No, it wasn't.

821
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,894
<i>I'm gonna go smoke.</i>

822
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,652
<i>(Lisa) Listen, tonight, if
anybody does anything crazy,</i>

823
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:05,687
<i>you're fired.</i>

824
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:07,789
<i>Rita, tell 'em to chill out,</i>

825
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,441
'cause I'm leaving tonight
if you fuck with me.

826
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,692
I'm really leaving.

827
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:12,494
Ramsay. And I'm not
calling him chef!

828
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:14,496
I'm calling him Ramsay and
that's what I'm calling him.

829
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:16,198
Mr. Ramsay at least.

830
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:17,599
Call him Mr. Ramsay.

831
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,933
Listen, respect he deserves.

832
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,036
- He's coming!
- Fuck my life.

833
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,537
He's already shitted
on the food.

834
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:24,839
Like, I'm waiting for him
to see us

835
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,074
run the front of the house,

836
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,275
and yell at us about that.

837
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,161
Doug, tiramisu on?

838
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,879
No?
Can't be bothered?

839
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:32,981
Nope.

840
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,349
(Gordon) No, can't be bothered.

841
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,919
Wow. Anyway, uh,
so take me through the line.

842
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:40,021
<i>Who's running what station?</i>

843
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:42,574
We usually don't
work on stations.

844
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,242
You don't work on stations
either?

845
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,860
Holy fuck.
It's getting worse.

846
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,545
Oh, my God.

847
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:50,898
(Announcer) Every Saturday night,
Boston's North End is packed...

848
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,183
- Hi.
<i>- How are you?</i>

849
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:53,802
<i>- Good. How are you, honey?</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

850
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,437
(Announcer) And as a
result, it's the one night

851
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,140
that La Galleria 33
is filled with customers.

852
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,442
My name is Sara and I'm gonna
be your server for tonight.

853
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:03,244
Um, I'm gonna have
the sausage cacciatore.

854
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:04,379
Give me the veal francaise,
please.

855
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:05,380
Veal francaise?

856
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:07,482
Oh, my God, my nerves.

857
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,588
Sir, whenever it's ready,
we can take table one.

858
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,740
Doug, who, uh--
who talks to who?

859
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,543
Who communicates here?

860
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,266
Anybody?

861
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:28,787
Doug, who communicates here?

862
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:33,491
- I can't hear anything.
- Yeah.

863
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:36,728
Who's-- who's, uh--

864
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,847
Oh, so there's no--
there's no timing?

865
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:44,386
Chicken Alfredo,
chicken Galleria.

866
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,388
Yeah, coming.

867
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,867
You've just--

868
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,969
You've just dropped that
on the floor.

869
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:03,054
Look at me.

870
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:05,607
You just dropped it
on the floor.

871
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:06,791
You can't cook it.

872
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,710
[Rings bell]

873
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,212
Doug, you've just
dropped it on the floor.

874
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:18,753
Uh, Rita, Lisa, both of you,
just two seconds.

875
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:20,672
Sorry, this is
sending me crazy.

876
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:21,773
Hello. What?

877
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,775
He just dropped the chicken
on the floor

878
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,677
and put it back in the pan.

879
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:28,162
- Wait a minute.
- This one here.

880
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,131
- Come on, guys.
- Are you serious, Doug?

881
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:32,133
Wait a minute,
he dropped it on the floor

882
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,019
and cooked it,
what-- what do you mean?

883
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:35,653
Am I on my own here or what?

884
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,272
No, you're not.
That's crazy.

885
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,973
Could you start that again
or not?

886
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:39,958
What?

887
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:41,976
Can you start that again?

888
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:43,895
It's there.

889
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:45,814
That's the one
that dropped on the floor.

890
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:47,415
It's okay.

891
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,117
It's good enough to eat it.

892
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,852
I'm not here
to make you look stupid.

893
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,153
But when I stop a chef
from serving

894
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:53,555
fucking chicken
dropped on the floor--

895
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:55,440
I mean, honestly, you guys

896
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,042
look like a bunch
of fucking idiots.

897
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:59,377
This is fucking crazy.

898
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:11,984
(Announcer) It's only minutes into a
busy Saturday night dinner service,

899
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,587
and Chef Ramsay
has already observed

900
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:19,641
just how low the standards
are at Galleria 33.

901
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:21,143
He just dropped
the chicken on the floor

902
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:22,528
and put it back in the pan.

903
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,230
Honestly, you guys look like
a bunch of fucking idiots.

904
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,049
- Wait a minute.
- This one here.

905
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:28,767
Why would you cook
a fucking piece of chicken

906
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:29,785
that you dropped on the floor?

907
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,821
You know,
it makes me question his--

908
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,607
not his intelligence,
but I mean--

909
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,609
yeah, I guess--
yeah, his intelligence.

910
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,210
Fuck it now.

911
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:40,162
Normally, you would never
cook something

912
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:41,363
that fell on the floor.

913
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:43,165
Why would you have done that?

914
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,750
He's going to think
you're crazy.

915
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,568
- Throw it out.
- Yeah.

916
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,605
Over here.

917
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,106
<i>(Lisa) I don't think
he's serving that.</i>

918
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:52,708
- I mean, I don't know what he does.
- If I didn't say--

919
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,009
It's disgusting,
but he's not serving it.

920
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:55,744
What is it with you
wiping his ass?

921
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:57,245
I'm not, but I don't
wanna be portrayed

922
00:32:57,347 --> 00:32:58,547
as a restaurant
who serves chicken

923
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:00,132
that's been dropped
on the floor.

924
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:02,484
- I tried to stop him from doing it.
- I don't know. He's nuts.

925
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,069
It fell on the floor.

926
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:05,421
That's-- he's nuts.

927
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:07,189
- I don't know.
- And picked it up, dusted it.

928
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:08,907
Yeah, I get it, but he's not
going to serve it.

929
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:10,125
I'm not looking for this stuff.

930
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,327
I walked right into it.

931
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:12,911
I was standing by his side
watching the line work.

932
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,129
But he started a new one.

933
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,215
So you see, it's no...

934
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:18,350
Oh, fuck me.

935
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,371
Oh, my God.

936
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,156
I would like to know
when Douglas

937
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:26,108
has ever picked something
off the floor and--

938
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:27,710
- Never, ever.
- Ever, ever, ever.

939
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,411
Why would he have done that?

940
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,297
Did he purposely do that?

941
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:35,351
(Announcer) While Doug
continues to work in silence,

942
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:38,237
food still manages
to get out to the diners.

943
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:39,755
- Chicken parm?
- Chicken parm.

944
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,075
And the ravioli was for you.

945
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,394
(Announcer) But the customers
are anything but reserved

946
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:48,731
when expressing
how they feel about his dishes.

947
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:51,934
How did the appetizer taste
for you?

948
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:53,535
It's not fresh.

949
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:54,720
But I can try to send
one of the owners

950
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:55,971
over this way
if you would like.

951
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:58,674
- Yes, please.
- Absolutely.

952
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:00,275
Lisa, they wanted
to speak to someone.

953
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,077
- Who?
- Uh, the four top over there.

954
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:03,896
<i>(Lisa) Okay.
I don't want to hear a complaint.</i>

955
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:05,514
I don't want to hear it.

956
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:06,815
I don't want to hear it.

957
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,100
Send Rita.

958
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,252
I don't like dealing
with angry, irate people.

959
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:12,354
I usually just
refer them to Rita.

960
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:13,639
The four top over there,

961
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,140
they would like to speak
to one of the owners.

962
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:17,559
- Oh, yeah, send Lisa. I'm busy.
- I tried, she said no.

963
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:18,894
All right,
I'm not going anywhere.

964
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,913
Lisa should
deal with complaints,

965
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:22,181
because I don't
handle that well.

966
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,833
I would rather just not deal.

967
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,935
(Announcer) The owners may
have decided not to deal

968
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,320
with disgruntled customers....

969
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:30,039
It's all burnt.

970
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:32,441
(Announcer) But that doesn't
stop the complaints from coming.

971
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:34,176
How is it going?

972
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,978
- Yeah, not really good.
- Really?

973
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,362
<i>Very charcoal-y.</i>

974
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:38,964
People are complaining
about the food.

975
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:41,300
Lisa or Rita will not
talk to the customers,

976
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,001
and they get
so pissed about it.

977
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,420
But it's very usual for me.

978
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:46,522
It's not like
this is the first time I see it.

979
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,257
This is supposed
to be medium rare.

980
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,892
It's well done.
<i>(Gordon) - Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

981
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,360
It looks like a bonfire.

982
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:54,446
Rita, when you
see a bone that is thicker

983
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:55,998
than the actual eye
of the meat,

984
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:57,299
it's like a dog chew.

985
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:58,400
My food is good.

986
00:34:58,485 --> 00:34:59,601
I still think it's good.

987
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:01,186
How are you gonna
get it to be medium rare?

988
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:02,504
That's the question.
I mean--

989
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:04,339
Why are you
on such a defense mechanism?

990
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,542
Well, because even
the customers complaining--

991
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:07,943
when they're right,
I'll take it.

992
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:10,979
What I can't take
is the garbage.

993
00:35:11,064 --> 00:35:12,364
Wow.

994
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,005
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened? Come over.

995
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,460
Cold? No, this one's
actually hot in the middle.

996
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:27,346
- What's wrong?
- They said it's cold in the middle.

997
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:28,464
I stuck my finger in it.

998
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:31,150
- It's hot in the middle.
- Let me see.

999
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:32,851
It's not warm.

1000
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,203
It's still hot.

1001
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,988
He tells me it's not,
but it is.

1002
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,890
- That's cold.
- No, it's not.

1003
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,008
The way I am, like,

1004
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:42,177
I'm gonna go over there
and tell the lady, like,

1005
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:43,645
"stick your finger
in the ravioli

1006
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,847
and tell me it's cold now."

1007
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,932
I'm, like,
ready to stab somebody.

1008
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,684
Whose ravioli was this?

1009
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:51,270
It's table five, the four top.

1010
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:54,273
Hi, who had these ravioli?

1011
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,024
- I'm so sorry. Hello.
- Hi.

1012
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:57,926
Were these yours?

1013
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:00,412
All of these ravioli,
they weren't cold.

1014
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,314
So I was just wondering--

1015
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,566
I don't know, the one
that I bit into was cold.

1016
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:06,268
Oh, no, no.
This is definitely your plate.

1017
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,569
- Yes.
- I took it right from the waiter.

1018
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:08,654
Yeah, I know it's mine.

1019
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:09,872
And I stuck my finger--

1020
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,707
The one that she handed
to me to eat was cold.

1021
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,009
They're all hot,
so I'm just curious--

1022
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,911
- They weren't-- weren't hot to us.
- By that time,

1023
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:17,095
I don't know.

1024
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:18,730
So they were cold
when they got here

1025
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:20,482
and then got hot
when they came back?

1026
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,234
- Just-- I'm just curious.
- I--

1027
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:23,635
I'm trying
to understand why--

1028
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:25,537
Uh, you seem like you're
kind of not happy with me.

1029
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,989
It's not that I'm not happy.

1030
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:28,273
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

1031
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:30,592
And they're all hot,
so I'm just wondering--

1032
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:31,993
Oh, my God.

1033
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:35,130
Rita, to me, that was
very, very unprofessional.

1034
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:42,971
My apologies. You've got
every right to complain.

1035
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:44,857
I think somebody's forgotten
that customers are king, right?

1036
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:46,058
<i>Yeah.</i>

1037
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:47,075
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

1038
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,111
Thank you.

1039
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:51,797
This is fucking ridiculous.

1040
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:54,399
Well, let's see how many more
complaints we can go on.

1041
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:55,901
I think you're overreacting.

1042
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:57,252
I mean, as owners,

1043
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:59,238
can anything bounce off you
and get on with it or--

1044
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,039
- I'm still here.
- No, no, no.

1045
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,492
- My skin is thicker than hers.
- Barely, barely.

1046
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:05,894
I feel like I'm in, like,
a sea of devils.

1047
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:07,296
I feel like
he brought this upon us.

1048
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,097
I thought you were going
to come in there and help us.

1049
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:11,733
And, like, everybody
is complaining.

1050
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:12,934
What do you want me to do?

1051
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:14,620
I mean, you're asking me
to stop the complaints?

1052
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:16,221
You sound like
a petulant teenager.

1053
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,439
How so?

1054
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:19,374
Well, 'cause you're just
on the defense.

1055
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,376
We love the food here
and we think it's good.

1056
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:23,679
I'm gonna disagree,
'cause the food's not good.

1057
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,964
I don't think my food is bad.

1058
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:28,517
Am I in denial?

1059
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,718
I don't think I am,

1060
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:31,420
but I keep saying
that my food is good,

1061
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:34,456
so that's, like, a sign
of somebody being in denial.

1062
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,657
- Ladies, welcome.
- Hello.

1063
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:37,659
How was that, my darling?

1064
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:43,498
No?
Let me just check.

1065
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:49,838
What has happened to the chef?

1066
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:50,923
He's in the kitchen.

1067
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,026
Do you wanna go see
what he's doing?

1068
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:56,528
Wow, gets worse.

1069
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:00,983
They're all open--
dead, dirty mussels.

1070
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:02,183
<i>Douglas, Rita.</i>

1071
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,485
I'm sorry.
What is he saying now?

1072
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:05,621
They're all--
they're all open.

1073
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:08,724
They're all open.

1074
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,425
And they're not clean,
they're dead.

1075
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,027
Lisa, the mussels are dirty.

1076
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:13,745
And more importantly,
they're all open.

1077
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:14,846
What does an open mussel mean?

1078
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:16,264
- It's dead.
- It's dead, yeah.

1079
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:19,368
So why are they in here then?

1080
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:21,186
So where are the dead ones
going?

1081
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:23,588
<i>(Lisa) In the trash.</i>

1082
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:24,823
Yeah, I know they're going,
but when?

1083
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,743
Chef Ramsay's really
negative and critical,

1084
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,428
and it's pissing me off.

1085
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,629
I want him to get fuck out.

1086
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:32,481
Let me tell you something.

1087
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:35,284
Get rid of the dead mussels
before we kill somebody.

1088
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:37,085
Oh, my God.

1089
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:47,085
(Announcer) It's two hours into
dinner service and Chef Ramsay

1090
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,137
has now confirmed
the main problem

1091
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,223
here at La Galleria 33,

1092
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,142
owners Rita and Lisa
are in denial.

1093
00:38:54,227 --> 00:38:56,161
We love the food here
and we think it's good.

1094
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:57,279
The food's not good.

1095
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,880
(Announcer)
And to make matters worse,

1096
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:01,166
head chef Doug's
practices in the kitchen

1097
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:02,584
are completely careless.

1098
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:03,902
Dead, dirty mussels--

1099
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:06,221
you could
fucking kill somebody.

1100
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:08,423
(Announcer) So Chef Ramsay
wants to take a closer look

1101
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:13,061
at what is lurking below
at La Galleria 33.

1102
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:15,047
Rotten, gooey as fuck.

1103
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,348
When the fresh onions come in,

1104
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:18,483
you'd think they'd
get rid of the old ones.

1105
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,322
They're rotten.

1106
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,526
I wanna show more rotten shit.

1107
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,843
I wanna show you
something, quickly.

1108
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:30,128
You always
know a chef inside out

1109
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:31,229
when you look at his fridge.

1110
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,764
<i>(Rita) Okay.</i>

1111
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,266
What's happened over here
over the last three months?

1112
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:36,968
'Cause they've been using
onions, peeling them in here

1113
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,770
and leaving all the bits
of shit in there.

1114
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:41,006
90% of them soft as fuck.

1115
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:42,908
- Oh, puke.
- Oh, yeah. And look.

1116
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:44,309
Have you any idea
how long it takes

1117
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,027
for an onion to go that rotten?

1118
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:47,562
- No. - No.
- About two months.

1119
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:49,448
I said to you earlier,
I sensed that there's

1120
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:52,667
a lazy stream running
through this restaurant.

1121
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:53,769
I'm questioning Doug.

1122
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:57,005
I feel like
I've trusted too much

1123
00:39:57,106 --> 00:40:00,092
that he would do the right thing
without watching.

1124
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,245
Oh, fuck. Wow.

1125
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:06,348
This one's just packed
with frozen pasta.

1126
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:07,949
What the fuck are they?

1127
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:09,251
<i>(Lisa)</i>
<i>Those are porcini ravioli.</i>

1128
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:11,286
<i>(Gordon) Oh, my God.
Porcini, wow.</i>

1129
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:15,474
A frozen ravioli
is not horrendous. It's not.

1130
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:19,627
Like, I've-- I've eaten
frozen raviolis, it's not--

1131
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:21,313
it's not that bad.

1132
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,397
What are those?

1133
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,316
- Those are cannelloni.
- Cannelloni?

1134
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:25,851
- Yes.
- You are kidding me.

1135
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,052
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>And who puts them together?</i>

1136
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:28,670
- Douglas.
- And when's it from?

1137
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:29,955
I don't know.

1138
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,272
Cannelloni, flat as a crepe.

1139
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:33,091
Is this what your father
was teaching him?

1140
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,493
<i>(Rita) No.</i>

1141
00:40:34,594 --> 00:40:36,995
Oh, my God.

1142
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:38,213
What are they?

1143
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:39,331
The frozen meatballs
that you've eaten.

1144
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:40,448
Oh, they're
the frozen meatballs.

1145
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,251
- Yeah, they're defrosting.
- Wow.

1146
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:44,953
I don't think you two
should be running a restaurant.

1147
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:46,454
- Why?
- Why?

1148
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:47,672
Because I don't think you
give a shit.

1149
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,775
<i>- No, we do.</i>
<i>- We totally do.</i>

1150
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:51,376
Honestly, if you were cooking at
home tomorrow for your family,

1151
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,395
I can guarantee you'd be
cooking better food

1152
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,313
at home than you serve
in your restaurant.

1153
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:57,732
And what's shocked me so far
since I've been here,

1154
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:00,135
no one has any pride

1155
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:02,437
in what they're
doing or saying.

1156
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,272
And you should not
be running a business.

1157
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:07,075
He's trying to point out
all our flaws.

1158
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,060
And he's being ultra critical
about everything.

1159
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,613
We're dead.

1160
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:13,715
I'm sick of hearing it.

1161
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:17,335
No, you can't do that.

1162
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:18,637
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1163
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:20,138
- You can't do that.
- Rita.

1164
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:22,357
- You're the owner.
- No, I can't. I've had enough.

1165
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,543
I'm just over the whole thing.

1166
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:26,127
I just want to run away.

1167
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,979
I'm out.
I can't do this.

1168
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:29,281
- This is humiliating.
- All right.

1169
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:30,899
I'll have him just
do the yelling to me.

1170
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,417
No. It's not that, Rita.

1171
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,019
Douglas is dropping
chicken on the floor.

1172
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,520
People are complaining.

1173
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,239
It's a bunch of shit.

1174
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,541
I didn't sign up of this.
I'm not doing this.

1175
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,359
I'm just not fucking doing it.

1176
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,378
It's ridiculous.
He's a douche bag.

1177
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:44,679
<i>He doesn't want to help us.</i>

1178
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,481
I don't think you should
call Chef Ramsay a douche bag.

1179
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:47,916
<i>(Lisa) He doesn't care.</i>

1180
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,302
His eyes are on us.

1181
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:52,103
- His eyes are on us?
- Yes.

1182
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,722
His eyes are on us.

1183
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:55,640
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1184
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:57,042
Rita's riding this wave
of like,

1185
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,459
"yeah,
Chef Ramsay is right."

1186
00:41:58,544 --> 00:41:59,961
I mean, I'm happy that

1187
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,347
she thinks
this was all worth it.

1188
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,799
I'm out of here.

1189
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:06,284
- I'll do it by myself.
- Where's Lisa?

1190
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:08,386
- She left.
- She's leaving.

1191
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,626
Lisa, you go, I'm going.

1192
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:15,794
I didn't sign up for this.

1193
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,429
Well, I don't give a fuck
what signed up--

1194
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,880
- Mr. Ramsay, I didn't sign up for this.
- Let me tell you something.

1195
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,682
You walk out,
I'm out, straight up.

1196
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:21,766
- Okay.
- I've had enough.

1197
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:23,268
I want him to get
the fuck out of here.

1198
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:25,003
I want him to leave.
He's in my space.

1199
00:42:25,104 --> 00:42:26,321
None of you give a shit.

1200
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:28,423
That's bullshit.
It's bullshit.

1201
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,808
- I care. I care.
- You care?

1202
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:32,143
- Yeah, I do. - What, by wiping
the ass of a chef like that?

1203
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,945
- He dropped a chicken on the floor.
- Listen, listen.

1204
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:35,947
- He picked it back up and
started cooking it. - Yep, I get that.

1205
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:37,566
- Well, you're just making excuses for him.
- We're not serving that.

1206
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,767
No, I don't give
a fuck about him.

1207
00:42:38,868 --> 00:42:40,085
I don't even like him.

1208
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:41,703
If I didn't see it, you would
be fucking serving it.

1209
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:44,038
- No, he would not have.
- Are you deluded?

1210
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,391
- No, I'm not deluded. - How do you
know he wouldn't have served it?

1211
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:47,425
Well, I know he wouldn't have.

1212
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:48,627
So why was he cooking it then?

1213
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:49,828
What the fuck do I know.
He's nuts.

1214
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,363
If you take off,
I'm going as well.

1215
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,182
- You go, I go.
- Okay.

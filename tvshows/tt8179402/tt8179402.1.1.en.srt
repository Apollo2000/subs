00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,916
No sleep around here.

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,916
Feckin' sheep!

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,833
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20…

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,666
Feckin' sheep.

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,416
What's wrong with ya?

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,625
Where's your mate?

8
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,666
Hmm?

9
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,041
Out there?

10
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:22,958
Oh shit!

11
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,500
Huh?

35
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,875
Wow. You are so lost.

36
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,250
I'm impressed with your confidence
in the face of complete ignorance.

37
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,541
Issue is, you're overcommitted.
I mean, you're essentially running.

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,791
And now that I'm here, you can't give me
the satisfaction of turning around...

39
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,416
I don't need help, but thanks.

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,458
I don't remember offering it.

41
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,791
So presumptuous.

42
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,041
You must be a fairy.

43
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,416
I <i>am</i> a fairy.

44
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,125
Sorry, that's just something
I never thought I would say.

45
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,916
It's an odd thing,

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,642
considering you're standing
in a courtyard of a college for fairies.

47
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,125
We don't have a lot of those
where I'm from.

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,000
And what realm are you from?

49
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,000
California.

50
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,750
- Oh, you're not from the Otherworld?
- I'm not.

51
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,708
If you want your mind blown,
three months ago,

52
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,458
I didn't even know the Otherworld existed.

53
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,791
Um…

54
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,000
If you are lost,
which I'm not saying you are,

55
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,416
and you need help,
which I'm not saying I'm offering…

56
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,750
This is the Specialist Hall.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,833
The Fairy Hall is that way.

58
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,250
Oh, the Specialist Hall. Obviously.

59
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,708
Hm.

60
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,250
And I definitely know
what a Specialist is!

61
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,791
- Right. Sorry, I'd be happy to...
- Mansplain it?

62
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,666
- No.
- Sure.

63
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,416
Kinda seems like your thing.

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,750
Quit perving on the first years.

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,875
- Riv, just give me one second. Yeah?
- Why? You gonna chase her?

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Nope.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How are you, man?

68
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,500
- Bloom.
- Yeah. You must be Stella.

69
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,500
Hi.

70
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,250
I was… waiting.
I just… I got impatient.

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,333
How very American of you. Shall we?

72
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,583
Miss Dowling tells me
this is your first time in the Otherworld.

73
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,866
I hope your trip was painless.

74
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,916
Miss Dowling gave me a time and location
where there'd be a gateway.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,541
It was in the middle of nowhere,
so it wasn't convenient.

76
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,505
The headmistress likes to do things
by the book,

77
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,708
and keeping your world a secret from ours
is chapter one,

78
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,000
no matter how inconvenient it may be.

79
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,333
But if you ever want to go back…

80
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,000
That's a whole lot of ring.

81
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,458
Family heirloom. Gateway ring.

82
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,333
The only thing that keeps you sane
in this place is the ability to leave it.

83
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,083
Your world may not always be thrilling,
but it beats this one.

84
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52,625
There are seven realms in the Otherworld,
each a different kind of boring.

85
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,375
<i>Think of Alfea as your new home.</i>

86
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,291
I'm sure it must be overwhelming,
an entirely new world.

87
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,291
And yet I saw no less than three people
updating their Insta stories.

88
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,458
I was half-expecting a school
full of Tinkerbells zipping around.

89
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,833
Disappointed?

90
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,708
Just kinda bummed
I didn't see a single pair of wings.

91
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,208
Hm. Well, we had wings in the past.

92
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,875
As we've evolved,
transformation magic has been lost.

93
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,000
Also, Tink was an air fairy.

94
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,958
You're a fire fairy.

95
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, that much I know.

96
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,833
- So, when do we… we start?
- Classes begin tomorrow.

97
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,625
You'll start with the basics.
Learn to use your magic slowly but safely.

98
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,208
When you say… slowly…

99
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,291
I mean it.

100
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,291
Magic can be dangerous,

101
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,041
as you well know.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,083
Our curriculum is designed
with that in mind.

103
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,208
Trust the process.

104
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,625
The <i>slow </i>process.

105
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,791
Alfea's graduates have ruled realms
and led armies.

106
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,791
They've forged powerful relics…

107
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
and rediscovered long-lost magic.

108
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,041
They shape the Otherworld.

109
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,708
If you succeed here,

110
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,291
you will too.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, this place,
the Otherworld, uh… Alfea,

112
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,458
it seems amazing. It…

113
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,375
This isn't my home.

114
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
I don't need to rule a realm
or lead an army and…

115
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,416
I'm here because you promised
you'd teach me control.

116
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,625
No, Bloom.

117
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,583
You're here because you knew
you had no other choice.

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,916
<i>How was your flight?</i>

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,208
Good. You know, long.

120
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,041
- <i>Well, the room looks nice.</i>
- It is.

121
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,000
<i>- It's big.</i>
- Roommates?

122
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,333
Friends?

123
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,250
It's literally hour one of day one, Mom.

124
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,333
<i>Don't glare.</i>

125
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,333
You can learn a lot about people
on their first day.

126
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,083
Everyone seems… cool, I guess.

127
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,666
I mean,
it's five girls in an enclosed space,

128
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,750
so it's a matter of time before we descend
into a <i>Lord of the Flies </i>situation and…

129
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,250
kill each other.

130
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
<i>Lady of the Flies, </i>sweetie.
Don't be sexist.

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,083
Could you at least make an effort
to be social, Bloom?

132
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,125
<i>I know how you are. This is a fresh start.</i>

133
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,791
- Don't just sit in your room...
- Got it, Mom. Thank you.

134
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,791
Hey, I see a window.
Do you have a nice view?

135
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,791
No,
the first years have crap views.

136
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,333
Well, I bet the worst view of the Alps
is better than the best view of Gardenia.

137
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,656
<i>What time is it there, by the way?
It seems bright.</i>

138
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,375
Oh…

139
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,833
Yeah, actually, um, it…

140
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,958
- All right.
- It's… It's…

141
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,541
- Lights out. Phones off.
- Uh, gotta go, guys.

142
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,208
- I love you.
<i>- Love you too, sweetie.</i>

143
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,208
You're a lifesaver.

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,750
I'll answer to that.

145
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,458
Or to Aisha.

146
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,000
Just wanted to get in your good graces
so you don't go <i>Lady of the Flies </i>on me.

147
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,416
Do I wanna know
why they think you're in the Alps?

148
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,000
My… parents are both human.

149
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,208
So they think that Alfea is
an international boarding school

150
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,666
in Switzerland.

151
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,625
Human parents, fairy daughter?

152
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,708
Mm-hmm.

153
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,750
Miss Dowling said there's, um,
a fairy somewhere in my family tree,

154
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,125
like a long-dormant magical bloodline.

155
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,958
One of these days, I'm gonna get used to
how absolutely ridiculous this all sounds.

156
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,458
Oh my God.

157
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,750
Are you the one person in the universe
who's never read <i>Harry Potter?</i>

158
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:08,333
Please. If you knew how many hours
I have wasted taking Sorting Hat quizzes…

159
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,416
Ravenclaw?

160
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,125
Sometimes Slytherin, yeah.

161
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,791
That explains the lies then.

162
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,041
Hm. Let me guess. Gryffindor.

163
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,833
Explains the judgment.

164
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,958
May I help you?

165
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Are you changing?

166
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,625
I am.

167
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,583
I thought the orientation party
was a casual thing.

168
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,916
It is.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
So, a casual thing
you're changing for?

170
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,833
People have seen me
in this outfit already.

171
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,333
They'll expect something different.

172
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,583
People expect you
to wear multiple outfits a day?

173
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,791
People expect me to care how I look.

174
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Something else?

175
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,541
That light, that's… magic.

176
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
How exactly do you...

177
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,125
I'm a mentor, not a tutor.

178
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,101
Look, this is something you'll learn
on your first day in class,

179
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,958
but fairy magic is linked to emotion.

180
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,791
It could be good thoughts, could be bad.

181
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,750
Love. Hatred. Fear.

182
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,916
The stronger the emotion,
the stronger the magic.

183
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,416
So, do you…
…do you hate me or do you fear me?

184
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,833
You were just looking at me
when you did the… spell.

185
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm pretty sure you don't love me, so…

186
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,750
Well, I don't know you.

187
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,750
But I'm sure once I do, I'll find…

188
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,583
something to love.

189
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
Yeah.

190
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,250
Shared space, Terra.

191
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,791
Everyone loved <i>The Secret Garden</i>
because it was a secret.

192
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,583
Actually, that's not quite the message
of <i>The Secret Garden.</i>

193
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,666
It's a story
about how when things are kept private

194
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,500
their benefits aren't fully appreciated.

195
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,041
OK.

196
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,083
Well, she seems lovely.

197
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,125
She's just having fun.

198
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,666
I know it's a lot. Shocker.
Earth fairy called Terra likes plants.

199
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,416
It's a family thing.
I've got this cousin called Flora,

200
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,750
my mum's Rose,
and my dad works in the greenhouse here.

201
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,541
That's why I know a load of second years.
I grew up around Alfea, so…

202
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,105
Stella's a second year?
Why is she in a suite with first years?

203
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,541
Oh yeah! Um…

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,958
Uh, I dunno, uh, really.

205
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,541
Uh, an administrative thing…

206
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,000
Also, sorry,
I just wouldn't bring it up with her.

207
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,458
You know? Um, let's all of us
just blanket statement, "Who cares?"

208
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,375
Do you want a succulent?

209
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
They're really hip,
low maintenance, very you.

210
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,138
- Sorry. Not that I know you.
- If I take it, will you stop talking?

211
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,833
- Terra, I'm just having fun.
- OK.

212
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,458
Thank you.

213
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,333
Actually, this one might be…

214
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,416
Musa?

215
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,958
- Did you say you grew up at Alfea?
- I did.

216
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,166
Weird childhood, let me tell you. But...

217
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,708
I went for a swim in the river,
but I don't suppose this place has a pool?

218
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,083
- Wait. Did you say you've <i>been </i>swimming?
- Mm. I go twice a day every day.

219
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,791
- But you just got here.
- You do know what "every day" means?

220
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,833
Uh…

221
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,208
Well, the only thing close is
the pond where the Specialists train,

222
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,291
but nobody swims there,
at least not on purpose.

223
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,500
- There's something about her.
- What, you're smitten after one chat?

224
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:57,416
♪ <i>We appreciate power
We appreciate power, power ♪</i>

225
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,416
What is it with you and the crazy ones?

226
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,083
How do you know she's crazy?
You haven't even met her.

227
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,750
She's a ginge. They're all nuts.

228
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,041
Amazing shags though.

229
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, you speak from experience?
Didn't realize your hand was a redhead.

230
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,958
<i>♪ We appreciate power ♪</i>

231
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,916
<i>♪ We appreciate… ♪</i>

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,250
You got slow this summer.

233
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,708
Correction.

234
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,750
I got high this summer.

235
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,500
Really?

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,625
Whatever big-brother speech
you're about to give me…

237
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,434
- There's no speech.
- …I don't wanna hear it.

238
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,041
A more productive use of your time

239
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,208
would be to distract
your aggro father figure

240
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,708
so I don't got expelled.

241
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,500
So, after your classes,

242
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,416
you are all mine.

243
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:51,958
And I like the things I own to work well,
so you will train every day.

244
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,833
Find your skill.

245
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,958
Hone your skill.

246
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,541
And eventually even you…

247
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,750
can fight like him.

248
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,750
He fights even better
with a bit of advance warning.

249
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,833
He did all right.
Favored his left, but what else is new?

250
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,250
Sky's father was Andreas of Eraklyon.

251
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,708
That made him a legacy admission,

252
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,625
but he still showed up on the first day
and did the work.

253
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,250
Well done.

254
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,000
I expect nothing less
from the rest of you,

255
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,791
whether you're third generation
and your parents demanded you come

256
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,208
or if I personally selected you
from your realms for service.

257
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,750
That decision was made

258
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:45,875
based on your natural talents
in combat and weaponry,

259
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,500
and I expect to see that skill
in evidence daily.

260
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,583
This place will seem like hell…

261
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,500
until actual hell comes.

262
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,875
We are the first line of defense.

263
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,000
A certainty when the future is uncertain.

264
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,083
Is that funny?

265
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,083
It's just you're talking about
preparing for the future

266
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,750
in a castle with kids using swords.

267
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,500
Must be nice to live in a world
where you can be so soft,

268
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,500
where you fear so little,
disrespect seems an option.

269
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,458
Do you know why the Barrier exists?

270
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,125
To protect the school from Burned Ones.

271
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,250
Have you ever seen a Burned One?

272
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,208
Nobody my age has.

273
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,291
But that's kinda my point.

274
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,458
- Isn't that all over now?
- What if it's not?

275
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,875
<i>Do you think you would know what to do?</i>

276
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,416
I was ten
when I saw one for the first time.

277
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,041
<i>I was gathering firewood with my father,
and we heard it.</i>

278
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,833
<i>It was like a rasp.</i>

279
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,708
<i>A clicking.</i>

280
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,916
My father shot it twice.
Once in its chest, once in its head.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,083
It didn't matter.

282
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,166
Burned Ones have inhuman speed
and strength,

283
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,666
and if they cut you,

284
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,000
the infection that follows
is swift and severe.

285
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,041
I watched it happen.

286
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,041
I watched the light dim
from my father's eyes,

287
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,375
and when he dropped his shotgun,
I knew what I had to do.

288
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,250
<i>Be thankful
you've never seen a Burned One.</i>

289
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,333
<i>But if you ever do,</i>

290
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,541
pray that it kills you
so the ones you love will not have to.

291
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,583
It's fresh.

292
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,333
Maybe a wolf?

293
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,458
Or a bear.

294
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,083
Could have gone out to protect his herd,

295
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,750
got surprised.

296
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,375
I'm happy
to continue the guessing game, but…

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,583
This is char residue.

298
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,750
How long since the last sighting?

299
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,125
- About two decades.
- Sixteen years. Rosalind was relentless.

300
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,750
- Could've been hiding...
- She killed all the Burned Ones.

301
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,833
We thought she did.

302
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,583
Ben, what we think is irrelevant.

303
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,250
The Barrier's doing its job.

304
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,083
Until we know something for sure,
let's clean this up before gossip starts.

305
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,583
Who actually saw
the shepherd's body?

306
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,166
Maybe he was just old.
People get old, die. We all die.

307
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,541
That old-age decapitation
really sneaks up on you.

308
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,750
Happened to my nan
right in the middle of bingo.

309
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,166
Just… thwop, thwop, thwop.

310
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,833
Down the table.

311
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,875
- No judgment, but…
- I eat a million calories a day.

312
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,416
If I didn't swim, I'd be massive.

313
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,625
- I used to dance. I get it.
- On that note…

314
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,875
Second round. Damn! Twice a day every day.
You weren't kidding.

315
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,916
So you did hear her earlier?

316
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,708
What?

317
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,250
In the room. Um…

318
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,666
You had your headphones on and ignored me
as though you couldn't hear me,

319
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,250
but you did hear Aisha.

320
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,431
Sometimes I just wear my headphones
when I don't feel like talking.

321
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,250
Yeah. It just seems
like that happens a lot…

322
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,958
around me.

323
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,708
It's a me thing. It's not you.

324
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,666
You've said enough. I've said too much.

325
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,291
Dad? Where you going? Greenhouse?

326
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,333
- Anything you need help with?
- That is not going to happen, love.

327
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,125
It's your first day.
No hiding in the greenhouse.

328
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,375
You wanted to go to Alfea
your entire life.

329
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,625
Mingle.

330
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,375
- Be you.
- OK.

331
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,708
Uh, the headmistress is busy.
You'll have to book an appointment.

332
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,791
- Excuse me?
- I'll just take a water. Room temp.

333
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,541
Thanks, love.

334
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,791
If the door is closed,
it means she doesn't want...

335
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,416
Headmistress Dowling!

336
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,583
I'm Beatrix, and I'm probably
going to sound like an arsehole right now,

337
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,416
but I'm literally your biggest fan.

338
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,458
Probably shouldn't have said "arsehole"
in front of the headmistress!

339
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,416
Bollocks. Shit!

340
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,625
- On a winning streak, I see.
- Sorry. For all of it.

341
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,750
It's just I've waited
my whole life for this, to be here.

342
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,291
I'm obsessed with this place, its history,

343
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,583
<i>your </i>history.

344
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,125
Noted.

345
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,000
Perhaps you'd like to study that history
in the library? I have work to do.

346
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,586
- You can't make me go out!
- It's Saturday. Get out of your room.

347
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,833
Get out of the house.

348
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,875
I literally went out earlier today.

349
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,166
Go to the movies. Go to a party.

350
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,250
Go somewhere that's not a rummage sale
or an antique store.

351
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,291
Oh, I see. So it's not enough I go out.

352
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,333
I have to be a basic bitch
like my mom was.

353
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,000
Better that than some weird loner.

354
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,583
Wow, you just called your daughter
a weird loner.

355
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,083
Take a parenting class!

356
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,166
I'm worried about you, Bloom.

357
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:40,000
Maybe worry about why you have
so little going on in your sad life

358
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,125
that you're obsessed
with the tedious minutiae of mine.

359
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,833
<i>♪ Lights out, follow the noise ♪</i>

360
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,916
<i>♪ Baby, keep on dancing
Like you ain't got a choice ♪</i>

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,916
<i>♪ Come on ♪</i>

362
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,708
<i>♪ Let's get physical… ♪</i>

363
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,166
This is a lot of people.

364
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,416
What?

365
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,333
You don't have parties in… California?

366
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,666
Oh, he remembers!

367
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,875
Oh, impressed?

368
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,833
Where can I go that's the opposite…

369
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,333
of this? What's outside?

370
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,041
- What, beyond the Barrier?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,208
Well, depending on rumors,

372
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,666
wolves, bears, or something much scarier.

373
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,041
But no people?

374
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,875
- Um...
- Perfect, thanks.

375
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,416
At the risk of, um… mansplaining,

376
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,541
it is dangerous outside right now.
You probably shouldn't go alone.

377
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,208
Are you offering to escort me?

378
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,541
Is that what this is?
It's not the worst pickup line.

379
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,250
- It wasn't a line.
- Mm.

380
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,083
- Trust me?
- Hm.

381
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,625
I just met you, but maybe one day I will.

382
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,208
Hey, Sky. Can we talk?

383
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,583
I haven't seen you all day.

384
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,083
Summer, Stella. All summer.

385
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,208
You know that girl
you were talking to, Bloom?

386
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,250
She's my suite-mate.

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,375
What does that mean, Stel?

388
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,500
- That I can't talk to her?
- I didn't say that.

389
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,375
What are you saying, specifically?

390
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,958
I'd hate to make you upset.
I know what happens when you get upset.

391
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,934
I'm sure
you'll do the right thing.

392
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:30,958
I always do.

393
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,625
Enjoy the show?

394
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,583
Right. Good thoughts.

395
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,583
Pictures of my sad teenage years,
not happy thoughts.

396
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,083
Noted.

397
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:24,958
No!

398
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,000
Bloom.

399
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,375
- What are you doing here?
- It's OK, Bloom.

400
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,250
- It's OK.
- Aisha, you should not be here.

401
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,500
Neither should you. You're losing control.

402
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,708
Yes, I know that.

403
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,166
Calm down. If you get angry at me...

404
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,333
Just go… away!

405
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,083
Aisha, run!

406
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,000
<i>No,
you shouldn't have been out there.</i>

407
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,750
Is that American
for "sorry I almost set you on fire"?

408
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,059
You were a runaway train
with no idea what you were doing.

409
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,583
Which is why I was out there alone
trying to figure it out.

410
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,666
Brilliant idea.

411
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,583
I'm not like the rest of you.

412
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,125
I didn't grow up here.
I don't have fairy parents.

413
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,083
I've done magic once in my life
and it was…

414
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,208
What? Terrible? I'm shocked.

415
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,916
I flooded my entire secondary school
after I failed a math test.

416
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,875
Taps, sprinklers, toilets…

417
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,708
Have you ever waded through human poo?

418
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,791
I have.

419
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,416
Not pleasant.

420
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,791
Sometimes being a fairy means
you have to deal with shit.

421
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,916
So my…

422
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:05,250
mom and I don't really get along.

423
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,208
I know. It's a shocker. I'm not…

424
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,541
exactly the ideal daughter for her.

425
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,333
She'd love a cheerleader, and I'm…

426
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,833
whatever the opposite of a cheerleader is.

427
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:32,833
- What the actual hell?
- Slam your door, lose your door.

428
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,083
Dad? Dad. Dad, she's crazy. You know that.

429
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,916
You need to be more open with us.

430
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,375
So, this is a good start?
Teaching your daughter she has no privacy

431
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,666
or boundaries or agency?

432
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,625
Don't you feminist with me.
This basic bitch'll break out her bullhorn

433
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,916
and her dissertation
and take your ass to school.

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,250
Every comeback is another week
without your door. Hit me.

435
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,500
That's what I thought.

436
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,250
<i>That night, I…</i>

437
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:15,958
<i>couldn't sleep.</i>

438
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,625
<i>Every time I closed my eyes,
the rage just kept building.</i>

439
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,708
<i>Then it happened.</i>

440
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:40,000
<i>It was almost like
the fire had a life of its own.</i>

441
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:46,541
<i>I don't remember how long I let it burn.
I just remember their screams.</i>

442
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,666
Bloom! Bloom!

443
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,791
Somebody help us!

444
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,041
Please!

445
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,708
Mom? Is she OK?

446
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,208
Get her outta here!

447
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,458
My mom was…

448
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,833
covered in third-degree burns…

449
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,375
'cause of me.

450
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,916
Every night after that, I…

451
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,708
I snuck out. I was so…

452
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,541
scared that I'd hurt them again…

453
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,541
that I slept in this…

454
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,250
…creepy-ass…

455
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,875
…warehouse near my house

456
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,500
until Miss Dowling found me.

457
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,125
All right.

458
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,250
Fire story beats shit story.

459
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,125
You win.

460
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,333
And your parents had no idea it was you?

461
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,750
I don't know how distant
my fairy ancestors are, but…

462
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:03,291
the most mystical thing
my parents believe in is knocking on wood.

463
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,958
What?

464
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
It's just odd.

465
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,750
You drew on a good deal of magic
without even trying.

466
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,000
It's hard to believe
you're from a dormant bloodline.

467
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,083
Is there any chance you're adopted?

468
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,166
No.

469
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,000
No, I… No, I've heard the story
of my birth a million times.

470
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,083
"Miracle baby." I…

471
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,458
had a heart defect in the womb,
but a day after I was born, it was gone.

472
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh God. You…

473
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,208
You're a changeling.

474
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,791
What's that?

475
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,875
Aisha, what's a changeling?

476
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,750
A changeling is a fairy baby
that's switched with a human one at birth.

477
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,541
- Wait, what?
- It's barbaric. It barely happens anymore.

478
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,833
That's not possible.

479
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,476
You're clearly very powerful, Bloom.
You have to be pure-blooded.

480
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,791
I would know
if my parents weren't my parents, Aisha.

481
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,208
Why would you even say that?

482
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:02,916
I'm just trying to help.

483
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,083
Well, you're not.

484
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,375
What the hell did you tell her?

485
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,708
The truth.
Because someone's been lying to her.

486
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,791
Want some?

487
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,166
- No. I just...
- There's two types of first years.

488
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,500
Pussies and aspiring former pussies.

489
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:09,250
Sorta feels like it's less a binary choice
and more a spectrum, but…

490
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,500
Cheers.

491
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,958
No.

492
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,708
Cheers when you're done.

493
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,958
Are you bullying the first years?
Be more basic.

494
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,583
- I can't bully the willing, right?
- I don't know what that means.

495
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,000
Just ignore him.
He thinks he's some badass.

496
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,844
You should've seen him last year.
He's just a tragic nerd in disguise.

497
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,041
And she's just three people in disguise.

498
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,583
- Whoa. Come on, man.
- No, I've got this.

499
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:42,625
People always think
that they can treat the big girl like shit

500
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,125
because we're… we're sweet,

501
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,166
and we're harmless, and we should be happy
that you're even talking to us.

502
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,500
But sometimes,
we've had a really, really bad day,

503
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,423
and some scrawny little arsehole
says the wrong thing at the wrong time,

504
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,833
and we're not happy you're talking to us,
and we're not sweet, and most of all,

505
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,083
we are not harmless.

506
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,791
Huh? Sorry?

507
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,041
What was that, Riv? I…

508
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,791
I'm sure it's really funny,
but I can't quite hear it.

509
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,666
- You could've killed me, you freak.
- Missed you too.

510
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:34,666
Sorry, I'm Terra.
That wasn't my ideal first impression.

511
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:39,583
Is it better or worse than throwing up
after a single drink?

512
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,541
Oh no. Come on, quickly.

513
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,375
Is that your family?

514
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,958
I get homesick too sometimes.

515
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,166
But my mum…

516
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,250
Honestly,
if she didn't force me to go here,

517
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,750
I wouldn't.

518
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,750
I'd live at home,

519
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,541
go to school, just have a normal life.

520
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,916
You know there's no shame in that?

521
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,208
No shame in wanting to be home.

522
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,113
She's blanking my texts.

523
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,791
Strange. I wonder if it's because

524
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,250
she poured her heart out to you
and you called her a freak?

525
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,208
- Have you seen Bloom?
- Not recently.

526
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,875
- Yes?
- Your face looks so calm,

527
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,291
yet you're racked with guilt.

528
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,041
You're a mind fairy.

529
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,833
A mind fairy?

530
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,250
- What's your connection? Memory...
- Not a great time.

531
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,541
- Is everything OK?
- Not really.

532
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,875
I'm looking for Bloom. For some reason,
Stella's feeling guilty about it.

533
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,666
Could everyone save the drama
for drama club?

534
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,875
Wasn't she talking to Sky?

535
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,416
And?

536
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,375
And I know what happened
to the last person who was talking to Sky.

537
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,541
I was here last year, remember?

538
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,458
Stella, where's Bloom?

539
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,208
She was feeling homesick,

540
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,291
so I did a nice thing,
and I lent her my ring

541
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,000
<i>so that she could go back
to the First World.</i>

542
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,458
<i>Doesn't it only work
outside the Barrier?</i>

543
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:44,708
<i>Yes, and there's a gateway
in the old cemetery.</i>

544
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,541
<i>That's deep in the forest, Stella.</i>

545
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,166
<i>You know what's out there, right?</i>

546
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,708
- It's Bloom.
- Hmm.

547
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,875
<i>Whoa! Twice in one day.</i>

548
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:39,416
Hold on, I'm calling the news.

549
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,541
Real Chatty Cathy here.
All it took was moving across the world.

550
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,625
I know, right?

551
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Easy solutions.

552
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,708
<i>- </i>Hey, you wanna video chat?
<i>- </i>No. Um…

553
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:52,875
I just wanted to check in
'cause we got cut off before, and…

554
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,041
- You must be jet-lagged.
<i>- Mm. Probably.</i>

555
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,458
Is everything OK, Bloom?

556
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:01,833
Yeah, I'm…

557
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,666
I'm OK.

558
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,125
You know, you don't have to be OK.

559
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,041
You're only 16.

560
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,375
I couldn't have done it
when I was your age.

561
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,875
You should be thankful
you have your mom's bravery.

562
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,583
Um…

563
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,708
What if I… What if I…

564
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,541
like, made a mistake?

565
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,958
You're too special for here.
It's not who you are.

566
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,375
What if you don't know who I am?

567
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:34,458
Hey, we are your parents, Bloom.
If we don't know you, nobody does.

568
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,125
Is there something else?

569
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,083
Something you wanna tell us?

570
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,208
No, you're right.

571
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,125
Alfea's where I belong now.

572
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,291
Bloom, listen to me.

573
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,090
Whatever you're going through,
I know it sucks,

574
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,083
but I also know you can handle it.

575
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:07,791
I always knew your path
wouldn't be like everyone else's.

576
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,250
Not like mine or your father's.

577
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,083
That's hard.

578
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,083
But at the end of it,

579
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,833
I can't wait to see who you become.

580
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,208
We love you, Bloom.

581
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,500
I love you too.

582
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,125
Please, please, please…

583
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,250
Don't stop now.

584
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,541
Are you OK?

585
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:42,458
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so.
What the hell was that thing?

586
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:45,041
- I'm pretty sure it's called a Burned One.
- Huh?

587
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,333
- Wait. Where… where's Stella?
- She's at school. Why?

588
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,958
That thing just took her ring.

589
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,125
You can't be in here, Stel.

590
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,875
If Silva finds out…

591
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,000

You broke up with me.

595
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,458
No, I know.

596
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,833
I didn't hear from you all summer,
and then I say two words to a first year?

597
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,166
I said I know, OK?

598
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,250
I'm sorry.

Yeah,
I know I'm not allowed to, but I did.

602
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,750
And I did something really stupid.

603
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,541
- Now they all think I'm a monster.
- Oh, Stel…

604

No, please.
I can't sleep in there, Sky.

Please. Tonight, can I just stay with you?

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,416
She won't leave it in the First World.

Don't worry.

Thanks.

620

Are you burning the midnight oil?

Snorting the midnight Adderall
is more like it.

622
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,416
But I'll need sleep eventually.

623
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,125
Hands are kinda full.

624
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,375
You're a first year.

625
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,041
I'm a lot of things.

626
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,750
So I know
you want to listen to your music,

627
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:08,458
and I, uh, I totally get that,
um, but we are…

628
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,916
stuck together for a while.

629
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So…

630
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:23,583
I borrowed this off my brother.
It's a speaker, so we don't have to talk.

631
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,833
You can be in your world. You just…

632
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,625
won't be alone in it.

633
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,541
Or not. It's no… It's not a big deal.

634
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,000
- Don't be angry.
- I'm not.

635
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:47,875
Can you stop with the fake happy bullshit
for one second?

636
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:49,583
I'm a genuinely happy person.

637
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:50,875
And I'm an empath.

638
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,625
I can feel everything that you feel.

639
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:57,291
Your anxiety with me,
your insecurity with Stella,

640
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,291
and your anger right now,
all of it, if not worse than you.

641
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,958
That's my gift, if you can call it that.

642
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,875
I put my headphones on

643
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,708
so I can take a break
from everyone else's emotions

644
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,500
and just focus on mine.

645
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,958
But if you really wanna know how I feel…

646
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:35,166
<i>I chained it up
in a barn outside the Barrier.</i>

647
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,844
- You should've killed it.
- And left it in the human world?

648
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,666
You should've brought it back here
and then killed it.

649
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,250
Did it break your skin?

650
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,208
No, I'm not infected.

651
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,541
I've got Ben to make up some oil
from the Zanbaq flowers in the greenhouse.

652
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,465
I've dosed it.
It won't be conscious for hours.

653
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,375
- Farah…
- I need to get in its head.

654
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,416
We need to know if this is
an isolated incident or something more.

655
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,541
Something more?

656
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:04,166
Like what?

657
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,875
I found a changeling in the First World.

658
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:10,958
A changeling.

659
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,750
I've not heard of one of those
in centuries.

660
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:14,958
Yet there she was…

661
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,000
left 16 years ago…

662
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:21,291
right around the time
the last Burned One was spotted.

663
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,041
You think it's all connected.

664
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,458
I'm struggling, Saul.

665
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,958
Rosalind kept so much from us.

666
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,500
I'm worried about the students.

667
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:41,291
<i>The Alfea they know is very different
from the one we attended.</i>

668
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,750
<i>They have so much life to experience.</i>

669
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,309
<i>Even if this world were safe,</i>

670
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>what they're going through
can feel impossible.</i>

671
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,708
<i>But this world isn't safe,</i>

672
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,833
<i>and I don't know how long
we'll be able to protect them from it.</i>

673
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,416
<i>I know you feel it.</i>

674
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,250
The… shift.

675
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:26,958
They've had order for so long,
they don't know what chaos feels like.

676
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,583
They might soon.

677
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,666

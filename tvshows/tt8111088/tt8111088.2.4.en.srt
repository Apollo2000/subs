1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,999
Oh.

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,456
Is that me?

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,881
There must be some mistake.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,925
- I can get you more credits.
<i>- I can bring you in warm...</i>

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,967
<i>Or I can bring you in cold.</i>

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,687
Yes, yes, yes!

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,815
- Very healthy.
- What are your plans for it?

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,071
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,204
What did you do to it?

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,951
Don't hurt him.
It's just a child.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,814
<i>Cara Dune
here was a veteran.</i>

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,466
<i>She was a drop soldier for the Rebellion.</i>

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,553
You're staying here?

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,551
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,683
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,181
it's very respectable again.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,720
<i>Hang on, kid.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,</i>

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,888
<i>but I finally know where I'm taking you.</i>

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,021
All right,
let's try this again.

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,271
Okay, did you...
Do you have the wire?

22
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,231
No. Nothing.

23
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,864
Hey...

24
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,908
Oh.

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,580
Okay.
Did you get the wire out?

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,869
The red wire?

27
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,162
Huh?

28
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,536
No, no, no. No, the red one.
Show me the red wire.

29
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,094
The red one.

30
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,209
Yes, good.

31
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,796
Now, you're going to plug that red wire
where the blue wire goes in the board.

32
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,563
Put the red wire where
the blue wire goes in the board, okay?

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,635
But don't let them touch.

34
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,478
You see where you took the blue one off?

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,612
<i>Yes, now put the red one...</i>

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,911
No, don't put the blue one back.
Put the red one where the blue one was.

37
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,084
And put the blue one
where the red one was.

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,739
But be careful.

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,207
They're oppositely charged,
so keep them away from each other.

40
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,539
<i>Make sure you hold them apart from...</i>

41
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,875
No, hold them apart.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Oh! Uh-uh...

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,464
Oh...

44
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,843
Are you okay?

45
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,773
Well, it was worth a shot.

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,979
There's no way
we're making it to Corvus in this shape.

47
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,699
I think we need
to visit some friends for repairs.

48
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,122
So, how'd you like to go back to Nevarro?

49
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:30,872
Hey!

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,540
Okay. Oh. Oh...

51
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,341
Okay, little guy.

52
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,959
No one's eating you today.

53
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,382
Go on, you're free.

54
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,973
Go on. Git.

55
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,517
Okay, look.

56
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,653
Here you go.

57
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,229
That's all I got.

58
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,648
Now, I need to return
all these things to the rightful owners.

59
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,052
Looks like someone
could use some repairs.

60
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,359
How's my credit
around here?

61
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,233
I think something could be arranged.
Isn't that right, Marshal?

62
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,228
I'm sure we can work somethin' out.

63
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,647
I'll get my best people on it.

64
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,735
Hey, fellas!

65
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,570
Let's fix this man's ship!
I want it as good as new.

66
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,158
And you, come here, little one!

67
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,666
Has Mando been
taking good care of you, huh?

68
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,379
Have you been takin' good care o' him?

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,880
Yeah? Yeah! He said "yeah!" Oh, yeah.

70
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,010
Yes.

71
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,046
Come on. Yeah.

72
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,347
Yeah, look at you.

73
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,605
Looks like you
two have been busy.

74
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,779
I myself have been
steeped in clerical work.

75
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,568
Marshal Dune here
is to be thanked for cleaning up the town.

76
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,663
Your ship's not lookin' too good.

77
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,704
I had a run-in with the New Republic.

78
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,403
They should leave
the Outer Rim alone.

79
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,335
If the Empire couldn't settle it,
what makes them think they can?

80
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,211
Here we are.

81
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,054
I'm surprised to
see this place is still standing.

82
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,014
Wait till you see inside.

83
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,974
<i>Who can
name one of</i>

84
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,306
<i>the five major trade routes in the galaxy?</i>

85
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,391
Anyone?

86
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,646
How about the Corellian Run?

87
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,108
<i>- The Hydian Way?</i>
- Yes, the Hydian Way. That is correct.

88
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,240
- A school?
- Things have changed a lot around here.

89
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,738
We'll leave the little one here
so we can talk business.

90
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,410
- Wait. Wherever I go, he goes.
- Mando, please.

91
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,030
Where we're going,
you don't wanna take a child. Trust me.

92
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,542
He'll be fine here.
You have my word.

93
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,840
<i>...be transported from the Outer Rim
to as far away as the Core Worlds.</i>

94
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,301
However, there are
several other regions within our galaxy.

95
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,514
<i>They are the Mid Rim...</i>

96
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,635
- Come on.
<i>- ...the Expansion Region, the Inner Rim,</i>

97
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,154
<i>the Colonies, Core,
and Deep Core.</i>

98
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,146
All right, class.
Settle down.

99
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,651
Back to the lesson, shall we?

100
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,873
<i>The capital of the Old Republic
was within the Core</i>

101
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,620
<i>on a planet called Coruscant.</i>

102
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,746
<i>The capital of the New Republic...</i>

103
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,752
<i>...is currently on the planet Chandrila,</i>

104
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,126
<i>which is also within the Core region.</i>

105
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
So, back to the start.

106
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,720
The system also contains
the Akkadese Maelstrom.

107
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:03,347
The Maelstrom surrounds Kessel
and its three moons.

108
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,516
<i>- As you learned yesterday...</i>
- No!

109
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,727
<i>...there are many systems in this galaxy.</i>

110
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,778
How many orbits are in the Kessel system?

111
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,909
Do we at least remember that?

112
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,365
Ooh, I know!

113
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,082
Uh... Two?

114
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,753
<i>Yes,
very good.</i>

115
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,250
<i>As the third moon of Kessel
rotates the outer planet,</i>

116
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:29,254
<i>you see the moon here
travels in its same orbit.</i>

117
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,968
Now who can track the path
of the orbit here?

118
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,724
Do I have any volunteers?

119
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,137
Anyone?

120
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,233
There's no registration on the ship,
but I'm pretty sure it belongs...

121
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,570
I believe you two have met.

122
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,275
I'm surprised
to see you here.

123
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,242
Right back at ya.

124
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,366
Mythrol here's taken care
of my books since he was a pollywog.

125
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,955
But then he disappeared one day
after a bit of "creative accounting."

126
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,924
Magistrate Karga was generous enough
to let me work off my debt.

127
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,003
Thank you, by the way.

128
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,508
Three hundred and fifty years,
but who's counting?

129
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,300
Well, if he runs off on you again,
let me know.

130
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,470
Let me assure you, I do not wanna
spend any more time in carbonite.

131
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,598
Still can't see outta my left eye.

132
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,266
Can we talk business?

133
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,008
I'm only
here for repairs.

134
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,060
Which'll take a while.

135
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,686
Which means you'll have free time
on your hands, right?

136
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,698
And we could really use your help.

137
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,445
Help how?

138
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,946
This is Nevarro.

139
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,367
We're here.

140
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,001
This entire area's a green zone.
Completely safe.

141
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,249
But over on this side is the problem.

142
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,504
It's an old Imperial base.

143
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,756
It's where all those troops came from
when we defeated Moff Gideon.

144
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,051
This base has been here
since the Imperial expansion.

145
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,853
It's got a skeleton crew, but for
some reason, it hasn't been abandoned.

146
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,969
<i>There's a lot o'
heavy weaponry in that place</i>

147
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,016
<i>the black market would love
to dismantle and get their hands on.</i>

148
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,311
And you wanna mop up the last
of the Imperial force before they do.

149
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,476
Mando, I just want them off my planet.

150
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,819
If we could take out that one last base,
Nevarro would be completely safe.

151
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,029
We could be a trade anchor
for the entire sector.

152
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,155
And the planet would finally be free.

153
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,078
What are we looking at?

154
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,137
The whole base is powered by a reactor.

155
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
We sneak in, overload the reactor,
and get the hell outta there.

156
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,476
Let's be fast.
And keep the speeder running.

157
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,140
There it is, right there.

158
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,811
You see it?

159
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,855
How close you want me to drop you off?

160
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,402
How 'bout the front door?

161
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,114
It's a little close
for a civilian, isn't it?

162
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,986
I got two choices for ya.

163
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,993
You take us in and I knock
a hundred years off your debt.

164
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,076
Or?

165
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,370
<i>Or I leave ya out here
in the lava flats to walk home</i>

166
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,794
<i>with whatever's left
in your humidity vest.</i>

167
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,253
It's not much of a choice, is it?

168
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,508
All right.
We can't go any further than this.

169
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,268
Let's go.

170
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,486
Controls are useless.
They're melted.

171
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,293
Well, it's probably not rated for lava.

172
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,750
Imperial trash.

173
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,122
All right, I'm headed back.

174
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,537
Hit me up on the comm,
we could set up a rendezvous time.

175
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,206
You park your gills right there
until I say otherwise.

176
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,086
I'm startin' to dehydrate, boss.

177
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,973
Okay, how does 30 more years
off your debt sound?

178
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,511
Can you at least be quick about it?

179
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,095
You wanna be quick?
Grab the flange cutter and help us out.

180
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,231
Okay, fine.
<i>I don't like</i>

181
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,309
<i>leaving my speeder like this,
just so you know.</i>

182
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,944
Come on, hurry it up.

183
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,441
All right, I'm coming.

184
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,862
Hurry up.

185
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,817
Hold tight.

186
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,249
How long is this gonna take?

187
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,256
Look, lady, this is rated
for light plumbing and such.

188
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,879
You're lucky I even packed it at all.

189
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,255
<i>Dank farrik.</i>

190
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,267
Are you comin' in or what?

191
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,100
I'll take my chances here,
but thank you.

192
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:56,475
Well, when the lava tide comes in,
give us a holler. We'll drop you a rope.

193
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,833
Empty base, huh?

194
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,261
The reactor should be set
in the heat shaft.

195
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,008
If we drain the cooling lines,

196
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,630
this whole base
will go up in a matter of minutes.

197
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,217
Look.
It's a mint Trexler Marauder.

198
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,313
We can get a lot for this
on the black market.

199
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,128
And it's gonna
get vaporized

200
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,020
like the rest of this base.
Now, let's go.

201
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,271
Such a waste.

202
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,412
Shuttle bay, this is command.

203
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,705
Shuttle bay,
the security feed just went down.

204
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,342
Can you check your relay hub?

205
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,880
Shuttle bay?
Shuttle bay, this is...

206
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,649
This will come in handy.

207
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,125
I found the heat shaft.

208
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,652
Let's go.

209
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,663
The access corridor
should be right past this junction.

210
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,568
<i>Must've blown
a transformer over there.</i>

211
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,380
<i>All right.
We'll check it out.</i>

212
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,537
<i>Section-Four?
TK-1-4-7.</i>

213
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,626
<i>Scan control has been
unreliable since last rotation.</i>

214
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,462
Send a technical crew to check it out.

215
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,889
There, Mythrol,
slice that door.

216
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,724
<i>Use the code cylinder.</i>

217
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,449
- Whoa!
- Yeah, "whoa" is right.

218
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,825
That's it.

219
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,670
Get on the reactor controls,
drain the coolant lines.

220
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,958
We'll watch the doors.

221
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
- Me?
- Yes, you!

222
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,336
I'm afraid o' heights.
And heat. And lava.

223
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,393
How 'bout if I put ya back in carbonite?
Get over there!

224
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,390
- There's no guard rail on this.
- Come on!

225
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:43,646
Oh, boy.

226
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,137
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

227
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,488
Hurry up!

228
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,041
Oh, dear.

229
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,512
All right, she's gonna blow.

230
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,600
Let's go!
Let's get outta here!

231
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
How long do we have?

232
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,944
<i>Ten minutes at the most.</i>

233
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,315
<i>5-3-8-7 and 5-3-8-9,
follow me.</i>

234
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,573
Call in reinforcements!

235
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,132
Hurry up,
<i>purge the drives.</i>

236
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,262
Destroy it!

237
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,350
Ahh!

238
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,317
<i>What the...</i>

239
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,993
I thought you said
this was a forward operating base.

240
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,948
I thought it was.

241
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,906
No,
this isn't a military operation.

242
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,156
This is a lab.

243
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,460
<i>We need to get into the system</i>

244
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,002
<i>and figure out what's going on.</i>

245
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,585
<i>- What about the reactor...</i>
- Do it! Do it.

246
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,115
I don't like this.

247
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,051
Pardon me.

248
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,172
<i>Replicated the results</i>

249
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,354
<i>of the subsequent trials,</i>

250
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,935
<i>which also resulted
in catastrophic failure.</i>

251
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,817
<i>There were promising effects
for an entire fortnight,</i>

252
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,819
<i>but then, sadly,
the body rejected the blood.</i>

253
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,988
<i>I highly doubt we'll find
a donor with a higher M-count, though.</i>

254
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,245
<i>I recommend
that we suspend all experimentation.</i>

255
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,248
<i>I fear that the volunteer
will meet the same regrettable fate</i>

256
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,671
<i>if we proceed with the transfusion.</i>

257
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,709
<i>Unfortunately, we have exhausted</i>

258
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,166
<i>our initial supply of blood.</i>

259
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,132
<i>The Child is small,
and I was only able</i>

260
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,887
<i>to harvest a limited amount
without killing him.</i>

261
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,679
<i>If these experiments
are to continue as requested,</i>

262
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,845
<i>we would again
require access to the donor.</i>

263
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,646
<i>I will not disappoint
you again, Moff Gideon.</i>

264
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,236
<i>This must be
an old transmission. Moff Gideon is dead.</i>

265
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:41,661
No. This recording's three days old.

266
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,908
<i>If Gideon's alive then...</i>

267
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,035
<i>Over there!</i>

268
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,589
<i>We have them!</i>

269
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,311
I need to get the kid.

270
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,850
Jet back, you're faster that way.

271
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,984
We'll head to the speeder
and meet you in town.

272
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,311
Come on, let's go!

273
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,226
When did you say
this place is gonna blow again?

274
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,696
<i>They're on the move!</i>

275
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,660
Let's go!

276
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,828
<i>We think they may
be moving to the...</i> Hey!

277
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,025
<i>This way!</i>

278
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,074
<i>All right, men,
load your weapons.</i>

279
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,198
There they are!
Blast 'em!

280
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,500
We're trapped!

281
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,497
Is that so?

282
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,924
Cover me!

283
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,586
What does she think she's doing?

284
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,597
All right, baby girl,
let's see what you got.

285
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,450
What are you guys waiting for,
an invitation? Let's move!

286
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,535
Go! Go, go, go,
go, go! Go!

287
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,693
<i>You're not considering
going over...</i>

288
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,191
Hang on!

289
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,109
Oh, no, no, no, no!

290
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,961
Wait. <i>Was that my speeder...</i>

291
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,582
Man the guns.

292
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,001
Copy that.

293
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,274
One down.

294
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,996
I've lost him!

295
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,006
Whoo!

296
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,505
Yes! We did it!

297
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,595
Headed home, boss.

298
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,363
That may have been premature.

299
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,155
Take evasive!
I got this!

300
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,185
What is going on back there?

301
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,733
You wanna come back here
and try this? Be my guest!

302
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,869
Can't you get this thing to go any faster?

303
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,576
Come on.

304
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,727
We're almost there!

305
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,746
Yes! Yes!

306
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:34,973
Hang on, kid.

307
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,867
Yeah!

308
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,372
Yes!

309
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,084
Yeah!

310
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,382
Not too bad,
huh, kid?

311
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,087
Oh, boy.

312
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,430
<i>That was some
pretty impressive flying, Mando.</i>

313
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:03,761
<i>What do I owe ya?</i>

314
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,886
With the repairs,
let's call it even.

315
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,730
Can I at least buy you a drink?

316
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,021
<i>Sorry. I have some
on board maintenance I gotta take care of.</i>

317
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,896
<i>Then we gotta hit the road
before Gideon catches wise.</i>

318
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,944
Well, good luck flying, my friend.

319
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:30,245
So, is there anything else
you can remember before the base exploded?

320
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,464
No.

321
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,168
<i>How long after
the Razor Crest jumped out...</i>

322
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,254
<i>I never said anything about a Razor Crest.</i>

323
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:40,968
<i>Your transponder log has a...</i>

324
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,589
"Transponder log."
Come on, give me a break.

325
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,467
The control droid
can't tell apart anything pre-Empire.

326
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,596
This isn't Coruscant.

327
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,517
Do you have anything else to add?

328
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,192
Not that I can think of, Officer.

329
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,902
But if somethin' does come to mind,

330
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,821
I'll be sure to send you a 'gram.

331
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,775
That is,
if you're ever out this far again.

332
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,250
What?

333
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,562
You did a hell of a job
cleanin' up the system.

334
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,350
According to records,
you're quite a soldier.

335
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,520
We could really use you.

336
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,152
I'm not a "joiner," Blue.

337
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,025
There's something going on out here.

338
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,367
They don't believe it
on the Core Worlds, but it's true.

339
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,662
These aren't isolated incidents.

340
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,704
They need to be stopped
before it's too late.

341
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,168
But we can't do it without local support.

342
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,592
Says here you're from Alderaan.

343
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,550
I served during Alderaan.

344
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,889
Did you lose anyone?

345
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,440
I lost everyone.

346
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,020
I'm sorry for your loss.

347
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,958
What do you have for me?

348
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,880
<i>The device has been planted,
as you requested.</i>

349
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:23,803
Good.

350
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,628
You'll be well-rewarded in the new era.

351
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,106
Moff Gideon.

352
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:52,277
<i>The tracking beacon
has been installed on the Razor Crest.</i>

353
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,790
Does he still have the asset?

354
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,748
Yes. Our source confirmed it.

355
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,327
And we will be ready.

356
00:34:03,305 --> 00:35:03,597

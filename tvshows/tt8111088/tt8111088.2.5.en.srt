331
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,314
Could be your side...

00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,193
could be my side.

with you, Mandalorian.

337
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,523

341
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,835
Willing to lay our lives down

Now, tell me.

349
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,414
Where is your master?

350
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,585
Where is Grand Admiral Thrawn?

I believe this was your payment.

354
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,194
THE MANDALORIAN: No.

355
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,278
I can't accept.

356
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,366
I didn't finish the job.

357
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,535
No.

358
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:08,872
But this belongs with a Mandalorian.

359
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,260
Where is your little friend?

360
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,514
THE MANDALORIAN: Back at the ship.

361

Wait here, I'll go get him.

362
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,235
THE MANDALORIAN: Wake up, buddy.

363

AHSOKA TANO: You're like a father to him.

369
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:04,780
I cannot train him.

370

AHSOKA TANO: There is one possibility.

373
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:26,802
Go to the planet Tython.

374
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,556
You will find
the ancient ruins of a temple

375
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,891
that has a strong connection to the Force.

376
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,854
Place Grogu on the seeing stone
at the top of the mountain.

377
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,022
Then what?

378
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,024
Then Grogu may choose his path.

379
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,237
If he reaches out through the Force,

380
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,074
there's a chance a Jedi may sense
his presence and come searching for him.

381
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,662
Then again,

382
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:57,624
there aren't many Jedi left.

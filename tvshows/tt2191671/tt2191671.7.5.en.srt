1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:01,444
<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,246
I did it.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,771
Mr. Meers, to be clear,

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,907
you're confessing
to killing Tim Bledsoe.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,109
Tim Bledsoe was going to
blow up the Bridgeport ferry

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,944
the day after you shot him.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,247
I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

8
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,074
<i>Patrick Meers</i>
<i>was not acting alone.</i>

9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,385
Someone, or some group,
were pulling his strings.

10
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,420
Please. My family's inside.

11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,822
You're protecting someone.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,590
I wish I could help you, Joan.

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,759
That video game.

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,494
Is that how you
talk to them?

15
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,229
I need you
to be brave now.

16
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,265
Can you be brave?

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:45,578
Ten years ago, my company wasn't
quite where it is today.

18
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,346
We weren't the destination
for e-mail,

19
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,850
search and social media for
500 million people worldwide.

20
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,785
We were just a tiny start-up.

21
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,454
In a sweaty office in San Jose.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,426
2433 Piedmont Street, Suite 3.

23
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,961
I can still smell it.

24
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:06,165
And then, one day,
Suite 2 becomes available.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,701
It's bigger, it's nicer,
has more windows.

26
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,304
So, we decide to make the move.

27
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,673
Trouble is,
that means a new address.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,475
New letterhead, new envelopes,
business cards.

29
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,445
We have to reach out
to the post office,

30
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,981
to our clients, our suppliers.

31
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,619
Late one night, the janitor
hears us talking about this

32
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,322
and he says, "Why don't
you just switch the numbers

33
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,624
on the doors?"

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,695
And that, folks,
is the principle

35
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,730
on which Odker was built.

36
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:42,134
Simple solutions
for complicated problems.

37
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,670
That's how a website that
launched in an office park

38
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,872
became a multinational empire.

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,307
Leonardo da Vinci said it best.

40
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,412
"Simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication."

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,348
Tommyrot.

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,016
What are you wearing?

43
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,818
That man
is a legitimate genius.

44
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,730
He's diminishing his
intellectual sophistication

45
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,521
for the sake of
a cocktail party anecdote.

46
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,323
It's just naked pandering.

47
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,193
It's a Tech Symposium,

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,228
not a doctoral defense,
and he's one of the most

49
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,050
successful people on the planet,
so obviously,

50
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:11,888
he's doing something right.

51
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,833
Why are you interested in him?

52
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,836
Because, apparently,
he is interested in me.

53
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,314
Do you remember
that gun buyback program

54
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,083
you started in my name
before I left New York?

55
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,407
Of course, why?

56
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,124
He just made a huge donation.

57
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:25,805
How huge?

58
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,079
Let's just say that

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,015
the program should be
in his name now.

60
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,045
The money came
with an invitation.

61
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:31,868
He wants to meet tomorrow,

62
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:32,918
so I thought
I'd get a handle on him.

63
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,022
Oh, my napalm is done curing.

64
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,390
Good luck with
your new suitor.

65
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,002
It's not every day
one attracts the fancy

66
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,860
of the eighth richest man
in America.

67
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,230
Uh, try not to burn
the house down.

68
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,439
Hello, Mr. 246.

69
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,741
Is there a Mrs. 246?

70
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,108
Hmm, pass.

71
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,377
I couldn't date a guy who
has nicer legs than I do.

72
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,246
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,881
Where's Isabel?

74
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,459
I thought we would
have seen her by now.

75
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,428
I know she was trying to
finish in under two hours.

76
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,829
- Oh.
- I guess it's tougher out there

77
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,787
than she would have thought.
- Hmm.

78
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,757
- There she is!
- Oh...

79
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:12,892
You got this!

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,160
God, she looks awful.

81
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,972
We would, too, after ten
miles of trail running

82
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,063
and obstacle courses.

83
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,398
Come on, girl!

84
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,333
- You're so close!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

85
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,469
What-what's happening?
Why is she stopping?

86
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,605
I don't know.

87
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,442
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,501
Is she still breathing?
I don't know.

89
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:37,502

91
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,151
Her name is Isabel Perez,
she's 27.

92
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,890
Was 27.

93
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:12,192
We were roommates.

94
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,541
Can you think of anyone who
would have wanted to hurt her?

95
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:17,497
Isabel worked in admissions
at this ritzy private school

96
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,199
in Tribeca, Saint Mark's.

97
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,035
She always took a lot of flak
when rejection letters came out.

98
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:24,171
Angry parents.

99
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,672
She'd get these
insane voice mails.

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,108
There were a few threats.

101
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:29,543
She ever report them?

102
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:32,346
I don't know.
I don't think so.

103
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,582
I'll check with the school;
they might have kept track.

104
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,386
If you think of anything else,
you call this number, okay?

105
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,890
I have to go walk
the course now.

106
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,301
We have to find where
Isabel was attacked

107
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,360
if we're gonna find
the person who did this.

108
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,172
You have any friends here,
someone to drive you home?

109
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,363
Yeah.

110
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,731
All right.

111
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:52,199
U-Um, Detective.

112
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,902
There is no course.

113
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,570
Sorry?

114
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,238
This is an adventure race.

115
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,941
It means there's no set route.

116
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,143
There's a bunch of checkpoints
all over the forest.

117
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,212
The runners all start together,
but then they can

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,624
go to the checkpoints
in whatever order they want,

119
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:07,825
as long as they
get to all of them

120
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,583
before they reach
the finish line.

121
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:12,386
You're telling me every inch of
this forest is fair game?

122
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,322
I think I heard
it's something like 3,000 acres.

123
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,958
Finding out where Isabel
was attacked could take days.

124
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,586
Happened in
the Southwest corner

125
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,495
of the park near the edge
of Richmond Pond.

126
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,233
You gonna tell me how you know

127
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:29,303
where this girl was stabbed
or am I supposed to guess?

128
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,771
I examined Miss Perez's body

129
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,306
while you were talking
to her friend.

130
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,641
<i>There was a smear of marsh mud</i>
<i>on her left leg.</i>

131
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,443
There was mud
all over her body.

132
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,446
Yeah, but most of that mud
had dried.

133
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:42,282
The marsh mud above her
left ankle was still damp.

134
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,017
Okay.

135
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:45,896
There are several bodies
of water in the Greenbelt,

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,855
but only one of them is
surrounded by marshland.

137
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:50,857
Richmond Pond.

138
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,630
Given that the marsh mud was
the freshest muck on her body...

139
00:05:56,698 --> 00:05:59,700
We can assume the
area around the pond

140
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,147
is where the attack went down.

141
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,235
Yeah.

142
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,870
She had a six-inch blade
in her back.

143
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,816
She couldn't have made it far
in that condition.

144
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,808
I'm not sure how likely
it is we'll find

145
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,644
the exact scene of
the stabbing, but...

146
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,512
Who knows, maybe we'll
find a creepy shack

147
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,448
with a door
off its hinges.

148
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,985
Yeah. Maybe.

149
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,637
Got metal pots, copper coiling,
propane tanks.

150
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:39,673
Looks like a bootleg
distillery to me.

151
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,575
What's left of one, anyway.

152
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,546
Well, it's certainly
a crime scene, but...

153
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,058
I don't think it was
where Isabel was stabbed.

154
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:48,995
No?

155
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,417
No.

156
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:53,186
There's two distinct sets
of footprints.

157
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,188
But neither
one of them is

158
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:57,034
small enough to be hers.

159
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,159
I doubt she was ever in here.

160
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,895
Then I wonder
whose blood that is.

161
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,865
Someone else's.

162
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,869
The knife in her back
pierced only muscle.

163
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:12,372
Didn't sever any major arteries;
that's why she was able

164
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,608
to escape and make it
to the finish line

165
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:16,009
before succumbing to her wounds.

166
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,345
This spatter is more
consistent with...

167
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,013
a shooting.

168
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,349
Judging by the amount of blood,
I'd say a fatal one.

169
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:26,586
So, someone gets shot here
making moonshine or whatever,

170
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,388
Isabel runs by
during the race...

171
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,023
Becomes a witness

172
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,602
that the killer feels compelled
to deal with.

173
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,193
But he
doesn't shoot her.

174
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,029
He stabs her.
That make sense to you?

175
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,198
I think we have to identify
the first victim

176
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,943
before we've got a chance
at solving anything.

177
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:43,236
Well, we have to find them
before we can identify them.

178
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:50,210
Dredge the pond and you will.

179
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,922
These marks were made
when the shooting victim

180
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,046
was dragged out of here.

181
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,282
The heels of his
shoes made them

182
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,917
before he was
dumped in the water.

183
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,222
Looks like he
was weighed down

184
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,390
with some big rocks.

185
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,925
I can see where
they used to be.

186
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:07,561
I'll get the
scuba team out here.

187
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,564
From search to social media

188
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,732
to scientific research,

189
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,602
Odker is more
than just a company.

190
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,584
Odker is your solution.

191
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,572
Ms. Watson?

192
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,073
You should get going.

193
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,075
No, I don't understand.
I had an appointment.

194
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,320
- Mm-hmm?
- Am I at the wrong office?

195
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,112
Is this the online
search office

196
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,990
and I'm supposed to be at
the social media headquarters?

197
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:28,415
Oh, no, there's no confusion.

198
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:31,251
Odin's expecting you offsite.
Clark will drive you.

199
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,253
Drive me where?

200
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,633
Ah, Ms. Watson.

201
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,101
Thank you so much
for coming out.

202
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,769
It's my pleasure.

203
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,038
Sorry about the field trip.

204
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,308
It's just the only time I
get any bandwidth these days

205
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,544
is during my archery
and I didn't want to miss

206
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,312
the opportunity to meet.

207
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,847
Bow and arrow.

208
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,949
That's pretty lo-fi
for a high tech guy.

209
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,985
Exactly. It's primal.

210
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,353
It settles the mind.

211
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,855
Some place for it.

212
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,993
I made a donation to
the Parks Department last year

213
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,328
and this is their way
of saying thank you, I guess.

214
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,497
They gave you a park?

215
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,799
Oh, for-for one hour a day.

216
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,501
I really am grateful.

217
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:22,969
I mean, the money
that you put into

218
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,515
the buyback program
is gonna go a long way.

219
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,741
I'll confess,
I'm a little skeptical

220
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,342
about the gun buyback
initiative.

221
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,711
Not the goal, of course.
Just the efficacy of it.

222
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,346
Jury's out, I'd say.

223
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:36,683
So, the donation you made was
just to find out if they work?

224
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,686
No, it was to buy
an introduction.

225
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,322
And maybe earn
a small favor.

226
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:48,161
I, uh, I have a problem.

227
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,597
It's well below your
pay grade, I'm sure,

228
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:54,434
but I'm told that you and
your partner are the best.

229
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:57,170
I'd be in your debt if you
could make time to help.

230
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,676
Last week, my sister
received a couple of letters.

231
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:05,345
Someone threatened
to kidnap her daughter

232
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:07,681
if we didn't pay up.

233
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,183
At first, I thought this was
some kind of cruel prank.

234
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,619
I mean, normally you have
to actually kidnap someone

235
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:14,054
before you demand a ransom,

236
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,790
but then these showed up.

237
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,761
Is this your niece?

238
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,530
Abigail. She's 16.

239
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,465
Whoever sent this knows
where she hangs out,

240
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,200
who her friends are.

241
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,203
I want you and your partner
to find out who sent this.

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,906
I have to ask: Why us?

243
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,284
I'm sure you have
people on your staff

244
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,142
who can handle this.

245
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,378
Yes, I do have good
people on the payroll,

246
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:39,746
but that's the problem--

247
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,425
You see, I think these
threats came from someone

248
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,882
who works for me.

249
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,918
What makes you think that?

250
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,953
One of the letters
referenced

251
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,722
Abigail going to
an equestrian camp.

252
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,223
Thing is, she's
never been to one.

253
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,492
I was thinking of surprising
her for her birthday,

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,395
and I mentioned it at a company
dinner a couple of weeks ago.

255
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:56,930
The only people
that knew

256
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,399
I was thinking of
sending her to that camp

257
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,102
are the Odker employees
who were there that night.

258
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,337
And my head of security
is one of them.

259
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:06,940
So you need an outsider.

260
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,775
My niece is in
real danger.

261
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,810
Her mother's a wreck.
I won't rest easy

262
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,112
until this is settled.

263
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,180
Can you help me?

264
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,121
How did it go with your
billionaire admirer?

265
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:22,956
<i>Our</i> billionaire admirer.

266
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:24,457
It turns out

267
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,693
he knows all about us,
and he wants to use us

268
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,094
to look into kidnapping threats

269
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,262
against his niece.

270
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,298
So these are the
letters that he got.

271
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:33,300
- What did you say?
- I said yes.

272
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,834
I mean, after the check

273
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,503
he gave our foundation,
this is sort of

274
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,638
the least we could do, no?
I loathe that expression.

275
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,141
The least one could do
is always nothing.

276
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,842
Abigail's family tree

277
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,211
makes her an easy target
for lowlifes and miscreants.

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,714
Any threat against her is more
likely a haphazard shakedown

279
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,149
than a legitimate risk.

280
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:51,117
It hardly seems worthy
of our time.

281
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,719
You seriously
don't want to help?

282
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,621
I'd like to know
why you do.

283
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:57,390
And before you say the donation,
it was certainly generous, yes,

284
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,902
but the whole reason
it's called charity

285
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,127
is because it requires
no recompense.

286
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,373
Well, I think a relationship
with Odin could be a good thing.

287
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,498
And before you say it,
I am not talking about sex.

288
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,300
I was gonna say it.

289
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,902
I'm thinking about our work.

290
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,638
I mean, the guy is sitting
on the most extensive trove

291
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,707
of private user data
in the world.

292
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,542
I mean, you don't
think that would be

293
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,544
a nice resource for a
couple of detectives?

294
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,479
How do you suggest we proceed?

295
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,815
He's gonna let us
into his offices late tonight.

296
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,751
He thinks the threats are coming
from someone inside Odker.

297
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,019
With a little luck

298
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,364
and access
to everyone's computers,

299
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,189
we should be able
to find out who.

300
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,729
Were the divers successful?

301
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,897
Twice as successful
as we thought they'd be.

302
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,366
They found <i>two</i> bodies.

303
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,868
Want to meet me at the morgue?

304
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:45,071
Meet John Doe.
Late 40s. Gunshot victim.

305
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,673
Water damage makes it hard
to nail down

306
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:48,151
exactly when it happened,
but I'm guessing

307
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,542
sometime early this morning.

308
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,277
Well, there's
not much tissue damage

309
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:52,746
around the entry wound.

310
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,214
Must have been

311
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,548
from a small caliber round.

312
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:56,883
Fired from something weak.

313
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,388
How about a single-shot
Remington derringer?

314
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,455
Scuba team found it in the
pond next to the bodies.

315
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,525
Only holds one shot.

316
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,395
One shot. All guns should be
Remington derringers.

317
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:11,030
A relic from the 19th century;
won't be easy to trace.

318
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,743
I'm hoping we have
better luck with him.

319
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,511
They're running his fingerprints
and dental records--

320
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,279
if they're in the system, we'll
have his name in a few hours.

321
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:17,871
Any luck IDing
the second victim?

322
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,639
Actually, yeah.

323
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,775
According to his collar,
his name is Truffles.

324
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,155
I'm confused. Are you saying

325
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,913
the person that killed this man

326
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,048
also killed this pig?

327
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:30,750
Hog, actually.

328
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:33,119
And I had doubts myself
until I saw photos

329
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,122
of the recovery operation.

330
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,891
Both bodies were weighed down
the same way.

331
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,392
Same rope. Same knots.

332
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,261
Same heavy rocks from
the edge of the pond.

333
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,547
Any bullet holes in it?

334
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:43,997
Nope.

335
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:46,132
So his demise wasn't
caused by the derringer.

336
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,667
How did it die?

337
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:50,136
Working on it.
Uh, we're a little outside

338
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,304
my area of expertise.

339
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,305
Mine, too.

340
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,807
But you and I have dissected

341
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,941
enough animal cadavers

342
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,142
in medical school.

343
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,278
Dilated pupils like this
in a mammal could mean

344
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:59,585
that it was fed
something toxic.

345
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:00,957
Already sent
a blood sample

346
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:01,915
to the lab.

347
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:03,183
Say you're right.

348
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,770
Why would someone want
to poison a hog?

349
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,686
And why hide its body?

350
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,154
So, a man in a forest,

351
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,823
and his hog,

352
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,257
both killed
at the same time.

353
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,259
Unless we're looking
at the fallout

354
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,462
from the world's most
nauseating love triangle,

355
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,596
we have three victims,

356
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:17,864
two murder weapons...

357
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,098
And zero motive.

358
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,864
We got an ID on the man
they pulled from the pond.

359
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,799
His name was Reginald Henderson.

360
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,401
He went by "Renny."
He was a bartender in Brooklyn.

361
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,404
We're pretty sure that he owned
the illegal distillery

362
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:36,973
that Marcus
and Sherlock found.

363
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,774
He had an old arrest
for selling moonshine.

364
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,643
That's why his prints
were in the system.

365
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,480
This his pig?

366
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:45,581
Hog.

367
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,218
But yes.
They found this photo

368
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,720
in the shack.

369
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,922
Killing the guy's pet...

370
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,081
Man, that just seems...
mean-spirited.

371
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,082
Sherlock and I
don't think

372
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,461
it was done out of spite.

373
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,296
We think it was part
of a larger plot.

374
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,098
CSU found trace amounts of ricin

375
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:04,066
in some of the broken equipment

376
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,134
in the shack.

377
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:06,669
The lab confirmed
that it was

378
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,437
the same toxin
that killed Truffles.

379
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:10,907
The hog.

380
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,509
If this adds up
to a larger plot,

381
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,611
I'm not seeing it.

382
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,014
We got a runner with
a knife in her back,

383
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,616
a dead bootlegger
and a poisoned animal.

384
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:21,751
What am I missing?

385
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:22,985
I think the key

386
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,197
is the order
in which they died.

387
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,154
So first it was Truffles,

388
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,155
then the bootlegger,

389
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,156
and then the runner.

390
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,308
It all started when Renny

391
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,944
started making ricin
in his distillery.

392
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,312
You think
he's the one

393
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,348
who made the stuff
that killed his pet?

394
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,095
He had the expertise
and the equipment.

395
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:39,515
And it's easy to extract toxins

396
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,951
from castor beans if you're
used to making alcohol.

397
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,352
Now, the question is,

398
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,887
was he forced to make it, or...

399
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:47,056
was he working with the killer
before he died?

400
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,068
Either way, the killer tests
the stuff out on Truffles.

401
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,359
Probably at gunpoint.

402
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,963
When he sees it works,
he shoots Renny.

403
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,732
And that's when Isabel Perez
jogs by, catches him in the act.

404
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,034
He only had one round

405
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,369
in his gun,
and he had already fired it.

406
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,822
So he attacks her with a knife.

407
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:06,610
Why the weird old gun?

408
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:09,779
Probably because he had a record
and couldn't buy a gun legally,

409
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,582
so he used a family heirloom.

410
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:13,146
We looking at Renny's friends
and associates?

411
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:14,527
Turns out
he had a fight

412
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,086
with his boss at the bar
he worked at a month ago.

413
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:19,655
Marcus is already
on his way there.

414
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,497
Excuse me.

415
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,068
Yo, bartender.

416
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:34,070
In a minute.

417
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,279
I need to talk to your boss,
Bo Willoughby.

418
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:44,814
Can you get him for me?

419
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,182
Sorry, Bo's not here.

420
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,994
He called in earlier,
said he was taking a trip.

421
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:49,585
Kind of a last-minute thing.

422
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,320
Three weeks ago,

423
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,533
Bo got into a fight with another
one of the bartenders here,

424
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:54,957
Renny Henderson.

425
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:56,859
- You know what it was about?
- Yeah.

426
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,160
They'd both been drinking.

427
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,196
They got a little annoyed
with each other.

428
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,177
It was nothing.

429
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,531
I'm not so sure
about that.

430
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:04,367
Renny's the reason I'm here.

431
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,335
He was murdered this morning.

432
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,115
What?

433
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,005
That's why I need
to know more

434
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,107
about the fight
he had with Bo.

435
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,978
You want me
to shut this place down?

436
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,613
Wouldn't be a problem.

437
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:19,315
I didn't really know Renny.

438
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:20,950
We weren't friends
or anything.

439
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,119
But I know he had a side
business making moonshine.

440
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,688
It was good stuff.
Bo would let him sell it here,

441
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,223
and they would share
the profits.

442
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,458
Artisanal moonshine?

443
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:32,328
That day that they fought,
Renny was ticked.

444
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,163
He said Bo was taking
too big a cut.

445
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,908
They started swinging,
the next thing you know,

446
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:37,210
the customers
are calling the cops.

447
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:39,001
They stay mad,
or was it settled?

448
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,369
Bo fired Renny.

449
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,805
Renny said Bo had
better watch his back.

450
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:45,474
That was the last time
I saw Renny.

451
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,842
You need anything else?

452
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,744
Yeah. Bo's number.

453
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,082
I just heard from Marcus.

454
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,351
Looks like Renny's boss
could be our guy.

455
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,986
His name is Bo Willoughby.

456
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,988
He's putting out
a Finest Message.

457
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,657
What is that?

458
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,526
I mean, I can see
it's a wine bottle.

459
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:05,828
Yeah, the, uh, floor
of Renny's shack

460
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,363
was covered in glass.

461
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,365
I was studying a
crime scene photograph,

462
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:12,401
and I noticed that some shards
in the corner really stood out.

463
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,537
I sifted those chunks
out of the rest of the pile

464
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:17,106
that CSU collected,
and I could see why.

465
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:19,508
They're older.
Decades older, in fact.

466
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,410
So it's an antique wine bottle?

467
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,212
Mm-hmm. Well,
most of one.

468
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,548
The section where the
label would be is missing,

469
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,083
hence the modeling clay.

470
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,718
So the killer took
the label. Why?

471
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:31,787
Well, I'm hoping
that's a question...

472
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:34,690
we'll be able
to ask him ourselves.

473
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:36,759
- You found a print?
- Yeah.

474
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,762
I can already tell
from the swirl pattern

475
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,364
that it's not Renny Henderson's.

476
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,632
You said Marcus believes
Bo Willoughby is a suspect.

477
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,368
Well, he would have
given his fingerprints

478
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,902
when he applied
for a liquor license.

479
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,372
So I'll tell Marcus
he needs to procure

480
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,741
Bo's application for comparison.

481
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:55,211
In the meantime,
you and I are due at Odker.

482
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,383
Joan, thanks so much for coming.

483
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,218
- You must be Sherlock.
- Yes.

484
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,520
I understand we're here
to find a quisling in your organization.

485
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,622
Probably one of my guys
in the coding lab.

486
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,491
I was toasting them
when I made the comments

487
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,092
that showed up
in those threat letters.

488
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,495
If not, you can check
my head of security.

489
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,764
He's up in the C-suite. Sims.

490
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:16,165
Name's on the door.
Probably best

491
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,266
to be gone by 4:00.

492
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,834
We have early
risers here.

493
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,069
You're not staying?

494
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:22,071
Oh. No.

495
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,074
My autobiography says
that the secret of my success

496
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,410
is "a dedicated spirit"--
truth is,

497
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,612
that just tested well
in focus groups.

498
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,580
My real secret is
eight hours' sleep,

499
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,749
every night, no excuses.

500
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,119
You do what you have to here.

501
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,587
Whatever it takes

502
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,922
to keep Abigail safe.

503
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,123
All right, we'll call you

504
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,591
in the morning with an update.

505
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,127
Not too early.

506
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,933
Good luck.

507
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:59,141
So, Matthew Yang

508
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:02,144
is using pirated software
to cheat at online chess,

509
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,314
and he illegally downloaded
the last <i>Sharknado</i> movie.

510
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:08,017
Other than that,
he's clean.

511
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,453
I'm ready to call it.
We've looked at everyone.

512
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,954
I think we go to Odin,

513
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,000
and we tell him that we need
to look at the waitstaff

514
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:15,201
at the restaurant where he
talked about his niece,

515
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,460
because I don't think
anyone here

516
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:19,628
where he works is
behind the threats.

517
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:22,064
You might be incorrect.

518
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:29,672
When did you find all this?

519
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,507
While you were watching
<i>Sharknado.</i>

520
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,477
These are poker chips
from an illicit cardroom

521
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,645
or casino, judging
by the poor quality.

522
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,013
The occupant of this desk,

523
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:40,583
Blake Tofel,
is swimming in debt.

524
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,421
Oh.

525
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,156
He's also written
a lot of big checks,

526
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,534
and none of them
have his name on it.

527
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:50,893
Now, what is Cashew LTD?

528
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,862
It appears to be an "S" corp

529
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,165
that Mr. Tofel uses to hide his
illicit gambling from the IRS.

530
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,001
Oh, there is a recent debit here
for 75 grand.

531
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:00,549
I mean,
I know Odker pays well, but...

532
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:04,206
Exactly. This book appears
to tell the story

533
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,908
of a man
with a gambling addiction.

534
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,420
I don't imagine
there's anything in there

535
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:09,211
about him threatening
his boss's niece

536
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,679
and demanding a ransom.

537
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,081
No, but we both know

538
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,350
that addiction
can be like an organism.

539
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,518
It can fight
to stay alive.

540
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,296
Easy to imagine
that if he ran out of money,

541
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,221
he might go to great lengths
to get some more.

542
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,857
I'm not ready to go to
Mr. Tofel's employer yet,

543
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,425
but I think he's worth
a closer look.

544
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,103
Marcus!

545
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,804
Hey.
Sorry to bother you so early.

546
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,607
Nonsense. Watson and I are
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

547
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,210
We ran the fingerprint you found
on that antique wine bottle

548
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:43,946
and got a match, but it's not
the one we were expecting.

549
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,291
In fact, I think
the whole investigation

550
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,249
is moving in a new direction.

551
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:48,357
It wasn't Bo Willoughby's?

552
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,451
No. He's innocent.

553
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,997
We caught up with him up
at a bachelor party

554
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,721
late last night on Long Island.

555
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,757
He told us
he'd been there all weekend.

556
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,891
He can prove as much?

557
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,259
Six different ways.

558
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,427
He didn't kill anyone.

559
00:21:58,495 --> 00:21:59,895
Not yesterday morning, anyway.

560
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,797
But the print you found,

561
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,900
that's our new angle. Belongs
to a guy named Todd Harris.

562
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,803
He's a wine dealer. Sells
high-end stuff all over town,

563
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:10,406
including
to Bo Willoughby's bar.

564
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:12,741
It stands to reason he would've
known Renny Henderson.

565
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,777
How did Mr. Harris
run afoul of the law?

566
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:16,345
Why are his prints
in the system?

567
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:17,857
He was arrested for
assault when he was 18.

568
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,782
Broke the victim's arm
in two places.

569
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:22,918
Well, sounds like someone who
would kill two people and a hog.

570
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:24,620
Where is he now?

571
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:27,089
Hard to say. None of his clients
have seen him in two days,

572
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:29,258
but he's about to hear
from the NYPD.

573
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:30,793
I'll let you know how it goes.

574
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,304
Mr. Harris, open up.
This is the police.

575
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:44,306
We'd like to talk with you.

576
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,647
Something's wrong.

577
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:55,818
Mr. Harris. Police.

578
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,321
Anybody home?

579
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,193
Mr. Harris?

580
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:14,570
We've got movement down here.

581
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:24,146
Police! Don't move.

582
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:26,315
Oh, man.

583
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:30,319
This is Major Case to
Central. I need a bus

584
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:33,188
at 589 Sumpter Avenue
in Brooklyn.

585
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:35,491
I have a male, mid-40s,

586
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,370
victim of an apparent
gunshot wound to the neck.

587
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:40,095
Put a rush on it, Central.
This guy's lost a lot of blood.

588
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,267
Mr. Harris?

589
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:50,705
I'm Detective Bell. This is
my colleague, Joan Watson.

590
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,607
We're with the NYPD.

591
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:55,610
Your doctor told us
that you were shot in the mouth.

592
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:58,079
The bullet broke your mandible
and exited through your neck.

593
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,647
You're lucky to be alive.

594
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:02,150
We know your jaw's
been wired shut,

595
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:05,787
but we brought this to help you
answer some questions.

596
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:07,989
You can just type,

597
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:10,458
and the program
will do the talking for you.

598
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,624
You saved my life.

599
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,554
Thank you.

600
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,023
I'm just glad we
found you when we did.

601
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,158
You lost a lot of blood.

602
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,693
And look,

603
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,162
if you're not up to this,
we can come back later.

604
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,599
No. I want to help.

605
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,268
Tell us what happened.

606
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,904
I was in bed. Tuesday.

607
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,241
There was a sound.
Someone in the house.

608
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,876
Before I even got up,

609
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:41,113
there was a shape,
a man, over me.

610
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,549
He hit me. I got knocked out.

611
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,751
So you never saw his face?

612
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,191
I woke up a few minutes later.

613
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,460
He tied me up, blindfolded.

614
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,696
We were in the basement.

615
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,398
I could hear him
looking through my wine racks.

616
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:04,269
He was mad.
He couldn't find what he wanted.

617
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,737
He talked to you?

618
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,740
Yes, but I didn't know
his voice.

619
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,909
I didn't know who he was.

620
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,745
He wanted my Baptiste.

621
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,547
Is that a wine?

622
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,886
Chateau Baptiste.
It's French merlot.

623
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:24,823
He wanted my Baptiste '57.

624
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,259
He started yelling.
"Where is it?"

625
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:30,428
I told him I had three bottles
in a locked cabinet.

626
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,796
We saw those
cabinets down there.

627
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,344
Is that where you
keep the good stuff?

628
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,437
Looks like he left
everything else in there.

629
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,573
So that was
the only wine he wanted?

630
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,175
Yes.

631
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:46,311
He took it
and put a gun in my mouth.

632
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,648
When he shot,
I thought I was dead.

633
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,784
I don't know when I woke up,
but he was gone.

634
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,120
I was still tied up.

635
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:57,422
Everything hurt.

636
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,759
It was torture.
But then you found me.

637
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,761
I can't thank you enough.

638
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,997
Don't thank us yet.
We still need to find this guy.

639
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,966
And we will.

640
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,635
<i>Got to think that</i>
<i>that guy was shot</i>

641
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,137
by the same person

642
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,472
who killed Renny Henderson
and Isabel Perez.

643
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,508
Ballistics already confirmed
that the bullet

644
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,976
that came out of his neck
was fired

645
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,311
from a Remington derringer.

646
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,813
Thing is, if he got robbed
on Tuesday night,

647
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,615
that means he was
the first victim.

648
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,617
The other two got killed
the next morning.

649
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,396
The antique bottle that
Sherlock put together,

650
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,787
it has to be the same bottle

651
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,488
that the killer stole, right?

652
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,601
I mean, he wanted to lace it
with the ricin that Renny made.

653
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,436
That's why he took the label
with him when he fled.

654
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,394
He didn't want
anyone catching on.

655
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,497
Question is, why did it have
to be Chateau Baptiste '57?

656
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,466
Why not one of Harris's
other bottles?

657
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,802
Think I should put it out
to the media, ask them to alert

658
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,670
all the bars and restaurants
in the city.

659
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,549
They need to hold off
on serving any of the stuff

660
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,007
until we figure this out.

661
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,742
No telling where
the poisoned bottles

662
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,144
might pop up,
so better safe than sorry.

663
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,856
I don't think they're gonna
pop up just anywhere.

664
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,015
I think I know exactly
who the killer wants to poison.

665
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,987
I'll get a location on this guy.

666
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,221
We can go alert him together.

667
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,391
I'll let Sherlock know.

668
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,361
Watson, excellent timing.
I have news.

669
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,030
So do I. I'm at the hospital
with Marcus right now.

670
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,875
If you don't mind, I'm
in the middle of burglarizing

671
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,034
- a criminal's lair, so...
- What?

672
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,602
Where are you?

673
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,081
Banking associate
of mine who traced

674
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,039
Tofel's accounts
found rent payments

675
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,574
for a walk-up in Tribeca.

676
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,920
And you thought it'd be
a good idea to break in there?

677
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,245
Well, no, I thought
I would find evidence

678
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,914
that Tofel authored the letters
threatening Odin's niece,

679
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,851
but instead I found a private
cardroom that he maintains.

680
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,020
That's where
the poker chips came from.

681
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,889
It seems he's less
degenerate gambler

682
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,858
and more poker host.

683
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,403
So there's nothing
to connect him to the letters?

684
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,804
No. In fact, I no longer think

685
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,362
he had anything to do with it.

686
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,564
It seems that his side business
is doing quite well.

687
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,366
He's actually up on the year.

688
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,734
That sort of blows our motive.

689
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,403
The man writes

690
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,238
dynamic programming algorithms
for Odker.

691
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,640
We shouldn't be surprised
that blackjack

692
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,909
hasn't proven so vexing
as to bankrupt him.

693
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,744
We'll have to go back
to the drawing board.

694
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,213
Well, we'll have to break
the bad news to Odin later.

695
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,606
Right now we have to ruin
a different rich guy's day.

696
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:05,817
You ever heard of Jason Wood?

697
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:06,702
No.

698
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,580
Well, he's the chief investment
officer at Grant Capital,

699
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,138
and I believe he is the target

700
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:13,041
of this ricin wine plot.

701
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,577
It's got to be one
of these Occupy people, right?

702
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:17,378
None of them can stand the fact

703
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,414
that someone else
has worked hard

704
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,873
and has more than they do.

705
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:21,937
H-Hon, slow down.

706
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:24,844
No one's said a word yet about
who wants to kill me or why.

707
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:26,479
To be honest, Mrs. Wood,

708
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:28,915
we're not ready to speculate
about motive at all.

709
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:31,417
Then why are you so
sure Jason's at risk?

710
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:33,763
Because we already know the
murder weapon they want to use.

711
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:36,289
It's a bottle
of Chateau Baptiste '57.

712
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:37,867
- That's my favorite wine.
- We know.

713
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:39,625
In fact, anyone
who's searched you

714
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:40,937
or Chateau Baptiste
online knows.

715
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:43,229
"For years,
Mr. Wood has snapped up

716
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:44,731
"every bottle of Baptiste '57

717
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,100
"that's come up for auction
in New York.

718
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,247
"And while other collectors

719
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:49,736
"stash their prizes
in the cellar,

720
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:52,605
the banking superstar confesses
he drinks every bottle."

721
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:54,440
Whoever wants you dead,

722
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:57,744
we're thinking they read this
and a light bulb went off.

723
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,279
Someone's out there
poisoning Baptiste?

724
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,315
With ricin.

725
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:04,017
It's cost two people
their lives so far.

726
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:05,785
Another man was shot
through the neck.

727
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:09,355
The killer seems hell-bent
on getting a poisoned bottle

728
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:10,867
of that particular vintage
in front of you.

729
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:13,593
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

730
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,094
I mean, I help run

731
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,673
one of the biggest hedge funds
in the world.

732
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,641
People wanting me dead, it
kind of comes with the job.

733
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,133
Nobody stands out?

734
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,702
I get at least one death threat
every quarter.

735
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,337
Two or three if we kick off

736
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:26,305
a merger that leads to
labor force contractions.

737
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:28,775
You mean, when you cost
thousands of people

738
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:29,942
their jobs?

739
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:34,746
You haven't bought
any Chateau Baptiste recently, have you?

740
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:35,982
No.

741
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,517
But I was planning on it.

742
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,029
There's a wine auction
in Chelsea tonight.

743
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,697
Corinna and I were gonna
pick up a few bottles.

744
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:42,555
I guess that's out. We
can nix the babysitter.

745
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:44,290
On the contrary.

746
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,935
We'd very much appreciate it
if the two of you

747
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,360
would be our guests
this evening.

748
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,801
I know Kevlar isn't
a breathable fabric,

749
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:57,737
but if you could stop adjusting
yourself, that'd be great.

750
00:29:57,805 --> 00:29:59,639
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

751
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:01,437
I can't believe
you suggested it.

752
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:03,194
Relax. Tonight's lot

753
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:05,507
was checked and secured by
the auction house two weeks ago.

754
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,465
Now, if this guy's plan
is gonna work,

755
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:10,101
he's gonna have to slip his
bottles into the mix tonight.

756
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,637
But if you're not here...
we'll miss our chance.

757
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:14,806
I don't see anyone
over there.

758
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,510
We're the only ones even going
near the Baptiste lot.

759
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:19,677
No one's even bidding.

760
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,479
Stop looking.
Just give him privacy

761
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:24,949
so he can slip in
his poisoned bottles.

762
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:27,619
Once he makes his move,
the police will jump on it.

763
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:34,793
Keith, you got eyes
on the target?

764
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,895
We got a little group
crowding our view

765
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,029
of Lot 49.

766
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,697
Give me the signal
if you see action.

767
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,836
You know,
in my line of work,

768
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,738
we try to minimize
risk and exposure.

769
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:48,373
That's exactly

770
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:49,808
why we're here.

771
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,843
To get the guy who wants
you dead off the street.

772
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:52,544
Minimize your risk.

773
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:53,878
They why do I feel

774
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:55,880
like I have a giant
bull's-eye on my chest?

775
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:57,515
Even if you did,

776
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,651
the chances are he
wouldn't be able to hit it.

777
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,520
We think he disposed of
his only weapon in a pond.

778
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:04,399
Not to mention the fact
that he's gone to great lengths

779
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:05,490
not to shoot you.

780
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:06,691
It suggests
the appeal

781
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,726
of this little
scheme is anonymity.

782
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:10,695
Wait. Wh-What do you mean?

783
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:12,741
He means that the killer
probably doesn't think

784
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,532
he can shoot you
and get away with it.

785
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,278
Poisoning wine that you like,
on the other hand,

786
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,080
wine that anyone here tonight
could have bought,

787
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:19,838
it would have seemed
more random.

788
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,283
It would have made it
more difficult

789
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,507
for police to identify him.

790
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:24,676
It also affords
him time to get away.

791
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,945
By the time you're choking
to death on your own vomit,

792
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,346
he could be
on another continent.

793
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:31,416
Anyone ever tell you two

794
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:32,917
your bedside
manner sucks?

795
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,220
Just look for people
you recognize.

796
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:37,388
Employees.
Corporate rivals.

797
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,557
Any threats at all.

798
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:47,599
Hey.

799
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,100
- Oh.
- What's going on?

800
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,903
Looks like we lost the signal
from the cameras.

801
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,362
We got to see the floor, man.

802
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:54,453
How long will it take
to get them back?

803
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,477
I got to do this
one at a time.

804
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,953
This venue's not a bank,
you know?

805
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,621
This is just a temporary setup
for this event.

806
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,212
We're wireless here.

807
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,991
Well, if we can't turn
all the cameras back on

808
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:05,884
at the same time, how did they
all go off at the same time?

809
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,586
Well, the rest of the power's
still on, so, uh...

810
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,155
I don't know, signal jammer?

811
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:14,559
Radio check.
Someone say "copy."

812
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:16,094
Damn it.

813
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,795
It <i>is</i> a jammer.

814
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:29,962
What is it?

815
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,498
When we arrived here this
evening, I made small marks

816
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:34,604
<i>on the labels of the bottles</i>
<i>of Baptiste '57.</i>

817
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:37,131
When we passed by three minutes ago,
everything was as I had left it.

818
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:39,166
Now two of the bottles
are missing their marks.

819
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:41,904
He must have made
the switch. How did...

820
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:43,606
Hey.
We have a problem.

821
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,785
All the cameras are down,
and somebody jammed the signal.

822
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,977
It's because they were
ready to make the switch.

823
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:48,978
Just a moment ago.

824
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:50,323
He's still got to be here.

825
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:52,281
I mean, this space is huge,

826
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,509
and with this crowd,
he can't just sprint for the exit.

827
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:56,285
Please lock the room down, now.

828
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:57,754
We need to keep him
here with us.

829
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:59,341
You want me to risk
spooking the killer

830
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,034
and then trap him in here
with a hundred people?

831
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:03,493
Do you want
to catch him or not?

832
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,828
Keith! Seal the exit.

833
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:09,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Detective Marcus Bell,

834
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,001
NYPD.
Sorry to ruin your evening,

835
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,578
but this is a police matter--
I need you all to remain calm.

836
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,496
This room just became
a crime scene.

837
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,301
Signal jammer that knocked
out the security cameras,

838
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,528
it was in a potted plant.

839
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:26,842
Killer smuggled it in,

840
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,778
flipped it on when he
was ready to make the swap.

841
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:30,446
Did CSU find any prints?

842
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:33,015
No. They're not optimistic
we'll be able to pull one

843
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,661
off the poisoned bottles
he planted, either.

844
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,285
Any luck with the guests?

845
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:37,830
An impressive cross section
of Manhattan's elite.

846
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:40,122
I reckon half of them
are capable of homicide.

847
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,326
Nobody jumps out for the murders
we've been looking into?

848
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,861
Jason and Corinna said they
don't recognize anyone here.

849
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:48,998
Then we got nothing.
We have to let these people go.

850
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm convinced the killer
is in this room with us.

851
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:52,501
You might be right...

852
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,537
- Might?
- I'm aware of your track record,

853
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:56,004
but knowing he's here
and proving it

854
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,039
are two different things.

855
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:58,474
The folks in this room
have half

856
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:00,142
the New York Bar Association
on retainer.

857
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,677
I can't detain them indefinitely

858
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,479
until we can tie someone
to the crime.

859
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:05,948
Sorry.

860
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,859
Wait.

861
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:18,728
It's him.

862
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:19,862
I know you.

863
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,164
You're the bartender,
Colby, right?

864
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:24,500
<i>Didn't recognize you</i>
<i>without the beard and the hat.</i>

865
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:26,002
What are you doing here?

866
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:27,703
I like wine.
Is that a crime?

867
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,539
No. But murder, conspiracy
and animal cruelty are.

868
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:33,387
The knots on his shoes,
they're figure eight packer's knots.

869
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:34,665
Rarely seen outside
the meat industry.

870
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,456
Your father a butcher?

871
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,625
They're identical
to the knots used

872
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,494
<i>to tie rocks</i>
<i>to Renny Henderson and his hog</i>

873
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,029
to make him sink
in Richmond Pond.

874
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:43,363
They look like the bindings

875
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,298
<i>that were around</i>
<i>Todd Harris's hands, too.</i>

876
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,450
You might as well
have signed your crimes.

877
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,035
Come on.

878
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:50,170
You think I'm a criminal
because of my shoelaces?

879
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,506
Actually, mate,
knot forensics have been used

880
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,541
to identify the culprits
in many cases,

881
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:56,209
all of them
prosecuted successfully,

882
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,678
as I'm certain yours will be.

883
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,017
So, this fella,

884
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,186
he breaks into
Todd Harris's home,

885
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,921
steals his wine,
shoots him,

886
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,323
takes the bottles
to Renny Henderson.

887
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,825
Forces him
to make ricin,

888
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,927
tests it on Renny's pig,
which kills the pig.

889
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,696
He kills Renny, too.

890
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:16,930
Then he kills
Isabel Perez

891
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,732
to cover it up
just so he could fail

892
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,167
to poison his actual target.

893
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:21,268
He had a busy week.

894
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,737
Someone should
have told this idiot

895
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,505
there are simpler ways
to kill a man.

896
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,875
Maybe not if you're hoping
to get away with it.

897
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:31,211
His plan wasn't complicated;
it was deliberately designed

898
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,246
to obscure his involvement.

899
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,248
He would inevitably be
the prime suspect

900
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,745
in any direct attack
on the Woods.

901
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:37,529
Why is that?

902
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,915
Because he's been obsessed

903
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,550
with Corinna Wood
for a long time.

904
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,152
Ever since high school, in fact.

905
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,154
They grew up in
Montana together,

906
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:45,654
and he followed her to New York.

907
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:48,035
He was arrested for stalking her.
He served five years

908
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:50,827
for that and an unrelated
weapons charge.

909
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,396
You were right--
that's why he

910
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:54,398
couldn't get his hands
on a decent weapon.

911
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:55,832
While he was inside,

912
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,534
he read that Corinna
had got married,

913
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,069
and that outraged him.

914
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,904
She was his
and his alone.

915
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,273
But how was he gonna get rid
of her interloping spouse?

916
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,342
Inspiration struck

917
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,277
when he found out
that Corinna's new husband

918
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:09,880
had a taste
for Chateau Baptiste '57.

919
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:11,348
Well, if the wife knew the guy,

920
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,926
how come she didn't
recognize him at the auction?

921
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,719
Because the last time she saw
him, he was 200 pounds heavier.

922
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,888
He lost all the
weight in prison.

923
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,259
Always inspiring
to see a convict

924
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,504
using their time productively.

925
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:24,694
Perhaps this
time around,

926
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,106
he'll write
the Great American Novel.

927
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,597
I suppose he'll have

928
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,766
the rest of his life
to figure it out.

929
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:37,441
"When an archer misses
the center of the target,

930
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:39,709
"he turns around

931
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:42,112
and looks for the cause of
his failure within himself."

932
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,448
I like Confucius
as much as the next guy,

933
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:46,574
but sometimes the wind blows.

934
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:47,651
If you have
a moment,

935
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:50,253
we'd like to discuss the matter
of your niece, Mr. Reichenbach.

936
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,090
Oh, you can call me Odin.
All my friends do.

937
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,835
I haven't decided
if we're going to be friends.

938
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,159
We came to tell you

939
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:57,260
that Abigail is safe.

940
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:00,097
Well, that is a relief.

941
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:03,467
So... who sent
the kidnapping threats?

942
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,836
There is no kidnapping
threat. Never was.

943
00:37:05,903 --> 00:37:08,271
Watson and I vetted
every Odker employee

944
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,907
on the list of suspects
that you gave us.

945
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,943
None of them sent
any letters.

946
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,653
We visited your
sister this morning--

947
00:37:14,654 --> 00:37:17,514
we told her that we hit a wall
and asked her if she could think

948
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,916
of anyone close to her that
might have sent the threats.

949
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,895
Maybe they didn't come
from inside Odker after all.

950
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:24,688
She had no idea what
we were talking about.

951
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,155
Said she never
received any threats.

952
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,591
You sent us

953
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:29,593
on a wild goose chase;
we'd like to know why.

954
00:37:30,477 --> 00:37:32,036
It was a test.

955
00:37:32,037 --> 00:37:34,105
You passed.

956
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:36,474
Our renown as detectives

957
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,243
is the reason you hired
us in the first place.

958
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:41,479
So testing our skills is
completely unnecessary.

959
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,781
It wasn't your skills
I was testing.

960
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,116
It was the two of you.

961
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:49,120
I told you my niece
was in danger,

962
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:51,689
and you did everything
in your power to help her.

963
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:53,657
Everything.
Whether it was legal or not.

964
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,493
You don't know
what steps we took.

965
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,328
I do.

966
00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,498
You solicited an illegal search
of my employee's bank records.

967
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:02,333
You broke into his home.

968
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,135
You broke more
than a dozen laws.

969
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:06,303
Don't worry, you've
nothing to fear from me.

970
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:07,938
Right now, I'm on your side.

971
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:09,974
I'd do anything to protect
an innocent person.

972
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,942
It's an impulse

973
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,712
I think we share with someone
you've apprehended recently.

974
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:16,213
Patrick Meers.

975
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,652
We were looking for the people
he was working for.

976
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,287
You're one of
them, aren't you?

977
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,623
You've been laboring
under the misconception

978
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,325
that Patrick is
some sort of terrorist.

979
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,327
That's not true. In fact,
I'd call him a patriot.

980
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:32,296
The world could use
more people like him.

981
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,964
In fact,
I'd like to think

982
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm looking
at two of them right now.

983
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,335
Our friend was shot
and almost killed,

984
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,407
and you just admitted
you were behind it.

985
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:42,406
I didn't tell Patrick Meers
to kill your captain.

986
00:38:42,474 --> 00:38:43,841
He made a mess.

987
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:45,809
He made his own decisions
about cleaning it up

988
00:38:45,877 --> 00:38:47,251
and I am very sorry for it.

989
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:50,681
Sorry enough to admit your involvement
to the NYPD?

990
00:38:50,749 --> 00:38:52,349
All I did

991
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,885
was tell Patrick what I'd
learned about Tim Bledsoe.

992
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:57,521
I had reason to believe
that an army veteran

993
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:59,490
with his psychological makeup

994
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:01,892
would take steps to avoid
a tragedy, and he did.

995
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,994
What happened next was
also tragic, but...

996
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:06,230
...I am a practical man,

997
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:07,998
and 200 lives were saved.

998
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,167
I'd like to talk about <i>that.</i>

999
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:13,337
We speak with murderers on a
regular basis, Mr. Reichenbach.

1000
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:15,039
Do you imagine any of them

1001
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,907
convinced us of
their righteousness?

1002
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,442
Perhaps you
should consider

1003
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,011
the possibility
that I am not the kind of man

1004
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,013
you deal with
on a regular basis.

1005
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:34,158

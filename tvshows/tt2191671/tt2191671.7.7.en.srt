1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:01,716
<i>Previously on Elementary...</i>

2
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:04,053
The captain, he's been shot.

3
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,331
So, that's Captain Dwyer.

4
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,632
He's gonna cover both squads

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,216
till we know more
about Captain Gregson.

6
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:09,904
<i>Your real name is</i>

7
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:11,373
Olga Berezhnaya.

8
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:14,242
To put it bluntly, you're
an international spy.

9
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,443
You can call me Patrick.

10
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:16,845
It's not Lieutenant Meers
anymore.

11
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,747
I left the army last year.
I did it.

12
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:20,782
<i>I didn't really want</i>
<i>to shoot that cop.</i>

13
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,096
He never wavered from his story,
and there's no way to prove

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,398
that he knew about Tim Bledsoe's
plan to blow up the ferry.

15
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:27,856
I didn't tell Patrick Meers
to kill your captain.

16
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,691
I think this is too big
for the NYPD.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,694
The NSA is the only agency
with the technical wherewithal

18
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:33,956
to untangle this knot.

19
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,250
Agent McNally.

20
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,784
Did you become
a member

21
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,019
of Reichenbach's cabal

22
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,021
before I came to see you
or after?

23
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,457
Our friend doesn't want to
hurt any of you, but I think

24
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,170
it's important you realize
he could hurt all of you.

25
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,360
Don't get in his way.

26
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,033
I'll never forget
the night Tommy got shot.

27
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,202
Don't know how many
of you know this,

28
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,437
but, uh, he and I...

29
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:59,771
used to work out of the 2-9
for a stretch.

30
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,507
The Yanks were playing the Mets
in the World Series.

31
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,376
That's how long ago it was.

32
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:07,378
Tommy was a Mets guy.

33
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,447
I, of course, bled Yankees blue.

34
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:12,683
When I told him that the Yanks
would take it five,

35
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:14,685
he says, "No way.

36
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,287
Mets in seven."

37
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,689
So we put our money
where our mouths were.

38
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,825
Hundred bucks.

39
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:22,460
Cut to 18 years later.

40
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:23,861
Night of.

41
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,164
I'm just getting out
of the shower--

42
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,232
no fantasizing, ladies...

43
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:32,303
...when I get the call
from a mutual friend.

44
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,572
He says, "Tommy Gregson
took one in the gut

45
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,674
"and one in the back tonight.

46
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,476
They don't think
he's gonna make it."

47
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,179
I just stood there, frozen.

48
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,347
My friend, he goes,
"Hey, you okay?"

49
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,918
I says, "No. I'm not.

50
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,387
Guy still owes me
a hundred bucks."

51
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,890
Now, before I officially return

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,560
the 11th
to your friend and mine,

53
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:58,663
I'm gonna hold something up--
you tell me what it is.

54
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,383
Come on, Novacek, help me out.

55
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,183
I believe that's
your shield, sir.

56
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,710
Exactly.
It's my shield.

57
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,109
We call it that because
it's supposed to protect us,

58
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:14,245
remind people that
we're part of something bigger,

59
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,214
something strong.

60
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,850
Now, Tommy, I know
you had your shield with you

61
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:22,286
when you got shot, and obviously
it didn't do much good,

62
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,088
so we chipped in,

63
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:27,625
and we had one made special
just for you. Marcus?

64
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,031
Ah, you shouldn't have.

65
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:41,439
Welcome home, Tommy.

66
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:44,108
Oh, seriously,

67
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,810
I'm, uh, I'm touched.

68
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,413
How about a special round
of applause for Captain Dwyer!

69
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:18,476
Got a minute?

70
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,278
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come on in.

71
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,248
I know my timing
could not be worse,

72
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,150
this being your first
day back and all,

73
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,253
but I wanted you to know,
I'm putting in my papers.

74
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,956
Friday is my last day.

75
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,424
You're kidding.

76
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,426
I got an offer in
the private sector.

77
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,428
It's too good to pass up.

78
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,331
Bree, you're just three years
away from your full pension.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,767
When we went over
your annual evaluation,

80
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:44,576
I told you I was
putting you in for a promotion.

81
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,480
You said that was
what you wanted.

82
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,169
It was. Then.

83
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,840
Now...

84
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,943
I want something else.

85
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,644
You're one of my best.

86
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,212
You know that, right?

87
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,315
I appreciate you saying that.

88
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,516
I'm not just saying it.

89
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,418
You sure there's
nothing I can do,

90
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:02,453
talk you into staying?

91
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,188
Sorry.

92
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,223
But I wanted you know

93
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,527
I appreciate everything
you did for me.

94
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:12,163
You're the best boss I ever had.

95
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,131
Well, thank you.

96
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,971
<i>This is Janice.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

97
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,973
Baby, wherever you are,

98
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,542
whatever you're doing, stop.

99
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,244
Get over here.
Your man crushed it tonight.

100
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,413
You and me...

101
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,818
...we got some celebrating
to do.

102
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,659
Baby, you here?

103
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,327
I tried calling you back,

104
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,863
but I got your... voice mail.

105
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,501
What?

106
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,415
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:07,518
Babe, this is
just like the movies.

108
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:09,887
Oh...

109
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:11,589
Babe, uh-uh.

110
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,891
I don't care how hard
you worked tonight, okay?

111
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,760
You made a promise
we're gonna celebrate.

112

114
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,606
His name is Ridley Dineen,
and according to his girlfriend,

115
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:56,419
he's a lot more interesting
than his rap sheet

116
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,819
would lead you
to believe.

117
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:00,522
I'm seeing petty theft,
misdemeanor assault.

118
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,857
What's missing?

119
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,358
Apparently, a string
of robberies

120
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,360
perpetrated against
drug dealers.

121
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,029
He was an Omar.

122
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,698
You know, from <i>The Wire?</i>

123
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,700
Scar on his face.
Whistled that creepy song.

124
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,069
I'll loan you my DVDs.

125
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,818
You were saying:
Mr. Dineen made his living

126
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,205
stealing from criminals.

127
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,374
The girlfriend said
he got some hot tip

128
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:21,410
about a stash house
the other day.

129
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,889
He was supposed to
be flush with cash.

130
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,313
He did the job
last night,

131
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,081
came home with just
under 200 grand.

132
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,550
Then he went all Scrooge
McDuck on his bed.

133
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,852
And who or what
is Scrooge McDuck?

134
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,087
Picture your father

135
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,156
but... as a duck.

136
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,635
He liked to roll
around in his money,

137
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,725
which is the last thing

138
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:37,926
Dineen did
before he died.

139
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,594
So a thief and his score

140
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,830
are accounted for--
why are we here?

141
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,032
Couple reasons.
The stash house he knocked off

142
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:47,002
was supposed to be unguarded,
but CSU found fresh blood

143
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,037
on the barrel
of his nine-millimeter.

144
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:51,707
So, obviously he shot someone.
We want to know who.

145
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,508
What's the other reason?

146
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,577
Looks like Mr. Dineen died
of an overdose.

147
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,045
I'm still waiting
on the tox screen,

148
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,380
but my money's on fentanyl.

149
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,681
I assume you're familiar.

150
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,450
Synthetic opioid.
A lot of dealers

151
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,085
lace their heroin with it.

152
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:04,586
According to the lab,

153
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,455
the money he stole
was filthy with the stuff,

154
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,724
which would seem to suggest
it was the drug being made

155
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:09,952
by the dealers he ripped off.

156
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,293
So there's thinking that

157
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,095
he didn't use fentanyl at all,

158
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,297
but he died
from an actual "contact high."

159
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:18,066
The drugs on the money
were absorbed into his skin.

160
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,301
No.

161
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,703
Fentanyl toxicity cannot
be achieved through touch.

162
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:22,871
I don't know, man.

163
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,573
I've seen some articles lately.

164
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,141
So have I.
And to be clear,

165
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,154
there are few things on
the planet dirtier than money.

166
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:29,644
It was once estimated

167
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,714
that 90% of American currency
had traces of cocaine on it.

168
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:34,082
That, I believe.

169
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:35,817
What I don't believe
is that touching it

170
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,586
can turn a person
into Hunter S. Thompson.

171
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:40,489
Fentanyl's supposed
to be... different.

172
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:42,557
You're both MDs.
Could you tell him?

173
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:46,228
Um, according to the American
College of Medical Toxicology,

174
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:48,296
even if you covered both
hands in fentanyl patches,

175
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,765
it would still take 15 minutes

176
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,967
just to receive
a therapeutic level of the drug.

177
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,068
That said,
I couldn't find

178
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,103
any injection marks
on Mr. Dineen.

179
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,239
There weren't any indications
he smoked, either.

180
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:59,074
It's possible
he ate some fentanyl,

181
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,076
but that would be
pretty unusual.

182
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,611
Look, according to the lab,

183
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,679
the real issue is the potency
of the fentanyl.

184
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,616
We got to find whoever's making
the stuff and shut 'em down,

185
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:10,445
'cause if we don't, it's only a
matter of time before more people die.

186
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:15,357
I'm sorry, I want to help,
it's just...

187
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,426
I already went through it all
with the other cops.

188
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,694
It's just hard, you know?

189
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,997
We understand.
But like we said,

190
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,266
a couple of things
have changed since last night.

191
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,002
You said the money Ridley
stole had drugs on it.

192
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,028
You think maybe that's
what killed him?

193
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,204
Did you touch any of it?

194
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,508
No.

195
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,310
I saw Ridley and called 911.

196
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,479
And you have no idea
where the money came from?

197
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:38,680
He had a tip.

198
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,348
Said it was from an old friend.

199
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,518
There was a stash house,
and it wasn't guarded at night.

200
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,054
"Easy money," he said.

201
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,889
All I know.

202
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,858
He never mentioned
the friend's name?

203
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,794
No. But maybe you can
look through his phone?

204
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,297
We did. Nothing jumped out.

205
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:58,467
We're gonna want to get
a list of associates,

206
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,336
anyone you think might be
the one who reached out.

207
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:02,838
Sure.

208
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:05,574
Did Ridley ever use drugs?

209
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,643
Never.

210
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:09,712
You're sure?

211
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,814
He lost a brother ten years ago.

212
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,683
Heroin.

213
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,252
It's one of the reasons he liked
knocking over drug dealers.

214
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,821
He figured they had it coming.

215
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,558
For a while, I was on meth.

216
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,227
Ridley made me
go to meetings,

217
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:28,029
and he said he could never
be with anybody who used.

218
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:31,066
I got clean.

219
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,667
For him.

220
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,505
I know he wasn't
a good guy, but...

221
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,773
he was my guy.

222
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:47,549
Dineen's car
was a bust.

223
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:50,685
Nothing that would help us
locate the stash house.

224
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,021
No drug paraphernalia,
either.

225
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,789
And yet I remain convinced

226
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,125
that it wasn't the money
that killed him.

227
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,561
Why, did you find
some fentanyl in here?

228
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,196
No, I just believe
in science.

229
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:02,697
I know what the science says.

230
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,766
I also know cops
who swear they got sick

231
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,201
just from touching the stuff.

232
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,037
That's the classic
nocebo effect.

233
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,940
The mere suggestion that
a substance can be harmful

234
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,744
causes people to suffer
negative effects after exposure.

235
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:18,113
You about ready to go?

236
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,482
You didn't see a cat in here
anywhere, did you?

237
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,284
No. Why?

238
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:23,818
'Cause there's cat hair
everywhere.

239
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,253
Persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

240
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,122
So?

241
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:31,226
Well, I just didn't see any cat
food or kitty litter anywhere.

242
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,828
Dineen was a professional
armed robber.

243
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,375
Would it really
surprise you to find out

244
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,232
he didn't take great
care of his pet?

245
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,635
We missed you guys yesterday.

246
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:41,970
Why?

247
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,239
The welcome-back thing
for the captain.

248
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,508
Oh, yeah.
We, uh...

249
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,910
we were finishing up a matter
for a private client,

250
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,780
but I assure you,
we were there in spirit.

251
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:55,951
You guys making any progress
with the Meers investigation?

252
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,186
Joan said you were
still kicking it around.

253
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,422
We all know he wasn't
working alone, right?

254
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,124
He shot the captain to protect
his "cell" or whatever.

255
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,261
I'm afraid we haven't made
any progress at all.

256
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:11,833
Hey. I'm leaving.

257
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,501
I did a hospital canvass.

258
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,637
No one was shot with
a nine-millimeter last night.

259
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,439
Guessing that doesn't bode well

260
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:20,008
for whoever Ridley Dineen shot
at the stash house.

261
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,344
Could have been the wound
was superficial

262
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:24,312
and the victim took care
of himself.

263
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,615
Or he's dead,
and his drug-dealing buddies

264
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,983
got rid of his corpse.

265
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,352
- You got a sec?
- Sure.

266
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:33,655
Would you close the door?

267
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:36,524
Is everything okay?

268
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,660
I wanted to talk to you
about Captain Dwyer.

269
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,563
What did you think of him?

270
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,131
He was fine. I mean,

271
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,877
a little brusque,
a little full of himself.

272
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,469
But for the most part,
he left me and Sherlock alone.

273
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,871
He ever make you feel
uncomfortable?

274
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,640
No. Why?

275
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,576
Bree Novacek is leaving
the department.

276
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:58,480
According to her, it's because
a better job came along.

277
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,382
But you think it's because
of something

278
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,550
that happened
with Captain Dwyer?

279
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,819
He's good at the job.
They wouldn't have tapped him

280
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,488
to run two squads if he wasn't.

281
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:09,591
But he's also got a reputation.

282
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,895
Doesn't always watch what he
says or does around female cops.

283
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,597
Last year a civilian aide

284
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,599
at the 12th filed
a complaint with the EEO.

285
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,367
Said he pressured her
to go out with him.

286
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:20,869
When all was said and done,

287
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,239
he received a "one-year
dismissal probation."

288
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:27,242
Means he could be terminated
if there was another incident.

289
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,278
Suffice it to say, he wouldn't
have been my first choice

290
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,080
to fill in for me here.

291
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,015
Well, I don't know what to say.

292
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:36,418
I mean, I didn't see him do
anything inappropriate,

293
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:38,286
but that doesn't mean he didn't.

294
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:41,723
I got a wife who used to be a
cop and a daughter who still is.

295
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,192
I know both of them have had
their fair share

296
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,927
of Dwyers to deal with.

297
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,397
I know what I want
to happen to guys like that.

298
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:52,067
I file a complaint, that's it
for him. He's gone.

299
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,437
But Novacek never
even mentioned his name.

300
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,772
Maybe talk to him.

301
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,974
See how he reacts when he hears
what you're thinking.

302
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,544
I mean, that might tell you
everything you need to know.

303
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:08,249
Hey. How'd it go at
Dineen's apartment?

304
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:09,718
Poorly.

305
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:11,586
The location of the stash house
that he robbed

306
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:13,154
is a secret that he died with.

307
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,589
What are those?

308
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:16,391
Oh. Gifts from the lab

309
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,059
and the ME's office.

310
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,928
The top one is an
analysis of the blood

311
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,796
that was on Dineen's
nine-millimeter.

312
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:24,733
They ran it through CODIS,
but they didn't get any matches.

313
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:25,938
So we still don't know
who he shot.

314
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,069
No.

315
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,536
Uh, the other is the tox screen

316
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,338
that Eugene was waiting for.
He was right.

317
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,308
The drug that killed
Dineen was fentanyl.

318
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,276
Any idea how it got
into his system?

319
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:36,856
No, but his girlfriend swore
up and down

320
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,346
that he never
would have used drugs.

321
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,148
Apparently,
he didn't even drink.

322
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,861
You agree with me that it
couldn't have been absorbed

323
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:42,817
through his skin.

324
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:44,085
I do,

325
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:45,687
but if she was telling
the truth,

326
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,567
how do we explain the results
from the tox screen?

327
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,290
Thought you'd be home earlier.

328
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,525
Yeah, me, too.

329
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,527
- The captain wanted to talk.
- What about?

330
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:53,862
Captain Dwyer.

331
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,601
Did you ever notice
any unusual behavior from him?

332
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,970
Saw him wash his hands
before he urinated once.

333
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:04,205
Mm. That's not what I meant.

334
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,107
Did you ever see him

335
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,842
acting inappropriately
with anyone?

336
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,310
Bree Novacek, for example?

337
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:12,380
I never saw anything untoward.

338
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,182
But if I'm honest,
I mostly avoided the man.

339
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,684
He didn't care what you and I
got up to, and I liked that.

340
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,254
Hmm.

341
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,856
It says here there's traces of
Albuterol in Dineen's system.

342
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,458
Yeah, to help him breathe.

343
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,687
His girlfriend said that he had
terrible cat allergies.

344
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,162
So why does he own a cat?

345
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,530
Pretty sure he didn't.

346
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,131
Cat hair all over his apartment.

347
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,337
Where are you going?

348
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,450
Back to Dineen's apartment.

349
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:38,594
Something I've got to check.

350
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:44,412
You want to tell me
what was so important

351
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,214
I had to meet you
here off-duty?

352
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,817
I think I know how the fentanyl
got into Dineen's system.

353
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:57,525
So, earlier...

354
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,929
I noticed this inhaler;
I thought he had asthma,

355
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,665
but he didn't.
He had a cat allergy.

356
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,111
I thought you said
there was a bunch

357
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,401
of cat hair on
his furniture.

358
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,403
I did, and there was.

359
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,005
But now I think
it was placed there.

360
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:12,674
Did you bring those
fentanyl test strips?

361
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,594
Whoever put the cat hair there

362
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,864
wanted to trigger
an allergy attack

363
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,799
so that Dineen would use
his inhaler.

364
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,702
Why?

365
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,571
Because it was laced
with aerosolized fentanyl.

366
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,875
Two lines.
Positive for fentanyl.

367
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,544
Ridley Dineen's death
was not an accident.

368
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,246
He was murdered.

369
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,876
The lab tested the contents
of the inhaler

370
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:01,073
and got the same results
Sherlock did.

371
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,793
The chamber was filled
with aerosolized fentanyl.

372
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,295
Now, does that prove
that he died from a hit off that

373
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,930
and not from touching the money?
No.

374
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,099
But it does seem more likely.

375
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,300
Somebody killed him.

376
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,809
We think it's the same person

377
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,903
who tipped him off
about the stash house.

378
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:16,805
If it was,
that person obviously knew

379
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,641
that the money there
would have fentanyl on it.

380
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,321
He couldn't be sure it would
be enough to kill Dineen,

381
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:22,945
so he messed
with the inhaler,

382
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,414
probably while Dineen was
out pulling off the heist.

383
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,649
If somebody wanted Dineen dead,

384
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,285
why not just mess
with the inhaler?

385
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:31,987
Why also send him
after the money?

386
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,800
The money makes the whole thing
look like an accident.

387
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,991
He touched it and OD'd.
End of story.

388
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,093
Who would go to all that trouble

389
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,362
to kill a lowlife
like Ridley Dineen?

390
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:43,165
Would you believe the
Russian government?

391
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,134
We know how it sounds,

392
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:48,337
but remember back in 2002,
when Chechen rebels took

393
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,539
a few hundred people hostage
in a theater in Moscow?

394
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:53,709
Russian troops flooded the place
with some mystery gas.

395
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,322
They thought it was gonna
incapacitate the rebels.

396
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:56,779
It did.

397
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:59,181
But it also killed
a whole bunch of hostages.

398
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Over a hundred.

399
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,395
The Russians would never say

400
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,618
what was in the gas,

401
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,186
but most experts thought it was

402
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,022
a fentanyl derivative
known as Kolokol-1.

403
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,824
Let me guess:

404
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:11,660
it's the same spray
that was in the inhaler.

405
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:12,895
Probably.

406
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:13,996
Probably?

407
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,799
The Russians have never
officially revealed

408
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,801
the chemical structure
of Kolokol-1.

409
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,704
But Sherlock came across it once
when he consulted for MI6.

410
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:24,506
Apparently,
what he saw is a match

411
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,575
for what the lab found
in the inhaler.

412
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,478
Are we thinking Dineen
was some sort of spy?

413
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:32,214
'Cause if the whole
d-bag criminal thing

414
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:35,250
is an act, it's a hell
of a good one.

415
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,786
Crazy as it sounds,
it's possible.

416
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,335
He could have been an operative
for them or some other country.

417
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,057
Which is why Sherlock
has gone to have

418
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:45,561
a conversation with someone
he knows is a Russian spy.

419
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,163
"Hedgehog, Hedgehog,
please come quick.

420
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,666
"Something's happened,
I feel sick.

421
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,901
"Peacock, Peacock,
what's the matter?

422
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,838
"Why are you in such a lather?

423
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,740
"My plume, said Peacock,
someone took it.

424
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,243
Someone mean
and very crooked."

425
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,544
Yes, Max.

426
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,784
Oh, don't stop on my account.
I love a good mystery.

427
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,719
Um, if now's a bad time,

428
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,588
I see that 1:00 is "dance time."

429
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,556
I could come back then.

430
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,924
I know from experience,
children,

431
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,860
your teacher is
an excellent dancer.

432
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,661
Amani, would you mind
taking over for me

433
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,129
while I speak to
my friend outside?

434
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:34,877
That's quite a transition,
stripper to first grade teacher.

435
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,979
Why the move?

436
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,882
The attention being paid to
your current administration's

437
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,418
relationship with my country
has made it much more difficult

438
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,720
to operate within the U.S.

439
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:45,921
Mm-hmm.

440
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,289
Too many reporters

441
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,892
and federal investigators
snooping around.

442
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,460
Some of us were extracted.

443
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,262
Some, like myself,
were reassigned.

444
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,130
And I assume you were put here

445
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:58,400
because so many of the students'
parents work at the U.N.?

446
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:01,003
What do you want?

447
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:02,638
Information.

448
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,908
A man named Ridley Dineen
was murdered two nights ago.

449
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,309
Ring any bells?

450
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:08,911
No.

451
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,413
He was killed with
aerosolized Kolokol-1.

452
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,484
Now you understand
why I came to see you.

453
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,986
The incident in Moscow.

454
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,188
Was Dineen one of yours?

455
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,291
If he was,
I wasn't made aware of him.

456
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,261
It's not like we all get
together on the weekends.

457
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,363
Perhaps he was an...

458
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,667
Perhaps he was an operative
for an enemy of Mother Russia.

459
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,169
It's possible,
but, again,

460
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:38,106
I was never
made aware of him.

461
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,942
Could you make
yourself aware?

462
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,811
Talk to your handlers.

463
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,424
If the Russian government
was responsible

464
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,682
and it was just a bit
of spy-on-spy violence,

465
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,784
it's possible I
could understand.

466
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,320
And my investigation
might just go away.

467
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,955
I don't believe you.

468
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,890
When we first crossed paths,

469
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,359
I could have outed you
as a spy, but I didn't.

470
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:00,362
Is that supposed to make me
trust you more or less?

471
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,164
Well, forget about trust.

472
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:05,801
I'd say that you owed
me one, wouldn't you?

473
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,248
Oh. Look who's out
of his jurisdiction.

474
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,817
Hey, Bill.

475
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:24,186
What happened?

476
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,032
You finally figure out
the food around the 11th stinks?

477
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:30,225
Actually, I'm here to talk.

478
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,927
What's up?

479
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,996
Bree Novacek

480
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:36,565
came to see me
the other day.

481
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,567
Oh.

482
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,003
She's putting in her papers.

483
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,271
Too bad. She's a good cop.

484
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,008
She's one of my best.

485
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,677
I got to ask, Bill.

486
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,679
- Don't.
- Don't what?

487
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:53,448
Don't insult me by asking
what you're thinking of asking.

488
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:56,585
Did something happen
between you two?

489
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:59,554
You don't listen so good.

490
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,025
If you did or said anything
to make her feel uncomfortable,

491
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,894
that would actually mean
<i>you</i> don't listen so good.

492
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:09,064
You're still on
dismissal probation.

493
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,632
What the hell
did she tell you, huh?

494
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,701
That I told her a joke?

495
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,102
That I looked at her funny?

496
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,448
Come on, tell me.
I want to know.

497
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:17,039
About you? Nothing.

498
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,373
Not a word.

499
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,108
But I know your history.

500
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,543
That's it. We're done.

501
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:22,878
I'm asking you
nice, Bill.

502
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:24,880
Tell me what you did.

503
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,916
You want to know what I did?
I'll tell you what I did.

504
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:31,620
I worked my ass off,
covering your squad and mine

505
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,655
while <i>you</i> were laid up
in the hospital.

506
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,925
I did <i>your</i> job, Tommy,
and I did it well.

507
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:40,295
You want to say something to me?
Say thank you!

508
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,773
Hey.

509
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,175
Hey. I'm at the morgue.

510
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:54,609
Pretty sure I'm looking

511
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:56,611
at the guy
Ridley Dineen shot last night.

512
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,247
So much for bringing him in
alive.

513
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,583
This mean
we found the stash house?

514
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:04,786
No. That's not where his body
turned up.

515
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:07,155
Do we at least have
a gang affiliation?

516
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,858
That depends.
Does Mensa count?

517
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:11,593
Mensa?

518
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:15,263
This guy--
he's not what we were expecting.

519
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,133
His name's Cecil Troy.
The bullets that killed him

520
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:20,836
<i>are</i> a match for Ridley
Dineen's nine-millimeter.

521
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,216
He was shot in the chest first.
When he went to the ground,

522
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,108
Dineen moved in close
to finish the job.

523
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:30,979
So, soft hands, no tattoos,
membership of a high IQ society.

524
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:32,347
I'm gonna hazard
a guess and say

525
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,716
he wasn't guarding a stash house
when he died.

526
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:36,818
He was found in his garage
in Dyker Heights.

527
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,887
Pretty sure
he'd just gotten out of his car

528
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,222
when Dineen popped him.

529
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,656
The money with the
fentanyl on it--

530
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,269
you think Dineen stole
it from this guy?

531
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:44,893
I went through his house
with CSU.

532
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:46,995
Didn't find any evidence
of fentanyl

533
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,797
or that Mr. Troy was involved

534
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,133
in any other kind
of criminal activity.

535
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:52,712
When I called Dineen's
girlfriend and asked

536
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,035
if she'd ever
heard of him,

537
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:55,804
she said no.
Far as she knew,

538
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:57,506
the only crime Dineen got up to

539
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,708
the other night was knocking
over the stash house.

540
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,409
But this has to be
connected, right?

541
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:02,577
We were wondering

542
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,146
if Dineen was some sort of spy,

543
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,514
but maybe it's simpler
than that.

544
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:06,960
This is the guy
the Russians wanted dead.

545
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:08,550
They hired Dineen
to do it,

546
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,386
and the tip about the stash
house was the payoff.

547
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,433
When they killed Dineen, they
were just tying up a loose end.

548
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:15,323
According to a
business card

549
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:18,360
I found, Mr. Troy here
was an art restorer.

550
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:20,273
Not sure what the Russians
would have against that,

551
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:23,098
but his office is my next stop
if you two want to join.

552
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,866
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

553
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,502
but no, I've never heard
of a Ridley Dineen,

554
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:30,906
and I have no idea why he would
have wanted to hurt Cecil.

555
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,608
Cecil mention any problems
with anyone lately?

556
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:37,445
No. He was kind and sweet.

557
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,181
If someone had a
problem with him,

558
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:40,749
he would have
tried to fix it.

559
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,450
That's just how he was.

560
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,519
Cecil was an art restorer,
right?

561
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,188
Technically, yes.

562
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,189
Technically?

563
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:48,557
He was a chemist.

564
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,692
I am, too,
but when we were in grad school,

565
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,028
we came up with a solvent
that could be used

566
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,530
to clean ancient textiles
without damaging them.

567
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,300
Museums and private
collectors send us their

568
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:01,403
parchments, their tapestries,
and their rugs, and we use

569
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:03,116
that chamber to expose them
to our solvent.

570
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,073
It's sort of like

571
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,142
a detergent for a really
expensive washing machine.

572
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:09,044
You guys ever do

573
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:11,079
any work
for international clients?

574
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:13,915
All the time. Sure. Why?

575
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,617
We can't get into
the details just yet,

576
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,986
but there's a possibility
Cecil was killed

577
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,754
on the orders of a
foreign government.

578
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:21,556
- What?
- Maybe someone

579
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,125
overseas wasn't very happy
with the work you two did.

580
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:25,727
Cecil paid the price.

581
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,230
No. That's crazy.

582
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:29,464
I mean,

583
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,734
has there been
an occasional unhappy customer?

584
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,470
Yes, but no one
who would want to kill us.

585
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,440
Excuse me. Uh, does this phone
look familiar?

586
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,105
No. Why?

587
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:42,777
I found it in one of Cecil's drawers.

588
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,413
I think it's a burner phone.
There's no call history,

589
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,850
but there are some interesting
text messages in the outbox.

590
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,920
"All's clear. Go now.
1620 Jesup Avenue.

591
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,655
53-86-29-04."

592
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:56,458
Sent on the same day he died.

593
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,928
You got any idea
what's at 1620 Jesup?

594
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,863
No.

595
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:05,333
Do you think it has something
to do with what happened to him?

596
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,673
Police.

597
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:14,109
Anyone in here?

598
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:25,387
It's all clear.

599
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,694
Look at this.

600
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,164
Oh.

601
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,565
Those numbers

602
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,401
on Cecil Troy's last text.

603
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,836
They had to have been
the combination, right?

604
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,472
This footprint
is Ridley Dineen's.

605
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,242
I recognize the tread
from his boots.

606
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,678
So this must be the
stash house he ripped off.

607
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,314
And Cecil Troy was the one
who sent him here.

608
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:00,942
Have you forgotten my new
color-coding system already?

609
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,765
Red lines indicate ownership.

610
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:04,467
Blue is a familial relationship.

611
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:05,574
Green denotes
a financial connection.

612
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,175
Pink is for kissing cousins.

613
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:10,378
Purple means
two suspects sang karaoke duets.

614
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,013
You mock me?

615
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:14,349
So, Cecil Troy didn't just send
Ridley Dineen

616
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,717
to rob that stash house.

617
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,152
He owned the place.

618
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,053
His uncle died a month
ago and left it to him.

619
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:20,455
Marcus checked.

620
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:21,856
The estate is still in probate,

621
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:25,326
but Cecil already had the keys.
Red.

622
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,607
You would think there were
easier ways to fetch drug money

623
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,631
if you have the keys
to the stash house

624
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:32,066
and the combination to the safe
that the money is kept in.

625
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:35,069
Well, obviously, Cecil was part
of the plot to kill Dineen,

626
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,873
but I just can't figure out why
and how he even knew the guy.

627
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,309
What would you believe? They
played together as children?

628
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,344
I ran background checks
on the both of them.

629
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,480
Turns out they grew up
on the same block.

630
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,215
That can't be a coincidence.

631
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:50,718
And then, 25 years later,
Cecil sets Ridley up to die.

632
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:53,354
Tells him about a stash house
full of cash.

633
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:55,034
Dineen is only too happy
to take the money,

634
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:56,202
and then,
either because he had tipped

635
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,892
to his
old friend's bad intentions...

636
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,495
Or he just didn't feel
like splitting the proceeds.

637
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:03,097
He drives to Cecil's house
and shoots him dead,

638
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,766
not more than an hour

639
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:08,002
before he himself inhales
a lungful of Kolokol-1.

640
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:11,072
What are the odds we're looking
at a closed loop?

641
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:12,774
Each guy had something
against the other.

642
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:14,509
They kill each other.
End of story.

643
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:16,010
It's possible,

644
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,380
but we still don't know
where Cecil got that money.

645
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:22,383
His bank records show
no unusual activity.

646
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,118
And he killed Dineen
with a substance

647
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:26,387
I hadn't previously imagined
existing on this continent.

648
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:29,190
Well, Cecil was a chemist.

649
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,959
Maybe he's the one
who made the Kolokol-1.

650
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,927
Mm. I still like the Russians.

651
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,974
If I'm wrong about them,
I should know soon enough.

652
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:37,098
I'm supposed to meet Olga
Berezhnaya in 20 minutes.

653
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:48,142
You know, that's one thing
I appreciate about

654
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,445
people in your profession--
punctuality.

655
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:52,881
I never met a spy
who didn't arrive on time.

656
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:54,916
Old habits die hard.

657
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:56,551
This is a strange spot

658
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,553
for a clandestine meeting,
though, isn't it?

659
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,154
We're two blocks
from a police station,

660
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:02,290
and in plain view
of a thousand windows.

661
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,292
Rest assured,
I didn't choose this spot

662
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,160
for their charcuterie plate.

663
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:08,129
It is really good, though.
You should try some.

664
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:10,331
I think I'd prefer that dossier.

665
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,500
A summary first.

666
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,104
Cecil Troy has no connection
with Russian intelligence.

667
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:18,017
No disrespect, but isn't that
what you would say

668
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,074
even if he was the new head
of the SVR?

669
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,342
Why should I believe you?

670
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,311
I don't care if you do.

671
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,220
But I think you'll leave here
and ask yourself,

672
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:28,449
why would I lie about that,
then give information

673
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:31,920
that is far more damning
to my government?

674
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:33,955
You see that window
on the third floor?

675
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,292
That's the home of Pasha Voynov.

676
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,695
Should I know that name?

677
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,497
Mr. Voynov was formerly

678
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:44,999
a chemical weapons scientist
in Russia.

679
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,035
He emigrated to New York

680
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,604
not long after
the Dubrovka Theater tragedy.

681
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:52,674
Is he one of the scientists
who helped develop Kolokol-1?

682
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,510
He was,
and so, even after he left,

683
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,545
Russian intelligence
kept eyes on him.

684
00:28:57,614 --> 00:29:00,882
As it turns out, they fear
he may have recently

685
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:03,284
cooked up a batch
of the stuff in New York.

686
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:06,120
They fear. They don't know?

687
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:09,390
He purchased
the requisite supplies.

688
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:12,393
But my handlers want me
to make it clear.

689
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:14,028
We have no
further information

690
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,797
as to why
he synthesized the drug

691
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,465
or who else
may have been involved.

692
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:21,502
So why are your handlers being
so forthcoming?

693
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,906
The knowledge this man possesses
makes him very dangerous.

694
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,141
He's as much a threat
to the motherland

695
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,143
as he is to this country.

696
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,547
You just signaled someone.

697
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,816
I'm sorry,

698
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:36,629
but we can't have Voynov sharing
what he knows

699
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,553
with the American government.

700
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:45,560
You guys should back up.

701
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:51,833
For what it's worth,
it wasn't my call.

702
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:56,337
Call 911.

703
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,672
Yeah.

704
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:04,379
What's all this?

705
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:07,281
Everything I've got
on the Navarro case.

706
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,617
Marcus offered to take it
off my hands when I leave,

707
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:11,386
so I thought
I'd walk him through it.

708
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,023
Course, if you'd rather
have someone else on it,

709
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:16,391
that's totally your call.

710
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,960
No, it's not that.
It's, uh...

711
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:23,297
Can we talk?

712
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,067
Of course.

713
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:33,041
Your decision to leave--

714
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:37,612
does it have anything to
do with Captain Dwyer?

715
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,983
'Cause if he did or said
something, please tell me

716
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:44,419
so we can bring
it to the EEO.

717
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:47,722
Whatever it was, I don't want
it happening to anyone else.

718
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,060
What?

719
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:54,929
This... thing

720
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:56,931
you think happened to me--

721
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,834
we go to EEO,
do you honestly think

722
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,336
it's not gonna happen
to anyone else?

723
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:03,905
Dwyer'll be gone.

724
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:05,807
I'm not talking
about him.

725
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,276
I am talking
about all the others.

726
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,445
Dwyer goes down,
do you really think

727
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,113
that's gonna change anything,

728
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:14,115
that this department's
gonna suddenly stop being

729
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:15,316
a boys' club?

730
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,954
To be clear,
you're not part of the problem.

731
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:23,191
I meant everything
that I said the other day.

732
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,493
The best boss I ever had.

733
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:27,028
But I've been a cop

734
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:28,863
for 17 years now.

735
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:30,865
And in my experience,

736
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,633
you are the exception,

737
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,469
not the rule.

738
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,471
The culture you're
talking about, Bree,

739
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,173
there's only one
way to change it.

740
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:41,609
Most of my friends right now,

741
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:43,478
you know what they are?

742
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:45,012
Cops.

743
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:46,481
When I leave here,

744
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,150
you know what most of my friends
will still be?

745
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:50,885
Cops.

746
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:53,354
You know what it's like
when someone goes after

747
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,356
the department.

748
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,526
The wagons get circled,
lines get drawn.

749
00:31:58,595 --> 00:32:00,361
And all that's gonna matter
to most cops

750
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,630
is that I cost
another cop his job.

751
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,365
And that's when
the crank calls'll start,

752
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,167
the anonymous threats.

753
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:08,569
Hell, I make the news, and then
people who aren't police

754
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,238
can start weighing in.

755
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:11,884
"Maybe she's just looking
for attention."

756
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:14,475
"Maybe she
was asking for it."

757
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,114
What happened between Dwyer
and me, I...

758
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,383
I didn't have a choice.

759
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:26,554
Now I do.

760
00:32:26,623 --> 00:32:29,490
I get it.

761
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,195
I just wish
I had been here for you.

762
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,036
<i>I'm almost surprised</i>

763
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,416
that this guy's SVR file does
not include his day of death.

764
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,818
I mean, obviously,
they knew it was coming.

765
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,775
Obvious to you and me.

766
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:50,044
Not so much
to the fire department.

767
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:53,214
They seem to be swallowing
the idea that a faulty gas line

768
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:55,216
was to blame for
the fatal explosion.

769
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:56,784
You could correct them.

770
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,286
I told the CIA instead.

771
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:00,454
Spies are their domain.

772
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:02,290
I'm just glad that
no one else was hurt.

773
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:05,626
If Voynov was synthesizing
Kolokol-1 for Cecil Troy,

774
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:09,297
then... his death is
hardly a tragedy, is it?

775
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,443
Well, still, it would've been
nice to talk to the guy.

776
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,901
We could have asked him
why he would cook up

777
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,271
some chemical weapons
to help murder a thief.

778
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
We could have asked him,

779
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:20,008
but I don't think
he would have answered.

780
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,943
Not if my theory about

781
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:24,745
why he became
involved is correct.

782
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,218
This is about a string
of robberies in Brighton Beach.

783
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:32,286
Aka Bratva Beach.

784
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:34,322
The businesses
that were robbed

785
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,525
included two car washes,
a dry cleaner's, and a café.

786
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,061
I think it's possible they were
all fronts for the Russian mob.

787
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,296
Well, mobsters do love
their cash businesses.

788
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:45,900
But what does this have
to do with Voynov?

789
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,013
He left Russia without the
blessing of the government,

790
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:49,570
which could be difficult
if you're one

791
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,806
of their top chemical
weapons scientists.

792
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:53,574
I submit he had help.

793
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:55,109
The Bratva?

794
00:33:55,178 --> 00:33:56,889
They have the resources
to get him out of the country

795
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:58,479
and keep him alive
all this time.

796
00:33:58,548 --> 00:33:59,814
Until today.

797
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:03,150
So you think Dineen was the one
who ripped off these places,

798
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,752
the Bratva figured it out,

799
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:08,022
and then hired Voynov
to make some Kolokol-1 for them?

800
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,824
I'm not the only one who thinks

801
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:12,126
that they were the real
victims of this spree.

802
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:13,961
Everything you're looking
at has been folded

803
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,963
into an ongoing
DEA investigation

804
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:18,099
into Russian drug trafficking.

805
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,001
Okay, but the Bratva
is the Bratva.

806
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,949
They're not shy
when it comes to killing people.

807
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,604
So why go to all this trouble

808
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:25,673
to make Dineen's death
look like an overdose?

809
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:27,275
Perhaps slitting
people's throats

810
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:28,876
becomes tiresome after a while.

811
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,212
Well,
it's an interesting theory.

812
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:34,715
But how does it account
for Cecil Troy?

813
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,717
My interesting theory is
in its larval stage.

814
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,219
It needs information to grow.

815
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,720
So you and I

816
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,490
are going to visit a
contact of mine at the DEA.

817
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,225
With any luck, he can help us...

818
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:46,794
weave Cecil Troy
into this bloody tapestry.

819
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,802
Anything?

820
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:57,538
Uh, Agent Abanto's assistant
came out again

821
00:34:57,607 --> 00:34:59,907
to say he'd be
five more minutes.

822
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:01,842
She seems to believe
him every time.

823
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:04,679
She's either a phenomenal liar
or a bit stupid.

824
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,027
Haven't got your lock picks
on you, have you?

825
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:09,550
Don't even think it.

826
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,385
There's a file room over there.

827
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:13,421
Could just pop in,

828
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,823
look for the files
I need, pop out.

829
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:18,426
If Ridley Dineen is responsible
for the robberies

830
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:21,362
in Brighton Beach,
I'd be doing the Agency a favor.

831
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,495
Is that a fascinating memo?

832
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,835
Actually, it is.

833
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:30,071
It's about the DEA's new safety
protocols for the handling

834
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:33,240
of all contraband seized
in drug raids, including cash.

835
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,076
It's also the reason
we can stop

836
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:37,278
waiting around for Agent Abanto.

837
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:39,046
If I'm right, it not only

838
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:41,048
explains who's responsible
for what happened

839
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:43,617
to Ridley Dineen-- it also
explains why they did it.

840
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,795
How was the funeral?

841
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,298
Cecil's funeral was
this morning, wasn't it?

842
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,200
How did you get in here?

843
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:59,669
Owner of the
building let us in.

844
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,337
This helped.

845
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,473
A warrant?

846
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,375
We needed one
to search this place.

847
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,643
Well, I-I don't understand.

848
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,011
What were you looking for?

849
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,880
Evidence.

850
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,148
We know that
you and Cecil

851
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:14,450
were behind
Ridley Dineen's death.

852
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,352
That's crazy.

853
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,120
It's worse than that.
It's cruel.

854
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,556
I just came from burying
my best friend.

855
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,991
Trust us, if we could have,

856
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,626
we would have come
for you sooner.

857
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:26,295
Just took us a while to catch up
to what you two did.

858
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:27,708
In case you
haven't already seen it,

859
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,665
this is a memo the DEA put out.

860
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,667
It says that,
from this point forward,

861
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:33,603
any and all
currency recovered

862
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,571
from narcotics busts
will have to be cleaned

863
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,740
by a company called
Troy-Kensit Labs.

864
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,375
Your company.

865
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,222
Last couple years,
there's been a lot of concern

866
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,579
in law enforcement
that drug-laced cash

867
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,215
could hurt or even kill
the people who touch it.

868
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,850
Money
with fentanyl on it

869
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,752
was supposed to be
especially dangerous.

870
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:51,354
The DEA got so worried,

871
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,723
they put out a solicitation
on a government website.

872
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,058
They were looking for a vendor,
someone who could

873
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,561
actually launder
seized money

874
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,162
without damaging it.

875
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:02,064
Now, you and
Cecil won the bid.

876
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,544
We're guessing,
when you already know how

877
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:05,901
to safely clean textiles
that are hundreds

878
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,103
of years old,

879
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,105
money isn't much of a challenge.

880
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,317
Unfortunately, a number

881
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,152
of toxicologists caught wind
of the solicitation

882
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:14,043
and dismissed it as nonsense,

883
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,012
a waste of
taxpayers' money.

884
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,014
They insisted
that drugs like fentanyl

885
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:20,082
could not be absorbed
through the skin.

886
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,517
You had the bid,

887
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,619
but the DEA decided
to slow everything down,

888
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:25,388
do a little more research.

889
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,390
That didn't work
for you and Cecil,

890
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,393
so you came up with a way
to force their hand.

891
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,094
He reached out
to Ridley Dineen

892
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,323
and told him about a stash house
that he'd heard about.

893
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,799
Dineen couldn't rob the place
fast enough.

894
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:39,902
<i>While he was out, you and Cecil</i>
<i>went to his apartment</i>

895
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,304
<i>and tampered with his inhaler.</i>

896
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,850
<i>You knew that using it</i>
<i>would kill him</i>

897
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:43,939
in less than a minute.

898
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,608
Police would process the scene
and assume

899
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,444
that the fentanyl
in his system was from the cash.

900
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,579
There would be more
panic about toxic money,

901
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,915
and the DEA would finally close
their contract with you.

902
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,317
What you didn't count on

903
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,819
was Dineen killing Cecil
after he was done.

904
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,122
I'm sorry,

905
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,831
it sounds like you're talking
about things

906
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,459
that Cecil may have done.

907
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,227
If he did do them,

908
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,163
I wouldn't know anything
about it.

909
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,497
Yeah, very smart.

910
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,599
Blame the dead man
because he can't defend himself.

911
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:13,602
However, we're confident
we're gonna be able to link you

912
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,171
to your two other accomplices,

913
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,605
Pasha Voynov

914
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,274
and Lady Godiva.

915
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:19,975
She's your cat, right?

916
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,978
We got a court order
for a sample of her hair.

917
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,692
We're gonna compare it
to the hair we found

918
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:26,148
all over Dineen's apartment.

919
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,828
We're also gonna
take a close look

920
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,018
at your bank records.

921
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,619
Someone paid Voynov

922
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,822
to synthesize the drug
that killed Dineen.

923
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,157
Probably the same person
who came up with all the cash

924
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:37,360
that Dineen took out
of that safe.

925
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,028
We already know
it wasn't Cecil.

926
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,463
So tell us,

927
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:42,465
when we talk to your bank,
are we gonna find out

928
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,434
that you recently withdrew
a couple hundred grand in cash?

929
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,205
Yeah.

930
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:51,807

He found some pictures
of me online.

935
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:11,527
They were photos from a trip
I'd taken with my ex.

936
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,129
I was in a bathing suit.

937
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:15,531

to a few people,

938
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,967
made a few comments.

939
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,402

00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:30,212
You're asking a question that
Dwyer should've asked himself.

943
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,582

I know what I said.

And, for the record,
I don't think I was wrong

Saying it out loud,

951
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,198
I realized I can take it.

952
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,667
Before you ask,

953
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,003
I am still putting
in my papers.

954
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:57,406
I really am excited
about this other job.

955
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,176
I'm happy for you.

956
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:02,378
Thank you.

957
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,114
Those friends
you were talking about,

958
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,116
the ones who are cops,

959
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:10,085
I hope you know I'm one of them.

960
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,223
I will be to the end.

Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,982
Nicolette Marie Nevin,

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,505
will you do me the honor...

4
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,415
ANDREA:
He's one of a kind, isn't he?

5
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,399
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,843
Our relationship...

7
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:13,178
It is perfect just like this.

8
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,515
My father owns his own cab.

9
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,819
He put me through medical school

10
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:16,994
working very long hours,

11
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,350
and I'm very proud of him.

12
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:20,280
So, y-you think this place
in Savannah...

13
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:22,073
You really think
they can help me?

14
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,950
It's one of the best inpatient
centers in the country.

15
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:25,952
I really want to be there
for all those moments

16
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:26,911
that you talked about.

17
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:28,176
Me too.

18
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,506
KIM:
Cain and Bell had their chance

19
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,790
to be the star of this company,

20
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:31,675
but they couldn't deliver.

21
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,090
Our future is brighter

22
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,451
with Conrad Hawkins
front and center.

23
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,085
I don't know.

24
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,974
I'm still jonesing
for that powder blue tux

25
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,791
with the ruffled shirt.

26
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,201
No, no, no, no, no,
you are not allowed to look

27
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,629
like a lounge singer
on your wedding day.

28
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,207
Seriously... thoughts?

29
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,451
You fishing for compliments?

30
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:03,620
- (chuckles)
- Come on.

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,189
Okay.

32
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:12,738
Baller.

33
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,609
Slightly different guy
than that jerk you met

34
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,724
your first day of residency.

35
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,969
You were just doing your job
the wrong way.

36
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,487
I must've done something right.

37
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,998
You turned
into a damn fine doctor.

38
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:31,173
Yeah, well, it...
hasn't always felt that way.

39
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,259
When all hell breaks loose,

40
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,212
you find out what people
are made of.

41
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,638
You excelled.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,821
That's very kind of you,
but let's stick to you.

43
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:43,994
How you feeling?

44
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,917
Any last-minute jitters?

45
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,108
None.

46
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,185
I'm as happy as I've ever been.

47
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,072
I'm about to marry my soul mate.

48
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,526
Okay, last stitch.

49
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:03,938
Something borrowed
and something blue.

50
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,031
It's a twofer.

51
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,850
Those earrings are beautiful.

52
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,018
Whose are they?

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,687
They were Jessie's.

54
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,090
My dad bought them
for her 16th birthday.

55
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,027
I wish she were here.

56
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,953
(sighs) Me, too.

57
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,140
But she's always with me.

58
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,976
- So is my mom.
- Hmm.

59
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:28,366
And now you get to wear
her circa-1980

60
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,374
- wedding dress.
- (chuckles)

61
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,468
When my dad begged me
to wear it, my heart sank.

62
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,229
(laughs) Luckily you have Mina.

63
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,491
Something old is now new.

64
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,826
I mean, you're a miracle worker.

65
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:41,976
- Thank you.
- Of course.

66
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,054
(Nic sighs)

67
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,890
Is it bad to be this happy after
everything that's happened?

68
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,317
(sighs) No,

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,730
but I wish
things had been different,

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,342
that we could all be here
together today.

71
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,178
Yeah.

72
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:04,995
(inhales)
2020, man, what a year.

73
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,835
I mean, we had no idea
what was about to hit us.

74
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,190
(sighs)

75
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:17,340
Okay, since the service
is outside,

76
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,204
I was thinking,
instead of throwing rice,

77
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,532
people could throw birdseeds?

78
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:23,443
Environmentally conscious...
I like it.

79
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,182
(laughs)

80
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,874
Okay, how do you feel
about a buffet

81
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,615
instead of a seated dinner?

82
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,617
I feel nothing.

83
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,935
Defer.

84
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,770
Band or DJ?

85
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,938
Up to you.

86
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:36,548
Oh, my God, we're bad at this.

87
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:37,791
Okay, I'm going DJ.

88
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,384
All right.

89
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,347
And I think I want
burgundy flowers.

90
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,389
Dahlias, peonies.

91
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:48,112
Really? I was hoping
for blue wildflowers.

92
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,931
You don't care
what music we play

93
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,658
and yet you have an opinion
on the color of my bouquet?

94
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,716
Remember that first date we had,
hiking at Sweetwater?

95
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,644
The flowers I picked
for you that day?

96
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,072
Blue wildflowers it is.

97
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:01,631
And whatever DJ you decide on,

98
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,134
they have to play
"Mr. Brightside."

99
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,723
You asked. (laughs)

100
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,433
I thought you had
better taste than that.

101
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,452
Oh, you're about to be
Mrs. Conrad Hawkins.

102
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,120
We both should have
better taste.

103
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:15,069

about to be Mr. Nic Nevin.

327
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,389
and-and schedule them as urgent.

328
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,904
CAIN: Okay, on one condition.

329
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't ever threaten my
job again or replace my face

330
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,583
on the side of this building
with a shiny new object.

331
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,418
KIM: Deal.

332
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,681
(line ringing)

333
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,418
(phone ringing)

334
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,916
(sighs)

335
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,773
Dr. Cain?

336
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,666
Is there something wrong?

337
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,184
I'm afraid so.

338
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,576
Listen, I know that I told you

339
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,517
your back surgery could wait,
Ben,

340
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:52,116
but I took another look at
your last scan this morning.

341
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,285
Is there a problem?

342
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:55,845
Yes. I see some progression

343
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,457
in your disc herniation
at your L5-S1 vertebrae

344
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,960
with some potential
involvement of your spinal cord.

345
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:05,371
- My spinal cord?
- Yes, yes, and it's getting worse.

346
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,018
I need to get you into
the OR immediately.

347
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,468
But it's not safe
at the hospital.

348
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,640
- The coronavirus is...
- Oh, no, our surgical facilities are pristine.

349
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,622
Yeah,
never been cleaner or safer.

350
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,453
And you won't be anywhere
near a COVID patient.

351
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,051
We'll take every precaution.

352
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,624
(exhales)

353
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,369
I don't know. Um,
I have to think about this.

354
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,653
See, here's the thing, Ben,

355
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:31,823
if you put this off,
you take one bad step,

356
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,992
you slip and fall
in the bathroom...

357
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,847
...you'll end up paralyzed.

358
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,497
Oh, my God, Dr. Cain.

359
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,457
(exhales)

360
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,004
Okay.

361
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,630
I'll do whatever you say.

362
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,640
(phone ringing)

363
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:00,243
Devon?

364
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,353
How are you?

365
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,523
Are you driving your cab again?

366
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:06,818
That's one of the riskiest
things you could do.

367
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,584
You promised me you'd stay home.

368
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:11,081
- And who is going to pay my rent, Devon?
- I will.

369
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,084
Listen, Dad,
our ER is packed. Our ICU, too.

370
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:16,200
Think about Mom.
You could get infected,

371
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:17,704
you could take it home to her,
she could die.

372
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:19,278
You both could.

373
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,448
I need you to turn that cab
around and go home now.

374
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,729
Dad, you need to leave the
facility and quarantine now.

375
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,119
It's really not a good time,
Nicky. I'm only...

376
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,899
- I'm halfway through treatment. If I leave...
- I know,

377
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,123
but I wouldn't be
asking if it wasn't serious.

378
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:33,070
Please. I'll get
you a hotel room.

379
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,385
Just tell me you'll do this.

380
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:40,058
Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Uh...

381
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,376
Anything for you, Nicky.

382
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,228
Okay.

383
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,732
Dad, where are you?

384
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,068
I finally got a guy who's
willing to manufacture

385
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,311
the new mask prototypes,

386
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:55,981
but now he is telling me that
there are no more materials.

387
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:59,555
You have Crohn's disease and
a compromised immune system.

388
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,599
We agreed that you were
gonna work from home.

389
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,915
Hear my voice. This is
me not happy with you.

390
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,919
You need to solve
this issue from home.

391
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,471
As soon as I'm finished here.

392
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,504
- (phone beeps) - Hello?

393
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:17,512
This is Marshall
Winthrop. Unfort...

394
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,851
(siren wailing)

395
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:28,922
CHAD: Hey, you,
nurse. I've been waiting for two hours.

396
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,183
I got gold-plated insurance.

397
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,663
- The taxes I pay, I should be first in line.
- MINA: Hey, hey, hey.

398
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,612
There's no special
treatment in this ER.

399
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,634
Put your mask up,
six feet apart or you're out of here.

400
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,950
I am six feet apart.

401
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:41,138
What are you trying to do,
set a world record for people

402
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,162
in an ER in the
middle of a pandemic?

403
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,532
MINA: I understand
the male temptation

404
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,084
to exaggerate length...

405
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,354
...but you need to back up.

406
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:53,022
(gasps)

407
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,966
What... Don't touch me!

408
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,218
He's not six feet apart!

409
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,367
IRVING: We've got five
minutes before our next crisis.

410
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,363
- JESSICA: It is crazy out there.
- IRVING: And unsafe.

411
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,998
I really wish you
were back in the OR

412
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,388
working as a scrub nurse.

413
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,315
JESSICA: I'm right
where I want to be.

414
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,283
I'm laying my head on
your shoulder right now.

415
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:27,217
IRVING: I'm holding you and
rocking you back and forth.

416
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,208
JESSICA: Aw. Thank you.

417
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,853
"Lower extremity
weakness and acute onset

418
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:54,007
of bowel incontinence requiring
urgent operative management."

419
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:58,154
Come on, he's a 58-year-old
with a simple bulging disc.

420
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,703
We are in the midst of
the single most devastating

421
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,372
public health crisis
of our lifetimes.

422
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,041
Barrett,
you can't be doing surgeries

423
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,542
that don't need to be done.

424
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,045
You put a patient at
risk of getting COVID.

425
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:17,030
20% of surgeries
are unnecessary.

426
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,624
I made a judgment call.

427
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:23,012
And he won't get COVID
because my OR is spotless.

428
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:30,377
You know,
you had a chance to do the right thing.

429
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,547
Pitch in with the rest of us and help,
but no.

430
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,976
You just followed Red
Rock's marching orders.

431
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,622
I'm a neurosurgeon. I cut.

432
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,888
When that pandemic can
be cured by brain surgery,

433
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,283
shoot me a page.

434
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,065
HUNDLEY: It's okay, Raylee.

435
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:57,233
If you get a fever or cough,
don't panic.

436
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:01,817
Most people don't get this sick.

437
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,986
You're gonna be okay.

438
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,764
My doctors are here.

439
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:08,491
I'll call you back soon.

440
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,417
- I love you.
- RAYLEE: I love you, Mom.

441
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,248
- (phone beeps) - BELL: Hey,
there.

442
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,254
(Hundley panting)

443
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,775
Proning isn't working, is it?

444
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:20,427
BELL: Well,
your O2 sats are still dipping too low,

445
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,521
so we're gonna try a
high-flow nasal cannula now.

446
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:24,273
CONRAD: It is a
little outside the box,

447
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:28,101
but otherwise we
have to intubate.

448
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,790
If you put me to sleep
and put that tube in,

449
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:36,335
there's a good chance
I won't wake up again.

450
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:42,049
Which is why high-flow
is worth the risk.

451
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,127
Okay.

452
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,722
On three. One, two, three.

453
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,692
(groaning, panting)

454
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:11,640
- KIT: Uh-oh, we disconnected something.
- (alarm beeping)

455
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,544
- BELL: Where do these go?
- Haven't a clue.

456
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,816
White electrode...

457
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,222
under right clavicle.

458
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,488
Black under left. (groans)

459
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,751
Red above and left of umbilicus.

460
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,586
What about the beeping?

461
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,013
Just press "silence."

462
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,184
(beeping stops)

463
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:37,262
Surgeons, huh?

464
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,081
Nurses aren't paid enough.

465
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,567
Tell me about it. (coughing)

466
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:45,921
(panting)

467
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,324
You're gonna be okay.

468
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,205
(coughs)

469
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,328
Snapped when I was in the room.

470
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:25,152
I thought I felt something.

471
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,241
CONRAD: Europe,
South Korea, China,

472
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,245
they all have state-of-the-art
protection; look at this.

473
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,561
Dr. Voss is a surgeon.
Could have gone home

474
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,299
'cause she doesn't have any patients,
but she's working

475
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:37,876
in the ICU,
and this is all that protected her

476
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,476
from exposure to COVID-19.
She's been exposed.

477
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,978
You are sending our
soldiers to face the enemy

478
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,234
without any armor.

479
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,777
We have a top ER
nurse in the ICU

480
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,500
fighting for her life.

481
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,321
Two transpo workers are dead. Med students,
residents,

482
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,151
they're isolating
from their families,

483
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:55,636
they're sick and alone,
and some of them may die.

484
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,228
Everybody is chasing
the same shipments.

485
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:58,805
I keep getting outbid
by other hospitals.

486
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:00,829
You need to protect
our staff. That's your job.

487
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,923
I feel your frustration. I-I do.

488
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,104
My frustration? Why-why
don't you come down to my ER

489
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,153
and share my frustration
instead of sitting

490
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,429
in your ivory tower
doing nothing?!

491
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,008
All of you think I
don't care. I care.

492
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,602
I can't escape this either.

493
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,863
This morning, a woman,
a total stranger,

494
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:19,515
called me a bat eater.

495
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,293
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

496
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,687
The "China Virus,"
the "Kung Flu."

497
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,797
I was born in Savannah.

498
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,449
This is being used to turn
us all against each other.

499
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,952
And yes,
I am trying to save this hospital.

500
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,398
I'll-I'll bend the
rules to do it,

501
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,955
but do not think for one moment

502
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,582
that this hasn't hit me hard.

503
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,477
I am human.

504
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,021
Prove it.

505
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,318
Prove it.

506
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:55,234
(distant siren wailing)

507
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,454
Yo. How you holding up?

508
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,150
I don't know. It's
pretty rough in there.

509
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,912
I'm proud of you
for working the ER;

510
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:09,414
however, I need you in the OR.

511
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,383
We have our first COVID trach.

512
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:16,238
Sounds delightful.

513
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:17,923
(both laugh)

514
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,001
Well, seriously,
you could use the break.

515
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,761
I'm worried about you.

516
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,524
I'm worried about you, too.

517
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,363
Okay.

518
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,585
You know where to
find me if you need me.

519
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,117
I certainly do.

520
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,786
CONRAD: The high-flow bought us time,
but...

521
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:51,590
your sat is 82% on 100% oxygen,

522
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,109
and it is dropping.

523
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,554
We need to intubate.

524
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,306
(stifled sobbing)

525
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,122
- Can you get Chu?
- He's on his way.

526
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:09,382
(Hundley crying)

527
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,548
Can you please tell
Raylee I love her again?

528
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,407
You will tell her yourself
because you will wake up.

529
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,201
Now let us fight for you.

530
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:30,963
- I'm here, Hundley. I'm here.
- (coughing)

531
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,840
You're gonna be okay.

532
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,136
- (sniffling) - We're here.

533
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:42,224
(sobbing softly)

534
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,918
We're gonna put you to sleep now,
my friend.

535
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:54,695
Just relax. Just relax.

536
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:27,019
- You haven't eaten all day.
- I can't eat.

537
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,557
Hundley's a single mom.

538
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,296
I don't want to have
to tell Raylee that

539
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
she's never gonna
see her mom again.

540
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,470
She's around the same age
you were when you lost your mom,

541
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,285
isn't she?

542
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,586
If you get COVID, I get COVID.

543
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,849
The good news is I
can smell that coffee.

544
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,737
And I could taste that bread.

545
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:10,003
If it's my last meal,
I'm going out with carbs.

546
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,231
Don't even say that.

547
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,919
How's Kit?

548
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:18,862
Her mask broke.

549
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,448
She's been exposed.

550
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:25,518
- (sighs) - I told
her to go home.

551
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,122
She's scared.

552
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,197
(Mina chuckles)

553
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:40,776
You'd rather wear a PAPR
than shave your beard.

554
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:44,366
(chuckles) You know how long
it takes to grow this beard out?

555
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,184
You know we have a
limited number of these?

556
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,610
They're for people who can't
wear N95s because of the way

557
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,674
their faces are shaped,
or because they have

558
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,531
a religious objection
to shaving their beards.

559
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:54,139
Yeah, well, let's just say I
do have a religious objection.

560
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,453
I worship this beard, all right?

561
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:58,885
Well, you certainly are
conceited as you are vain.

562
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,220
Isn't it itchy?

563
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,573
Not at all.

564
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,985
- All right, let me help you.
- Aw, thanks.

565
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,765
Without the beard,
I look too young.

566
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,730
It adds wisdom and gravitas,

567
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,072
- and it's reassuring to my patients.
- Mm.

568
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,091
(laughs) Well,
you don't look reassuring to me.

569
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,405
- You look like you're about to go into space.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

572
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,437
It's working.

573
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,650
Yeah, it is.

574
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,854
Where did you get it?

575
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,522
South Korea.

576
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,633
My family still
has relatives there.

577
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,784
I put in an emergency order,

578
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,787
and it turns out this
shipment was on its way.

579
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,957
- It wasn't cheap getting it diverted to Chastain.
- Wait, wait, wait.

580
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,061
- You said Red Rock wouldn't pay.
- They won't.

581
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,356
But they did.

582
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,377
(sighs)

583
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:24,304
What happens when they find out?

584
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,043
Could cost me my job.

585
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:30,569
But for now,
at least our staff will be protected.

586
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:33,747

IRVING: Welcome
to the long-awaited

674
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,865
Nic and Conrad wedding.

675
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,367
We are all gathered here
today to celebrate the union

676
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,439
of these two people we love.

677
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,204
So, without further ado,

678
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,707
I'll let Nic and Conrad
speak for themselves.

679
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,192
I love you.

680
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:38,972
(whispers): I love you, too.

681
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,289
Conrad and I wanted
to take a moment

682
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,476
to remember some friends
that are missing here today.

683
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,979
People we worked with
for a very long time...

684
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,650
...who sadly lost their
battle with COVID.

685
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:57,320
George in transpo.

686
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,282
Dr. Peterson.

687
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,139
Peter who cleaned the ICU rooms.

688
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,238
Lois from accounting.

689
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,241
They ate lunch
together every day.

690
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,544
I think she had a crush on him.

691
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,081
We lost them both.

692
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:19,178
CONRAD: We also want to
send love to our dear friend Devon,

693
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:21,736
who was to be my best man.

694
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,347
Devon...

695
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,935
...lost his father
to COVID-19...

696
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:32,355
...and he almost
lost his mother.

697
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,860
He's on his way to his
dad's memorial right now.

698
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,278
Dad?

699
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,001
Thank you for stepping
in as my best man.

700
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:43,408
I love you.

701
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,619
I love you.

702
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,544
IRVING: Let us honor the
lives of those we've lost,

703
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:55,712
by holding their
memories in our hearts

704
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:59,049
as we celebrate one
of life's greatest joys.

705
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,390
Tough times come.
They always will.

706
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,454
But when they do, Conrad,
I want you by my side.

707
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:17,425
No matter what,
in sickness and in health.

708
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:19,964
NIC: I promise to
always have your back,

709
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,053
no matter what.

710
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,889
I promise to love you,

711
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:25,962
- but to never obey you.
- (laughter)

712
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:29,621
I didn't have my hopes
up for that "obey" part.

713
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,991
Mostly...

714
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,419
I promise you'll never lose me.

715
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:37,712
This is forever.

716
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,260
For as long as
we both shall live.

IRVING: Conrad Theodore Hawkins

718
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,688
and Nicolette Marie Nevin,

719
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,301

People just like you. You...

777

You can make it,
you just... you just got to fight.

778

Dad, listen to me.

783

I would be nothing without you.

784
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,090
You helped put me
through medical school,

00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:24,374
driving nights and weekends,
working overtime.

786
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:28,597
I believed in myself
because you believed in me.

787
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:31,047
And I always knew, no matter
what, that you loved me.

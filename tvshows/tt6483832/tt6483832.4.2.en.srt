00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:29,724
I saved you from a disease.

161
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:34,534
Getting fired can be a beautiful thing,
trust me.

162
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,731
Now you and I
have that in common.

163
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,797
Hey.

164
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,406
Hang on tight,
Dr. Hawkins. It's going to get...

165
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,409
- even uglier around here.
- (elevator bell dings)

166
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,392
Trust me.

167
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:06,190
NIC: These were our
colleagues and our friends.

168
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:09,828
Health care workers who died
in the line of duty from COVID.

169
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,435
I hope we never have
to put another face

170
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,127
or name on this memorial.

171
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,973
(exhales) You know,
I was with Nurse Garner

172
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:29,450
when he passed away.

173
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:32,642
Heartbreaking.
Such a lovely man.

174
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,721
I-I had to go out and tell
his enormous entourage...

175
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:41,462
Wife, kids, parents,
siblings, friends... I...

176
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,132
It's a life cut short
but certainly well-lived.

177
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,801
And you know,
I don't know if I was...

178
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:50,305
if I was feeling
envy or... or jealousy,

179
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,309
but I-I mean, I just,
I have to admit I...

180
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,666
I wish I had even a
small part of what he had.

181
00:08:56,743 --> 00:09:00,148
In the very distant future,
when you're on your deathbed,

182
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,672
I and every one
of your friends here

183
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,986
- who you haven't outlived...
- (laughs)

184
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,321
...will be at your bedside.

185
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,656
Well, I appreciate it.

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,297
I've just come to regret some
of the bridges I've burned,

187
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:12,735
the people I've hurt,
that's all.

188
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,018
Figure out who's
worth fighting for

189
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:18,188
to get back in your life
and get after it already.

190
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,105
Sat's 85.

191
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,826
You're not getting enough
oxygen. We need you

192
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,369
- off the phone...
- Senator Buxton, I'd like to put you on the phone

193
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,702
with one of your constituents.
Her name is Bianca.

194
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,206
She is a hardworking young
woman who can't afford childcare.

195
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,835
Yeah,
tell her what you just told me.

196
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,409
Sat's down to 83.

197
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:42,995
- Nichelle!
- (breathing heavily)

198
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,464
I don't feel right.

199
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,051
What's happening?

200
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,761
(Nichelle gasping)

201
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,674
CONRAD (echoing): Devon?

202
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,370
Devon.

203
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,514
- Devon, give me the mask.
- (snaps fingers)

204
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,214
Let's get another X-ray, okay?

205
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,068
(fading): She's a little
wheezy. How about some nebs?

206
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,529
(gasping, wheezing)

207
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,005
Mr. Mullins here came in with a
few weeks of worsening dyspnea.

208
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,328
And look at this.

209
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:28,736
Right axis deviation.
Right heart strain pattern.

210
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,239
And evidence of pulmonary
hypertension on bedside echo.

211
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,982
Also complained
of some dizziness,

212
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,743
so I sent him through the answer box,
which...

213
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,393
Fine. CT scanner.

214
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:42,324
His head CT revealed
some old ischemic strokes.

215
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,108
But the reason
I called you is...

216
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,256
AUSTIN: Proximal filling
defects in the pulmonary artery.

217
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,999
It's consistent with
thromboembolic

218
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,189
pulmonary hypertension.

219
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,783
- Uh, what's that?
- Uh, blood clots

220
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,838
in the artery that leads
from your heart to your lungs.

221
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,122
That's why you're
having trouble breathing.

222
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,749
AUSTIN: Based on these images,

223
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,292
these clots could
be a few months old.

224
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,085
IRVING: They could
have started last April.

225
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,296
That's when he had an
urgent spine surgery here

226
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,962
followed by COVID-19.

227
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,997
Oh. This sounds bad.

228
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,448
What happens now?

229
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:12,947
Well, based on your husband's
hemodynamic instability,

230
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,783
we should plan for surgery
to remove the clots as soon

231
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,309
as possible. Then he'll be able

232
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,225
to breathe comfortably again.

233
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,626
I knew he looked familiar.

234
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,485
I butted heads with Cain
months ago over this guy.

235
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,729
He reclassified his elective
spine surgery as urgent.

236
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,968
Which means if Mullins got
COVID here at Chastain...

237
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,900
He's another Cain casualty.

238
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:37,454
And we both know that that
surgery wasn't truly emergent.

239
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:39,829
Well,
we suspect. We don't know for sure.

240
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:41,142
Okay, in Mina's kangaroo court,

241
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,960
Barrett Cain is
sentenced to death.

242
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,376
All right,
I'm gonna find out for sure.

243
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,298
♪

244
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,425
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,313
You froze up before,
and then you took off

246
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:05,471
like a bat out of hell.

247
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,399
Yeah,
I'm just fried. It's jet lag.

248
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,174
(sighs)

249
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,814
Multiple small nodules

250
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,178
with surrounding
ground glass opacities.

251
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,088
It's consistent with
histoplasmosis.

252
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:21,445
And a lot of other
types of infections

253
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,706
- and inflammatory processes.
- Yeah.

254
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:26,376
Histoplasmosis is one
of the great imitators.

255
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:29,212
All of her test
results and symptoms

256
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,664
could mimic something else.

257
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:34,028
Her diagnosis might
not be straightforward.

258
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,197
- And she might not have histo.
- True.

259
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,773
But until we have
something more definitive,

260
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,305
we stay the course.

261
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,724
Have you heard anything

262
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,510
about who might be
replacing Kim as our CEO?

263
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,397
- Come in. - Well, have you?

264
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,183
Not a word.

265
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,403
What are you doing?

266
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,741
Who's he?

267
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:02,056
My former stepson Jake.

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,988
My first wife's kid.

269
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,748
I was with Donna for six years.

270
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,199
Gosh.

271
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,036
We've been out of touch for a long time,
and

272
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:13,164
I reached out during the pandemic,
and, um,

273
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,736
you know,
didn't... didn't hear anything back, but,

274
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,408
just, I'd like to try and...
to reconnect with him.

275
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,911
I was with him from
when he was six

276
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,217
till just about 12, and...

277
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:27,261
Oh, God, we had fun.

278
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:32,253
And he was angry
and-and... and hurt

279
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:35,853
when I divorced his mother.

280
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,616
Then Donna threatened to
kill me if I reached out to him.

281
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:43,527
Said I'd done enough damage
by abandoning them, and...

282
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:46,372
Oh,
I shouldn't have listened to her.

283
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,939
Tread lightly.

284
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,546
And good luck, Randolph.

285
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,314
CONRAD: Hey. Bianca.

286
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,202
Not sure if you're
aware of this,

287
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:17,320
but HR can help you find
affordable childcare, okay?

288
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:20,990
Um, great. But my name's
not Bianca and I don't have kids.

289
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,067
(alarm sounding)

290
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,402
We need help!

291
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,995
What happened?

292
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,808
She fell. And
she's in a lot of pain

293
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,167
and she's having even
more trouble breathing now.

294
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:32,076
Please, you got to do something.

295
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,056
- DEVON: We're gonna get you on the bed.
- CONRAD: We got you.

296
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,338
We got you.

297
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,152
(wheezing)

298
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,488
Nichelle, try to relax.

299
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,129
Try and relax. Try and relax.

300
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,556
(grunts, panting)

301
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,561
- Bilateral crackles.
- Sats in the 80s.

302
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,023
Something's not adding up.

303
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,420
We'll run some more tests
and I'll order a chest CT.

304
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:02,176
Well-well, could it be the meds?

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,827
As I told Nichelle,
very unlikely.

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,021
Shingles. I saw a dermatologist.

307
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,661
They put you on an antiviral?

308
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,538
- Yeah, ten days ago. - Good.

309
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,624
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah.

310
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:23,698
If it's not a fungus,
we'll figure out what it is.

311
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,139
She's stressed about
the special election.

312
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,082
Mr. Randall didn't
want her to run.

313
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:31,477
And that's why he's not here?

314
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:35,639
Tom Randall cares
about Tom Randall.

315
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:38,045
He puts in time for
her if there's a camera.

316
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:41,382
Nichelle cares about
everybody. Atlanta needs her.

317
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,531
Georgia needs her.

318
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,829
You know, I couldn't imagine
what we'd do without her.

319
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:03,092
Is he off his call yet?

320
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,263
I'm sorry,
Mr. Yorn is on a different call now.

321
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:08,047
Of course he is. When do you
suppose he might be available?

322
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,245
- Check back in an hour.
- That's what you said an hour ago.

323
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,886
Tell you what,
why don't you have me paged

324
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,063
- when he's off the phone?
- Certainly.

325
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:23,780
(monitor beeping steadily)

326
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,898
- Mr. Mullins. - Hey.

327
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,786
I have a couple of
questions I'd like to ask you

328
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,952
- before we prep you for surgery.
- Yeah.

329
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,934
Have you continued to experience
acute onset bowel incontinence

330
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,200
post the discectomy
Dr. Cain performed

331
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,127
back in April last year?

332
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,296
Or was it only before surgery?

333
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,081
Say what?

334
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:44,052
Were you having difficulty
controlling your bowels

335
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:48,045
after the operation
or was it only before?

336
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:51,549
Neither. Um,
I've never had that problem.

337
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,520
Did Dr. Cain check your
rectal tone back in April?

338
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:01,295
Oh, uh, no. Uh,
I think I'd remember that.

339
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,298
(chuckles): Sure.
Of course you would.

340
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,801
All right. I'll see
you in the OR.

341
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,303
And we'll get you back on
your feet before you know it.

342
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,910
Okay.

343
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:20,336
Ben Mullins. Remember him?

344
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,299
He's back with
chronic thromboembolic

345
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:25,302
- pulmonary hypertension.
- And you're telling me this because...?

346
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,229
Because the clots could
be the result of COVID.

347
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,139
Which he most
likely contracted here

348
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,066
after you conned
him into thinking

349
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,799
- his discectomy was urgent.
- I did nothing of the kind.

350
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,353
I know you fabricated
his symptoms

351
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:36,802
to justify the surgery.

352
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,187
Mullins was never incontinent.

353
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:41,190
He doesn't even remember
you checking his rectal tone.

354
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,976
I know I may look like I have
stupid written on my forehead,

355
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,029
- but I see what's going on here.
- Even if I did what you are

356
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:50,983
accusing me of, there are plenty
other white surgeons out there

357
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,652
who did elective
surgeries during COVID.

358
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:56,205
Why come after the only
other prominent Black cutter?

359
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:58,040
There are plenty of brothers

360
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,928
I left behind because they
weren't ready for the fight.

361
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:04,663
Not once did it ever occur
to me to pick them off.

362
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,999
But you're that one
rising crab in the barrel

363
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,760
who pulls the one
above you right back in.

364
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:15,132
No. You got me wrong, bro.

365
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,704
That's not my M.O.

366
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,372
I don't want you gone, Barrett.

367
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,874
I happen to find strength

368
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,972
in our all-too-small
brotherhood,

369
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,044
but I'm about pushing
each other to excel,

370
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:26,148
to be more prepared,
to be more skilled,

371
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,073
so our talent cannot
be discounted.

372
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,866
It doesn't matter
if we're better.

373
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,909
We're always
gonna be discounted.

374
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,816
It's about the money.

375
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,244
Money's the one
thing they can't ignore.

376
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,030
Which is why I'm gonna
continue to do whatever it takes

377
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,041
to be the top earner.

378
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,127
That's the way
the game is played.

379
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,924
Playing the game doesn't
mean you have to lose your soul.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,504
You do you, and I'll do me.

381
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,806
Let the cards fall
where they may.

382
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,836
♪

383
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,094
Devon.

384
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,975
Thanks. What's up?

385
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:42,386
Nichelle and James
seem concerned

386
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,264
that she's taking
the antifungal meds.

387
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,816
It's a little weird.

388
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:50,152
When James asked me
if she was gonna be okay,

389
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:53,280
he looked like I'd look if I
thought I might lose Nic.

390
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,220
So you think there's something
going on between them.

391
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,083
Hey, what's up?

392
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,177
So, Cain lied on Mullins' file.

393
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:17,658
Said he was incontinent
to justify the surgery,

394
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:21,091
- but he was not. - That's it.

395
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:22,663
We have what we
need to get rid of him.

396
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,353
When you say "get rid of him,"

397
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,805
it means to potentially
destroy his career.

398
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,308
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I-I need to sit with it.

399
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:32,153
I can't imagine why.
He's a proven menace.

400
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,175
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

401
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,150
It's simple. Cain is dangerous.

402
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,346
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice surgery.

403
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,181
We can make that happen.

404
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,947
It is incumbent
upon us to do so.

405
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,992
Like I said, I need a minute.

406
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,294
All right?

407
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,047
All right.

408
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,866
(monitor beeping steadily)

409
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,184
Nichelle, I'm gonna follow your
lead and speak truth to power.

410
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,703
- Conrad...
- I don't think you're telling me

411
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,343
everything I need to know.

412
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,040
And I'm worried that
whatever you're holding back

413
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,396
is putting you at risk.

414
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,484
It's okay. You can tell me.

415
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:15,029
I can't feel my legs.

416
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,244
CONRAD: Can you feel that?

417
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,497
- You feel that? - No.

418
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,829
Lesions in L3-L4.

419
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,975
That's the cause of the
lower extremity paralysis.

420
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,875
Histo only causes spinal lesions
in the immunocompromised.

421
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:37,979
Which the patient is not.

422
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,074
We're dealing with
something else.

423
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,433
My gut says infection,
but our work didn't turn up anything.

424
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,102
I still think she's not
telling me something.

425
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:45,843
And it may end up killing her.

426
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,749
Well, I'll leave the detective
work to you two smarty-pants.

427
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:52,252
Right now, our future governor
needs a spinal decompression

428
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,396
so her paralysis doesn't
become permanent.

429
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,120
Hey.

430
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,766
- There you are. - Hey.

431
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,125
I have, uh,
concerns about this bypass thing.

432
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:11,127
- Okay. - So, you're telling me

433
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:14,274
you're not just gonna run
my blood through the machine

434
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:17,133
but you have to... have to stop my heart,
too?

435
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,803
MINA: Yes. The bypass

436
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,096
will act as your heart and lungs

437
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,431
- while we remove the clot.
- Okay. So,

438
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:24,381
what happens if my heart doesn't,
um,

439
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,808
start back up again?

440
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:28,385
Oh, well,
in that very remote possibility,

441
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:31,147
we would do everything we can
to get your heart beating again.

442
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,794
- "Remote possibility."
- BEVERLY: Mm-hmm.

443
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,100
That isn't reassuring, okay?

444
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,102
I don't know if you've noticed,

445
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,770
but, uh...

446
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:40,272
(coughs)

447
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,970
...but remote possibilities
tend to happen

448
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,454
- to me. - Hey.

449
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:47,997
Forgive him. It's just
been a rough year.

450
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,810
First it was the
emergency back surgery

451
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,618
and then his COVID infection,
and now this.

452
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:55,078
(slurring): I must be
the unluckiest man alive.

453
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:57,317
- (alarm beeping) -MINA: Mr. Mullins?
- Sweetheart?

454
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,728
- (slurring) -What's going on?
- He may be having a stroke.

455
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:01,655
- Excuse me. I'll up his oxygen.
- Oh.

456
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,347
(breathing heavily, grunting)

457
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,828
All right, his pupils are still reactive,
but he's lost

458
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,164
tone on his left side.
He needs a head CT.

459
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,229
We need to page Cain.

460
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,770
Hey.

461
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,675
Holy crap.

462
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,274
What are you doing
lurking out here?

463
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:25,679
Well,
I-I was actually lurking inside.

464
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,703
Just out of sight.

465
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,113
I didn't want to throw
you off your game.

466
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,375
The bouncer told me you
come back here between sets.

467
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:36,119
(chuckles): Just thought I'd
come see what you were up to.

468
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:39,048
Seriously? 20 years go by,

469
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:41,228
and you just thought you'd
come see what I'm up to?

470
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,179
What do... what do you want,
'Dolph?

471
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:45,387
So, how's-how's your mother?

472
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:47,723
She's doing well. She... Over you,
finally.

473
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,369
Listen,
I've got a lot of friends inside,

474
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:52,061
so if we could just get to it,
whatever it is?

475
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:54,805
Yeah. Of... Yeah. Of course.

476
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:58,400
Uh, like a lot of people,

477
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,852
the pandemic has forced
me to reevaluate things,

478
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,814
and I realize I've...

479
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,888
I put my professional
and financial life

480
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:12,698
ahead of my relationships,
and I'm-I'm so sorry for that.

481
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:16,785
I've seen a lot of people die this year,
Jake.

482
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:20,400
Some alone. Others
surrounded by loved ones.

483
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,207
Oh.

484
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:25,168
You're here because
y-you're scared of dying alone.

485
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,379
No.

486
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,881
- That's not why I'm here.
- But it's totally on brand.

487
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,267
Oh, that's not entirely fair.

488
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:32,913
We had a lot of
wonderful times together.

489
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,845
I-I... And I-I blew it.

490
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:37,523
There's no way
around that. I-I...

491
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,393
I cared for you, and I blew it.

492
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,924
No, if you cared for me,
you would've stayed in touch.

493
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,356
Go find somebody else to
hold your hand while you die.

494
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,117
I already mourned losing you.

495
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:02,205
Ben Mullins has
a clotting disorder

496
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:05,946
that is threatening his heart,
lungs and now his brain.

497
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,210
This is your fault.

498
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,806
I know the hierarchy
between you two is fluid,

499
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,951
but I will not be spoken
to that way by a resident.

500
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,286
AUSTIN: Two things, bro,

501
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,955
Dr. Okafor is no
ordinary resident,

502
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,645
and she happens to be right.

503
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,649
- This is on you.
- No, it's on the patient,

504
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:20,816
who was advised of the risks.

505
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,779
And last time I checked,
I didn't unleash a pandemic

506
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:25,103
- on the world.
- Mm-hmm. Deny it all you want,

507
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,134
but you will be held
responsible for this.

508
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,543
Logan Kim isn't here
to protect you anymore.

509
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,233
Hey.

510
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,139
Let's just, uh,

511
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,662
take a breath, all right?

512
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,100
He had a stroke in his
nondominant frontal lobe.

513
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:42,816
AUSTIN: All right.

514
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,009
Well,
looks like we can proceed with the surgery.

515
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:47,292
The blood thinners he's
on should be adequate

516
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,347
to treat the clot,
but we need you to be on standby

517
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,825
in case there's
hemorrhagic transformation

518
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,091
and the vessel bursts.

519
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,976
Always here when you need me.

520
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:59,480
You'd both do well
to remember that.

521
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:05,319
(monitor beeping steadily)

522
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,165
Dr. Voss?

523
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,213
Kit, what's going on down there?

524
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,173
KIT: Better if I show you.

525
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,371
Nichelle has
something on her skin

526
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,969
that looks like shingles.

527
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:41,041
You have shingles, too.

528
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,266
- Why?
- I don't know. Coincidence?

529
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:46,662
It's a symptom of something
you and Nichelle caught

530
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
when you were
out of town together.

531
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:50,884
- I'm guessing nowhere near Kentucky.
- I'm her driver.

532
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,961
- All right? That's all.
- Yeah, no, of course.

533
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:56,328
That being said,
she's gonna die unless I get the truth.

534
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,332
(exhales)

535
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,564
We were in the Caribbean.

536
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:07,539
Jamaica.

537
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:09,903
Are the meds you're taking
for the shingles working?

538
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:12,072
Not really. Why?

539
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,576
Because I know what you both have now,
and it's not shingles.

540
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,587
(monitor beeping steadily)

541
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,862
(high-pitched whirring)

542
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,952
- (heart beating) -
AUSTIN: All right.

543
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:37,903
A massive clot removed
and a beating heart.

544
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,330
I say it's a beautiful
day in the OR.

545
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:43,845
- (monitor beeping rapidly)
- CHU: Intracranial pressure

546
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,002
is rising.

547
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:51,945
- Pupils are blown.
- MINA: He's brain-hemorrhaging.

548
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,780
AUSTIN: And herniating.
He doesn't have much time.

549
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:56,755
- Somebody call Cain.
- CAIN: He's already here.

550
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,590
Elevate the head,

551
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,948
reverse the blood thinners,
prep for a craniotomy.

552
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,325
Incision.

553
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:25,283
(monitor beeping rapidly)

554
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,888
CHU: Intracranial
pressure is up to 60.

555
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,815
CAIN: I know how high it is.

556
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,464
Ready to enter the skull. Drill?

557
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,395
(whirring)

558
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,660
CHU: Blood
pressure's rising fast.

559
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,098
AUSTIN: What's going on up there,
Cain?

560
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:11,382
I stopped the bleed,
but he's still herniating.

561
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,842
- How is that possible?
- He's bleeding

562
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,165
from a place where I can't see.

563
00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:15,695
Other side of the brain.

564
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,221
- Ultrasound?
- AUSTIN: Aren't you supposed

565
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:19,181
to drill a hole in the
other side of the skull?

566
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,776
CAIN: No, he doesn't have
the time for two craniotomies.

567
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,944
I'm gonna pass the needle
from this side of the brain

568
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:24,893
to the other to
remove the blood.

569
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,897
MINA: You can't blindly poke
a needle through the sides

570
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:29,358
- of his brain. You'll kill him.
- I don't blindly operate,

571
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:31,382
and nobody asked
for your permission.

572
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:35,020
Yo,
have you ever done this before?

573
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:36,405
Nope. Never.

574
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:40,887
We need to stop this.

575
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:42,953
If we do, the patient will die.

576
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,225
Listen to your mentor, Okafor.

577
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,332
Stay in your lane.

578
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:51,920
CHU: Blood pressure's dropping.

579
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,797
CAIN: Time to go to work.

580
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,402
CHU: BP stabilized.

581
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:15,527
(monitor beeping steadily)

582
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,540
(door opens)

583
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,940
You're going to protect Cain.

584
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:35,964
He's done so much harm.

585
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,353
Yeah, but in his mind,
he's just doing whatever he can do

586
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:41,252
to survive in a system
that's been rigged against us.

587
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:45,807
So you think systemic
racism excuses his behavior?

588
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:47,217
No.

589
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:50,387
But it does explain it.

590
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:54,099
The frustration,
the-the pain, the anger

591
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:56,463
that builds up,
knowing that in this country,

592
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,895
your life can go
south at any moment

593
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:02,157
just because of the
melanin in your skin.

594
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,496
Now,
I was raised not to let the unfairness

595
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,163
of discrimination consume me.

596
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,948
But if Cain wasn't taught that,

597
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,312
can you blame him
for how he turned out?

598
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:14,147
I mean, what else do you expect?

599
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,316
I wasn't born in this country,

600
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,675
so my experience and
history with racism is different,

601
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,343
but this is a mistake.

602
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,129
I believe Cain can be redeemed.

603
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:27,683
You're wrong.
People don't change.

604
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,852
Okay, well,
here's the bottom line.

605
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,971
I've listened to your input,
Mina,

606
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:34,973
but at the end of the day,

607
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:37,308
it's my decision whether
to report him or not.

608
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:39,172
Not yours.

609
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:43,106
And I need you to respect that.

610
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:47,786
Are you asking me as m... As
my colleague or my boyfriend?

611
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:53,166
- Does it matter?
- What you do matters to me.

612
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,362
- How did it go with Jake?
<i>- BELL (over phone): Not well.</i>

613
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,364
- Oh, I'm sorry, Randolph.
<i>- You know, I've always</i>

614
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,796
felt guilty about leaving him.

615
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:10,058
And... He needed a father.

616
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:13,729
<i>And I'm not so sure about
the choices he's made.</i>

617
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,875
- Can you do anything about it?
<i>- No, he's...</i>

618
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,545
He's a grown man, he's moved on.

619
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:23,049
And I think my chance to
have any positive impact on him

620
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:24,718
- has passed me by.
<i>- You can't give up</i>

621
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,219
<i>so easily, Randolph.</i>

622
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:27,576
Put up a fight.

623
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:29,222
Oh, I have to hang up.

624
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:32,655
It's time to ambush
the CEO of Red Rock.

625
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:34,916
<i>- What?</i>
- ASSISTANT: And your lunch

626
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,252
is at 12:30 and... Sir,
I'll call security.

627
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,067
It's okay. Dr. Voss
isn't here to hurt me.

628
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,426
Although,
given her mastery of the spine,

629
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,834
I'm sure she could.

630
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:47,262
Listen, I'm sorry you got
the cold shoulder all day,

631
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,266
but my assistant,
she's a bit overprotective.

632
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,911
All will be forgiven if
you answer one question:

633
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:54,895
who's replacing
Logan Kim as CEO?

634
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,084
Chastain isn't
getting a new CEO.

635
00:32:58,108 --> 00:32:59,610
I don't understand.
Someone has to be in charge.

636
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:02,861
Who's gonna run the hospital?

637
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:07,243
<i>CONRAD: Dr. Voss expects</i>

638
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:08,928
you'll be up and
walking again soon.

639
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:10,838
She said I had
lesions on my spine.

640
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:13,007
- Please tell me you know what I have.
- We do.

641
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:15,084
You have a parasitic
worm called a Schistosoma.

642
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:17,604
And your spinal lesion
biopsy confirmed it.

643
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,606
CONRAD: They're
usually found in places

644
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,174
like the Middle East,
Southeast Asia, the Caribbean.

645
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,751
The Caribbean?

646
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:28,097
Do you have any
idea how lucky you are

647
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:30,099
that we had the
time and the patience

648
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:31,809
to figure out what was
going wrong with you

649
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,361
before your organs failed,
despite...

650
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:34,788
- Devon. - No, no, no.

651
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,456
She needs to hear this.

652
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,096
You lied to us.

653
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:40,794
We have sick people out
there who need our attention,

654
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,870
but we were stuck here
wading through your nonsense.

655
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:44,734
CONRAD: Let me talk to her.

656
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,612
We put you on antiparasitics
for the next four weeks.

657
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:57,207
James is on them, too.

658
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,085
Keeping secrets from
your doctors can kill you.

659
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:10,306
I don't want you to think
I'm just another politician

660
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,963
who had an affair.

661
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,809
- I am not here to judge you.
- Well, that's what

662
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,092
people do unless
you give them context.

663
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,832
You know,
I represent the district I grew up in

664
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,666
in Atlanta.

665
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,501
I love my people.

666
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:23,411
And I've been able to make
a difference where change

667
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:25,435
is hard to come by.

668
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:28,007
At first,
my husband understood that.

669
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,198
When we met,
he was an NFL megastar

670
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:32,868
and I was a judge
in small-claims court.

671
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:36,037
Now no one asks
him about football.

672
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:38,208
They ask him what it's
like to be married to me.

673
00:34:38,232 --> 00:34:41,251
And his ego can't handle that.

674
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,620
But James...

675
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:45,714
Yeah?

676
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,862
He'd love to tell people what
it's like to be married to you.

677
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,460
(scoffs softly)

678
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:51,865
Yes, sir.

679
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,006
He's a good man, my James.

680
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,893
While my husband might
not sleep with me anymore,

681
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,614
but he will do a press
conference tomorrow

682
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:02,041
and say,
"My wife is stronger than half the men

683
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:04,193
I played football with.
No bug's gonna stop her."

684
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:07,810
But if I was outed as unfaithful
to Atlanta's favorite son,

685
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,074
I would never make it to
the governor's mansion.

686
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:11,551
You know we're
duty bound to keep

687
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,024
your personal life confidential.

688
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:14,576
I know.

689
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:18,914
But it will get out eventually.

690
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,216
Can you ask James
to come in here?

691
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,977
(door opens)

692
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,403
She almost died
keeping a secret.

693
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,027
Anything you want to tell me?

694
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,262
After the memorial,
I went to the hospital

695
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:57,619
where my dad died.

696
00:35:57,696 --> 00:36:00,238
I found the resident
that took care of him.

697
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:04,125
It was a good guy,
reminded me of you actually.

698
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:10,799
They were understaffed,
too few vents.

699
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,112
One nurse for
every ten patients.

700
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:14,781
We have one nurse
for every two patients.

701
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,879
They intubated him.

702
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:19,424
He was stable until,
like, 2:00 a.m.

703
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,260
His sat dropped,
heart rate started to slow.

704
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:23,812
Ten minutes went by.

705
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:26,033
And when they finally got to him,
he was gone.

706
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:28,391
Cardiac arrest.

707
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:30,768
My father, he died alone

708
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:33,285
because his public hospital,
in a poor brown neighborhood,

709
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:36,866
didn't have enough
resources to save him.

710
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:39,202
I'm so, so sorry, man.

711
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,387
When the,
when the resident was...

712
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:03,351
When he was rereading his notes,

713
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:05,511
he started to cry.

714
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,764
And I said to him,

715
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,503
"Hey, l-look,
we all have that patient we know

716
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,810
we could have saved."

717
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:16,105
And he said to me,

718
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:19,868
"If only it had just been one."

719
00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:21,953
There had been dozens.

720
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,960
(ventilator hissing)

721
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:35,194
We'll continue to monitor him but,
uh, his prognosis is good.

722
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,386
(sighs) Dr. Cain
said the same thing.

723
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:40,221
He stopped by.

724
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,017
His words were such a comfort.

725
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:50,899
We are indebted to him,
to all of you, for saving Ben's life.

726
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:57,947
Mrs. Mullins,
there's something you should know.

727
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:12,253
You went behind my back
and told the Mullins about Cain.

728
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,422
- I explicitly told you not to.
- Oh.

729
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:15,902
Now they're suing.

730
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:16,758
You weren't listening to reason.

731
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,426
I was listening to my gut.

732
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:20,929
Which tells me to believe
in Cain's redemption.

733
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:22,483
You don't get to override that,
Mina.

734
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:24,243
Barrett Cain broke the
first tenet of our profession,

735
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,101
"do no harm."

736
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,413
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice medicine.

737
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:30,271
I did you a favor.
I did us all a favor.

738
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,056
You didn't do anybody a favor.

739
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,753
You just carried
out your own verdict

740
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:35,059
in Mina's kangaroo court.

741
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,112
And you disrespected me.

742
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:42,733
If you're looking
for me to apologize,

743
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,494
that's not happening.

744
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,698
You know, by my count,
it's been nine

745
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:52,034
consecutive nights
of soul-stirring sex

746
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,797
- and unparalleled conversation.
- Mm.

747
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:55,274
And,
though I will deny ever saying this,

748
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:57,373
my back hurts.

749
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,094
Are you suggesting
we take a break?

750
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:01,419
- Yes. - Agreed.

751
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,087
Two nights.

752
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:04,514
Three.

753
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,717
Agreed.

754
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:11,146
Rest your back and
reconsider your actions.

755
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:14,065
Yeah. And you reconsider, too.

756
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:19,112
♪

757
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:26,244
New driver, huh?

758
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:31,040
Can't move forward
without change.

759
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,312
But good news.

760
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:36,287
Senator Buxton freed
up some federal money

761
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:39,290
for our childcare needs,
so not a bad day's work.

762
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,250
I'll mention that to Bianca.

763
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:43,823
Trust me,
somewhere in Atlanta there is a girl

764
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,254
named Bianca with two kids

765
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:47,390
who can't afford to
take care of them.

766
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,929
Thank you for everything.

767
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,356
Best of luck to you, Conrad.

768
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:01,196
Best of luck to you, Nichelle.

769
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:10,780
Oh, what the hell, man?

770
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,834
How do you go from
absent ex-stepfather

771
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:14,158
to shameless groupie...

772
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:16,004
I'm here because
I want to be here,

773
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,547
and because there's
something I need to say to you.

774
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,881
You needed a father,
and I dropped the ball.

775
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,091
You're a very talented musician.

776
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,720
- Thanks. - You know,

777
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,439
having said that,
I know it's-it's hard to make a living

778
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:27,700
- in the music business no matter...
- (laughs)

779
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,944
- ...without a lot of luck.
- Okay, this is priceless.

780
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:31,853
You know, I don't know how
you supplement your passion,

781
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:33,873
but I'd... I would like to help.

782
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:36,347
The thing is,
I don't need your help.

783
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,775
I play music to relieve
stress. I'm a surgeon.

784
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,570
Plastics and ENT.

785
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,356
I...

786
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,024
I googled you.

787
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,745
I use Wong,
my mother's maiden name,

788
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:50,245
for my medical practice.

789
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:53,206
She is the one who put
me through medical school.

790
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:57,660
Don't do that.

791
00:40:57,737 --> 00:40:59,996
- What? - Smile

792
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:03,216
like you had any influence on
my decision to go into medicine.

793
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,770
I'm glad Devon finally
opened up to you.

794
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:16,916
You're a good friend.

795
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,440
Oh, it's devastating.

796
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:23,185
- I hate that he's going through this.
- Mm.

797
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:26,689
Promise me,
let's never run for office.

798
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:30,285
(laughs) Or become sports icons.

799
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:34,497
And let's never,
ever keep secrets from each other.

800
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:39,419
Right. No. Never.

801
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,800
(laughs): What is it?
You look adorably insane.

802
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:48,753
Well,
in the spirit of excellent rules

803
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:51,306
for a healthy marriage,

804
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:55,143
there's something
I have to tell you.

805
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,353
Okay.

806
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:06,529
I'm pregnant.

807
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,324
What? How?

808
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,971
Four years of medical school

809
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,288
and you still don't
know how this works?

810
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:14,807
I didn't know we
pulled the goalie.

811
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:17,740
We didn't. I know. It's-it's...

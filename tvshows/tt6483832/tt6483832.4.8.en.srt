1
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:03,522
Things don't have to end

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,898
- between us.
- When's your flight home?

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,415
Tomorrow morning.

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,821
- Will I ever operate again?
- It will take months

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:14,274
of PT before you can even
think about operating again.

6
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:15,589
Rose, I can't imagine the pain

7
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,850
- you've endured.
- I'm a dancer.

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,497
I was a dancer.

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,116
Now I teach dance
to high-risk kids.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,932
Those girls, they're my life.

11
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,805
Let's stick to the only
thing that matters.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,587
- How is Nic?
- Attack nearly killed her and the baby.

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,032
Mentally, each
day's a little worse.

14
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,108
She has PTSD.

15
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,890
- Can't even make it through the night.
- Nightmares.

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,623
- I know.
- They're getting worse.

17

18
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,559
Hi. Leela Devi.
New surgical intern.

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,178
Jessica Moore.
Old surgical nurse.

20
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,349
You know the interns
usually pre-round at 5:00

21
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:30,975
and not 3:45, right?

22
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,235
When you get to know me,

23
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,020
you'll see I tend
to over prepare.

24
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,480
So, what's your story?

25
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,321
The hospital where I
matched shut down.

26
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:38,931
Financial losses from COVID.

27
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:42,267
It's been happening all
over the country. I'm sorry.

28
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,082
- But welcome to Chastain.
- Thanks.

29
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,992
Hey, um, when you have a minute,

30
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:51,162
I would love to learn
everything about your patients.

31
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:52,778
Not just the medicine.

32
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,279
Personal stuff, too.

33
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:56,426
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,817
Nurses always know
more than anyone, right?

35
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,288
You're gonna take notes?

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,103
- I write everything down.
- Wow.

37
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,868
Okay. Well, um,

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,519
let's start over here.

39
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:12,038
So, we have Mr. Watts.
And he is the sweetest thing,

40
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,632
but if you talk
about his sailboat,

41
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,343
you'll never leave the room.

42
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,691
This place hasn't been
the same without you.

43
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,285
- Welcome back to work.
- I'm glad to be here.

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,121
Schlumping around the
house was getting old.

45
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,478
That's called healing,

46
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,624
not schlumping.

47
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,222
I'm excited to be back.

48
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,692
I'm just sad that my
first day's Billie's last.

49
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,964
Where are you headed?

50
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,487
Back home to
Charleston to figure out

51
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,584
the rest of my life.

52
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,586
Get your hands off of me!

53
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,514
31-year-old jail inmate
involved in a riot.

54
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,090
Took a heavy beating
and has extensive injuries

55
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,206
to his chest and abdomen.

56
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,814
- Get the hell off of me!
- Get your hands off!

57
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,488
- We're trying to help you, sir.
- Go to hell, all of you!

58
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,384
Let's go to 11.

59
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,924
One, two, three.

60
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,115
Are you okay?

61
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:14,484
That's the man who stabbed me.

62
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,717
I'll get someone
to cover for me,

63
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,739
and then I'll take you home.

64
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,848
- I'll stay another day to be with her.
- That's not necessary.

65
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,426
- I'll be with her.
- Okay, you guys are overreacting.

66
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,261
No, we're not. This is a
trigger. You don't need this.

67
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,396
I won't be anywhere near
him. I don't even work this floor.

68
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,948
Now I'm worried about you.

69
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:53,159
Do I want to kill him with
my bare hands? Maybe.

70
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,975
Will I? No.

71
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,422
- Maybe you should go home.
- And leave you here alone?

72
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,006
Why would we let
this guy scare us off?

73
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,259
He's under armed guard.
He's handcuffed to the bed.

74
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,053
There's no reason
anyone has to leave.

75
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,505
If Nic wants to stay, I'll
stay with her. Conrad,

76
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,006
you can keep seeing patients.

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,225
I'm gonna head upstairs.

78
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,417
Promise you'll
keep your distance,

79
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:11,959
I promise I'll keep mine.

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
I won't let her out of my sight.

81
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,548
You take care of you.

82
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,112
Is that the guy?

83
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,240
Yeah.

84
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,671
Not your problem.

85
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:27,485
Listen, we're gonna do
everything we need to do

86
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,028
and then send him back
to jail where he belongs.

87
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,561
Now, you steer clear.

88
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,850
- I need some help here!
- Come on, let's go.

89
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,426
Open left tib-fib fracture

90
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,090
after fall. Patient
complaining of abdominal pain.

91
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,758
- Vitals stable.
- Yeah, we just made our vows.

92
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,909
We were heading down a
rickety staircase when Megan

93
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,676
I was pushed down
the stairs by a ghost!

94
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:48,265
Hotel's super haunted.

95
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,623
All right, here we go.
One, two and three.

96
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,646
Hundley, let's give
her two of morphine.

97
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,274
Mild tenderness.

98
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,109
No rebound or guarding.

99
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,486
- We'll have to do an ultrasound.
- Stabilize the fracture here.

100
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,135
And then after
that, you will need

101
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,949
surgery to put the bones
back where they belong.

102
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,860
48-year-old, status post
three-vessel CABG postop

103
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:10,662
day one. Vitals stable.

104
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,831
Labs with a slight creatinine
bump to 1.2. No chest pain.

105
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,482
- Plans for the day?
- Send off urine electrolytes.

106
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,409
Repeat the
creatinine in the p.m.

107
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,983
Make sure he gets out of bed.

108
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,526
And his daughter's visiting.

109
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:21,581
I'll prepare to see
her dad in the hospital.

110
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,802
Strong work for an intern. Next.

111
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,587
Quicker this time.

112
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,140
You know how surgeons feel
about rounds. Overnight events?

113
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,474
None. Chest tube
drainage was only

114
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,143
20cc's, but she's very anxious.

115
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,927
- Plans?
- Clamp the chest tube,

116
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,721
repeat an X-ray. Hopefully
we can pull it later in the day.

117
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,431
And then maybe she
can visit the garden.

118
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,580
This is your first
morning at Chastain.

119
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:43,361
How'd you learn so much
about these patients so quickly?

120
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,511
I asked a really smart nurse.

121
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,349
Good job.

122
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,022
Does that happen often?

123
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,357
More and more lately.

124
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,026
I have Huntington's disease.

125
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,839
My father died of it.

126
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,674
It's probably the real reason
I fell down those stairs.

127
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,033
My balance is getting
worse and worse.

128
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,346
We got married as
soon as we realized

129
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,685
Megan inherited the gene.

130
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,057
I had a fifty-fifty chance,

131
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,300
and I lost that coin toss.

132
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,686
Symptoms started
soon after we fell in love,

133
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,877
and Megan knew
what it was right away.

134
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,692
Huntington's is brutal. I
know how bad this is gonna be.

135
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,885
I spent my childhood
watching my father waste away.

136
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:30,222
All the nerve cells dying until
there was nothing left of him.

137
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,744
This is Dr. Voss and Dr. Bell.

138
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,205
- You're in great hands, okay?
- Thank you.

139
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,879
- See you after surgery.
- Okay.

140
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,308
Looks like you broke
a few bones here.

141
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,144
I'll be taking you to the OR.

142
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,905
So, you have some
fluid in your abdomen

143
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:49,056
that shouldn't be there.

144
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,984
We'll get a CT

145
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,912
to confirm, but we'll likely
repair that in the OR, as well.

146
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,725
Okay.

147
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,657
Josko.

148
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,420
We-We're gonna miss our
honeymoon. I'm so sorry.

149
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,997
It's all good. No
worries. Don't worry.

150
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,735
Such a hard booking to get, too.

151
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,571
We were gonna stay at the
Stanley Hotel in Colorado.

152
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,203
The inspiration for The Shining?

153
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,691
I wouldn't set
foot in that place

154
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,490
for all the Bitcoin in Iceland.

155
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:16,176
Our love of horror films is
what brought us together.

156
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,440
Hey, hey. Here we go.

157
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,586
We're having fun now.

158
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,296
Ooh, show me your moves!

159
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,213
Sir, are you all right?

160
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,012
I'm fine.

161
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:40,292
Dr. Barrett Cain

162
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:43,681
here for physical therapy
with Tammy Eaton.

163
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:45,316
That's what I'm talking about.

164
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,358
Wear this at all times.

165
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,280
Welcome to Chastain.

166
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,953
- Wheelchair, please!
- No.

167
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,825
I don't need a wheelchair.

168
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,769
It's hospital policy, sir,
given your condition.

169
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,071
- Let me help you.
- Hey, hey.

170
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,907
How about we turn that frown

171
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,126
upside down?

172
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,176
Honestly, Billie, you can go.

173
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,325
I'm fine. You're
gonna hit rush hour.

174
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:16,047
- A little traffic doesn't scare me.
- Even on I-20?

175
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,554
Wow, you have been gone a while.

176
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,997
I'm brave.

177
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,643
Hey, you feel like a coffee?

178
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,479
I'd love one. Cream
and two sugars?

179
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,814
I was thinking both of
us would hit the café.

180
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,192
Well, I'm just about
to start my rounds.

181
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,007
- Morning.
- Hello.

182
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,718
Go. I'm fine.

183
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
- What?
- I just heard from my lawyer.

184
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,504
She says immigration
is demanding more proof

185
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,956
of my medical
training in Nigeria.

186
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,255
- Why?
- I don't know. She said it's unusual.

187
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,751
Can't you just give
them what they want?

188
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,428
I don't know if I can
get the paperwork

189
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,888
out of Nigeria quick
enough to make the deadline.

190
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,297
And if I don't,

191
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,517
no visa. I'll be deported.

192
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,018
And once someone is deported,

193
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,875
it's nearly impossible
to get back in.

194
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,618
Why is this happening?

195
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:08,171
Is someone trying to
sabotage my career?

196
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,700
Where's Nic?

197
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,036
She left the floor
right after you did.

198
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:28,066
Orderly to the cath lab.

199
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,606
Imbecile!

200
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,089
- Get me a real nurse!
- Hold still.

201
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:52,924
- I'll try again.
- Like hell you will!

202
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,595
Code Grey!

203
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,081
Get off me.

204
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,497
- Nic.
- What are you doing?

205
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,484
- Yeah?
- Get out of here. Okay? I got this.

206
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,258
Here.

207
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,574
- Hey, are you a...
- Doctor? Yeah.

208
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,410
Hey. No.

209
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,434
Are you kidding?

210
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,144
You don't have privileges
here. That is illegal.

211
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,012
Pravesh, I know
that every broken rule

212
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,889
tears at your psyche,
but she was struggling,

213
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,833
- and this guy needed to go to sleep.
- All right.

214
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,777
I got it from here. Please
just go check on Nic.

215
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,118
Pressure's 76/48.

216
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,781
What's going on?

217
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,555
Look at his neck.

218
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,794
We need an ultrasound.

219
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:51,274
Muffled heart sounds.
It's Beck's triad.

220
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,465
Pericardial effusion,
there's fluid around his heart.

221
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,300
Must have been too
small to see in the scan

222
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,324
when he first came in.

223
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,543
Page Dr. Austin.

224
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,512
We need to drain the fluid now.

225
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,847
What the hell were
you doing in there?

226
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,721
I answered a code. It's my job.

227
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,239
That's the best you've got?

228
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,386
You gave me and
Conrad your word.

229
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,728
- I thought you had eyes on her.
- I was literally gone five minutes.

230
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,391
My God, do you
guys hear yourselves?

231
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:14,842
So I went to see him.
That was up to me.

232
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,508
And you know what,
Lisa was in trouble,

233
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,510
- So I called for help. It's over.
- Is it?

234
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,198
- Yeah, it is.
- Where you going?

235
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,555
I have a patient.

236
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,375
He's got a cardiac issue.

237
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,024
They'll fix it and
send him back to jail.

238
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,919
All's well that ends well

239
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,988
if this was a one-shot deal.

240
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:42,850
Pressure's dropping.

241
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,352
- He's in tamponade.
- Devi, grab the ultrasound.

242
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,728
Move it. This guy could
code while we wait on you.

243
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,065
- You want me to take over?
- No, give her a shot.

244
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,047
Move the probe up a bit.

245
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,675
Move it up.

246
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,532
What are you doing?
Put it back where it was

247
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,539
and rotate it cranially, now.

248
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,284
Incorrect! Pravesh, take over.

249
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,688
Devi, get out of
my sight. Move it!

250
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:21,114
All right, that's a good
visual, Pravesh, thank you.

251
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,983
Entering the pericardial sac.

252
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,319
And... we're in.

253
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,891
Draining the effusion now.

254
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,915
All right?

255
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,327
All right, he's
stabilized for now.

256
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,588
Let's book an OR, find
the source and repair it.

257
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,997
Why are you still here?

258
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,591
Go.

259
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,398
You'd think a mid-year
surgical intern would know

260
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,909
- how to do an ultrasound.
- She certainly fooled me

261
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,767
during the rounds this morning.

262
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,894
I thought she was
a potential star.

263
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:55,089
Let me know if you need
anything, I gotta take this.

264
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,108
Yeah, go ahead, man.

265
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,000
Nadine, what a nice surprise.

266
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,449
Hey, Devon. Guess what.

267
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,713
I'm in Atlanta for my
yearly moyamoya checkup.

268
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,474
I'd love to stop by and say hi.

269
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,642
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love to see you.

270
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,935
I get off around 7:00.

271
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,428
Can't wait.

272
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:17,020
And I, have a surprise for you.

273
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:18,483
What kind of surprise?

274
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,318
It wouldn't be a
surprise if I told you.

275
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,550
I'll see you later.

276
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,473
This poor woman.

277
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,695
I wouldn't wish Huntington's
on my worst enemy.

278
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,478
Well, hopefully we
can give her back

279
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:35,480
whatever quality
time she has left.

280
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:40,652
I hear Cain is back at
Chastain for the first time today.

281
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,007
Yes, for PT. I'm gonna check
on him after this. Rongeur.

282
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,363
You know, I know you
don't need my advice...

283
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,408
No, I don't.

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,053
I think you should
cut him loose.

285
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,140
He's more trouble
than he's worth.

286
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,330
You're probably right.

287
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,143
But we've lost so many doctors

288
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,886
since we went public.

289
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,313
We're struggling.

290
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,040
I had hopes for Cain's
return. Without him,

291
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:01,433
I may have to shutter the
neurosurgery department.

292
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,069
You said you were
gonna find replacements.

293
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,385
Believe me, I've tried.

294
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,443
Now, complete the word

295
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,351
by placing the
correct block on top.

296
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,281
- This is ridiculous.
- Think of them

297
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,397
as building blocks
to your recovery.

298
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:35,356
Look... The more you
do it, the easier it'll get.

299
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,854
I'm not doing it
again. Let's move on.

300
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,044
In order to move on, we
need to complete each task.

301
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,955
So... begin again.

302
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,193
Do I look like a toddler?

303
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,051
Don't talk to me like one.

304
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:49,795
Don't act like one.

305
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,949
Tammy's just doing her
job. Have some respect.

306
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:57,954
Whoever you are, when I want
your advice I'll ask you for it.

307
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,992
Dr. Cain.

308
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,211
- Is there a problem?
- He's a doctor?

309
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,755
Dr. Cain is one of the top
neurosurgeons in the country.

310
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,093
Well, here's hoping my
disease never creeps upstairs.

311
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,816
I don't like her attitude.

312
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:12,243
That's Rose Williams,

313
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,245
- one of my favorite patients.
- Mine, too.

314
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,989
Never complains. I love her

315
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,802
to the moon and back.

316
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,180
She obviously has no
idea what I'm going through.

317
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,399
You've had some bad luck,

318
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,590
but Rose has
sickle cell disease.

319
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:28,571
She's young and should have
her whole life ahead of her.

320
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,430
Instead, she has a
devastating diagnosis.

321
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,083
How's that new hip settling in?

322
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,344
It's feeling much better.

323
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:41,088
I'll be dancing
again in no time,

324
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,983
and I can't wait.

325
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,117
Good. Take your time.

326
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,080
There's no rush.

327
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,716
My office when
you're done, Barrett.

328
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,632
We need to talk more
about what happened.

329
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,467
You promised both Conrad and me

330
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,086
you'd stay away from Jay
Pickering, and you didn't.

331
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,719
Why did you do it, Nic?

332
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,622
I'm still having nightmares.

333
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,522
I guess I'm still
scared, in a sense.

334
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:48,058
Maybe it helped to see him

335
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:51,603
broken and weak.

336
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,532
I just need to stop reliving
it over and over again.

337
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,034
I mean, every time
I close my eyes...

338
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,517
Time will help all of that.

339
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,614
You remember when your mom died?

340
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:06,002
You and Jessie were devastated,
and you both began acting out.

341
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,503
Yeah.

342
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,381
And for several years,
you and I drifted apart.

343
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:15,091
Probably when we
needed each other the most.

344
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,368
I was terribly lonely.

345
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:20,763
There was this guy, a neighbor.

346
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,021
Started giving me attention.
You know, having me over

347
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,879
for one excuse or another.

348
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:30,456
He made me feel special.

349
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:35,011
Then one day he touched
me where he shouldn't.

350
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,181
And he raped me.

351
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,133
How old were you?

352
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:44,020
Thirteen.

353
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,291
Why didn't you tell me?

354
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,985
I didn't tell anyone.

355
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,258
I was ashamed.

356
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,983
It was difficult and painful.

357
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,797
I'm so sorry, Billie.

358
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,559
It took time, but eventually,
I broke his hold over me.

359
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,250
And that's what you have to do.

360
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,419
Move on.

361
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,566
Because if you don't,
you'll continue to be a victim,

362
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,673
and you've given him control.

363
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,252
The fracture has been
repaired. The surgery went well.

364
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,254
I'll be in in a sec.

365
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,682
- Hey.
- Hi.

366
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,631
Those newlyweds gave me an idea.

367
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,188
They got married at a spooky
hotel and are honeymooning

368
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,427
at the Stanley Hotel.

369
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,120
Redrum.

370
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,674
I love scary movies.

371
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:47,177
I say we make our
wedding our wedding.

372
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,679
Personal.

373
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,462
- Special. Just for us.
- What'd you have in mind?

374
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,131
When did we have
the best time ever?

375
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,819
Snorkeling in the Keys.

376
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,321
- But we can't leave Atlanta.
- Yes, but

377
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,930
- I have an idea.
- Someone help!

378
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,866
What is happening?

379
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,272
All right, call the blood
bank for two units, stat,

380
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,356
and page Conrad.
She's having a GI bleed.

381
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,990
- What happened?
- She said she felt sick

382
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,587
- and then blood was just everywhere.
- Help me sit her up.

383
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,213
Pretty decent episode
of hematemesis,

384
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,904
Vitals stable.

385
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,296
All right, let's give her a
bolus of omeprazole, 80 mil.

386
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,312
And call Bell. We need him here.

387
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,764
- This can't be from the fall.
- I don't think so.

388
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:36,026
Something else is
causing her GI bleed.

389
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:42,054
- Megan, stay with us.
- Stay with me. Stay with me!

390
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,017
My God. Help her! Help her!

391
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,688
- Need to intubate now!
- Hey, Josko, you need to wait outside!

392
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:51,439
- You need to wait outside.
- Sorry.

393
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,984
Can you prep the ET tube?

394
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,342
Where's the pipe?

395
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,200
I can't see a damn thing.

396
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,952
All right, I see
the cords. Tube.

397
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,977
She's gonna need
an endoscopy to locate

398
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,081
the source of the bleeding.

399
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:22,053
Yeah, and she needs that now.

400
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,541
- How's the new intern been doing?
- Mixed bag.

401
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,419
Sometimes total confidence,
others a flailing mess.

402
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,069
Just like every intern.
Including you, Pravesh.

403
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,947
I think there's
more to it than that.

404
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,055
If you'd rather be an
artist, by all means go do it.

405
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,098
At least no one dies when
you color outside the lines.

406
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,323
Right now, you really should
be focusing on your patients.

407
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,395
Especially after
today's performance.

408
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,586
So kind of you to
give me that advice

409
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,608
on my first day at
Chastain, Dr. Pravesh.

410
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,276
Thanks so much.

411
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,969
Do you want to see
what I was drawing?

412
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,419
You don't know me
and I don't know you,

413
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,324
but you need to understand this.

414
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,702
There is nothing that
matters to me more

415
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:19,018
than learning to be the
best doctor that I can be.

416
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,686
And as far as my
performance goes,

417
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:22,947
when you were an intern,
did you perform flawlessly?

418
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,635
It's a learning process,

419
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,784
and I was rather hoping
you'd help me learn,

420
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,371
not tear me down.

421
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,207
Hold on.

422
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,114
- Bulging vein at six o'clock.
- Yeah, a variceal bleed.

423
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,304
I need to band it.

424
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,639
I'll get her started on a drip.

425
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,003
Okay, I have the culprit.

426
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,360
Twisting the dial...

427
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,306
And the band is on.

428
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:12,621
Cutting off circulation to
the abnormal veins and

429
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:16,584
stopping the bleed.

430
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:23,986
So Megan was
bleeding due to varices.

431
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,343
She likely has cirrhosis.

432
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:28,471
Yeah, it explains
why her coags are off.

433
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,016
Liver disease.

434
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:36,832
- Drugs, alcohol...
- No.

435
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,022
When we took her history,

436
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,691
she said she only
drinks tea and seltzer.

437
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:43,339
I'll send off studies.

438
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,549
Hepatitis panel,
autoimmune serologies.

439
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,656
They have to tell us something.

440
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,542
Impressive.

441
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,546
I'm motivated.

442
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,027
I want my life back.

443
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,384
Me, too.

444
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,053
Sickle cell is, um, it's brutal.

445
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,465
Earlier today, I was

446
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:16,952
I was a little

447
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:19,397
I'll fight it till
my last breath.

448
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,419
I want to dance again.
It gives me a goal.

449
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,829
I can understand that.

450
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,063
I'm a surgeon

451
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:27,220
and I'm nothing
without my hands.

452
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,648
How did you hurt yourself?

453
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,261
I was hit by a car.

454
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,953
Damn. I'm sorry.

455
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,341
Well

456
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,416
you'll cut again,
I'll dance again.

457
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,502
We're both fighters, right?

458
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,184
I think you have
a far harder road.

459
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,509
But good luck with that.

460
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,489
No, no wheelchair.

461
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,527
I'll be walking out of
here on my own two feet.

462
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,249
In my career, I've found that

463
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,325
patients need to be
honest with themselves

464
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,774
about the prognosis.

465
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,028
And only then can they truly
plan for what the future holds.

466
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,190
Okay. It's a good point.

467
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:12,594
Based on what I
saw this morning,

468
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,526
you will never
likely operate again,

469
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,954
but you're honest
with yourself about that.

470
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:19,268
Right?

471
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,292
Fine motor skills.

472
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:24,628
You couldn't even put one
block on top of another, so...

473
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,590
Good luck with that.

474
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,070
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey.

475
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,811
You have cirrhosis of the liver

476
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:42,221
and we need to find out why.

477
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,959
You already said
you're not a drinker.

478
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,794
- Just tea and seltzer. It's all I do.
- Okay.

479
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,152
Um, have you ever had a
hep B or hep C infection?

480
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,299
No, not that I know of.

481
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,633
When you first thought
you had Huntington's,

482
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,398
what were the signs?

483
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,347
I started to be
clumsy all of the time

484
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,221
and then came the fatigue

485
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,477
and the memory loss,
difficulty swallowing.

486
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:05,836
I remember very similar symptoms
when they started with my dad.

487
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,650
And this is a new one

488
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,274
that happens more
and more all the time.

489
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,321
Josko said it looks like

490
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,011
- I'm trying to fly away.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,824
- Put your arms up like this for me?
- Yeah, yeah.

492
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,699
Yeah, just a little
higher. Higher, higher.

493
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:18,015
Yeah.

494
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,517
There we go.

495
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:26,932
Who diagnosed your
Huntington's, Megan?

496
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:28,192
I did.

497
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:29,788
Was it ever
confirmed by a doctor?

498
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,587
No, but I know what I have.

499
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:34,365
There's not really a
treatment, so, like...

500
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:36,753
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, hey, hey.

501
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,610
- Hey.
- It's okay. It's okay.

502
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,298
Hey, Josko, I

503
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,726
need to run some more
tests. I'll be right back.

504
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,874
Okay. Hi.

505
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,168
Hey, baby. Yeah?

506
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,400
All right. You see the
tear in the right atrium?

507
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,366
That's why he
wouldn't stop bleeding.

508
00:25:55,912 --> 00:25:57,440
Hey.

509
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:00,057
Do you feel any ambiguity
as we try to save the life

510
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,134
of the man who
nearly killed Nic?

511
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:03,822
Oddly, I don't.

512
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:07,751
Once they're in our OR, I
focus on the task at hand.

513
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,401
2-0 Prolene and pledgets.

514
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:12,385
Would you like me
to scrub in here?

515
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:16,907
I do not have time to teach
you over this particular heart.

516
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,170
She can watch over my shoulder.

517
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,819
Suit yourself.

518
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,915
Dr. Okafor, you're
needed in the lobby.

519
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,417
Tell them I'm in surgery.

520
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,513
They said that it's urgent.

521
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:30,963
Somebody from the medical board.

522
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,676
Go.

523
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,971
I can handle this.

524
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:44,121
So, it looks like today
is your lucky day.

525
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,519
Go scrub in.

526
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,359
Hey.

527
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,592
Are you all right?

528
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,668
I'm actually doing a bit better.

529
00:26:58,692 --> 00:26:59,970
Yeah.

530
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,577
How are you?

531
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,269
Honestly, I'm not great.

532
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,313
I don't know what
to do with this anger.

533
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,670
I want to kill the guy
for what he did to you.

534
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:15,382
But, you know, we
have each other.

535
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,135
We have our baby.

536
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,305
And this man who hurt us

537
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,402
is going to spend the
rest of his life in prison.

538
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,884
So...

539
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,315
How did you get to this place?

540
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,796
I had, um, an interesting,

541
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,405
difficult conversation
with Billie earlier.

542
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,576
But we can talk
about that later.

543
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,317
- Dr. Okafor.
- Yes.

544
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,060
Shamus O'Reilly,
Georgia Medical Board.

545
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:58,844
I'm here to inform you
that an investigation

546
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,512
is underway that could put
your medical license in jeopardy.

547
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:03,349
I have a few questions to
ask you, if you don't mind.

548
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:05,869
Were you ever
romantically involved with

549
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,184
a Micah Stevens?

550
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:09,103
I believe he was
a patient of yours.

551
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,575
I will take that as a yes.

552
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,025
And are you currently
in a relationship

553
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:17,653
with your attending, AJ Austin?

554
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:20,531
So... yes again.

555
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,016
Do you or did you
ever run a medical clinic

556
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,927
out of your home?

557
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,207
I need to speak to my lawyer
before this goes any further.

558
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,926
That is your right.

559
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,601
I will set the time for
an interview under oath.

560
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:36,088
Here's the file that we built
on you so you can prepare.

561
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,496
Perhaps ask more
pointed questions

562
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,549
as they're
completing the survey.

563
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,551
Did their doctor explain
their treatment plan?

564
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,720
Are they clear on their
discharge instructions?

565
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,995
But I'm hoping for
something more substantial.

566
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,873
Okay. Thanks, Caitlin.

567
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,584
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

568
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:15,753
You look tired.
Please, sit down.

569
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,570
No, I'm not tired at all.

570
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,631
But if you insist...

571
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,172
Based on what I saw
this morning, Barrett,

572
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,027
it's clear your road to recovery

573
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,696
- is going to be long and hard.
- No, that's not true.

574
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,996
I'll be right back in
the OR in no time.

575
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:35,751
Not in one of my ORs.

576
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,586
I think it's only fair to warn
you that I'm going to start

577
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,351
interviewing for
someone to replace you.

578
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,445
We need a top neurosurgeon.

579
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:43,781
Without one, the whole
department will fail

580
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,260
and that's an outcome

581
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,452
- I can't accept.
- You can count on me.

582
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:47,618
Just give me about a month

583
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:49,097
to prove that I
can get back fast.

584
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,715
I'm very sorry,
Barrett, but I can't.

585
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:54,291
It's not just your
uncertain physical recovery

586
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,084
that's troubling
me, it's your attitude.

587
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,682
The way you acted this
morning is not something I want

588
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,985
or expect from a doctor
at the new Chastain.

589
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,009
That's fair.

590
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:04,968
I was out of line then.

591
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,300
Just give me another chance.

592
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:08,955
I'm willing to watch and see

593
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,308
how you do personally
and physically.

594
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,238
I won't write you off yet,

595
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,813
but I have to be honest.

596
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:17,575
At this moment,

597
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,984
I see no place for
you at Chastain.

598
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,538
What can I do here?

599
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,879
Nothing. I will let you know.

600
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,232
He's losing pressure.

601
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:45,152
If we can't control the bleed,
we need to put him on pump.

602
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,723
All right. There was a
tear in the right atrium.

603
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,391
It was repaired, but
now there's another.

604
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,623
And I can't slow down

605
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,082
to talk you through every move.

606
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:00,511
Time is of the essence.

607
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,138
I actually work
better in silence.

608
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:03,962
Yeah, we'll see about
that. Hand me a cl

609
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:06,590
clamp.

610
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:12,054
Retractors.

611
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,362
There it is.

612
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:18,977
It's right there.

613
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:21,355
2-0 Prolene.

614
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,651
All right. There we go.

615
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,532
There it is.

616
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,494
That should hold.

617
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,290
That's a pretty
impressive OR debut

618
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,085
for our surgical intern, no?

619
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,523
There may be hope for you yet.

620
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,154
- Do you mind if I...
- Yes.

621
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,388
You may close.

622
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:06,149
Come on, the
suspense is killing us.

623
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:10,654
You have Kayser-Fleischer rings.

624
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,489
And that, that is good news?

625
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,585
- Yeah. Yeah, it is good news.
- Yeah?

626
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:17,347
It's a diagnostic of
Wilson's disease.

627
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,809
It's a rare, inherited
disorder that causes copper

628
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,167
to accumulate in your liver,
brain and other vital organs.

629
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,652
It's often missed
or misdiagnosed

630
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,507
- as something else.
- Like Huntington's?

631
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,676
Yes.

632
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,440
That motion you made
with your arm, Megan,

633
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,180
is pretty specific to Wilson's.

634
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,943
I need to run some
more tests to confirm,

635
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:43,164
but I'm feeling really
confident that Wilson's disease

636
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,763
is causing all of your symptoms,

637
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:48,191
and you do not
have Huntington's.

638
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,027
But how bad is Wilson's disease?

639
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,007
It's serious,
but it's treatable.

640
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,422
Wait, so

641
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:58,035
my death sentence
has been commuted?

642
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:00,019
It looks that way.

643
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,591
We'll give you
medications to help

644
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,301
rid your body of
the excess copper.

645
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:06,618
And we'll monitor
your liver function,

646
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,732
but

647
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,734
all of your
neurological symptoms

648
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,032
that you've been experiencing

649
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,905
they should all vastly improve.

650
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,895
God, we got married so fast
'cause I had an expiration date.

651
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,899
- Are you sure you still want...
- Do you think that I want to be a widower?

652
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,692
I was looking forward to that?

653
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,739
We now have a
whole lifetime together.

654
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:42,496
We definitely have
to go to Salem.

655
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,248
And Transylvania.

656
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,583
And Paris has catacombs.

657
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:48,137
I've always wanted
to see a catacomb.

658
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,462
We're gonna see a catacomb.

659
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,070
I'm glad you stayed today.

660
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,571
Me, too.

661
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,648
It can't have been
easy being here.

662
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:01,598
I know how much
you miss Chastain.

663
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,121
I know you wish your
career was back where it was.

664
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,678
I can't lie.

665
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,439
I wanted so much
to be a neurosurgeon.

666
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,942
It's a terrible loss, but
I brought it on myself.

667
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:16,020
You ever think about trying
to get your residency back?

668
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,280
Like that would ever happen.

669
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:19,377
I wouldn't be so sure.

670
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,263
Kit, this is Billie Sutton,

671
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,140
the neurosurgery resident
I was telling you about.

672
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,176
Billie, this is Kit
Voss, our new CEO.

673
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,127
Can you spare a minute to talk?

674
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,632
When I was a second-year
surgery resident,

675
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:38,284
I told a twit of an attending
to shove a meniscal probe

676
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,565
up his... well, you know.

677
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,567
And there were
worse transgressions.

678
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,808
There's good and
bad to your story.

679
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,309
That's not unusual.

680
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:48,123
And although the bad is very bad

681
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:52,482
- I cost a man his life.
- You overestimated your skill.

682
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,595
You crossed a line you
should never have crossed

683
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,820
and your patient
paid the ultimate price.

684
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,802
But you published some stellar
papers and your mentor reviews

685
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,513
- were second to none.
- Yeah. Most of them.

686
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,745
Stop arguing against yourself.

687
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,499
My neurosurgery department
is dying since we became

688
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:11,929
a public hospital.

689
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,628
You were one of the best.

690
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,841
And I believe in second chances.

691
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:19,604
I don't know what to say.

692
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:23,441
I'd like to reinstate your
residency on a trial basis.

693
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:25,182
A month, then we reassess.

694
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,643
Are you interested
in joining our team?

695
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,396
Say yes, Billie.

696
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,107
Yes.

697
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,584
Good.

698
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,128
Hey.

699
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:46,352
Sorry I couldn't make it back.

700
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,467
It's all good. Leela was
surprisingly excellent.

701
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:51,394
What did the medical board want?

702
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,003
To inform me that
I'm under investigation.

703
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,455
Investigation for what?

704
00:36:57,607 --> 00:36:59,477
The clinic I ran in my home,

705
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:03,553
for dating a patient,
Micah, and for dating you.

706
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,797
It's Cain. It has to be.

707
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:08,203
No one else would
leak that information.

708
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,321
I can't confront him.

709
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:13,449
I have no proof,
but I'm sure it's him.

710
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:16,419
He's out for revenge.

711
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,401
AJ, I could lose
my medical license.

712
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:21,238
A-And your chance for a visa.

713
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,668
I don't know what's worse,

714
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:26,337
being deported or
not being a doctor.

715
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,057
Listen to me, Mina.

716
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:32,415
You are not going anywhere.

717
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:35,043
You hear me?

718
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,938
I know I was hard
on you earlier.

719
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:56,960
It is my job to help you.

720
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,254
You didn't have
all the information

721
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,185
that would have made
my mistakes make sense.

722
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,764
My entire life I've
wanted to be a surgeon,

723
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:08,785
despite knowing I have one
big obstacle to overcome.

724
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:10,954
You're dyslexic.

725
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,435
You've kept the
secret fairly well.

726
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,388
I had a friend in med
school who was dyslexic

727
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:20,275
and he also drew
patients' anatomy

728
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,393
to make sense of it.

729
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,113
Which is why I
did well in the OR.

730
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,636
But when I have to
do something new

731
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:30,515
without preparation,
it's a challenge.

732
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,550
So I over prepare.

733
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,218
I arrive hours
before anyone else,

734
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,532
I review CT reports
multiple times, writing down

735
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,723
key information to
fully comprehend it.

736
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,579
And you have to work twice
as hard as everyone else.

737
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,798
I do poorly on written exams.

738
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,490
So I didn't get an interview
at most residencies.

739
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,514
In fact, the only reason I'm
here is my mentor convinced

740
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,592
Dr. Voss to give me a chance.

741
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:58,818
Look, I'm glad that it
is clear between us.

742
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,505
And I will keep your secret
if that's what you want.

743
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,435
But moving forward,

744
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,437
make me understand
how I can help you.

745
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,823
Well, I don't want to
be treated differently.

746
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,556
I have to be as good
as any other resident.

747
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,725
Done.

748
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:28,756
Hey. Are those from

749
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:30,702
- the patient appreciation booth?
- What can I say?

750
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,296
Once a resident
always a resident.

751
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,705
I see free food, I
cannot help myself.

752
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:38,541
My policy, too,

753
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:40,396
until free sushi
ruined a long weekend.

754
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:44,005
Is that the princess?

755
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,268
Princess Nadine.

756
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,884
Yeah, yeah, she, called earlier,

757
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,429
said she was back in town
and that she had a surprise.

758
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,976
Pravesh, this is...

759
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:01,606
Is that little prince your son?

760
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,397
Brother, I've got to admit,

761
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:26,071
you have put me in a
vendetta kind of mood.

762
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:31,814
A rare, special
brand of pissed off,

763
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,984
and I find myself with some
inspired ways to make you pay

764
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:37,559
for what you're
doing to Mina Okafor.

765
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,419
Excuse you.

766
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,700
No.

767
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:45,294
You don't have to run
away from me, Barrett.

768
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,152
I won't hurt you, baby.

769
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,530
Not yet.

770
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,211
See, I had an epiphany,

771
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,431
and the irony is way too sweet.

772
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,383
You're gonna walk away
from me, take the elevator

773
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:03,938
to the penthouse,
where you will settle in

774
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,223
at rock bottom.

775
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:10,467
And I have no interest
in punching down.

776
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,453
You ruining Mina's
life and career

777
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,380
will not heal you, Barrett.

778
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:19,976
If anything, you will
sink to a new low.

779
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,623
- She tried to destroy me.
- No.

780
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,793
She called you out
for all the right reasons.

781
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,486
And you're trying to destroy
her for all the wrong reasons.

782
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:32,175
And now I hear even
Kit thinks there's no seat

783
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,990
for you at our table.

784
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:37,744
But as far as I'm concerned,
that's not punishment enough.

785
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:41,664
Fix it, Barrett.

786
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,750
Now.

787
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,753
If you don't.

788
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:51,049
I'm coming for you.

789
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:58,014
You hear me?

790
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,353
And you won't walk away from me

791
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:06,481
ever again.

792
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,557
Yeah, it's Barrett.

793
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,451
I want you to ease
up on Mina Okafor.

794
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:45,540
Drop the whole thing
now, the hearing,

795
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:48,398
the challenge to
the visa, all of it.

796
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:50,160
Sorry, Barrett.

797
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,718

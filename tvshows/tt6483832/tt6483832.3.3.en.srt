1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:03,912
- Previously on The Resident...
- How did you get this place?

2
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:07,037
Are you sure right now is the
right time to make this move?

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,383
I've never been so sure.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,868
- Remind me why I hired you.
- Your last assistant quit,

5
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,295
and my dad is Zip Betournay.

6
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:14,038
He owns the Crystal Springs golf club.

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,756
I can find you a
smoking hot date tonight.

8
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,117
I-I have someone in mind.

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,042
My ex-husband is so hard on Grayson,

10
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:22,663
but I'm proud of him. He's a good son.

11
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:25,475
I can't let Jessie go without
knowing what really happened.

12
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,999
Please, just take a look at this.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,782
It's Jessie's medical records. I just,

14
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,721
I just want to know that
nothing terrible happened,

15
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,897
everything was done right.

16
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:37,651
- It's a terrible idea.
- Oh, come on, just play along.

17
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,285
We live under the same roof now.

18
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,363
- Which is amazing.
- Agreed,

19
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:43,135
but people get on each other's nerves,

20
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:46,086
which is why I'm proposing that
we both get to pick one thing

21
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,598
that drives the other one crazy.

22
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,715
Only one?

23
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,332
Cute. Yes.

24
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,324
And we both try to quell the thing

25
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:55,276
in an effort to live happily ever after.

26
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,587
- Fine.
- Good. You go first.

27
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,581
- Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.

28
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,415
Go ahead.

29
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:10,962
You do this-this thing when you eat.

30
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,215
What?

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,762
Mmm.

32
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,955
Mmm...

33
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,790
Mmm. Mmm!

34
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,829
- And that annoys you?
- You have no idea.

35
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,754
- I just like food.
- This is why I didn't want to do it.

36
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,295
All right, fine, yeah. No, you're right.

37
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,414
I can totally enjoy my food silently.

38
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,716
My turn.

39
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:35,193
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" is right.

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,691
Receiving reports of a
high-speed police chase

41
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:41,860
in Midtown Atlanta
involving two suspects

42
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,195
believed to be armed.

43
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:45,480
Drivers in the affected
area are being urged

44
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,802
to stay off the roads.

45
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:49,151
Pursuit is heading north on Peachtree.

46
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,517
We have a problem.

47
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,830
You hang on.

48
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,640
Hey, you stay the hell awake.

49
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,216
If you keep driving like this,

50
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,334
you're gonna die with me, brother.

51
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,619
Ain't nobody gonna die today.

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,213
That's good. Don't want yours
to be the last face I see.

53
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:23,683
Almost...

54
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,977
Hey, you hang on.

55
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,178
A few more seconds, okay?

56
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,949
Listen up! We have a Code Silver.

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,951
We need to lock the ER down now!

58
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:36,171
Get everybody out of
here now. Let's go. Hurry.

59
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,415
Ashley, come with me.

60
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,491
The driver's armed.

61
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,435
Okay, security, lock
these two doors down,

62
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:45,228
- and nobody else in or out.
- Hey!

63
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:48,054
Quickly and quietly come this way.

64
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:49,530
- Let's go. This way,
- Come on, come on, come on...

65
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,742
in an organized fashion.

66
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:52,414
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, quickly.

67
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,369
- Everybody, get back!
- Let's go.

68
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,358
- I need help!
- Go, go.

69
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,187
I'm a cop, he's not.

70
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,196
I need him alive!

71
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,764
Open up!

72

73
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,504
Detective Al Raines,

74
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,965
Atlanta PD. FYI, I'm fine.

75
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,425
Yeah, with all that adrenaline going,

76
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,702
Detective, you might
not feel your injuries.

77
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,863
It's almost over, you son of a bitch.

78
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:31,199
- I got your ass.
- Oh, you just stay tuned, Albie.

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,967
- You stay tuned.
- You brought him here.

80
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,261
He's in our hands now. You
need to trust us. All right?

81
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:38,587
Let's go over here. You can
keep an eye on him from there.

82
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:41,156
- All right?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:42,565
I'll trust you.

84
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,917
Just make sure your
doctors don't trust him.

85
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:46,945
Can you bring me a lac tray? Thank you.

86
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,328
Ain't no soul in that man.

87
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,662
He runs a crew.

88
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,879
They do high-end home invasions.

89
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,831
Break in, tie up the family,
steal everything.

90
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,565
Sometimes they let the people go.

91
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,617
Other times, maybe the homeowner catches

92
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,994
a glimpse of a face they shouldn't,

93
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,244
they execute 'em.

94
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:03,990
No mercy.

95
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,807
All right, everyone be careful.

96
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,815
Can you tell me your name?

97
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,130
Hey, Albie? They want to know my name.

98
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,581
Hey, you come on over here.

99
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,286
I'll show you where to find your name.

100
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,863
Airways intact. Decreased
breath sounds on the left.

101
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,648
Got a tip earlier today.

102
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,749
Caught Rob and his crew in the act.

103
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,333
I cornered that bastard.

104
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,243
Yeah, you sure did some damage.

105
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,177
After he impaled himself,

106
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,366
I thought he might die
right there on the spot.

107
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,076
Got him here as fast as I could.

108
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,978
The rest of Rob's crew got away.

109
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,451
They took the homeowner with them.

110
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,269
60-year-old grandfather.

111
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,141
It's only a matter of
time before they realize

112
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,217
they don't need that hostage anymore.

113
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,747
Rob knows where his crew is hiding out.

114
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,616
He's got to tell me where
they are soon, otherwise...

115
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:57,818
Damn it.

116
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,293
- Hey!
- Detective!

117
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,698
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Give it back!

118
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,048
- Back up!
- Hey!

119
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,013
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

120
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:05,822
- Give it up!
- Back up, man.

121
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,463
- Let him go, let him go.
- I got it.

122
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,820
We're good. Good.

123
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,261
You enjoy that, Albie.

124
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:13,337
It's the last thing you're
ever gonna get from me.

125
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,989
Okay, let's get him to CT carefully

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,291
and let's call the OR and
let them know we're coming.

127
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,198
Chaz, hold down the fort. I
need to see another patient.

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,444
Devon, tag me back in

129
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,504
if you need help with
our detective friend.

00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,020

- Thanks for stopping by.
- Didn't really have a choice.

139
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,014
Heard how your little
chess game with Dr. Bell

140
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,800
got you the funds for your clinic.

141
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,226
Well done.

142
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,594
- Thank you.
- Clock my surgical board.

143
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,286
It's a full slate.

144
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,003
I'd like for you to work with me today,

145
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:05,172
run pre-op on all my surgical patients.

146
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,298
Why me?

147
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,376
'Cause I demand the
best, and that's you.

148
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,898
So ride with me through
the first wave of surgeries

149
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,442
and you can bail
anytime after that, or...

150
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:19,273
force me to find a more
cunning way to make that happen.

151
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,090
Uh, that won't be necessary.

152
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,317
I'm sure one day in neuro won't kill me.

153
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:25,377
Or will it?

154
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,938
No, construction business is no joke.

155
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,071
You know, every step
is a fall or a break

156
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:35,660
or a shot to the ass, in my case.

157
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,125
I'm seeing you got shot
with a nail gun at work.

158
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:41,432
- Who'd you piss off?
- Self-inflicted.

159
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,883
Yeah, I'm a clumsy oaf.

160
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,470
Took two to the left cheek,

161
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,649
which threw me off-balance
and I tumbled off

162
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,156
the second floor scaffolding.

163
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,508
Wounds got infected and my antibiotics

164
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,548
jacked up my kidneys real good.

165
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,679
- So that's why you're on dialysis?
- Yeah.

166
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,371
They say my kidneys are bouncing back.

167
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:59,214
And I was feeling pretty good
until these damn migraines

168
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:01,233
kicked in the last couple days.

169
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,831
Any other pain?

170
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:05,714
No.

171
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:09,367
- Dizziness?
- No, but, Doc...

172
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:11,995
much as I dig it here,
I think I'd really prefer

173
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:13,515
something for this migraine pain.

174
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,542
- Mm-hmm.
- ASAP, so I can get back to my work site.

175
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:19,523
My guys got to pull the extra
load if I'm not there, so...

176
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,893
Well, I'm gonna run a test panel,

177
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,540
make sure everything's okay,
and then we'll go from there.

178
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,309
- Good?
- Good.

179
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,287
Make yourself comfortable.

180
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,697
Be careful, Doc.

181
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,909
You make things too nice,
I may never leave.

182
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,621
This isn't an herbal
or energy supplement.

183
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,675
It's not a daily vitamin.

184
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,824
It's all three.

185
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,814
The best nutritional scientists
in the country helped craft

186
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:47,657
this groundbreaking product.

187
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,902
Six years

188
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,498
and every disposable dime
I had is on this table.

189
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,408
Put the Chastain name on the product,

190
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,844
give me your brand in
marketing, and together

191
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:04,406
we will sell millions
of units, guaranteed.

192
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:10,513
I'm sorry, this isn't real medicine.

193
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:14,878
I get it.

194
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,887
The supplement business is littered

195
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,703
with con artists selling snake oil,

196
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:22,361
and they are cleaning up
in a $122 billion industry.

197
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:24,104
It is the Wild, Wild West out there,

198
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,210
and supplements aren't
regulated by the FDA.

199
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,515
Look, I get that this is
outside of your comfort zone,

200
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,366
but you can trust me.

201
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,779
My products are the real deal.

202
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,707
All I'm asking is for
you to give me a chance.

203
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,214
You know, a hospital like Chastain

204
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:45,623
can only associate itself

205
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,340
with the highest
standard of medical care.

206
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,109
And we don't take chances.

207
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,466
Thank you.

208
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:07,094
Steady. I want him in
the OR in one piece.

209
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,302
How bad is it, fellas? Talk to me.

210
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:11,557
- Detective, we got this. Relax.
- Not possible.

211
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,583
I'm coming with you.

212
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,202
Time to fight the law and win, Pravesh.

213
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,520
You're not allowed in the OR.
Go back to the ER for observation.

214
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,656
Hey, I don't need observation!

215
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:21,317
Detective, if you keep
following us, I will call security.

216
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:23,626
I have had ICE removed, I
will have you removed, too.

217
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,686
Intern don't play.

218
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,664
He's in V-fib.

219
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,399
Okay, I got no pulse. Yeah,
we need to start CPR right now.

220
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,184
Get these cuffs off. We can't roll him

221
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,965
onto his back or move the impalement.

222
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,350
All right, let's start
compressions from both sides.

223
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,285
- Me and you, Pravesh.
- Let's go.

224
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,315
Easy, guys.

225
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,650
Better.

226
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,168
Let's go!

227
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:55,009
Remember, Docs, he dies,

228
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,172
hostage dies.

229
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,350
- He's crashing again.
- All right, back at it.

230
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,158
Do we have code meds?

231
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,373
What he needs is blood.

232
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,666
- He's been down too long.
- Okay, he's coding.

233
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,594
Chu, you know what to do.

234
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,671
- Drape and intubate.
- You got it.

235
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:20,765
Nurse, take my place.
Nolan, scrub room with me.

236
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,735
I'm in. Hang two units
of O neg and start pressors.

237
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:29,170
All right, let's go.
On my count? One, two, three.

238
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:33,889
Get his back.

239
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,528
Guy's got a steel bar
rammed through his chest.

240
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,656
Mostly, you don't survive that.

241
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:42,534
Adjust the attitude.
It's my OR, my outcome,

242
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,203
and I say he lives.

243
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,255
Aye, aye.

244
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,518
Come on, Pravesh, I
need a living patient.

245
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,477
I cannot operate on dead people.

246
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:54,597
Well, I suppose I could, but why bother?

247
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,691
Holding compressions. Pulse check.

248
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,104
Sinus tach. Strong carotid pulse.

249
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:04,723
Congratulations, Pravesh.
You just saved the life

250
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:07,944
of a truly detestable human being.

251
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:08,945
Ten blade.

252
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,448
Make this quick, Doc.

253
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,126
I'm gonna be at Rob Spiro's bedside

254
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:16,044
the moment he comes out of surgery.

255
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,661
Did you take any blows to the chest?

256
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,698
Did three tours in Afghanistan.

257
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,366
IED blew up my Humvee.

258
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,551
Couldn't hear for a week.

259
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:27,871
Think I went to see a doctor? Not once.

260
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,465
It's called strength of character.

261
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:33,419
Yeah, I did two tours myself,

262
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,732
and anytime I have health
issues, I still see a doctor.

263
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,324
It's called not being an idiot.

264
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,646
What unit?

265
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,598
Navy corpsman. Third
Battalion Seventh Marines.

266
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,151
Battle of Sangin.

267
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:52,287
Heard that was a hell
of a time, brother.

268
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,438
You have any head pain?

269
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,209
You're damn right I do.

270
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,220
He hit me in the head
with a two-by-four.

271
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,531
Squeeze my fingers.

272
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,282
Ah. Doc, not with this one.

273
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,259
He stepped on my hand twice here.

274
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:10,613
I'm sending you for a CT scan.

275
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,707
No. Not a chance.

276
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,954
You may have life-threatening injuries.

277
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:17,203
In order to do my job,
I need more information

278
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,462
than just a standard exam.

279
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,028
Nah.

280
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,745
All right.

281
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,828
How about we start with
an X-ray of your hand?

282
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,056
They're cheap and fast.

283
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:31,134
And it will help me with
the diagnosis, brother.

284
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,894
Hey.

285
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,421
They're deep into Spiro's surgery.

286
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,806
He's touch and go.

287
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:39,876
If I didn't need information from him,

288
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:41,403
I'd tell your guys to let him perish.

289
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,646
It doesn't work that way around here.

290
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,815
Oh, yeah? How's it work?

291
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:49,152
Saints, sinners, and
everything in between.

292
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,477
We treat them all.

293
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,771
It doesn't matter what they've done

294
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,113
before they come through our doors.

295
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:55,423
You don't care about their past.

296
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,276
I have to care about the future.

297
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,736
Another few hours pass,

298
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,942
some bad guys with an innocent
man are gonna realize

299
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:03,833
they could run a lot
faster without a hostage.

300
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,002
That happens, they'll put him down

301
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,337
like a dog.

302
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,122
Please, do whatever you need to do

303
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,920
so I can get what I need.

304
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,221
That way, nobody else has to die.

305
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,638
I'm so sorry.

306
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,917
This is embarrassing. I don't
know why I'm crying.

307
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,908
Because you're human and you're scared.

308
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:36,148
I mean... spine surgery.

309
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,626
On my spine.

310
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,318
All those nerves.

311
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,510
It's dangerous and I
don't want to do it.

312
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,828
I don't.

313
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,391
But the pain and weakness,

314
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,101
and I miss my life, but...

315
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:52,286
One step at a time, okay? Here.

316
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,054
This is your MRI.

317
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,965
See the narrowing right here.

318
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,676
It's putting pressure
on your spinal cord.

319
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,636
It's called spinal stenosis,
and what Dr. Cain wants to do

320
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,991
is a very common procedure

321
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,565
called a laminectomy.

322
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,316
That's just gonna open up some space.

323
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,494
Only takes about an hour,

324
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,570
and I'll be there to make
sure everything runs

325
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,571
as smoothly as it can.

326
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,061
Your surgery's at 4:15, so I'll
probably have someone come up

327
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:21,005
about a half hour before
to take you to the OR.

328
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:23,579
Thank you for taking
the time to tell me.

329
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,865
Sorry, fog... frog in my throat.

330
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,251
How long have you had that?

331
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:30,035
Last month or so.

332
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,538
Hmm.

333
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,542
Do you have any blurred
vision? Difficulty swallowing?

334
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,837
Yes. Is that a problem?

335
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,506
It could be. Let me talk to Dr. Cain.

336
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,430
You hang in there, okay?

337
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,553
I will be with you the
whole way, I promise.

338
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,712
♪ Get busy... ♪

339
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:51,390
Up, down, up, down, up.

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,149
All right. To the right. Come on.

341
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,446
Elbow to knee. Let's go, guys. Yup.

342
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,691
Weight on your heels. Let's go.

343
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,374
Set of eight. Let's go.

344
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,086
All right, you know what?

345
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,071
Let's, um, let's take
a five-minute break.

346
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,302
Stretch, hydrate, and we're back, okay?

347
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,460
Good work.

348
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,053
If you are here to scold me

349
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:13,796
about fake medicine,
you can save your breath.

350
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,281
I'm broke. All right?

351
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,465
The business is finished.
I'm dissolving the company.

352
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:18,934
Your supplements have potential.

353
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,681
You killed my pitch.

354
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,235
You said Chastain doesn't take chances.

355
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:29,595
They don't. I do.

356
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,906
I'm the one who brought you
to the board this afternoon,

357
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,224
and they were captivated

358
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,100
by your passion, your confidence,

359
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,911
your obvious intellect.

360
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:40,272
Your presentation was
flawless. I'm not surprised.

361
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,177
You used me as a test case.

362
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:43,918
You do not want to be in business

363
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,153
with Chastain and Red Rock.

364
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,614
They think of profit-sharing
as a chronic disease.

365
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,832
They will shake your hand,

366
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,354
then drive a knife in
your back at the same time.

367
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,321
Listen, Andrea, I've spent the last year

368
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,789
educating myself on
the world of supplements

369
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,981
and, specifically, your company.

370
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:00,569
I watch its every move,

371
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,772
and unfortunately you've been
walking into the wrong rooms.

372
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:06,298
There's nowhere left to go.

373
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,691
You're out of gas.

374
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,682
What are you proposing?

375
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,430
The amazing qualities you
already bring to the table

376
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,862
plus my face

377
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:17,222
and the name Dr. Randolph Bell,

378
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,531
CEO and Chief of Surgery

379
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,607
on the label of millions of bottles

380
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:22,709
of our supplements.

381
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,535
♪ You know me, you know me ♪

382

383
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,707
Rick.

384
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,784
Hate to kick you out of this plush room,

385
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,362
but all your tests came back negative.

386
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,679
So, you got, uh,

387
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,004
normal electrolytes,
normal blood counts.

388
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,254
You got a history of migraines,

389
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,495
uh, this is presenting as another one.

390
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:42,793
I know that's not fun, but if you

391
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,050
can handle a nail gun to the ass,

392
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,733
you can handle this.

393
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,716
Hey, kidding aside, that's a relief.

394
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,976
With my dialysis,

395
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,986
I was starting to think
maybe it was something else,

396
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:54,680
- but...
- Yeah, well, I'll write you a prescription,

397
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,399
- should help you out with your migraines.
- Hey.

398
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,784
- Thanks a bunch, Dr. Hawkins.
- All right, my pleasure.

399
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,074
Rick? Rick?

400
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,792
Code Blue!

401
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,363
Code Blue, room 5417.

402
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,300
- I need some help in here!
- Code Blue, room 5417.

403
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,334
Oh, my God.

404
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,727
What happened to my patient?

405
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,173
Complaining of migraines,

406
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,527
tests came back negative, then he coded.

407
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:36,197
- Any new medications?
- Just on all the standard stuff.

408
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,015
Doxazosin, a statin,

409
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,517
- an EPO med.
- Could you have missed something?

410
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,037
Maybe you need to ask
yourself that question.

411
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,476
That's exactly what I've been doing...

412
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,006
Because he received spotless
care under my supervision.

413
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:48,877
- Well, something went wrong.
- What are you implying, Dr. Hawkins?

414
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,794
I just want answers.

415
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,698
We'll get them soon enough.

416
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,604
- Have you seen Dr. Cain?
- Uh-huh.

417
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,308
Are you here just to watch him?

418
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,482
Is that so wrong?

419
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:23,227
Nurse Sally watched
him yesterday, twice.

420
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,896
Dr. Cain?

421
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,979
You haven't sealed off the aneurysm yet.

422
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,583
Place an 8.6-millimeter coil.

423
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,588
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you

424
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:34,928
about your pre-op patient, Mia Danvers.

425
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,149
Okay, go ahead, but hurry.

426
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,927
I think she may have something
other than spinal stenosis.

427
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,412
No, Rodriguez, you need more stability.

428
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,123
Add an interbody spacer to
the posterior vertebral body.

429
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,009
And you completed seven years
of neurosurgery residency?

430
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,937
I'm a nurse practitioner.

431
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:52,065
Yes, exactly, and why
is a nurse practitioner

432
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,757
trying to re-diagnose my patient?

433
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,062
Full stop. You recruited
me to work on your unit.

434
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,690
Mia Danvers has atypical symptoms.

435
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,772
I want to run some tests.

436
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,448
This is all healthy brain
tissue. Good margins.

437
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,674
Nice work, Timmons.

438
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,118
You can run as many tests as you like.

439
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,364
Mia Danvers will be on my
table in OR One at 4:15.

440
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,792
Dr. Cain, do you always
let your residents operate

441
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:12,460
when you're not in the room?

442
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,461
Dr. Meyer, call Admitting.

443
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,494
I am there for the crucial
part of each surgery.

444
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,138
Always?

445
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:26,506
My residents are second to none.
They rarely make mistakes.

446
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:29,983
And if they do, yes, I'm
always there to correct them.

447
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:32,487
So have no fear, Nurse Nevin.

448
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,547
All is well.

449
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:49,980
Do I detect notes of mango and chia?

450
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,649
A delightful hint of acai?

451
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,319
They say it increases stamina.

452
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,474
Yeah, but, I mean, is that,
like, scientifically proven?

453
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,504
Proof's not required.

454
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:01,609
People believe what
they want to believe.

455
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,344
The placebo effect works.

456
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:07,181
If you think that acai will
give you an energy boost,

457
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,457
chances are,

458
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,760
it will.

459
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,139
But why you?

460
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,430
I mean, you're already,
like, a top dog doctor.

461
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,751
I mean, you're Dr. freaking Bell.

462
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,861
You ever heard of the amazing Dr. Oz?

463
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,845
Yeah, sure.

464
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,347
Dr. Sanjay Gupta?

465
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,709
The-the dude on CNN.
Yeah, I love that guy.

466
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,723
Before you walked through
the doors of Chastain,

467
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:30,112
had you ever heard of Dr. Randolph Bell?

468
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,874
No.

469
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,584
They're household names, I'm not.

470
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,957
But a $5 million investment
will get me in the game.

471
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,184
So we need to find someone close

472
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,427
with very deep pockets.

473
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:49,158
That's, uh, kind of steep, Dr. B.

474
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:50,921
I mean, who would pony
up that kind of cash?

475
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:54,711
I'm gonna give you a hint.
Who do we both know

476
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,147
who's local, wealthy,
and has capital to spare?

477
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,357
Who has offices in Buckhead

478
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,088
and made his money
betting on risky ventures?

479
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,742
Who contributed half your DNA?

480
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:10,795
Oh, my-my pops! My dad.

481
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:12,951
- Ah.
- Set up a meeting, stat.

482
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,664
Yeah, you got it, boss.

483
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:23,769
Hey.

484
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,838
- You okay?
- Yeah.

485
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,747
You don't look okay.

486
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,265
What's up?

487
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:36,281
A patient of mine...

488
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:39,025
everything seemed fine.

489
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,960
Was about to discharge
him, and then he just...

490
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,527
coded.

491
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:48,181
No signs, no symptoms. Dead
before he hit the floor.

492
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,360
- I'm so sorry.
- I keep going over everything in my head.

493
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,078
What did I miss?

494
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,495
I have to figure out why.
Why-why did it happen?

495
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,610
You will. Here.

496
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:03,529
It's okay.

497
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:07,576
Here you go, sir.

498
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,874
Well, the good news is
your hand isn't broken.

499
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,321
- Hallelujah. I'm out of here, man.
- But...

500
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,211
something else must be
wrong, so I'm keeping you

501
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,222
in the hospital a little while
longer, run some more tests.

502
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,093
Doc. No. Come on.

503
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,985
You're being ridiculous, man.

504
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:26,132
I'm not discharging you
until I'm a hundred percent

505
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,655
positive you're okay.

506
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,164
You should call someone.

507
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,159
Get them to bring you
a change of clothes,

508
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,385
and you'll need a medical proxy.

509
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:33,569
Is it looking that
bad for me over there?

510
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,146
It's just standard protocol.

511
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,689
Aw, shh...

512
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,575
Damn, gonna be honest, man.

513
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,502
Besides an ex-wife and
a few drinking buddies,

514
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:44,038
nobody's gonna come bring
me a fresh pair of underwear.

515
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,489
You know...

516
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,798
or make no medical
decisions for me, man.

517
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,844
I've spent the last
five years thinking about

518
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,420
catching bad guys.

519
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:53,038
Especially the one you got in your OR

520
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,964
right now. Everything else, every...

521
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:58,298
everyone else became background noise.

522
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,190
You all right?

523
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:05,043
Look out. Can't see that good.

524
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:07,052
Around the edges.

525
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,271
Can I have a look?

526
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:10,405
Ah...

527
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:12,674
Nurse?

528
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,601
I need some fluids. He's hypotensive.

529
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,064
Hey, Detective.

530
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,357
Time to wake up.

531
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,544
Hey.

532
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:28,073
What the hell happened?

533
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,294
You passed out. You can
be mad at me all you want.

534
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,187
Keeping you in the hospital.

535
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,766
You're lucky to be alive, you know.

536
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,932
The cop said you once crammed yourself

537
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,608
underneath a kitchen sink for hours

538
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,831
during a home invasion.

539
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,403
That true?

540
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,463
Do you ever get pain in
your knees and joints?

541
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,915
Yeah. Always.

542
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,052
How'd you know that?

543
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:28,556
That hurt?

544
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,427
I don't feel it.

545
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,137
Elastic skin,

546
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,447
abnormal flexibility,

547
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,524
atrophic scars...

548
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,434
and pseudotumors.

549
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,787
I think you might have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

550
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:42,147
They call it the Stretch
Armstrong disease.

551
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,776
It is associated with aneurysms.

552
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,211
They can burst at any time.

553
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,631
Do you have kids?

554
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,493
A d... a daughter.

555
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,619
Why?

556
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,306
Ehlers-Danlos is genetic.

557
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:01,976
If she has aneurysms,
it can be very dangerous.

558
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,853
She's going to need
aggressive surveillance.

559
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:08,057
You mean she can die from it?

560
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,841
Yes.

561
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,469
But I can manage her care.

562
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,989
I'd like to see her.

563
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,850
I got no idea where she is.

564
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,162
I haven't spoken to her in ten years.

565
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:23,497
She wants nothing to do with me.

566
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:24,981
Do you have a phone number?

567
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,191
Mm.

568
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,859
How about a name?

569
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,402
I can track her down.

570
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:38,087
Everybody dies of something.

571
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:52,330
Intimal flap on the aorta root.

572
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:54,028
Aortic dissection.

573
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:56,721
And look at all these discontinuities.

574
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,057
Thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures.

575
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,035
All from a fistfight?

576
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,894
A lifetime of fistfights.

577
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:06,281
I'll break the news to him.

578
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:08,542
I'll page cardio and neuro.

579
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:10,068
Raptor and Cain?

580
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,420
That should be interesting.

581
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,009
Okay, my friend, we
looked at your scans.

582
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:21,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

583
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,465
Whoa, easy.

584
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,584
There you go.

585
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,304
Wow. I've delivered enough bad news

586
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:31,089
in my career to know that look.

587
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,758
Rip off the Band-Aid, Hawkins.

588
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,237
You have an aortic dissection

589
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,647
and multiple fractures in your spine.

590
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:42,076
Separately, neither would be dangerous.

591
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:43,652
Together...

592
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:44,744
It's time for prayer?

593
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,278
I'm prepping the OR now.

594
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,324
Chastain has the best
surgeons in Atlanta.

595
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:50,525
Your odds are good.

596
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,546
You be honest with me.

597
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,334
If the operation doesn't kill me,

598
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:02,971
could it put me in a wheelchair?

599
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:12,814
Got to be able to be a cop.

600
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,650
Yeah.

601
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,431
If I can't be a cop...

602
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,867
life's not worth living.

603
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,413
Let's not go there.

604
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:32,000
What is your backup plan?

605
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:38,673
What would you do if
you couldn't be a doctor?

606
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:46,640
Captain.

607
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,834
Detective Raines is headed
into surgery as we speak.

608
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,855
- Is he gonna be okay?
- It's serious but repairable.

609
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,618
- I'll keep you all posted, I promise.
- Please do.

610
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:58,388
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

611
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:01,155
I have a favor to ask.

612
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:02,514
Anything. Name it.

613
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,309
I need a phone number or an address

614
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,993
for Rob Spiro's daughter.

615
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:07,806
She could be in serious
medical jeopardy.

616
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:10,355
- I need to examine her.
- Look, respect for your profession,

617
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,834
but don't waste another second
on that animal or his family.

618
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:15,819
She didn't choose her father.

619
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,671
You're blaming the victim.

620
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:19,173
You're a cop. Aren't you supposed

621
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,340
to do the exact opposite?

622
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,285
Dr. Hawkins, I was
just about to call you.

623
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,039
You got the results
of my dialysis patient?

624
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,259
Reason he dropped dead without warning

625
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,730
is he had a massive pulmonary embolism.

626
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,279
He's not the only one.

627
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,022
We've had five other patients drop dead

628
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:38,622
from massive P.E.s just
in the past six weeks.

629
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:39,884
At Chastain?

630
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,029
In the past six weeks?

631
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,738
All dialysis patients.

632
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,872
Nic's sister Jessie Nevin, she
was a dialysis patient here.

633
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,403
First the robber, now the cop.

634
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,355
They're all the same on the inside.

635
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:02,574
Yeah.

636
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,923
Dr. Austin.

637
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,358
Dr. Cain.

638
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:29,397
We'll be repairing
the aortic dissection first.

639
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,895
Happy for you to assist, but you will be

640
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,576
- doctor number two.
- Well, it's an interesting proposition,

641
00:29:34,577 --> 00:29:35,899
but I'm no one's assistant.

642
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,942
I'm certainly not number two.

643
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,238
Well, then you can
monitor the nerve function.

644
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:45,426
Or I can repair the
spinal fracture first.

645
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:47,786
The aorta is the priority.

646
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,288
- It's literally tearing apart.
- The spinal cord

647
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,627
is being transected... it
could literally paralyze him.

648
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:54,768
The aortic dissection
could kill him on the spot.

649
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,647
Doctor number three is gonna go prep.

650
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:10,359
Okay, last stitch...

651
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,788
and the aortic root
has been reconstructed.

652
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,957
You're missing a step
in the Yacoub technique.

653
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,341
No, this is the David technique...

654
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:19,576
it's what we'd prefer at Stanford.

655
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:21,820
Not at Hopkins. Our studies
show a lower mortality rate.

656
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,632
Only when the aortic annulus
is less than 27 millimeters.

657
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,041
Our patient is 28 millimeters.

658
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,492
Then reinforce the suture lines.

659
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,285
Coronaries need to
be properly reperfused

660
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,762
before you restart his heart.

661
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:34,492
We're good,

662
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,126
but thank you.

663
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,769
Take him off bypass.

664
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,629
- We don't want our guy to get an M.I.
- I'll handle the heart.

665
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,047
You stick with the brain.

666
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,855
Brain commands the heart.

667
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:54,191
Yeah, well, the heart powers the brain.

668
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,885
All right, Nolan,

669
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,529
go ahead and decannulate.

670
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,780
Time to make space

671
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,969
so doctor number two
can access the spine.

672
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,820
You're more than welcome
to stay afterwards.

673
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:14,063
Be happy to have you retract
a few layers of soft tissue.

674
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:15,257
Someone has to do it.

675
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:18,635
- Patient's crashing.
- What the hell?

676
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:20,543
- This was an easy access.
- Aneurysm rupture.

677
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:21,838
Get the cell saver.

678
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,841
I'm gonna use my hands
to stop the bleed.

679
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,367
Bleeding stopped. Good call.

680
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:34,776
All right.

681
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,540
The tear spread through the iliac.

682
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,541
Grab the vascular clamps.

683
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,193
Go proximal.

684
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:45,938
- Done.
- Now distal.

685
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,100
He's about to code.

686
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,241
It's on the backside. I can't
see where the tear ends.

687
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,719
All right, all right, all right.

688
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,886
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

689
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:54,054
Okay, right here.

690
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,838
Slide the clamp along my fingers.

691
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,250
Got it.

692
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:09,068
Blood pressure stabilized.

693
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:13,907
Well done, doctor number one.

694
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:16,076
Back at you, doctor number two.

695
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:17,560
Yeah.

696
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,820
You know, I've been

697
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,730
in the health care field a long time,

698
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,900
and I have never seen
anything so promising.

699
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:28,571
Supplements are a $122 billion industry

700
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,757
with multiple areas of growth.

701
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,493
Shift your weight forward and down.

702
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,378
Get more distance on your shot.

703
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,267
And collagen? On fire.

704
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:42,960
30% growth, $100 million.

705
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,004
With my medical reputation
and your business savvy,

706
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,440
we can make a fortune.

707
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,976
Uh, make sure your hands
don't cross the swing plane.

708
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,026
This can be good for Grayson, as well.

709
00:32:58,027 --> 00:32:59,953
Give a bright young man
with a few bad habits

710
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:02,313
some guidance.

711
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,533
Get your son started on a new path.

712
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,672
Magnificent effort.

713
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,951
The shot or the pitch?

714
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,761
Both.

715
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:22,792
Let's draw up the papers.

716
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,646
Just, uh... one ground rule

717
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,298
before going to business together.

718
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,842
Fire away. No secrets between partners.

719
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,228
No more schtupping my wife.

720
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:48,001
_

721
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:54,564
_

722
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,915
_

723
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,478
Here are the lab results you ordered.

724
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,540
_

725
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:17,572
Mia Danvers doesn't need surgery.

726
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,273
- Hey. In a rush?
- Hey.

727
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:23,750
My patient with spinal stenosis...

728
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,602
turns out she has myasthenia gravis.

729
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,202
That's what's causing all her symptoms?

730
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,342
Yes. And we can treat it
with meds. I just need Cain

731
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,035
to cancel the surgery. I don't
want him opening her up

732
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,119
if he doesn't have to.

733
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,701
Cain finished early on Detective Raines.

734
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,462
Probably squeezed your patient

735
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:42,246
- into the OR.
- Damn it.

736
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,674
- Did you need something from me?
- It can wait. Go.

737
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,434
Ten blade.

738
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:08,398
I don't understand.
You didn't do the surgery?

739
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,458
Turns out you have what's
called myasthenia gravis.

740
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,160
It's an autoimmune disease.

741
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:14,612
It can be controlled
through the medication.

742
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,408
Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Cain.

743
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,669
Thank Nurse Nevin. She's
the one that caught it.

744
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:28,483
She seems relieved.

745
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:30,152
Take one guess how
much your due diligence

746
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,263
cost this hospital today. No, allow me.

747
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,775
Mia's surgery would have
run 75 grand, give or take,

748
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:37,468
not including the recovery,
so let's just call it

749
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,595
$150,000 all-in.

750
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,437
I'm not in the business

751
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,289
of putting people into
surgery if they don't need it.

752
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,535
Which is exactly why I handpicked you.

753
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:50,987
It should come as no surprise
that I'd like to offer you

754
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:53,540
a permanent position on
my neurosurgery staff.

755
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,709
Give you more opportunities to shine,

756
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,952
make a lot more money
than you're making now.

757
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:01,990
But I'm guessing you don't care
so much about that last part.

758
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,487
Take your time. Think about it.

759
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,670
I have another surgery to do,

760
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,839
which is no doubt a necessary one.

761
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,567
Have to make up for lost revenue.

762
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,718
The corporate structure

763
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,946
will be an LLC with partner ownership

764
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:28,408
vesting in two-year increments,
which is standard,

765
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,410
and starting at ten percent.

766
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:33,696
Except for me. I'll own 65%.

767
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:35,531
Any advance of money...

768
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:37,992
He'll own 65%?

769
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:39,869
How much money is he investing?

770
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,589
- Six.
- Six...

771
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,998
Million.

772
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,667
... be deemed a debt
owed by the partnership

773
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,378
and not an increase in
capital contribution...

774
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,411
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd reconciled

775
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,550
- with your husband?
- It was only three weeks ago.

776
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:58,489
We're keeping things
open this time around.

777
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,056
Does he know that?

778
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:02,139
Any questions?

779
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,121
To new partners.

780
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:09,504
And some old ones.

781
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,416
This is gonna be awesome.

782
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,239
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

783
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:29,043
So, Doc...

784
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:30,728
am I gonna live?

785
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:40,446
Surgery was a success.

786
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:45,576
Thank you.

787
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,607
Uh...

788
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:54,086
What about Spiro?

789
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:56,112
The son of a bitch gonna make it?

790
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,172
He should. He's recovering.

791
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:02,118
I'm gonna need to see him.

792
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,096
No witnesses.

793
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:06,493
We both know that's not gonna happen.

794
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,052
Actually, we don't.

795
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,189
Never broken any rules?

796
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:19,427
It's written all over your face.

797
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:21,596
You do whatever it takes

798
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:24,599
to save people.

799
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,993
You and me, we not that different.

800
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,606
Spiro's crew has a hostage.

801
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:34,166
His life is hanging in the balance.

802
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:40,172
We're his last hope.

803
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:45,594
You tell me I'm wrong.

804
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:51,310
Turn off Rob's morphine.

805
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,794
You can't be serious.

806
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:55,521
And then we add a dose of Narcan.

807
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,318
That should wake him up.

808
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:00,894
His pain level would skyrocket.

809
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:02,395
I want to clear his system of drugs.

810
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:03,513
I'm worried about his airway.

811
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:05,181
No, you're not. He would go into shock.

812
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,773
What you're talking about is torture.

813
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,976
What I'm talking about is this man,

814
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:11,330
who will die unless Rob Spiro tells us

815
00:39:11,331 --> 00:39:13,489
where he's being held
and he tells us now.

816
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,252
Conrad, I get that you are
trying to help this man,

817
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,253
- but that...
- Don't lecture me on my motivations.

818
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,912
Hold on a second. Wait.

819
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:20,812
The cops said they
found Spiro's daughter.

820
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,990
I can contact her, get her
to come into the hospital,

821
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,575
and when he sees her, he
might have a change of heart.

822
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:26,026
He doesn't give a damn
about his daughter.

823
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:27,346
What? You don't know that.

824
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:29,181
"Everybody dies of something"?

825
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:31,183
His words. You told me yourself.

826
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:32,926
This is not our job.

827
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:35,261
We-we are doctors. We save lives.

828
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:36,487
We already saved Rob's life.

829
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:37,747
Now we make him a
little bit uncomfortable

830
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:39,070
so that we save another.

831
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,524
You're crossing a line.

832
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:44,228
I am doing the most good

833
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:45,971
for the greatest number of people.

834
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,280
Don't do this.

835
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:55,998
It has to be done.

836
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,712
I want no part of it.

837
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,244
Thanks, Connie. This was the scene

838
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:34,079
earlier this evening at
an abandoned warehouse

839
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,772
in Downtown Atlanta, where
an active hostage situation

840
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,658
ended peacefully with three arrests.

841
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:40,092
They rescued him, huh?

842
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:42,766
... officers have emerged
with Jason Wyans,

843
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,589
the hostage taken earlier today

844
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,591
during yet another home invasion.

845
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,926
Wonder how they found him.

846
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:49,243
... the rest of Rob Spiro's crew

847
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:50,837
are now in police custody.

848
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:52,955
And I wonder what's that thing I do

849
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:54,898
that drives you nuts.

850
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,962
- I've been bracing myself all day.
- I thought

851
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:59,931
- you'd never ask.
- Hmm.

852
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,736
You don't like it when I'm barefoot?

853
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:10,615
What are you doing?

854
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:12,692
The socks.

855
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:13,693
What?

856
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:17,289
You leave socks all over the place.

857
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,676
It's the thing that makes me crazy.

858
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,442
It's-it's like a sock
trail all over the house.

859
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,501
No, I do not.

860
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:25,130
You do. Look, there's-there's
a pair over there.

861
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:26,611
Men's, size ten.

862
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,041
Sometimes a little sweaty.

863
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:30,302
Okay.

864
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:33,329
- I can work on that.
- Uh...

865
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,456
- Like, I mean...
- I will definitely

866
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,733
- work on that.
- Like, work real hard on it.

867
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,977
- Very hard.
- 'Cause it's... gross.

868
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:44,273
Thank you.

869
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:49,862
Hey.

870
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:52,823
What's wrong?

871
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,662
The patient you lost earlier?

872
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,791
Sort of.

873
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:12,752
You have been...

874
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:15,521
beating yourself up over Jessie's death,

875
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:18,791
about how you pushed for
the transplant surgery.

876
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,687
What's this about, Conrad?

877
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:26,118
Jessie died of a pulmonary embolism.

878
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,470
A complication from surgery.

879
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,241
Five other dialysis patients

880
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:37,076
died at Chastain over
the last six weeks.

881
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:41,163
All from pulmonary embolisms.

882
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:47,069
I think whatever killed your sister,

883
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,004
it killed them, too.

884
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:56,845
We need to figure out what it was.

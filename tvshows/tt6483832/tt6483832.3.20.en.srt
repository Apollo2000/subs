00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:06,139
it is perfect just like this.

3
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,446
He'll be a vegetable.

4
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:09,394
It's the compassionate
choice at this point.

5
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:10,993
Are you suggesting we let him die?

6
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:13,420
Nobody, and I mean<i>
nobody,</i> dies in my OR!

<i>NIC: She's been in

KIM: If it gets out now
that we have a deadly fungus,

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,547
this hospital goes bankrupt.

for the decontamination process.

16
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:32,055
- Clean it now.
- Lunch. Half hour.

17
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,441
Daddy's still very sick?

18
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:35,685
He's fighting to get better.

19
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:38,334
They want to put you on a

00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,454
- Thank you.
- There you go.

22
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,382
Hey. How was that?

23
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,958
(SIGHS) Intrusive.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,460
They're swabbing armpit and groin.

25
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,683
Humiliating but necessary.

26

You don't need a mask, Zorro.

27
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,541
This is<i> Candida auris,</i> not coronavirus.

28
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,418
It travels on skin and equipment.

29
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,660
It isn't airborne.

30
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,156
And you're scaring people.

31
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,670
Shouldn't they be scared?

32
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,125
DEVON: No. We've contacted

33
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,569
the health department, and it
is all being handled properly.

34
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,239
And why are you here, anyway?

35
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,223
Only people who have been in contact

36
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,218
with infected patients
need to be swabbed.

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,563
Can never be too safe.

38
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,832

Randolph, do you think

45
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,793
we should have Derek
transferred to Atlanta General?

46
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,128
- I really don't think that that's necessary.
- Well,

47
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,553
all his doctors are at Chastain.
His chemo protocol

48
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,332
is here. And, Kit, we're
taking every precaution.

49
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,319
Plus, Derek had zero crosses
with the infected patients.

50
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,405
Okay, but if there's any
sign that this is spreading...

So, you fell while salsa dancing?

53
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:55,699
- Yeah.
- And took down a table full of mojitos.

54
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,534
- Ouch.
- MERCEDES: I wanted to bring him in

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,207

- Follow my finger.
- Mm-hmm.

MERCEDES: You don't lose
your balance, Miguel.

60
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,921
He's the 2003 Salsa Planet champion.

61
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,473
- Did you know that?
- And 2002.

62
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,346
- Back-to-back, baby. (CHUCKLES)
- Impressive.

63
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,735
You still compete?

64
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,904
(SIGHS) Now I teach. Oh.

65
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,907
First lesson is free at my studio.

66
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,392
I love salsa. Thank you.

00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:25,103
Uh, Miguel, will you
unbutton your shirt for me?

68
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:27,039
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

69
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,754
Is that a pacemaker?

70
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:36,832
No, it's a, uh, it's a defibrillator.

71
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,335
What's that for, hon?

72
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,905
It's nothing to worry about, <i>corazón.</i>

73
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,120
It's probably broken, anyway.

74
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,431
Is that why you fell?

75
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,640
Because it shocked you?

76
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,767
Maybe.

77
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,127
Okay. So it sounds
like either your heart

78
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,314
or your defibrillator
needs some attention.

79
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,138
Am I allowed to be happy?

Well, your daddy's recovery is amazing.

Sarah's dog is having puppies,

93
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,903

Welcome back. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

You don't have to answer the

- I don't know.

Nope. Nothing.

KIT: What's happening?

105
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,009
Could it be the cancer?

106
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,678
A-a brain bleed while he was sedated?

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,723
We're gonna get him
a head CT immediately,

108
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,075
and figure out what this is.

I don't even really like popcorn.

Well, who doesn't love butter and salt?

115
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,134
Truth. Which is why, when I was starving

116
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,849
and my options were vending machine

117
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,228
or a dumpster dive, I bought a bag.

118
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,335
Basically inhaled it and somehow
got a kernel stuck in my molar.

119
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,900
And you tried to remove it

- with a paper clip?
- I mean, that wasn't my first play.

I did try a toothpick like a human.

00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,448
Uh, brushing, flossing,

123
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,767
and then my fingernails
when I got desperate.

But then I guess I just...

125
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,229
got used to it.

126
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,388
I figured it would eventually
come out on its own.

127
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,750
Well, let's make sure
it's nothing serious.

128
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:19,485
How long have you been
experiencing jaw pain?

129
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,010
A few weeks.

130
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,752
I know, I know. I should've
gone to the dentist.

131
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:25,926
But I'm only working with
basic health insurance

132
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:29,412
and a public radio salary here.

133
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,765
And I have my son's tuition to pay.

134
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,291
So, when I woke up this morning,

135
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,918
it was like I was
being stabbed in the...

136
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,845
Justine?

137
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:37,963
I need some help over here.

138
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,148
Grab her legs.

139
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,094
Tilt your head toward me.

140
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,030
Going in slowly.

141
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,025
You see that?

142
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:52,119
CONRAD: White lesions.

143
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:54,847
So I didn't have a stroke?

144
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,679
CONRAD: No. The CT confirmed that.

145
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,778
And it doesn't look like cancer, either.

146
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,151
Then why can't I see?

147
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:04,798
You have an infection in your eyes.

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,594
Okay. So we can fix this,
right? And he'll see again.

149
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,554
I'll be right back.

150
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:17,664
We can talk more

151
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,481
after the eye doctor finishes his exam.

152
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,358
Hang in there.

153
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,954
DEVON: Okay...

154
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,979
so all the tests from the hospital staff

155
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,081
and the patients have come back;
no one else has been colonized.

156
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,648
So it can't be<i> Candida auris.</i>

157
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,928
The labs will confirm
that one way or another,

158
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,521
but let's get him on contact
precautions just in case.

159
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,614
Gowns and gloves for
anyone who enters his room.

160
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,288
And if he does have it, what's next?

161
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,485
Fevers. His blood pressure drops...

162
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:45,231
Sophia died within a
day of being diagnosed.

163
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,866
Be straight with me. Is
that what we're looking at?

164
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:51,337
It is a pan-resistant strain of<i> candida.</i>

165
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,695
And we don't have the
medicine to treat it.

166
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,219
Let's focus on what we can do.

167
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,091
CONRAD: Yeah, let's start him on GCSF.

168
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:59,200
Jump-start his immune system,
trend his labs every six hours,

169
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,379
and watch his blood
pressure like a hawk.

170
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,547
Did you learn something?

171
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,840
Molly...

172
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,935
until we know what
we're dealing with here,

173
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:09,029
it's best Josie doesn't go in the room.

174
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,122
- JOSIE: Grandma?
- Okay, what's going on?

175
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:12,481
- Grandma.
- Yes?

176
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:13,981
Do you have any more of these?

177
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,691
They're really pretty.

178
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:19,902
Hey...

179
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:24,545
- Oh, my God.
- What?

180
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,696
This is Dawn Long's vent.

181
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,531
Her daughter put that sticker on it.

182
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,743
You mean, if it wasn't
properly cleaned...

183
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:33,745
CONRAD: Kit, if that's
true, Derek probably

184
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:35,764
got<i> Candida auris</i> from that vent.

185
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:44,306
And now Michelle has a cold,
so I have an extra ticket

186
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:45,715
to my friend's show at The Loft.

187
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,592
Be my plus-one.

188
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:51,763
Oh, I'd love to, but it's
my folks' 45th anniversary.

189
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:53,982
- Mm.
- I'm sure Torres would love to roll.

190
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:56,059
Eh, pass.

191
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,394
- Really?
- (CHUCKLES)

192
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:59,062
He showed so much promise.

193
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:02,249
Fleeting attraction. You know how it is.

194
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,738
45 years of marriage. Wow.

195
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,782
Yeah. You know what?

196
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,952
They still love each other
like it was the first day.

197
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,597
Huh. Something to aspire to.

198
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,671
Hmm.

199
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,812
I didn't want it in
me in the first place.

200
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,510
I feel strong as an ox.

201
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:24,054
For God's sake, I'm only 55.

202
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:27,991
Mr. Espinoza, I am Dr. Austin.

203
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:29,850
This is Dr. Okafor.

204
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:32,293
We're gonna see what's
going on with this ICD, okay?

205
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,806
Probably shocked me by mistake.

206
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,475
I went in for a physical,
three, four months ago.

207
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:39,477
My doctor saw my swollen feet.

208
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,030
Of course they swell. I dance.

209
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,033
But he told me I had heart failure.

210
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,868
I still don't believe it.

211
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,366
My heart has never failed.

212
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:51,161
Except it did.

213
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,388
Are you sure?

214
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,389
Yeah, we are.

215
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,880
Would you like us to get your wife

216
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,498
before we talk more?

217
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,290
- I don't have a wife.
- Your girlfriend?

218
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,957
The woman who was with you in the ER?

219
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,412
Probably home with her husband.

220
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,650
Just tell me what I need to know.

221
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh, Miguel,

222
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,801
your device worked
exactly as it should have.

223
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:19,118
Your heart went into a deadly rhythm

224
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,235
while you were dancing,

225
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,663
and your ICD shocked you back to life.

226
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:26,524
You're saying without it...

227
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,026
I might have died?

228
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,028
Yes.

229
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,087
Well, will this happen again?

230
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,509
Well, your heart is functioning at 25%,

231
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,327
so it's very likely it will happen

232
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:38,554
when you exert yourself.

233
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,599
Like when I'm dancing.

234
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,212
Salsa is my life.

235
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,939
My livelihood.

236
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,360
I don't know how to do anything else.

237
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,556
Tell you what.

238
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,016
When we get your tests back,

239
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,185
Dr. Okafor and I will review them

240
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:05,497
and see if there's
anything more we can do.

241
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,836
(INDISTINCT VOICE OVER P.A.)

242
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,373
How's Josie?

243
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,208
She didn't want to leave.

244
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,561
But the sitter took her
to the children's museum,

245
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:30,178
so that will help.

246
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,231
Any news?

247
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,141
The cultures came back,

248
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,811
and Derek has what we suspected.

249
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,502
A<i> Candida auris</i> bloodstream infection

250
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,889
that traveled to his eyes.

251
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:43,393
- So we're starting him on antifungals?
- Yes.

252
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:47,332
But it's a drug-resistant strain, Molly.

253
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,525
Our existing medications are
likely impotent against it.

254
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:53,328
- And his immune system is so weak...
- No.

255
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,170
No, he can't get better one minute

256
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,499
and have no hope the next.

257
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,623
There's got to be something
we're not thinking of.

258
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,060
Conrad is working with
our infectious disease team

259
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,837
to see if there's anything we can try.

260
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,172
DEREK: I'm...

261
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,674
really hot.

262
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,584
I don't feel right at all.

263
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,961
Your fever's spiking.

264
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:12,231
We'll get you some acetaminophen.

265
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,687
- He's getting worse.
- (PAGER BEEPING)

266
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,781
That's Conrad now.

267
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:23,408
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

268
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,789
Christy, he needs some acetaminophen.

269
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,791
Right away.

270
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,956
How do you feel?

271
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,917
Excuse me?

272
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,721
My son-in-law is blind
because of<i> Candida auris,</i>

273
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,839
and it's probably going to kill him.

274
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,559
So, again, how do you feel?

275
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,895
I had nothing to do with that.

276
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:01,971
You had everything to do with it.

277
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,991
You knew your patient
had a deadly fungus,

278
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,826
and you covered it up
to save your own skin.

279
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,402
But not well enough.

280
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:09,361
Dawn's vent wasn't properly cleaned

281
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,481
and that vent went to Derek.

282
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,650
I gave specific instructions
to sterilize her room

283
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:14,835
and all the equipment.

284
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,745
Well, you failed.

285
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,863
And now my daughter
will lose her husband,

286
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:22,342
my grandchild her father
and Derek his life.

287
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:26,829
And you better hope that doesn't
happen, because if it does,

288
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,932
I will destroy you.

289
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm sorry, Kit.

290
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,471
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

291
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,173
Of course you can't.

292
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,318
Because you've likely
never loved anyone.

293
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,166
- What is all this?
- Derek's best hope.

294
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:56,401
It's a modified drug-testing bioprinter.

295
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,442
Translation, please?

296
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,685
We know that Derek's<i>
candida</i> is resistant

297
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,365
to all individual drugs,

298
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,259
but how about a
combination of those drugs?

299
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,782
Yes, it would take
days to test them all...

300
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,474
KIT: He barely has hours, Conrad.

301
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:11,192
That's where this printer comes in.

302
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:14,135
We're testing 96 different combinations

303
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,805
- at the same time.
- PERSOPOULOS: No hits yet, but it's early.

304
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,531
Well, let's just hope
they don't come too late.

305
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,502
Derek's started to spike fevers,
and we all know what comes next.

306
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:29,612
JUSTINE: I can't have a brain
infection. It was popcorn.

307
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:31,533
Children eat it in movie theaters.

308
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:34,263
Come on, there's no way this
is a real thing that happens.

309
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:38,278
It's... it's extremely unusual,
but it does happen.

310
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,996
I brought in Dr. Pravesh
to review your CT scan.

311
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:44,931
So, your infection traveled
through your sinuses

312
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,451
and into your brain here.

313
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,077
Which would explain the seizure.

314
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,955
(SIGHS) So, what now?

315
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,508
Antibiotics that most
certainly constipate?

316
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,711
Justine, you may need surgery.

317
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,528
DEVON: And we called in
a neurosurgery consult

318
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,799
to find out, okay?

319
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,505
Neurosurgery?

320
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:05,273
Dr. Reynolds should be here shortly...

321
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,365
CAIN: Dr. Reynolds is stuck in surgery,

322
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,974
I'll be doing the...

323
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,160
the operation.

326

I-I didn't recognize your name
when I reviewed your chart.

327

JUSTINE: Oh, I got a baby,
wedding, divorce. In that order.

328
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,659
Haven't switched my name
back yet because it is a pain.

329
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,829
Ryan was a bad choice.

330
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,717
But I got the best part
of him: my awesome kid.

331
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,220
So, how about you? Married?

332
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:39,805
Only to my work.

333
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,861
And, uh, how's Katie? And your mom?

334

(CLEARS THROAT) Dr.
Pravesh, Nurse Nevin,

335
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:53,326
I'll take it from here.

336
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,579
- Yeah, sure. Cool.
- Yeah.

337
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,651
Man, that was just
starting to get interesting.

338
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:03,777
Wait, do you think she's an ex?

339
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,728
Of course. Who do you think Katie is?

340
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,252
Sister?

341
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,777
I don't know, child?

342
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,505
NIC: Huh. And he has a mom.

343
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:14,230
DEVON: Well, he didn't
just spring fully formed

345

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

346
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,021
Well, luckily she's my
patient and a talker.

347
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:24,882
Maybe we'll finally learn something

348
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,009
about old Barrett Cain.

349
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,528
Hmm.

350
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,143
So, where are we?

351
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,561
NIC: The surgery will happen today,

352
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,393
once we've done a full workup.

353
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,816
After you're sedated, the oral surgeon

354
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,614
will pull out the infected tooth.

355
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,452
And then Dr. Cain will
remove a part of your skull

356
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,379
- to access the infection.
- (EXHALES SHARPLY)

357
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:49,699
Part of my skull. Okay,
that freaks me out.

358
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,577
Be straight with me. How much
danger are we talking here?

359
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,297
(EXHALES): Uh, listen...

360
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:58,924
Surgery to the brain is always risky.

361
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,525
But there's no other option,
and you're in great hands.

362
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,213
Dr. Cain is an excellent neurosurgeon.

363
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,308
Well, some things never change.

364
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,403
He was always the best at
everything he did. (CHUCKLES)

365
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:12,364
You were close, I take it?

366

College.

367
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,728
I was the girl with her nose in a book.

368
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,156
He was the guy who flirted
me out of the library.

369
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:25,067
All my friends were like,
"What? A football player?"

370
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,278
But he had better
grades than most of them

371
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,113
and he was the star quarterback.

372
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:30,907
So Dr. Cain was a football player.

373
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,783
He was on his way to the NFL.

374
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,602
Scouts were all over him until...

375
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,429
- Injury?
- ACL.

376
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:39,007
Burnt his sports career to the ground.

377
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:41,343
And by the time he rose from the ashes

378
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:44,271
and started figuring out
what to do with his life,

379
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:46,481
it was over between us.

380
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,109
He'd changed.

381
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,761
He had always been so in control,

382
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:55,991
and suddenly there was
something that he couldn't fix.

383
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:01,145
And he got bitter. Angry.

384
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:04,040
It wasn't what I signed
up for, so I got out.

385
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,919
Maybe I shouldn't have.

386
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,590
Maybe there's still time.

387
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:15,210
No.

388
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:18,996
I left him, and I lost him.

389
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:23,668
And now here he is when
I need him the most.

390
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,836
(SIGHS)

391
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,398
Barrett Cain is the one who got away.

392
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,654
I'll be back.

393
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:39,367
You look like you have news.

394
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,019
We have a hit.

395
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,622
(EXHALES) That's great.

396
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,628
But what works in the lab
can be starkly different

397
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,034
to what works in a person.

398
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,971
True. But it's a chance, Kit.

399
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes.

400
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:05,727
Yes, it is.

401
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,901
Nice.

402
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,528
Excuse me?

403
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:18,106
He can't give up.

404
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:21,058
- The man has a gift.
- MINA: Mm-hmm.

AUSTIN: See? Just before he degenerates

- into V fib...
- The rhythm started at V tach.

411
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:40,090
Which means we could ablate
it. Do you think it would work?

412
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,537
In the right hands.

413
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,747
And luckily, the man's
prowess on the dance floor

414

is second only to my
own dexterity and grace.

415
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,290
I assume that means I should
get him on the cath lab schedule.

00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,049
Yes. Now let's go
give him the good news.

but it is gonna be tough.

drug to fight the fungus,

these drugs will work.

Dr. Okafor and I have
familiarized ourselves

448
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,312
with the intimate details of your heart,

449
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:14,727
and we'd like to suggest a viable option

450
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,294
to return you back
to your dancing shoes.

451
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,202
It's a procedure called ablation.

452
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,266
We'll thread catheters
through the main artery

453
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:22,318
and vein in your groin

454
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,530
and then burn away
the part of your heart

455
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:26,016
that's been causing the abnormal rhythm.

You tell me my heart is weak.

if this goes as well as expected,

460
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:36,694
it means no more lethal arrhythmias.

00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:11,937
The hospital's clean,
the patients are safe.

806
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:15,223
You know, I've become
accustomed to a particularly

807
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:16,683
heavy look of yours.

808
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,110
But today...

809
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:21,539
today something's different.

810
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,948
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

811
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,118
Today, in order to protect my patients,

812
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,903
I had to become part of the
system I've been fighting.

813
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:30,030
How so?

814
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,032
Well, I didn't tell my patients
they could be at risk

815
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,856
of getting infected by a superbug.

816
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:36,306
Didn't want them to panic
and walk out of Chastain

817
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:39,298
and not get the care and
attention they needed.

818
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,059
You know, it's not often
that our worlds collide,

819
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:45,304
but about this, I know a thing or two.

820
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:48,899
Doing good isn't black and white.

821
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:52,386
And the shades of gray are unsettling.

822
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:56,032
Oh, I know. I deal with that every day.

823
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:01,412
How do I live with myself?

824
00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:04,564
Never lose sight of your ideals.

825
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,566
'Cause once that happens,

826
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:10,421
the steps aren't many to the dark side.

827
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:12,948
Trust me, I know.

According to a source,
hospital workers were

844
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,596
made aware of the fungus ahead of time,

845
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:00,153
but chose to cover it up
instead of alerting the public.

846
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:03,123
<i>A cover-up at one of
Atlanta's premiere hospitals.</i>

847
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,384
<i>I interviewed one nurse
here who said, and I quote,</i>

848
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:07,631
<i>"Don't believe anything
Chastain tells you".</i>

849
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,221
How did this get out?

850
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:10,879
Doesn't really matter much how.

851
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:13,354
Find the source so I can
bury them under this building.

852
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:16,178
I told you we should have
notified State Health.

853
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,305
Sounds like you're
putting this off on me.

854
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:19,990
It's pretty damn clear that the cover-up

855
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:21,567
is reading far worse than the crime.

856
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,736
Your prints are all over this.

857
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:26,304
- Because you forced my hand.
- Leverage is a useful tool.

858
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:27,478
It's called blackmail.

859
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,075
I had to keep you on a loyal path.

860
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,420
I don't like being threatened.

861
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:37,916
Hawkins.

862
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,585
(CHUCKLES)

863
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:42,868
- I owe you an apology.
- This ought to be good.

864
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,966
When I initially evaluated
you, I missed your potential.

865
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:47,375
And that's on me.

866
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:50,212
But ever since you secured
the Georgia FC soccer team,

867
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:53,023
I-I've been paying attention, and I see

868
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,776
you have the makings
of a true rainmaker.

869
00:41:58,197 --> 00:42:00,722
I'm an internist, not a neurosurgeon.

870
00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't think my limited earning
power is what you're looking for.

871
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:04,927
The title isn't about billing.

872
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,895
It's about being a public face.

873
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:09,118
Cain's reputation,
both past and present,

874
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,282
is problematic.

875
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:12,234
We need compassion.

876
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:13,952
- (LAUGHS)
- Heroism.

877
00:42:13,954 --> 00:42:15,954
A doctor who fights for patients.

878
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:18,629
Military hero turned whistleblower.

879
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:20,534
We all know how you love those.

880
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,578
This isn't about me.
It's about Chastain.

881
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,390
Cain and Bell had their chance
to be the star of this company,

882
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:28,058
but they couldn't deliver.

883
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,378
Your inspiring story
comes free and clear.

884
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,423
Our future is brighter with
Conrad Hawkins front and center.

885
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:36,937
And that's how I'll
frame it to the board

886
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,104
later this afternoon.

887
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,897
I'm sure Cain will love that.

888
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:43,504
He won't have a seat at the table.

889
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,696
And at some point down the road,
I'm sure the board will want

890
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,078
to talk to you, too.

891
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,873
The truth about Cain needs
to come out, and soon.

892
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:57,880
You don't want to save Chastain?

893
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,427
I know you care about this hospital.

894
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:06,454
If you really want to
change things around here,

895
00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:11,101
this is an opportunity to gain
some real power and influence.

896
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:13,145
What do you say?

897
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,744

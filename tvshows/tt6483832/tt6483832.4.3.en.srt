I have to tell you.

I'm pregnant.

Who's replacing Logan Kim

Chastain isn't getting
a new CEO.

I don't understand.
Someone has to be in charge.

his heart, lungs

No, it's on the patient,

- of the risks.
- Mm-hmm, deny it all you want.

held responsible for this.

Well, we can table that part

But for now, in general,

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,835
it's understood
that we will not always agree.

104

A bypass should never be

Or your choice
of furosemide drip over boluses.

interrupted suture

110

hold my breath for that.

00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,437
I'm not asking you to.

117
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,009
But I am asking you to remember

118
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,769
that I am still your attending.

119
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,610
Well, there's just one more
ground rule.

120
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,774
This lounge... (clears throat)

121
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,615
It is the residents' lounge.

122
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,670
Just because you are
dating a resident

123
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,137
does not mean you have access.

124

00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,513
Ambulance versus pedestrian,
with right shoulder pain.

165
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,305
BP 110/80.

166
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,748
Heart rate 120.

167
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,728
I hear you're a hero,
saved one of the victims.

168
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,139
No good deed goes unpunished.

169
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:02,974
Just came out of nowhere.
All right.

170
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:05,235
- On your count.
- All right, we're good...
one, two, three.

171
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,092
Aah!

172
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,572
(exhales) Get the ultrasound.

173
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,097
Yeah, we know the protocol.

174
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,488
Clear breath sounds bilaterally.

175
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,496
My airways are fine.

176
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,084
See any free fluid?

177
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,274
Negative.

178
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,903
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.

179
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,259
Touch your fingers together.

180
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,112
Now grab my fingers.

181
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,758
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

182
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,169
Grip strength five out of five
and symmetric bilaterally.

183
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:34,411
Does this feel the same as this?

184
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,747
Again.

185
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,212
This. This.

186
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,693
Cain?

187
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,428
Get me to CT.

188
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,226
(machine whirring)

189
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,229
(machine blipping)

190
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,634
Talk to me.

191
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,061
Not each other.

192
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:10,230
I'm the patient. I'm right here.

193
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,715
<i>Dr. Cain,</i>

194
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:13,383
<i>put down the tablet.</i>

195
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,804
<i>You shouldn't move.</i>

196
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,789
<i>It could exacerbate
your injuries.</i>

197
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:19,313
Scapulothoracic dissociation.

198
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,536
My arm must've been yanked
with significant force,

199
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,044
ripping the scapula
from my thoracic cage.

200
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,090
Tearing the nerves
in my brachial plexus.

201
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,921
Can't close my hand.

202
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,058
Can't touch my fingers together.

203
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,005
He's gonna need surgery if
he ever wants to operate again.

204
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,766
That is a complex procedure,

205
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:50,278
even for the best
orthopedic surgeon.

206
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,077
Page Dr. Voss.

207
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:03,761
Hey.

208
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:06,119
Well, that was certainly
a hot mess.

209
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,696
- You heard about Cain?
- Yeah.

210
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,048
How is he?

211
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,049
In imaging.

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,437
He may be seriously injured.

213
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,220
Well, nobody deserves that.

214
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,389
Listen.

215
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,611
I saw Yorn.

216
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,060
And?

217
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,563
Did he say
why he hasn't hired a CEO?

218
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,565
They're selling the hospital.

219
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,619
God.

220
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,143
Uh, is there a buyer?

221
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,197
I mean, Red Rock's been
a disaster.

222
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,480
I-I don't know,
but any big corporation's gonna

223
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,390
put profits over patients.

224
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,780
You think we're better off
with the devil we know?

225
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,245
I need to show Yorn

226
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,466
that Chastain is worth
a hell of a lot more

227
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,915
than he thinks it is.

228
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,971
You have a rather unsettling
sparkle in your eye.

229
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:49,495
I'm guessing you have a plan.

230
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,310
Oh, Randolph.

231
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,967
I don't like this.

232
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,821
Look, we need
to show Red Rock that we can

233
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,484
remedy our anemic bottom line
or it's over.

234
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,159
And filming a segment
highlighting Chastain's value

235
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,662
to the community is
the quickest and best way

236
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,308
to get rich people
to write checks

237
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,826
and sick people to flock to us.

238
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,500
Surgeries have complications.

239
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,168
Things can go wrong.

240
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,654
- Worse than they have already?
- (pager vibrates)

241
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,450
It's Cain.

242
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,344
Don't do anything crazy.

243
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,624
And let's keep Red Rock's plans
to ourselves.

244
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,251
The last thing we need to do
is panic the staff.

245
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,090
Mm.

246
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,693
Really?

247
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,119
(chuckles)

248
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,453
Come on.

249
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,452
- Ready?
- Mm, no.

250
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,059
Too bad.

251
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,386
(winces)

252
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,578
Mm, maybe I should've
married a nurse.

253
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,223
(chuckles)

254
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,708
Here.

255
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,860
- I won't quit my day job.
- (moans)

256
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,549
We'll know soon.

257
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,243
Now all we do is wait.

258
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,408
Hey, Doc, how long do I
have to be like this?

259
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,061
Mr. McCloud,
your condition is critical.

260
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,155
- We need to discuss it.
- (laughs)

261
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:17,825
I know I look like a burrito,
but it can't be that bad.

262
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,252
I can't even feel any pain.

263
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,461
The fire destroyed
your pain receptors.

264
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:25,499
And we're gonna give you fluids
to make you feel comfortable.

265
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,812
- But that's all
we can offer you.
- Wait a minute.

266
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,189
What are you telling me?

267
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,734
(exhales)
You might not survive this.

268
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,899
Is there someone we can call
to be with you?

269
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,403
I saw that your daughter was on
your emergency contact list.

270
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:42,200
No. No.

271
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,703
I don't want Ariana
to remember me like this.

272
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,279
You shouldn't be alone.

273
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:47,909
And I'm sure that your daughter
wants to see you.

274
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,358
My daughter and I... she...

275
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,378
we don't talk much.

276
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,923
There have been problems.

277
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:01,127
When I was growing up,
my father was always

278
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:03,204
driving his cab.

279
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,609
Nights, weekends,
birthdays, you name it.

280
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,446
Then there was this one day
that I asked to ride along.

281
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,228
We drove all night.

282
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:15,808
He let me sit up front, he even
taught me how to spot a fake 20.

283
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,456
And then we just
started talking.

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,463
He spoke to me about India,

285
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,782
what it was like
immigrating to Queens.

286
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,318
Starting a family.

287
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,914
We never talked like that again.

288
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:34,919
When he died, I didn't
even get to say goodbye.

289
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:39,924
What I would do
for just one more day,

290
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:45,722
one more ride,
one more talk with my dad.

291
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,894
My point is that maybe your
daughter would feel the same.

292
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,658
You don't know our story.

293
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,441
It's our story.

294
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,068
It's not yours.

295
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:03,097
Just be my doctor,

296
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,743
and try and get me through this.

297
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,664
Okay.

298
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,121
C-spine is cleared.

299
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,624
I know what you're thinking.
(grunts)

300
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,639
That this is karma,
the accident.

301
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,626
The sooner we operate,
the better chance you have

302
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,391
to restore your hand function.

303
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,068
That's what I'm thinking.

304
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,713
I assume you'll be accessing
my brachial plexus

305
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,450
- from my neck?
- Yes.

306
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,804
Once I have, we'll decide
on the best approach

307
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,880
to reattach your scapula
to your thoracic cage

308
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,312
and perform a nerve repair.

309
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,998
I want my surgical residents
to observe you in the OR.

310
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:57,151
You don't trust me. Fine.

311
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,729
There are other
orthopedic surgeons here.

312
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,414
No, no, I want you.

313
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,883
You're the best.

314
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,639
But I nearly killed
your son-in-law.

315
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,256
Yes, you did.

316
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,309
And now I'm gonna try
and save your surgical career.

317
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,814
(monitor beeping rapidly)

318
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,027
His neck veins are distended.

319
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,347
Heart sounds are faint.

320
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,701
That combined
with your low blood pressure

321
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,927
and tachycardia...

322
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,037
Beck's triad.

323
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:36,958
Which means I have bigger
problems than just my hands.

324
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,550
I have to tell you something,

325
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,369
otherwise I'm going to explode,
but you can't get mushy,

326
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,038
and have to agree this
conversation never happened.

327
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,057
Okay.

328
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,394
I'm seeing someone.

329
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,396
He works here.

330
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,567
(laughs)

331
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,236
Well, it's about damn time.

332
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,405
Who else knows?

333
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,574
Just you and AJ's cats.

334
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,278
Oh, my God,
I have so many questions.

335
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,205
- When did it start?
- First kiss, your wedding.

336
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:14,615
First hookup,
shortly after that.

337
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,634
First fight, here.
Now you're caught up.

338
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:18,152
Wow, you're terrible at this.

339
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,970
I don't know
what else to tell you.

340
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,306
He and I are totally
on the same page.

341
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,421
Most of the time.

342
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,923
But that's another story.

343
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,419
- Now we have ground rules.
- Mm.

344
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,887
- I know all about
the ground rules.
- Exactly.

345
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,654
I had to tell someone, and
obviously that someone was you.

346
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:32,823
(laughs)

347
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,577
I'm so happy for you.

348
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,992
Thank you.

349
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,937
Wait. Where are you going?

350
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,773
(exhales)

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,850
TERRY:
Man or woman is fine.
They just...

352
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,313
they need a face
for camera, okay?

353
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,257
I'm not looking
for a supermodel, just

354
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,092
-someone to share
the frame with you.
-I get it, I get it, a face

355
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,336
- for camera.
- And a nice, safe surgery.

356
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,429
Okay? Nothing too messy.

357
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,178
Or... or sad.

358
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,491
- A quick fix
with a "ring the Bell" ending.
- Nice and safe...

359
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,268
does not make
for impactful television.

360
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,829
- We have to take
a risk here, Terry.
- Okay. Okay.

361
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:02,853
A<i> small</i> risk.

362
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:05,296
On a charismatic patient.

363
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,724
(tapping keyboard)

364
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:20,456
(chuckles)

365
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,730
Bingo.

366
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:27,968
You look familiar.

367
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,698
Are you one of those...
dancing doctors on TikTok?

368
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,809
BELL: Mr. Mackey.

369
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,032
I'm Dr. Bell, general surgeon
here at Chastain.

370
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:39,700
I'll be operating
with Dr. Okafor today.

371
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:43,075
- Where's Dr. Nolan?
- There was a schedule change.

372
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,578
Let me get to the big question
right at the top.

373
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,338
Will I have a scar?

374
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,302
-A small one.
-A lot of my followers online
are ladies, and,

375
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,918
well, let's just say they don't
follow me for my pithy captions.

376
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,715
- (Bell chuckles)
- They come for this.

377
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,073
And a handful of gents, too,
if I'm being honest.

378
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,246
So I got to keep it
looking prime time.

379
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,427
Well, Emmett,
I'm not just a doctor

380
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:02,687
here at Chastain.

381
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:05,172
I also... host a TV show.

382
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,767
And I would like to do
a feature on you.

383
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,510
We'd interview you

384
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,195
and then film the surgery.

385
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:12,772
With your permission, of course.

386
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,585
I love it. Have at it.

387
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,784
Exploit me. (laughs)

388
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,705
<i>WOMAN (over P.A.):
CT, pick up line 2292.</i>

389
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,540
<i>CT, pick up extension 2292.</i>

390
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,876
Why are there cameras here?

391
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,545
I don't want to be filmed.

392
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,131
They can't film you
without your consent.

393
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,699
Um, your chart said that

394
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,013
you have rheumatoid arthritis.
Are you on any medications?

395
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,388
Not anymore.
Nothing ever worked.

396
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,891
Hmm.

397
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:41,894
(Eva groans)

398
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,205
(whispers): Sorry.

399
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,616
- (panting)
- Where you from?

400
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,857
The Midwest.

401
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,860
Oh, my God.

402
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,625
No. I'm on television.

403
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,218
Take out my IV.

404
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,887
No, we're still waiting
on your lab results.

405
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,302
Hey, don't do that.

406
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Hey!

407
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,416
- (groans)
- We need some help over here!

408
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,818
Yep, just as expected.
The fluid around your heart

409
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:17,147
is preventing it
from pumping properly.

410
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,131
You know I'm a doctor,
too, right?

411
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,655
Your pericardial effusion is
growing and causing tamponade.

412
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,082
Why didn't you
catch this earlier?

413
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,158
When I did your initial
FAST exam in the ER,

414
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,160
it wasn't there, which means

415
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,995
two hours ago,
you couldn't even see it.

416
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,572
- So now you drain it.
- KIT: Yes.

417
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,762
But you might have
a cardiac or aortic injury

418
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,334
- that needs repair.
- My hands are

419
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,095
the painfully obvious
priority here.

420
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,930
Heart before hands, I'm afraid.

421
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,769
How long until I can operate?

422
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,583
Just enough time
for me to perform

423
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,826
a pericardiocentesis and drain.

424
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,291
Then he's all yours.

425
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:48,751
Okay.

426
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,285
This is Eva.

427
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,696
She tried to run
when she saw herself on TV.

428
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:02,214
Any explanation?

429
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,959
She's still in Bay One refusing
to answer any questions.

430
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,624
I mean, she understands
that she needs to stay, but...

431
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,464
she's still visibly shaken.

432
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,965
Head CT's negative.

433
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,179
But the labs show
she's in renal failure.

434
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,544
Spiking a fever.

435
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:16,966
I'll send for a new set of labs,

436
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,026
but we're
definitely missing something.

437
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,066
I'll try her emergency contact,

438
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,635
see if they can help us
figure out what's going on here.

439
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,774
Any news
on that other blood test?

440
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,909
The important one to us?

441
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,630
(whispers): Still waiting.

442
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,798
Hi. This is Dr. Hawkins
at Chastain Park Memorial.

443
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,581
I'm calling about Eva Wolman.

444
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,216
We just admitted her.

445
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,927
That's correct.

446
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,257
Okay. I understand.

447
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,393
Thank you.

448
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:53,173
The number Eva listed belongs
to an FBI agent.

449
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,099
He's on his way.

450
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:56,005
He says we need to secure
her area.

451
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,007
No visitors.
Direct medical personnel.

452
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,756
I'm guessing she's in some sort
of witness protection program.

453
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:03,328
Okay, well, then we should get
her a guard and a private room.

454
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,685
I'll call security.

455
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:08,247
If someone wanted to hurt Eva,
now they know where to find her.

456
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:18,549
All right, fluid has drained
from your heart.

457
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,426
Confirm with echo.

458
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,037
AUSTIN: Hmm.

459
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,895
Ham and cheese crepe.

460
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,953
I was in the cafeteria,
dining on that savory galette

461
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,961
when they told me
Chastain's next recruit

462
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,756
was<i> the</i> Barrett Cain.

463
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:44,650
The food wasn't inspiring,
but the name was.

464
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,077
Why?

465
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,319
Come on, man.

466
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,249
Another surgical god
under the same roof?

467
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,960
And a brother at that.

468
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,162
I had hoped for...

469
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,142
a colleague,

470
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,144
a comrade.

471
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,594
But, brother,
you have managed to alienate

472
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,150
every single doctor
in this hospital.

473
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:11,176
And even still,
I have my instincts.

474
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:15,498
That hope I felt
is still very much alive.

475
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,478
We know traumatic events
like this

476
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:21,164
can have a profound impact
on one's constitution.

477
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:24,668
You know? So maybe you come out
on the other side of this,

478
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,005
surgical gifts intact...

479
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:30,103
with a different outlook
on life.

480
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:34,917
Are you testifying against me
in the Mullins lawsuit?

481
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:40,609
You're too proud
not to tell me if it was you.

482
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,966
So who is it?

483
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:47,138
I will tell them to prep the OR.

484
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,357
♪

485
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,300
So, how soon
can we transfer her?

486
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,397
We don't know.

487
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,899
What do you mean you don't know?

488
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:08,637
We're trying to figure out
what's wrong with her.

489
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,197
Eva wasn't severely injured
in the crash

490
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,501
and yet her organs are failing.

491
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,887
We need to figure out
what's going on with her.

492
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:17,037
We pulled this
from your cameras.

493
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,963
This guy approached
the front desk

494
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:20,187
looking for her room number.

495
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,225
When they asked his name,
he disappeared.

496
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,061
Let's notify Chastain...
Tell them to report

497
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,125
but not engage him.

498
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,752
Should assume he's dangerous.

499
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:29,088
How much danger is she in?

500
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,717
She testified
against some powerful people.

501
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:31,849
That's all I can say.

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,478
So figure out
what's wrong with her,

503
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,062
'cause she's not safe here.

504
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:42,913
Emmett's crits
are drifting down.

505
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,989
He may have a bleed
from his spleen or liver.

506
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,179
Surgery is risky,

507
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:47,826
with the potential
for complications.

508
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,609
- Agreed.
- So filming it is unethical.

509
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:52,036
The patient consented.

510
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,183
Just because he said yes
doesn't make it right.

511
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,167
I think we should attempt
this laparoscopically.

512
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,428
We need to be focused
on what happens in the OR.

513
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,097
Our minds should be fully on
Emmett, not on cameras,

514
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:01,190
- which could...
- My mind is

515
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,547
exactly where it needs to be.

516
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,361
You don't understand...

517
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,770
No, I understand. They took
your face off the building,

518
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:07,846
so you had to find
some other place

519
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,553
to put it.

520
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,222
I'm a surgeon first.

521
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:13,391
Mm. Not today.

522
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,111
(footsteps approaching)

523
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,824
Good news.
Your labs are improving.

524
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:34,578
<i>MAN (over P.A.):
Available RN to Surgical.</i>

525
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,988
That looks painful.

526
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,002
Must have been
from the accident.

527
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,917
I've always bruised easily.

528
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,019
No, no, it's okay. It's okay,
it's okay. I just wanna see her.

529
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,571
It's all right.
I won't let him hurt you.

530
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,970
He's not here to hurt me.

531
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,723
I'm the one who hurt him.

532
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,329
I think it would be good
for them to talk to each other,

533
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:07,756
under supervision.

534
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,499
Eva's very happy to see him.

535
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:11,318
Says they've known each other
their entire lives.

536
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,525
That doesn't mean
he's not a threat.

537
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:15,505
Until we complete a full
background check on this guy,

538
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,506
we keep them separate.

539
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,507
Understood?

540
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:19,181
Okay, yeah. Fair enough.

541
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,375
- I'll talk to her.
- Mm.

542
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:27,394
I was moonlighting
at this little dive bar down on

543
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,800
Park Street, and, uh...

544
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:32,786
one day, she walked in.
(chuckles softly)

545
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,288
She looked at me, and...

546
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,458
we basically had our first date
right then and there. (chuckles)

547
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,456
Only a few months in,
we were already talking

548
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,371
about marriage.

549
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,964
I wanted a summer wedding.

550
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,172
Eva hates the cold.

551
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:46,725
So much that I-I had to get rid

552
00:24:46,877 --> 00:24:47,726
of my Bobcats season tickets.

553
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:49,545
That's how much she hates it.

554
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,947
He stopped going
to hockey games.

555
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:55,234
That's how much he loved me.

556
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,203
(chuckles)

557
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,086
And then, one day, she was gone.

558
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:09,414
No calls.

559
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,567
Nothing.

560
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,417
She wouldn't return my messages.

561
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:15,328
My friends all said
that I had moved too fast and...

562
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,384
I spooked her,
that she ghosted me.

563
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:20,259
But that didn't make any sense,
'cause we were good together.

564
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:23,073
My sister lives in Atlanta.
So when she texted me

565
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:24,377
and said that she saw Eva on TV,

566
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:26,690
I just got on
the next flight here.

567
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,061
Even if she never wanted
to see me again,

568
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,401
I needed to know why.

569
00:25:30,588 --> 00:25:33,030
I couldn't tell him why.

570
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:39,537
I blew the whistle
at the firm where I worked.

571
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,331
Insider trading.

572
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:45,042
My words sent guys to prison.

573
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,452
FBI said I had to go
into witness protection,

574
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,256
and I didn't want
to bring Darren into that.

575
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,884
I've been where you are.

576
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,053
I was a whistleblower.

577
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,108
Yeah.

578
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:00,110
And I was afraid
that doing the right thing

579
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:02,393
would hurt someone I love.

580
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:08,399
So, I know the pain
that comes with that.

581
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,776
I didn't want to hurt him.

582
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:14,196
I still don't.

583
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,961
But I still think about him.

584
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:19,743
You could tell him that.

585
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,744
- (groans softly)
- (laughs)

586
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,137
(sniffles)

587
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:24,473
- Might give you closure.
- (chuckles)

588
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:26,136
Closure.

589
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Yeah.

590
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:29,494
That could be good
for both of us.

591
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,974
(inhales sharply)

592
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:33,085
- (slurring): Could you...
- Eva. Eva.

593
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,926
Eva. Squeeze my fingers.
Squeeze my fingers.

594
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,504
Call a code stroke!

595
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,599
(phone vibrates)

596
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,485
What?

597
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,767
What is it?

598
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:46,395
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.
I have to go.

599
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,752
TERRY:
Wide... we want to feel
the whole room.

600
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,921
Get all the toys,
everything that's...

601
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,664
Soon as they land,
tight on Bell.

602
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:57,088
Get a few shots of the surgery,
but I don't want to see

603
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,094
<i>too much mess.
You, I don't want...</i>

604
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,930
Hope it's more fun being on your
show than it is watching it.

605
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,599
You've seen it?

606
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,788
Once.

607
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,439
While folding laundry.

608
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,293
You oversimplify science.

609
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,940
You referred to a minor study
as "evidence."

610
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,284
And now you're bringing
your entourage into the OR.

611
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:15,944
Also,

612
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,617
you wear too much makeup.

613
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,948
(monitors beeping)

614
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,530
His pressure's plummeting,

615
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:22,843
- heart rate's rising.
- He must be bleeding out.

616
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,224
We got to move.

617
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,871
♪

618
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,398
(monitor flatlining)

619
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,741
(sighs deeply)

620
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,120
Hey.

621
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,706
You okay?

622
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,076
Yeah. I lost a patient.

623
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:52,411
It was expected,

624
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:53,665
but still...

625
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:54,913
Is the family here?

626
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:56,489
I'll notify them for you.

627
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,378
- There's no one.
- (phone vibrates)

628
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,752
He died alone.

629
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,807
Sorry.
Losing someone's never easy.

630
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,260
I tried to get him to...

631
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,231
call his daughter, talk to her
one last time, but...

632
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:14,744
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

633
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,360
No.

634
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,340
I'm okay.

635
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,239
I just need a minute.

636
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,083
When do we expect Dr. Voss?

637
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:34,286
She's late.

638
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,714
She must be wrapping up
her last surgery.

639
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,048
Cain's already under.

640
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:40,926
He always lets us start
without him.

641
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,515
DAVIS: He used to say,

642
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,038
"How else will we learn?

643
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:46,372
"Closed eyes mean cut away.

644
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,559
No need to wait
for the attending."

645
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,946
NELSON: I need the practice.

646
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,729
10-blade to me.

647
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:54,565
Oh, crap. He's awake!

648
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,453
Up his sedation!

649
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:57,695
(gasps) Dr. Cain!

650
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,695
(alert blaring)

651
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:02,315
(grunts)

652
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,741
Dr. Cain, please...

653
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,798
(monitor beeping steadily)

654
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,748
10-blade to me.

655
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,172
Uh, Dr. Bell?
A little camera right, please.

656
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,141
Perfect.

657
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:32,853
(monitors beeping)

658
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,751
Spleen is dry.
We should have done an ex-lap.

659
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,442
The source of the bleed must be
coming from the liver lac.

660
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,921
Is it coming
from the arteries or the vein?

661
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,905
I still... I can't see a thing.

662
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,001
He's gonna bottom out soon.

663
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,305
Let's try the Pringle maneuver.

664
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,786
(beeping continues)

665
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:53,493
<i>MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i>Transition team to OR Four.</i>
<i>Transition team...</i>

666
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:54,774
How is she?

667
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:57,686
I wish we had better news.

668
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,797
Eva had a mild stroke.

669
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,948
Are you saying she could die?

670
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,197
We're monitoring her.

671
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,506
I finally find her after
all this time, and now this?

672
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,622
We're doing everything we can,
Darren.

673
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,883
But we need your help.

674
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,793
I don't understand.

675
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,314
We don't know Eva, but you do.

676
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,941
Is there anything
about her medical history

677
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,223
that you could tell us?

678
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,186
Something that could help us
figure this out.

679
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,543
Anything out of the ordinary?

680
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:25,063
I-I-I'm sorry.
Nothing's coming to mind, no.

681
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:28,141
You know, when you love someone,

682
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:30,569
we... dismiss certain things.

683
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:32,979
- Certain quirks become normal.
- Yeah.

684
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,390
What about those types
of things?

685
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,894
Yeah, yeah. She used to, uh,
try to hide her stress.

686
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:41,079
Um, especially during midterms
or finals.

687
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,656
Not many people could tell,
but I knew. (exhales)

688
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,509
She used to talk in her sleep.

689
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,827
Sometimes it was creepy, but...

690
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:49,807
most of the time,
it was pretty hilarious.

691
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,406
And she would eat, uh, odd foods

692
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:52,999
at weird times.

693
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,737
And she would break out
in this, um,

694
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,480
purple rash
every once in a while.

695
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,649
But I'm only remembering that
'cause she was so self-conscious

696
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:01,744
- of it.
- Did this rash
look like a bruise?

697
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:05,008
- U-Uh, yeah. Sort of.
- And would it come
at a certain time of year?

698
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,438
Now that you mention it, yeah.

699
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:07,513
In the winter.

700
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:08,790
Purpuric lesions.

701
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,442
Renal failure. Fever.

702
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:15,122
Combine that with her diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis...

703
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:17,249
(exhales)

704
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:22,880
NIC:
Eva, you have a condition
called cryoglobulinemia.

705
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,957
It's rare and can be mistaken
for rheumatoid arthritis.

706
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:27,937
And it's why your meds
never helped.

707
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:30,112
And why you always hated
the cold.

708
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:32,723
Cryoglobulins
are proteins in your blood.

709
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,352
They clump together
during the cold,

710
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:35,871
get trapped
in your blood vessels,

711
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,227
like a... like a traffic jam.

712
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,229
And why am I so sick now?

713
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:41,881
It was cold outside
during the accident

714
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,286
- and you weren't kept warm.
- And the nurse

715
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,363
turned the temperature down
in your room

716
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,628
because of your fever.

717
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:48,791
And this rash is...
It's actually called "purpura."

718
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:50,701
And it's due
to the cryoglobulins clumping

719
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:51,983
in the vessels in your skin.

720
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,038
And they're doing
the same thing in your brain,

721
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,638
which is why you had
a mild stroke.

722
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,635
But now we can treat you.

723
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,470
CONRAD:
We're just gonna get this blood

724
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:02,419
to the lab, confirm it.

725
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,806
(inhales)

726
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,214
We'll be right back.

727
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:11,762
(monitors beeping rapidly)

728
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,985
Who told you
to start without me?

729
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,804
We always start
without Dr. Cain, so...

730
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:20,582
Well, this is my OR.
And in my OR,

731
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,566
residents
never cut unsupervised.

732
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,643
You should have waited.

733
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,920
Step aside.

734
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,330
- (alarm beeping)
- O2 sats and BP are falling.

735
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,315
- What the hell did you do?
- We just started

736
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,151
the dissection.
It was going perfectly.

737
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,652
Well, this situation
says otherwise.

738
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:35,193
You went too deep and punctured
Cain's pleural cavity.

739
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:37,955
We need thoracic.
Page Dr. Austin.

740
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,792
(monitor beeping)

741
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,330
I still don't have
source control.

742
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:46,274
Activate
massive transfusion protocol.

743
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,943
- Get the cameras out of here.
- Just keep rolling.

744
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,778
- Don't stop shooting.
- BELL: We got this.

745
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,635
Converting to open.

746
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,893
Hold down on the liver.

747
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,016
MINA: What next?

748
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,556
Partial hepatectomy.

749
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,853
Resecting a part of his liver
could cause more bleeding.

750
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:08,129
He's already lost
half his volume.

751
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,728
He can't afford to lose more.

752
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
It's a risk we have to take,
and we've got to be perfect.

753
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,548
Retractors.

754
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:14,785
BELL: Stapler.

755
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,660
Blue load.

756
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,813
There it is.

757
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,875
- Hepatic vein bleeding.
- Right angle to me.

758
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,211
One more staple. Blue load.

759
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:29,992
MINA: Ligating the vein.

760
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,417
(stapler clacking)

761
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,928
(monitor chirps)

762
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:38,265
Bleeding stopped.

763
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,430
Call down to the blood bank
for more blood products.

764
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,931
More suction.

765
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,750
All right, Kit, lay it on me.

766
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,246
KIT: Tension pneumothorax.

767
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,696
We decompressed it,
but now he needs a chest tube

768
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,180
and a vessel repair.

769
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:57,075
Which one of you neophytes
punctured Cain's lung?

770
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,412
I need a chest tube. Scalpel.

771
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,874
- How's the view?
- Better.

772
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:05,709
I found the bleeder.

773
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:17,128
(monitor beeping)

774
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:18,941
AUSTIN:
All right, normally, this is

775
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:21,165
the part of the story
where he stabilizes.

776
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,810
Then why the hell hasn't he?

777
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,546
What is this, Bikram ICU?
It's hot in here,

778
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,789
- even for me.
- Well,

779
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:34,215
we have to keep you warm
so this machine

780
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,965
can remove the abnormal protein
from your blood.

781
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:39,370
You're gonna make a full
recovery. And now that you have

782
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,222
a proper diagnosis,
you're gonna feel

783
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,304
better than ever.

784
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,806
Thank you.

785
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:47,751
(footsteps approaching)

786
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,845
- Hi.
- DARREN: Hey.

787
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,076
So, on a scale from one to ten,

788
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,413
how, um, upset/angry are you?

789
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:10,107
At the moment,
I'm just glad you're okay.

790
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,742
I owe you
a long explanation and...

791
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,705
I really missed you.

792
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,329
I guess I thought about you
a little bit, too.

793
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:31,920
(both laugh)

794
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,090
Eva...

795
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,859
I got a job that I hate

796
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:39,930
and a special-needs bulldog
that I love.

797
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:43,890
Would it be crazy
if we came with you this time?

798
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,627
Darren, this...

799
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:50,372
isn't a decision
you make in a moment.

800
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:52,040
Trust me.

801
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,059
I've lived it.
You have to be sure.

802
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,217
I would love
for us to be together again,

803
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:01,992
but I understand
if you can't do this.

804
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:03,638
Don't try to talk me out of it.

805
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,311
I'm sure.

806
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:07,572
(both chuckle softly)

807
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,916
(both laughing)

808
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,323
- That's Mr. McCloud's daughter.
- (crying)

809
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,588
He called her before he died,

810
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,975
but she came too late
to see him.

811
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:26,808
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

812
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:28,501
(knocks)

813
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:29,686
Hi, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

814
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:32,096
I treated your father.

815
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,982
I'm...

816
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:35,859
I'm sorry.

817
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,237
If it helps,
he wasn't in any pain.

818
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,660
I wanted to see him.

819
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:52,951
(sniffles) It had been too long.

820
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,962
I thought there was time.

821
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:00,425
At least he called me.

822
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:04,888
We got to talk for a bit.

823
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,265
I got to apologize.

824
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:10,060
(sniffles)

825
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:14,064
I'm s...
I'm so glad he reached you.

826
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:17,275
And I'm so grateful to you.

827
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,154
He said
you convinced him to call.

828
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:27,077
We always think there's
so much more time, and then...

829
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,664
something happens
out of the blue.

830
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,919
(Ariana crying)

831
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,421
I'm so sorry for your loss.

832
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,070
I'll send one of our counselors
to come talk to you.

833
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,135
Thank you.

834
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:48,765
Well, as you've seen,
medicine is unpredictable.

835
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:50,411
No matter how much you prepare,

836
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,829
the human body
is full of surprises.

837
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:56,347
How you feeling?

838
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:59,495
Warm. Tingly.
Like I could hug you.

839
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,762
(chuckles) Well,
that could be the pain meds.

840
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,340
What's your handle?

841
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,428
For Twitter.

842
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,912
- Insta.
- I...

843
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:11,173
So I can follow you.

844
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:12,680
I don't do that.

845
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,269
(chuckles)

846
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,942
Give me your phone.

847
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:19,278
(Bell clears throat)

848
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:22,777
Well, I guess
I'll be doing that.

849
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,450
<i>Every day,</i>

850
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,970
patients walk through the doors
of Chastain

851
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:28,621
with different needs,

852
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,957
and our staff is ready.

853
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,719
Our doctors and nurses
work tirelessly.

854
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:37,314
They care deeply.

855
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:40,058
Sacrifice willingly.

856
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:44,637
This hospital is a cornerstone
of this community

857
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:46,881
and a center
for medical innovation,

858
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:50,068
and that's why I'm so proud

859
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:53,388
to call
Chastain Park Memorial home.

860
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,406
And cut! Fantastic.

861
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,075
We got it, Dr. Bell.

862
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:59,077
- All right?
- TERRY: Yeah.

863
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:02,580
Hey, thanks, Randolph.
You were right.

864
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:04,582
This was a smart play.

865
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:07,260
Thanks.

866
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,249
Bet you're glad
the circus is leaving town.

867
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:13,908
I was wrong.

868
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:17,062
You didn't bring
the cameras here for you.

869
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,940
You're trying to help Chastain.

870
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,152
How bad is it?

871
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:27,739
Bad.

872
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:31,534
You're not the only one
who loves this place.

873
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:34,204
So, what can we do?

874
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:38,541
What happened in there?

875
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:39,876
Cardiac tamponade.

876
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:42,098
I thought he had
a pericardial drain in place.

877
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:43,880
Yeah, he did. And it clotted.

878
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:46,009
By the time I cracked his chest
and got him on bypass,

879
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,550
15 minutes went by.

880
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:48,885
Even with cardiac massage,

881
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,273
there's no way to know
if his brain

882
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,275
was adequately perfused
for those 15 minutes.

883
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,226
But we do know we don't want
survival for survival's sake.

884
00:39:56,395 --> 00:40:00,397
We want our patients to be more
than just a body in a bed.

885
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:02,065
No matter who it is.

886
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,787
- And his hands?
- KIT: We'll have to wait

887
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:06,091
to do his brachial plexus repair

888
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,124
- when he's stabilized.
- (pager vibrating)

889
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:10,365
Yeah. That's<i> if</i> he wakes up.

890
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,704
I got to go. Keep me posted.

891
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,972
CONRAD:
Can we agree that if one of us

892
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,970
goes into witness protection,
we both do?

893
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,270
Yep, definitely.

894
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:42,330
With our chickens.

895
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:45,424
- We got to raise them right.
- (laughing)

896
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:48,403
Now that we're clear on that...

897
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,615
Are the results in?

898
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:55,410
Just a click away.

899
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,347
I may have already ordered

900
00:40:59,516 --> 00:41:02,292
a case of nonalcoholic
sparkling cider for you.

901
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:05,462
And a few other things.

902
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:06,689
Like what?

903
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:08,798
Prenatal vitamins.

904
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,467
Pregnancy pillows.

905
00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:12,171
(chuckles): What?

906
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:14,115
- Support bands.
- Wow.

907
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,284
-Oils for your stomach.
A heat wrap for your back.
-Conrad.

908
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,388
- (laughs)
- And a foot massager. I know,

909
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,346
I jumped the gun
just a little bit, but...

910
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,272
I may have bought
some oils, too.

911
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:25,206
-Huh.
-And some leggings.
Lots of leggings.

912
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,233
Oh. (chuckles)

913
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:34,635
I think we're ready.

914
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,993
Let's do it.

915
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,288
(sighs)

916
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:46,728
(chuckles softly)

917
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,730
It's official.

918
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:52,416
(inhales) It's official.

919
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:55,094
(laughs) Aw.

920
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:01,935
♪

921
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:16,199
Now, that is the only face
I want to see

922
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,326
after the day I had.

923
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:21,538
Our rule was no physical contact

924
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:24,207
inside the hospital.

925
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,211
Yeah, I don't think we ever
locked that one down completely.

926
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:31,548
Besides, you know rules
are always subject to revision.

927
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:33,219
- Mm-mm.
- No?

928
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,386
Moot, as we're not...

929
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:39,264
- inside.
- Mm-hmm.

930
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:56,125
You okay?

931
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:57,574
Yeah.

932
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,577
But there's something
about Chastain you should know.

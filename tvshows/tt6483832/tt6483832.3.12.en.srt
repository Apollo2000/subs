do that the right way.

No more spinning.

36

how to make her do that at night.

47
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:01,135

- I'm going to propose to my new nanny.

48

(CHUCKLES) Oh.

Search & Rescue, that's very funny.

- Keep an eye on her? <i>
- Of course.</i>

76

- Why you asking me that? <i>
- Oh,</i>

77
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,933
uh, no reason. No reason at all.

78
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,694
Just take care of her.

79
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,937

We have to go check on him. Let's go.

Oh. Well, look at that. I didn't know

89

doctors still made house calls.

90
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,224
I got your address from a

93
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,228
he didn't sound like himself, Adelaide.

94
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,073
Can I come in and speak with him?
I want to make sure he's okay.

95
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,565
Of course. He's taking a little nap.

96
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,181

Archer, open the door.

We've never locked that
door. Archer, answer me.

104

We need to break in
and check on him, okay?

105
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,906
- No. No, no, no, no...
- It's okay.

106
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:46,938
It's okay, Archer. What did you take?

107
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:50,465
Call 911. Tell them we have
attempted suicide by overdose.

I swear, I saw that handsome face

come across my TV, and
the next thing I know,

163
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,504
$30 disappeared right
out of my checkbook.

- on its way.
- I-I don't need an ambulance.

172
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,683
- I didn't take any of the pills.
- Archer, this is

173
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,136
an interrupted suicide attempt.

174
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:47,828
Legally, you need a
full psych evaluation.

175
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,355
I never should have had the surgery.

176
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:52,891
You have MS. You fell
and fractured your spine.

177
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,826
You were in pain. You
needed the operation.

178
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:55,912
ARCHER: But the bills.

179
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:59,007
The cost... it... it's catastrophic.

180
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:00,482
Too young for Medicare,

181
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:03,348
too much money for Medicaid,
and our insurance deductible

182
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,371
is... so high.

183
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:07,348
We're already maxed
out on what we can pay.

184
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,017
And then, after the surgery,

185
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:10,517
this arrived.

186
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,540
Chastain used an
out-of-network anesthesiologist

187
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,343
who charged $15,000?

188
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:22,343
Did Chastain make you aware
of the out-of-network cost?

189
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:25,328
No. But we thought
that it was a mistake.

190
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,227
We couldn't pay that,
so Red Rock sued us.

191

What now? W-We go
bankrupt? And now my wife

- Shh.

You are not ending up on the street.

He pulled it out. He
pointed it at his head.

215
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,149
I tried to grab it from
him, and it went off,

Uh, it was a while ago.

00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,679
It started off a little light gray,

231
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,323
but then it just kept going from there.

232
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,802
You know, I read an article that
said it would cure everything.

have a bit of a problem here"?

Where's the nearest drugstore?

I can run out and grab batteries.

310
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,822
A drugstore won't carry
that kind of battery.

311
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,407
We need a hospital or
the device manufacturer.

I'll call Life Flight, see
if they can arrange a chopper.

317
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:49,767
and Life Flight doesn't
have a free chopper.

318
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,700
The manufacturer has
batteries, but they're not local

319
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,102
and can't get them here in time.

320
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:56,130
The nearest hospital is
Chastain, three hours away.

321
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:58,857
So this woman will die because we're
too far from a friggin' battery?

322
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,203
Don't forget the portable ultrasound.

323
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,396
<i>AUSTIN: Already in
with the VAD batteries.</i>

324
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,948
Go. I'll text you the coordinates

325
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,422
of the clinic van... with any luck,

326
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,482
you'll meet them there halfway.

327
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,212
<i>- So if we</i> don't hit any red lights...
<i>- You'll have a chance</i>

328
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,798
to get the new batteries into
your patient before she dies.

329
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,136
- And, Mina...
- Ready?

330
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,699
Okay, we're leaving. Thank you.

331
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:19,795
Drive safely.

332
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:23,057
Whoa, whoa. Uh, you ever
get any speeding tickets?

333
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,808
- No.
- Then I'm driving.

334
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,979
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

335
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,215
Gunshot wound in the abdomen.

336
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:34,849
BP: 80/50. Heartrate: 140.

337
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,553
We got to get him to the O.R.

338
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,405
You know we have to take
this from here, right?

339
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,242
Hey. We got him.

340
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,769
I promise.

341
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,970
Dr. Hawkins, please go
with him. You're his doctor.

342
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,346
I can't.

343
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,739
BELL: Wow, look who's back.

344
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,784
- Oh, you look great.
- Oh, thank you.

345
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:59,409
Oh. (LAUGHS)

346
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,763
My hair's still growing
back, so hence the wig.

347
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,481
- Oh.
- Yeah,

348
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:07,304
but at least I'm clear
for work, in theory.

349
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,018
Well, Chastain's made a few changes.

350
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,725
There are two new scrub nurses.
We're looking for a third.

351
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,849
So you won't be working
any more double shifts.

352
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,185
Yeah. Doesn't look like
I'll be working at all.

353
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:18,804
I'm not on any surgeon's schedule.

354
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:22,140
Well, word probably hasn't
gotten around that you're back.

355
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:23,284
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,027
Or...

357
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:27,646
your colleagues just
want to ease you in.

358
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,591
Or... no one trusts me
in an operating room,

359
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:32,984
because my brain is, um...

360
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,706
Oh, like in a-a skillet, a-an egg...

361
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,491
Your brain is not fried.

362
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,159
- Yeah.
- That's normal.

363
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,379
You're gonna have trouble
finding words for a while.

364
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,860
You're recovering from major surgery.

365
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,216
Do you have any trouble understanding

366
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:48,433
words that are spoken to you?

367
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,478
No.

368
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,462
Then you are ready.

369
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:55,298
And you'll be with me
today. Put her in six.

370
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,976
No. No, no, no. You don't have
to do that just to be nice.

371
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:00,846
Ask around.

372
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:03,324
Nobody's ever accused me of being nice.

373
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,325
(LAUGHS)

374
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
I'll see you in the O.R.

375
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,985
BELL: Bowel is torn to shreds.

376
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:17,338
NOLAN: Mm, close-range
bullet. No surprises there.

377
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,747
BELL: Lap pad.

378
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,749
At least no major vessels were hit.

379
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,901
NOLAN: Lucky guy.

380
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,585
So you thinking colostomy here, or...

381
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,422
BELL: Oh, I hope not. That'd
be a disaster for this man.

382
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:28,373
He already has MS.
That's enough to deal with

383
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:29,758
without a colostomy bag.

384
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,809
Do you need the...

385
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,022
Retractor.

386
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,439
Yes. Perfect.

387
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,988
Why couldn't Dr. Hawkins go with Archer?

388
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:48,560
Because he doesn't work here anymore.

389
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:50,538
He doesn't? Why not?

390
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:52,522
The hospital let him go.

391
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,450
People are very upset.

392
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:56,067
(SIGHS)

393
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,253
They've got to be insane.

394
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:03,585
When do we hear from the surgeon?

395
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,385
As soon as the operation is over.

396
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,705
I don't understand...

397
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:10,390
how this happened.

398
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,090
How could I not see that
he was planning this?

399
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:20,233
What kind of wife am I?

400
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:24,054
Adelaide, I...

401
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,723
I-I don't know your husband.

402
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,575
But I do know one thing.

403
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:31,394
You didn't see any of this

404
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:33,563
because Archer didn't
want you to see it.

405
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:36,667
ADELAIDE: We always told
each other everything.

406
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,419
KYLE: He was protecting you

407
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,170
because he loves you.

408
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,537
And he blames himself

409
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:47,385
for all this trouble that
you're both in, and...

410
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,956
So he feels ashamed.

411
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:53,328
I'm sure that he's
been racking his brain

412
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:55,460
trying to find any way out of this,

413
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:59,181
any way to live out
his life with you and...

414
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:02,192
still make sure that you're safe.

415
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:06,821
But he just couldn't
find any other answer.

416
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,194
Any way to save the
person that he loves...

417
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:13,953
and stop being a burden.

418
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,627
If someone is desperate enough...

419
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,623
the worst solution in the world

420
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,173
starts to look like a
pretty damn good thing.

421
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,891
Says take a left here. Now.

422
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,647
(VAD BEEPS LOUDER)

423
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,391
I-It's louder. Wh-Why is it doing that?

424
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:45,010
That's the VAD system telling
us that more battery has drained.

425
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,153
How much longer do I have?

426
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:47,229
15 minutes.

427
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,513
Maybe half an hour.

428
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,324
Then it will go to the backup battery,

429
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,285
- and another 15 minutes.
- Where's the ambulance?

430
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,404
It's saying we're
still 52 minutes apart.

431
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:56,738
CLARA: If we both go faster,

432
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,198
we can still make it together in time.

433
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,741
This is my fault.

434
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,860
I didn't need to see a doctor.

435
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,047
Stop that. They're my batteries.

436
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,155
They're my responsibility.

437
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,840
I forgot 'em, and...

438
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,550
here we are.

439
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,946
Pay attention, Joyce.

440
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,157
Social security numbers.

441
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,186
Bank account passwords.

442
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:22,172
Um, the combo for the lock on my bike.

443
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:24,692
I know nobody rides
it, but just in case.

444
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,935
In the left-hand drawer
in the laundry room

445
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:30,397
are the appliance warranties
and also the instructions

446
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:31,773
for the remote control.

447
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,481
I guess you get to watch your game shows

448
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,659
every night after all.

449
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:38,947
Joyce.

450
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,450
All this time...

451
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:43,043
your heart,

452
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,379
the batteries.

453
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,927
I thought I was taking care of you.

454
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,553
But you've been taking care of me.

455
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,680
We've been taking care of each other.

456
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,136
All right, here's where I keep the gold.

457
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,639
Wha... Gold?

458
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,592
I'm kidding. But I do have that
jar of pennies in the pantry.

459
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:10,595
(SIGHS) The ambulance that's meeting us

460
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,030
better have its sirens on.

461
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,432
Can I have a word?

462
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,940
Absolutely.

463
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,442
I need to tell you something.
It's a little awkward.

464
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,194
Randolph Bell.

465
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:28,113
Used to be CEO, now he's not.

466
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:31,095
Used to be chief of
surgery. That's all done.

467
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,454
The guy can get his hands on the ball,

468
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,171
but he can't keep it in the air.

469
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,526
That hasn't been my impression.

470
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,876
- What's your point?
- Don't get me wrong,

471
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:39,266
Bell's a decent salesman,
and the company will be fine,

472
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,634
but... it could be more than fine.

473
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:45,021
I can help increase
revenues exponentially

474
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,350
through better marketing.

475
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:48,209
You shouldn't have to
waste your valuable time

476
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,351
with that penny-ante stuff.

477
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:52,459
I'm having dinner
tonight with an investor

478
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,889
from a major advertising firm.

479
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:57,434
You should join us.

480
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,786
Sounds promising. Count me in.

481
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,455
I'll do that.

482
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:14,468
Adelaide said you were out here.

483
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,036
The surgery was a success.

484
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,305
We repaired enough of the bowel,
he won't need an ostomy.

485
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,957
So he will recover.

486
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,720
Well, there's no cure for the MS.

487
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:28,316
And he'll need treatment
for his suicidal depression.

488
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,559
He won't be able to pay for any of that.

489
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,027
Do you know why he shot himself?

490
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,089
- No, I don't.
- Mm.

491
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,972
Chastain billed him for an
out-of-network anesthesiologist

492
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:44,863
and then added on over
100,000 in unspecified charges

493
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:46,983
- that his insurance can't pay.
- (SIGHS)

494
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,639
And then, just to kick
him while he's down,

495
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,323
Red Rock sued him.

496
00:21:57,203 --> 00:22:00,347
I won't bill for my
surgery today, and...

497
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you. That's a start.

498
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,392
And as for the rest of it,
I'll see what I can do.

499
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:07,855
You know, what Red Rock
did to you was not right.

500
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,398
Well, they haven't treated
you so well, either.

501
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,862
What can I do for you?

502
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:18,389
Archer's my patient, and I'm
not even allowed to see him.

503
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,533
Nothing's filling that void.

504
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,354
<i>MINA: Where's the ambulance now?</i>

505
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,176
It's been in the same place for
three minutes. Traffic, maybe?

506
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:41,221
We're still 30 minutes away.

507
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:42,556
(VAD CONTINUES BEEPING)

508
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:43,887
It says "backup battery mode".

509
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:45,634
- No! No, no, no.
- It's okay.

510
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:48,262
- That means 15 minutes left. Keep driving.
- Joyce...

511
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,255
- Drive faster.
- Joyce!

512
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:52,733
I got five years out of this machine.

513
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:56,175
Bonus years I wouldn't have
had if it hadn't been for you

514
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,905
taking care of me through
the operation, and after.

515
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:02,158
They were good years.

516
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,453
Thank you.

517
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:14,087
Pull over.

518
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,998
We still might be able
to reach them in time.

519
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,450
Math says we won't. Pull over.

520
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:20,819
Bianca, we are not giving up on you.

521
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,414
Everyone in this van knows
the same thing: it's over.

522
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:27,267
You know where I don't want to die?

523
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,352
The back seat of a van.

524
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:33,515
When I go out of this world,

525
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:37,093
it's gonna be under the blue sky

526
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:40,355
with the sun on my face.

527
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,114
With my sister.

528
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:57,247
NIC: Clara's down the road.

529
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:59,641
She'll wave down the ambulance
that's carrying the battery.

530
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:02,377
BIANCA: Be straight with me. This is it.

531
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,287
We all know it can't get here in time.

532
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:05,973
There's still a chance.

533
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,432
Nic, listen.

534
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:12,387
I don't want any heroics.

535
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:15,606
No CPR that could break my ribs.

536
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:23,640
I promise.

537
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:24,991
Thank you.

538
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,027
What'll it be like

539
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:37,587
when it happens?

540
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,416
Uh...

541
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,918
well, the...

542
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,679
the battery will stop,

543
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,764
and, um, you might feel a little dizzy.

544
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:53,169
And then you'll close your eyes and...

545
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,689
it will feel like falling asleep.

546
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,049
That's good.

547
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,193
Peaceful.

548
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,320
That's how I want it.

549
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,365
We know

550
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,325
you did everything you could.

551
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,354
Now, shoo.

552
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:14,041
I want to do my dying
alone... (CHUCKLES)

553
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:15,416
with my sister.

554
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,544
I love you so much.

555
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,723
The battery's less than ten miles away.

556
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:32,426
- That's too far.
- So we keep her alive until it comes.

557
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:34,808
- We can't do that.
- We can. If she's not down for long...

558
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,088
Mina, stop.

559
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:38,981
She doesn't want a violent death.

560
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,769
Jessie.

561
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,321
- (PANTING)

562
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:49,241
(FLATLINE)

563
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,322
That moment outside her room...

564
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:57,124
when it was happening and
there was nothing I could do.

565
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:01,921
At least this...

566
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,759
we can let Bianca go the way she wants.

567
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:10,054
That we can do.

568
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:15,477
(BEEPING SLOWING)

569
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:17,795
It's slowing down.

570
00:26:17,796 --> 00:26:19,605
Battery's running out.

571
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,693
I'm glad it's sunny today.

572
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,115
It's pretty.

573
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:30,141
Quiet.

574
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:32,694
She gets to hold her sister's hand...

575
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,537
while she dies.

576
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:38,958
At least they have that.

577
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,093
(FLATLINE)

578
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,152
Uh...

579
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:08,155
I'm actually not dead at all.

580
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:10,031
She's alive!

581
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:15,223
- BIANCA: Oh...
- Oh, my God.

582
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:16,997
My heart's beating.

583
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:19,574
- What?
- Well, that's different.

584
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,882
- I'm definitely not dead.
- (JOYCE LAUGHS)

585
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:24,821
Well, unless this is...

586
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:26,656
- No, this can't be Heaven.
- (LAUGHS)

587
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:28,508
I mean, it's nice here,

588
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:30,993
but there should be,
like, a river of ice cream

589
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:33,775
and a field of roses and Chris Pine.

590
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,915
Her pulse is strong and regular.

591
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,351
The VAD must have given
her heart time to repair.

592
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:41,854
Now that the VAD stopped,
her heart is working again.

593
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:52,899
How you feeling?

594
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,643
Let me guess: method actor

595
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,854
prepping for his Blue
Man Group audition.

596
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:00,509
Ooh! Smurf superfan.

597
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,400
Patient information is private.

598
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,336
(GROANS) I'm so tired of rules.

599
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:11,532
Nadine, what's really going on?

600
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:15,797
I hit my head. That was real.

601
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,183
But when I got here,
I was happy to see you.

602
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:22,971
You probably think this is silly, but...

603
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:25,832
most people act all weird
because I'm a princess.

604
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,500
With a guard always around,

605
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:30,478
I'm never alone, but...

606
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,930
But you're always lonely.

607
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:35,984
You understand me.

608
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,705
I still can't keep you here overnight.

609
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:42,064
But...

610
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,250
maybe there's something we can do.

611
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,740
To be clear, now that
I'm not dead, I take back

612
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:52,592
that thing I said about your game shows.

613
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:53,676
I can live with that.

614
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,505
Cardiac function is sufficient.

615
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,507
Did I even need the
VAD in the first place?

616
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,400
Yeah. The VAD saved your life.

617
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,585
And then once it was in you,

618
00:29:02,586 --> 00:29:04,604
it gave your heart enough time to heal.

619
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,440
If that battery hadn't run
out, we never would have known.

620
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,607
(BEEPING)

621
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:12,970
Now that there's no blood

622
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:14,631
running through the VAD, it's clotting.

623
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:17,450
We need to get her to Chastain now.

624
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,936
- Get the gurney.
- I'm gonna call ahead to book an O.R.

625
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:22,546
- What's wrong?
- We need to get the VAD out.

626
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:24,774
There's a clot, and if it dislodges,

627
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,367
it could be bad.

628
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:28,919
You mean my sister could die?

629
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:32,715
This time for real.

630
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,792
The gunshot guy was exciting, sure,

631
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,983
but five people with sniffles,

632
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,893
a princess looking for love,

633
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:44,410
and a blue guy who
caused his own problems...

634
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,836
I mean, come on.

635
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:47,463
Wait, why are we out here?

636
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,633
Seems like you need
a break from the E.R.

637
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:54,628
Tell me, Ezra, why do you
want to go into anesthesiology

638
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:55,977
after intern year?

639
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:58,606
Fascinating physiology. High stakes.

640
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:00,398
Life and death every day.

641
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,021
What else?

642
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,407
To be honest, great hours.

643
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:09,860
And I like patients who can't talk

644
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,862
because they're asleep.

645
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,340
Do you have OCD, Ezra?

646
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:15,060
What? No, I do not.

647
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:17,702
That's absurd.

648
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:18,920
I've seen you pick at your buttons,

649
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:21,246
double-check your
stethoscope's in your pocket,

650
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:22,707
check your phone a billion times.

651
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:26,427
Fine, I-I'm... I'm
a control freak, okay?

652
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:29,653
I also check the lock on my door

653
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,549
ten times before bed.

654
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,642
I buy pillowcases in bulk

655
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,152
because I need a fresh one every day.

656
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:36,554
I get up in the middle of the night

657
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:37,847
to make sure the stove is really off.

658
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:41,034
But that's because I'm super careful.

659
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,444
If you're an anesthesiologist,
that's a virtue,

660
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:46,397
because you can't make a single mistake.

661
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:48,332
I respect super careful.

662
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:56,196
So why don't you take another
look at Blue Billy's scans.

663
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,370
Fusion of the vertebral bodies.

664
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,223
Bamboo spine.

665
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:05,264
Mix with long-term chronic
aches and pains, you get?

666
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:09,086
Ankylosing spondylitis.

667
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:11,306
An autoimmune disease. Very treatable.

668
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:12,381
Ezra...

669
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:14,216
the desire for perfection,

670
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:17,053
checking things again and again...

671
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:19,697
all your patients need that.

672
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,468
Let's go give Blue Billy the news.

673
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,293
It's a manageable condition.

674
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:29,607
We'll get you set up with a specialist,

675
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,418
and your pain will be
under control in no time.

676
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:33,328
And everyone said the
pain was in my head.

677
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,754
It's why I took the silver.

678
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,923
Hey. How long before
the blue fades away?

679
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:43,579
Um...

680
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,247
never.

681
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,807
I'm sorry.

682
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,272
Awesome. (CHUCKLES)

683
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:53,514
Eh.

684
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:54,774
(SHORT CHUCKLE)

685
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,923
AUSTIN: I've put in hundreds of VADs,

686
00:31:56,924 --> 00:31:58,928
but I've never taken
one out for this reason.

687
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,195
MINA: Hmm.

688
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:03,450
Bianca's ventricle is clear.

689
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:05,476
Now I will repair it.

690
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,478
Pledgeted Prolene.

691
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,456
AUSTIN: It's funny.

692
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:12,292
The liver is the only organ
that can regenerate itself,

693
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:15,295
but the heart...

694
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,538
it can repair.

695
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,540
Evolve.

696
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,884
Adapt to meet its circumstances.

697
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,763
You're poetic today.

698
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,475
Yeah.

699
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,309
I guess I am.

700
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:34,055
Ready to take her off bypass.

701
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:36,190
Let's see how she does
on her own, shall we?

702
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,993
MINA: Hmm.

703
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:55,709
Her heart is strong and healthy.

704
00:32:56,862 --> 00:32:58,754
All on her own.

705
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:05,536
And yet another Hollywood ending

706
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:08,038
to an Austin-Okafor medical story.

707
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,851
(CHUCKLES) It almost wasn't.

708
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:14,103
I really thought Bianca
was gonna die on that road.

709
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:18,232
She said everything she
needed to say to her sister.

710
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:20,629
She was at peace.

711
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,389
Also, it's an...

712
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,701
Okafor-Austin medical story.

713
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,186
(CHUCKLES)

714
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:31,871
Second billing.

715
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,564
I'll take it.

716
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:34,565
This time.

717
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:40,404
What would you say?

718
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:43,507
You know, if you knew
it was your last hour?

719
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,554
I don't know what I would say.

720
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:49,538
But I do know

721
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:52,559
the person I would say it to...

722
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,393
is you.

723
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:00,023
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

724
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:08,741
Our relationship

725
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:12,244
is one of the most
important ones in my life.

726
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:16,039
It is perfect.

727
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,086
Just like this.

728
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:30,338
Well, like I said in there,

729
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:33,015
the heart can adapt.

730
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:38,179
So you have a good night,

731
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,855
Mina Okafor.

732
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,176
Hold on, where are you taking her?

733
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,318
For a quick scan.

734
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:00,368
No visitors allowed.

735
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,629
We're not really going
for scans, are we?

736
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,630
Nope.

737
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:11,206
CONRAD: Is your car ready?

738
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:13,455
I can take you to pick it up.

739
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,251
Oh! No, I think I'm gonna
walk out to the impound lot.

740
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:17,977
It's not too far away.

741
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:20,313
I need the exercise.

742
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:21,939
A little time alone with my thoughts.

743
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:28,321
That was one hell of a day, hmm?

744
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:30,514
You're a hero, you know?

745
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:32,411
If you hadn't jumped in to stop Archer

746
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:33,731
from shooting himself, he'd be dead.

747
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,340
No, man, I was supposed
to keep an eye on him.

748
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,479
He should never have gotten
to the gun in the first place.

749
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,148
- That's on me.
- I think you should give

750
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:40,290
yourself a break.

751
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:43,652
Hey,

752
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,921
why don't you come
over to our place later?

753
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:48,841
I'm tired.

754
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,718
- Thanks, though.
- Come on,

755
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,494
we'll order some pizza
with Nic. It'll be fun.

756
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:55,423
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

757
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,424
I think you could use it.

758
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:00,502
My ass just got fired, so... (CHUCKLES)

759
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:01,853
I know I could use it.

760
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,650
Uh, not tonight.

761
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:10,195
Thank you.

762
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:30,625
This is the best scan I've ever tasted.

763
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,576
I guess I just had a case of...

764
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:34,578
trapped-with-a-guard-itis.

765
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:36,689
(LAUGHS) They didn't teach
me that in med school.

766
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,040
Mm.

767
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,542
You know, I wanted to be a doctor.

768
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,543
Really?

769
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:43,062
Yeah.

770
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:45,973
I really liked the
idea of helping people.

771
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:49,551
But my parents put the kibosh on that.

772
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:52,779
Not a life for a princess.

773
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:56,266
My life is very controlled.

774
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:59,514
Look. This is the front of my apartment.

775
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,015
What do you see?

776
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,398
That's a camera.

777
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:04,400
Over there, an alarm.

778
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,402
And this one,

779
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,903
another camera.

780
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:09,947
The whole place is like that...

781
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:13,900
alarms and cameras everywhere.

782
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,978
(SIGHS) They look like they're
there to keep enemies out,

783
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:18,264
but, really,

784
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:21,099
they're keeping princesses caged in.

785
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:26,088
Well...

786
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,182
you're free-range now.

787
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:29,258
(CHUCKLES)

788
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,110
For a short time.

789
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:33,612
Thank you.

790
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:38,192
I'd like to see you again.

791
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:40,787
Yeah.

792
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,829
Please.

793
00:37:45,442 --> 00:37:48,277
You're not gonna make
the first move, are you?

794
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:50,279
- I'm at work. I...

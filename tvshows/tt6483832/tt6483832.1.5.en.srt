I am.

I just, I don't know how

through everything, okay?

00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,409
Okay.

Hey, I've got an idea.

- You have one of those?
- Yep,

328
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,461
and you can see it,
if it's okay with your mom.

329
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:16,046
(WHISPERING): Yes. Baby, go.

You know, I thought
about going into medicine.

Bell's doing Christina and Ed's
surgeries at the same time?

Not if I have anything to do with it.

Yeah. I'll see you inside, okay, Gus?

Sure thing, Doc.

Do you have time for
a triple "A" repair?

Bell scheduled my patient
concurrently with another.

385
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,230
I don't know;
I'm pretty jammed up today.

00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,428
How urgent is it?

387
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,758
Nic, I already told you, we
transfer Christine to St. Joe's.

388
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,358
I reached out to Dr. Reyes.

389
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,581
He has an opening, no HODAD,
everybody wins.

390
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,102
You can't make crazy moves like that.

391
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:07,697
You send a patient to another hospital

392
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,934
and Claire will swallow
your medical career whole.

393
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,868
No one needs to know;
my plan is bulletproof.

394
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:13,483
Unless you get shot down in the process.

395
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,557
You're getting awfully cautious
these days, brother.

396
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,177
You're getting awfully
reckless, brother.

397
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:19,274
A little reminder, we'll all
on the same team here.

398
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,944
Look, it sounds like Christine's stable,

399
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,546
so I'll do her surgery after Gus.

400
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,380
It'll be tight, but it's doable.

401
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,983
She's gonna need to request a switch

402
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,778
- or Bell will come for my head.
- Of course.

403
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,218
All right, sounds good?

404
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,588
- Yeah, thanks.
- No. "Tight" sounds like

405
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:34,102
- a disaster waiting to happen.
- Well, I wasn't asking you.

406
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:35,279
Well, I'm telling you

407
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,237
that making medical choices
for the wrong reasons

408
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,917
- isn't very smart, Silva.
- And what exactly does that mean, huh?

409
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,510
Conrad, it's the right call.
He's just trying to help.

410
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,244
I'll see Christine in surgery.

411
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,761
Thanks.

412
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,529
What's going on with you?

413
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,829
MARSHALL: This is incredible.

414
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,964
All funded by cancer patients?

415
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,094
And an early investment
in a groundbreaking drug for lymphoma.

416
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,435
I love breaking ground.

417
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:20,704
Well, that's encouraging.

418
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,505
As I tell all investors,

419
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,384
you need to be driven by
the desire to care for patients

420
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,095
as well as for the return,

421
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,547
since most of these drugs never
really make it to market.

422
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:33,350
Dr. Lane, I don't like many people,

423
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,952
but I like you.

424
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:37,555
So I'll be brutally honest. (SIGHS)

425
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:41,058
I'm driven by one thing:
betting on the right horse.

426
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:44,895
It requires my full focus
and a lot of personal sacrifice.

427
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,196
(CHUCKLING): Just ask
my ex-wife and son.

428
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:48,999
Success comes with a price.

429
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,235
And sometimes, that price is family.

430
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:55,339
But, Doctor, you have
my undivided attention.

431
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:56,740
It doesn't happen often.

432
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,341
What do you have to offer?

433
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,810
I'm happy to give you a breakdown

434

I just... I got a lot going on and...

439
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,864
but now I'm all good.

440
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,796

punch Jude in the face.

442
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,813
Oh, I just was trying to do
the best thing for Christine

443
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,505
and you and Jude, you weren't into it,

444
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,376
- so I let it go.
- You know it's okay to talk

445
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:35,678
about things other than
patients and medicine.

446
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,781
We can talk about our lives.

447
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,093
Not a sign of weakness.
You get that, right?

448
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,307
Okay, okay.

449
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,589
Go ahead. Fire away.

- Nic.
- Mom or Dad, you pick,

452
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,862
because, honestly, after all this time,

453
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,964
I still don't know much
about either of them.

454
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:57,733
My parents split.
My dad kept me from my mom

455
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:59,802
and then she passed away. You know that.

456
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,581
Dad, well...

457
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,978
I hate him.

458
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,681
You would, too.

459
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,415
Why?

460
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,297
Because he's the last guy

461
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,589
anyone would want as a father
in every conceivable...

00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,155
But why?

463
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,331
You know I'm not a kid.

464
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:30,833
I don't need you to hold my hand

465
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,769
and talk me through all my feelings

466
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,672
about all the bad stuff, okay?

467
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:38,175
Not everyone needs that.

a few of these surgeries.

that is important:

I have an opening in my schedule

496
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:18,008
which will be filled by York Evans.

And you, Dr. Pravesh, will
present the case to me.

It better be flawless.

Dr. Pravesh will review
the facts for us.

that the foreign body

after a formal apology is made.

792
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:39,170
Give or take.

793
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:43,358
Well, I'm confident we'll be at the
higher end of those estimates.

The M and M conference...

796
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,803
I heard it was pretty tense.

797
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:54,183
Yeah.

798
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,389
(EXHALES)

799
00:39:59,215 --> 00:40:02,609
When a doctor questions the practices

800
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:05,733
of this hospital and its physicians

801
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,881
to the extent that
Dr. Leonard is doing...

802
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,748
it has a detrimental effect.

803
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,272
Wouldn't you agree?

804
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,795
Consider it handled.

805
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,342
And Dr. Okafor?

806
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:30,748
BELL: One of the most gifted
surgical residents I've ever seen.

807

<i>She is invaluable.</i>

809

IRVING: It's a multistep process.

810
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:41,522
Yeah, just unsubscribe me.

811
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,350
But you're still
in your free trial period.

812
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,319
I'm gonna block you from my phone.

813
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,599
I'll circumnavigate.

Sorry about Bell.

Dick move.

818
00:40:58,006 --> 00:40:59,444
First question...

819
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:00,979
You only get one.

820
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:02,813
Where are you going?

821
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,389
To unwind.

822
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:08,508
Does Devon get a question?

823
00:41:08,518 --> 00:41:11,201
Uh, will you ask her
if she's going to unwind alone?

824
00:41:11,212 --> 00:41:15,738
With a boyfriend? Just a friend?
Does she<i> have</i> friends?

It's fine. I'm fine.

158
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,478
You're not fine. You got arrested.

159
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,238
You see any handcuffs? I'm okay.

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,057
Can we just please go?

161
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,577
What the hell happened?
You got into a fight?

162
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,464
- It was schoolyard stuff.
- Between two grown men?

163
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:57,788
Well, he threw the first punch.

164
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,941
The police agree that I'm
innocent, so they released me.

165
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,828
- Who were you fighting?
- This guy, he bought my car.

166
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,295
He had buyer's remorse, he
thought I'd take it back.

167
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:08,241
- And then he made fun of my hat.
- Wait, you-you sold your car?

168
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,618
You've had that car for 20 years.

169
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,245
Nic, nothing lasts forever.

170
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,631
Dad.

171
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,008
- I'm worried about you.
- (PANTING)

172
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,643
Yes, look... Okay, I've
been a-a little down lately.

173
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:23,102
But who doesn't hit a rough
patch every now and then?

174
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:25,438
I'm fine.

175
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:27,820
I promise.

176
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:36,029
AUSTIN: Well, the repeat
cultures are negative.

177
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,955
Plus no fever in two days.

178
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,815
Which means your infection is clearing.

179
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:43,484
So I finally get to hold my baby?

180
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,853
Yes, indeed.

181
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:48,789
However, the results
happen to be so good that...

182
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,377
We can discharge you and send
you home with oral antibiotics.

183
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,287
Yes! Ah...

184
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:57,832
Thank you both so much for everything.

185
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,491
- You got it.
- I can't wait to have Michelle in my arms

186
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,554
- and finally to be able to get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:04,723
(SIGHS)

188
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,223
Do you think she'll know who I am?

189
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,715
I'm sure she'll know

190
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:12,155
by the love you give her.

191
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,699
(CHUCKLES)

192
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,327
- ADAKU: Look at how cute she is.
- MINA: Yeah.

193
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,854
(EXHALES)

194
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:21,147
As my admitting resident,

195
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,333
you are gatekeeper
to the medicine floor.

196
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,576
And when I say "gatekeeper",

197
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:27,057
I mean you are to be a blocking machine.

198
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:30,663
Mrs. Allen, 68-year-old female
with alcoholic pancreatitis.

199
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,006
Know what went wrong here?

200
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,483
She binged on alcohol and
gave herself pancreatitis?

201
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,884
Wrong. The ER were too
slow giving her a benzo,

202
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,665
so now we're stuck chasing
her withdrawal symptoms.

203
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,556
That's not entirely
fair. The ER is always...

204
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,877
Mr. Hopper, 80-year-old man.

205
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,879
Fell in his home, sprained his hip.

206
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:45,914
Care to guess the mistake?

207
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,600
He's an elderly man who lives alone

208
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:51,353
- and he needs discharge planning.
- Which could have been done

209
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,605
while he was waiting in the
ER. Instead, he's taking up

210
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,181
one of our beds,
waiting for a placement.

211
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,200
I could go on, but the trend is clear.

212
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:00,704
We're accepting patients from
the ER that don't belong here.

213
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,231
Look, I agree that these patients

214
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,191
in particular could
have been managed better,

215
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:08,003
but most of the patients on
this floor do need to be here.

216
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:15,218
I know you're not a
pure medicine resident,

217
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,388
that you've been tainted by
habits you learned in the ER.

218
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,559
- I wouldn't say that...
- But you're on this team now.

219
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,353
So, what are you going to be?

220
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:27,880
A blocking machine.

221
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:31,318
A blocking... machine.

222
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:36,198
(BUSY CHATTER)

223
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,576
Dr. Hawkins...

224
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:43,396
this is Bill Landry,
owner of Georgia FC.

225
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,924
Son, I have a team of top
doctors from St. John's

226
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,123
who take care of my players.

227
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,610
I don't know who you are
or why you were on my field.

228
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:52,255
Why exactly did you poach
a patient from St. John's

229
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,749
- and bring him here?
- That's not what happened.

230
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:54,758
I don't care.

231
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,061
I want Dax transferred to
St. John's immediately.

232
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,929
Well, that would be a bad idea.

233
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,415
Dax has sustained significant
injuries to his chest

234
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,843
and his abdomen, leading
to multiple broken ribs,

235
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,295
lung contusions,
lacerations to his spleen.

236
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,255
I trust that, when he stabilizes,

237
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:11,399
you'll make that transfer
happen as soon as possible.

238
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,592
Y-You have my word.

239
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:16,245
And I apologize for the
inconvenience. I-I hope...

240
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,894
Bill Landry is the
richest man in Georgia,

241
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:25,646
and in one morning you have
him pissed off at Chastain.

242
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:28,649
You shouldn't have been anywhere
near Dax Ramsey to begin with.

243
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,683
He asked for a second
opinion, so I helped.

244
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:34,781
He's at Chastain now, so your
services are no longer required.

245
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:35,929
Treating a patient

246
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,213
without hospital privileges
is against the law.

247
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:40,161
I'm not treating him.

248
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,363
I'm here as a friend.

249
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:44,883
Which gives Dr. Hawkins
every right to stay.

250
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:47,643
If you so much as lay
a finger on Dax Ramsey,

251
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,813
I'll have you thrown out and sued.

252
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,779
Wow. You guys already boarding
patients in the hallway?

253
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,315
One of those days.

254
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,859
- You here for my admit?
- First one of the day.

255
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:15,203
Riley, this is Dr. Pravesh.
He's gonna do an assessment.

256
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,248
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
Hey, can I do the thing?

257
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,953
The floor is yours.

258
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,419
Riley Jackson, 28-year-old female.

259
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,992
Five hours of sudden
onset nausea and vomiting.

260
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,258
- Did I get it right?
- Nailed it.

261
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,335
And that's vomiting with a capital "V".

262
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,429
I can't even keep crackers down.

263
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,356
It's good to meet you, Riley.

264
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,175
Uh, can you tell me
when all this started?

265
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,434
Uh, this morning.

266
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,178
I woke up fine, dropped
my daughter off at school.

267
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,555
And then on the drive back home...

268
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:41,889
- Capital "V"?
- Yeah.

269
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,652
- Hmm.
- All over my steering wheel.

270
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:44,890
It was not pretty.

271
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,584
Okay. I'm gonna talk to
Dr. Feldman and figure out

272
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,836
- the best way to take care of you, okay?
- Thank you so much.

273
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,950
- All right. We'll be right back.
- Thanks.

274
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,860
Hey, this looks like gastroenteritis.

275
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,194
- This is a soft admit.
- Yeah...

276
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,863
Got you there, Feldman.

277
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,290
Give it a few more hours of
continuous fluids and meds.

278
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,869
Are you seriously
blocking this admission?

279
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:07,019
Wow, you've, uh, already
become one of them.

280
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,717
(CHUCKLES) Stashing a patient
in the ER for a couple hours,

281
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,136
hoping they somehow cure themselves?

282
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,063
- Internal medicine's signature move.
- DEVON: Look,

283
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,306
I can't give Riley a
bed that doesn't exist.

284
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,298
Between surgical patients
and medical patients,

285
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,891
- a bed isn't available.
- That's true.

286
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,553
They got a lot of
surgical patients today.

287
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:22,269
- You know, how about you just pick a side, man?
- Pick a side.

288
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,891
Sorry. I like watching you two argue.

289
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:28,728
My therapist says it's because
I envy your guys' relationship.

290
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,871
Which I do not.

291
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:35,135
Just because you're busy
upstairs doesn't mean

292
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,661
you get to saddle us with your work.

293
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:40,331
We don't exactly, uh, have
spare time down here either.

294
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,743
Fine. I'll put in holding orders.

295
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:46,189
But she will have to board in the ER

296
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,672
until a bed is available.

297
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:50,350
As long as she's not on my list,
you can do whatever you want.

298
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,014
Look who's here.

299
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:57,983

He's not septic. And
while the rhabdo alone

447
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,002
can cause some elevation in the lactate,

448
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,304
it's more than I'd expect.

451
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:18,866

How do you treat that?

454
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:25,712
Type B lactic acidosis is
a symptom of something else.

00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:27,536
And it's that something

456
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,394
that might explain what's been causing

457
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,362
all of Dax's injuries
in the first place.

know what you're doing.

00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:54,481
No, it-it's... that's
not the same thing.

629
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:57,626
Patient boarding...

630
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,203
that's a national crisis.

631
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:01,371
Okay.

632
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,823
So you find the local solution
to the national problem.

633
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,992
If I have to think outside

634
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:08,245
of the box for my unwinnable
situation, so do you.

635
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,956
(CHUCKLES)

636
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,832
I miss this.

637
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:13,976
(SIGHS)

638
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,395
Yeah, me, too.

639
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:38,375
Dad, open the door.

640
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,841
Dad.

641
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,010
I think I know what you're planning,

642
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,012
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

643
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,105
NIC: I'm... (SIGHS)

644
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,575
I'm worried you might
be a danger to yourself.

645
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:15,779
That's a pretty big leap, but I get it.

646
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:18,023
You're upset about what I said earlier.

647
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:21,735
We are rebuilding our lives, together,

648
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:23,528
and things are really good.

649
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,033
And I think it caught you by surprise.

650
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:30,368
When you came back to help Jessie,

651
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,223
you didn't expect that the man

652
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,059
who burns everything down

653
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,397
would start building things
he was scared to lose.

654
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,691
(STAMMERS) You're-you're
just making this a lot harder

655
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,223
than it has to be. I really
think you need to leave.

656
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:49,071
You and I both know if
I walk out that door,

657
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,573
- I'll never see you again.
- Nic, if you love me,

658
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,409
you will go.

659
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,435
No.

660
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,732
Because every day for
the rest of my life,

661
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,990
I will live with the guilt
that I walked out on my father

662
00:31:59,992 --> 00:32:01,834
when he needed me, so, no.

663
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,131
It won't be your fault.

664
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,594
I'm the broken wheel in this family,

665
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:16,098
and this, today, I can free you of that.

666
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:21,211
And I don't want you to
shed a single tear for me.

667
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:23,939
I don't deserve it. I never have.

668
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,318
Do you remember when they took me in

669
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,760
for Jessie's transplant surgery?

670
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,930
I wanted to tell you something.

671
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:35,284
Yeah. (SNIFFLES)

672
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,602
What was it?

673
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:41,531
If I died saving Jessie,

674
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,618
it'd be the only good thing
that I've ever done with my life.

675
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:49,034
I know that I'm worthless.

676
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:50,709
That's why I-I run,

677
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:55,712
it's why I, I-I, I fail
at everything I touch.

678
00:32:55,714 --> 00:33:00,000
God... he just keeps
choosing the wrong one of us.

679
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:04,629
First your mother.

680
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:05,981
Jessie.

681
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,155
I'm at the end of my life.

682
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,077
And that is all I got to show for it.

683
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:23,073
The sum total of my life...

684
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:26,502
(CHUCKLES): stuffed into an envelope.

685
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,820
That is not true.

686
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:34,301
Things haven't always been easy
with us, but... you have me.

687
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:37,346
(SNIFFLES)

688
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,372
(EXHALES)

689
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:43,427
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you this sooner, but...

690
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:48,673
when I think about my
future... I see you in it.

691
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:53,437
At my wedding, walking
me down the aisle.

692
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,991
Birthdays, holidays,

693
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,574
and every moment in
between, you are there.

694
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:02,746
It would break my
heart if you were gone.

695
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,666
So, no.

696
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,585
I'm not leaving.

697
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,594
Will you be honest with me?

698
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:23,392
Can you tell me what you are planning?

699
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,603
(CRYING)

700
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,774
Dad.

701
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:35,387
Okay.

702
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,149
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

703
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:41,034
Will you give it to me, please?

704
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:43,871
It's okay.

705
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,325
- Okay.
- (CRYING)

706
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:50,294
Okay.

707
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:58,076
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

708
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,012
(EXHALES)

709
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,424
Bell, what happened?

710
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:10,384
Well, I noticed his
abdomen was distended,

711
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,015
and then his hemoglobin took a dive.

712
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:13,668
What, you're thinking
it's his splenic lac?

713
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,468
Well, yeah, that's what
I was worried about.

714
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,470
(BEEPS)

715
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,816
That's what's happened.

716
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:20,098
That spleen's got to
come out immediately.

717
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,355
Whatever is going on with Dax

718
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:22,784
is causing him to become coagulopathic.

719
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:25,120
Well, clotting issues aside...

720
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,105
we got to get him to the OR stat.

721
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:29,547
- I hope there's time to save his life.
- All right, let's go.

722
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,806
Hey. Hey. What is this?

723
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,397
Patients who have been
sitting in the ER hallways

724
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,042
for hours, waiting for a
bed on the medicine floor.

725
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:41,395
A hallway in the ER
versus a hallway here.

726
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,870
- What's the difference?
- Proximity.

727
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,999
Doctors tend to forget about
these patients even though,

728
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,500
technically, they're on their lists.

729
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,794
Out of sight, out of mind.
A patient almost died today

730
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,170
because she fell through the cracks.

731
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:52,981
Administration won't allow this.

732
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,174
It'll go back to the
way it was tomorrow.

733
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:56,634
Maybe.

734
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:58,177
But at least today, these patients,

735
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,363
they won't be forgotten.

736
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,689
BELL: We're slightly off
the midline to the fascia,

737
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:12,483
- 'cause I see rectus muscle.
- AUSTIN: Agreed.

738
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:14,360
Wait. Hold up.

739
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:16,029
Lac.

740
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:18,590
Peep the color.

741
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,327
That doesn't even look like muscle.

742
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:23,828
It's more pale than usual.

743
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,013
AUSTIN: And look at that.

744
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,998
It barely twitched.

745
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,335
Well, that's odd, given
Dax's athletic background.

746
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:32,596
I think we've hit the part of
the story where we find answers.

747
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:35,691
Conrad? You there?

748
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,194
I am with you every step of the way.

749
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,889
I know what's wrong with Dax.

750
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:46,159
You'll need a muscle biopsy to confirm.

751
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:52,449
Mr. Landry. Hey.

752
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:56,694
So, it turns out that Dax has a
genetic mitochondrial disorder.

753
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:58,327
BELL: And that occurs when mitochondria

754
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,664
fails to produce enough energy

755
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,533
for the body to function properly.

756
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:05,387
When Dax went pro, he started
doing intermittent fasting.

757
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,466
It triggered his disorder and it
exacerbated his trauma symptoms.

758
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:10,967
Is it treatable?

759
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,025
With a specialized diet and supplements,

760
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:15,138
it's likely he'll be
able to continue to play.

761
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,733
- I can't thank you both enough.
- AUSTIN: Uh,

762
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,901
we aren't the only
ones you should thank.

763
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,720
BELL: We didn't make
the diagnosis alone.

764
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:25,198
Conrad Hawkins was an integral part.

765
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:28,172
Really?

766
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:38,903
Mr. Landry?

767
00:37:38,905 --> 00:37:41,331
I heard what you did for Dax.

768
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,449
I owe you a debt of thanks.

769
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,915
Oh. Glad I could help.

770
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:48,685
I also heard that Dax brought you in

771
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:51,791
because our team doctor
didn't address his concerns.

772
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,176
That's unacceptable.

773
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:56,179
My players are like family to me.

774
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:59,441
And this has shown me that
my family needs a doctor.

775
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,110
I'd like that doctor to be you.

776
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:03,945
(LAUGHS)

777
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,807
Is, is this is a real offer?

778
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:10,452
It is. I don't think I'll have a problem

779
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,262
getting you a position at St. John's.

780
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:18,043
So, Dr. Hawkins, what do you say?

781
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:34,976
Hawkins, what are you doing here?

782
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,836
I thought you'd like to
know I've just been hired

783
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:39,389
as the new team doctor for Georgia FC.

784
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:43,176
Physical therapy, medical tests,
referrals, orthopedic surgery.

785
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:47,564
It's the prestige and money

786
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:50,158
of a partnership with
a major sports team.

787
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,996
Now, all of this will
remain at St. John's,

788
00:38:54,998 --> 00:39:00,502
unless there's another
hospital I decide to call home.

789
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,697
Do you want Chastain
to be that hospital?

790
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:09,511
Or should I just let Red Rock know

791
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,663
you let this golden goose
slip through your fingers?

792
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:14,182
You're bluffing.

793
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:17,529
Bill Landry has a
contract with St. John's.

794
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,336
A contract his lawyers
say he can get out of

795
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:20,838
with a few quick phone calls,

796
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,674
given what happened to Dax Ramsey.

797
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:27,512
If I were to agree to this,
what would be the terms,

798
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:29,680
moving forward?

799
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,908
Well, you and I hug it out...

800
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:37,947
... and then I decide

801
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:41,951
which physicians treat
and consult Georgia FC

802
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:45,422
and I monitor every aspect of team care.

803
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,217
I'm chief resident.

804
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:51,869
And I'm gonna do
whatever I think is best

805
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,639
for my patients here at Chastain.

806
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,375
<i>(CORK POPS)</i>

807
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:59,877
- I love it. Yes, yes.
- (LAUGHS)

808
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:02,213
I can't believe you pulled this off.

809
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:04,508
I wish I could've seen the
look on Logan Kim's face.

810
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,810
Oh, if you were truly
our friend, you would have

811
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:08,594
recorded it so we can play it on a loop.

812
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:10,480
(LAUGHTER)

813
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:12,088
I have to admit, it was pretty great,

814
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,946
but this is just the beginning.

815
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:17,064
He's right. We still
have a lot of work to do.

816
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,122
Like ousting our corporate overlords.

817
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:20,916
- Which won't be an easy task.
- True,

818
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,402
but we will get it done, together.

819
00:40:24,404 --> 00:40:26,329
Agreed.

820
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:31,551
But first, we need to do
something about your wardrobe.

821
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:36,249
Welcome home, Conrad.

822
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:39,634
(LAUGHTER)

823
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,269
(SHOUTS)

824
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,605
- Yeah! All right.
- (LAUGHTER)

825
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:48,276
(LAUGHS, GRUNTS) Yeah!

826
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:51,596
(WHOOPS)

827
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:52,638
- Mwah.
- Thank you.

828
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,782
Still looks good.

829
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,992
A toast.

830
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:58,644
Here's to another day in the trenches.

831
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:00,479
- (HUNDLEY WHOOPS)
- I'll drink to that.

832
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:01,862
- Cheers.
- HUNDLEY: Cheers.

833
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:03,274
It's good to have you back.

834
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:05,752
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

835
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:10,615
(SIGHS)

836
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:15,136
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to celebrate with you.

837
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,330
After the day you've had,

838
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:19,498
I'm the last person
you should think about.

839
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,309
(EXHALES)

840
00:41:24,505 --> 00:41:25,705
Kyle has a long road ahead,

841
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,148
but you don't have
to do this alone, Nic.

842
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,775
Whatever happens, I'm here.

843
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:33,488
Hey. What did I say?

844
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,533
Exactly what I needed to hear.

845
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,829
Oh. Oh, hey, sorry.

846
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,330
Sorry, I just... (STAMMERS)

847
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,614
Do you...? I-Is it
okay if I borrow this?

848
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:46,167
- I kind of already stuck my...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

849
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,244
You can keep it. You
got everything you need?

850
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:52,156
Uh, yeah, yeah. You got snacks,
you got tunes, you got road map.

851
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:56,202
I think we are good to go.

852
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:58,704
Well, if you need anything...

853
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:00,265
(QUIETLY): Yeah.

854
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:04,928
Hey, so... you-you think
this place in Savannah,

855
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,171
you really, you really
think they can help me?

856
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:08,523
NIC: It's one of the best

857
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,549
inpatient centers in the country.

858
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:12,510
It's a psych joint. I get it, but good.

859
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:14,195
Whatever it takes.

860
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:19,275
I really want to be there
for all those moments

861
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:21,077
that you talked about.

862
00:42:22,188 --> 00:42:24,563
Me, too.

863
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:25,665
Come on.

864
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,360
(MUTTERS)

865
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:30,462
Call me on the way?

866
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:54,811
We can all help prevent suicide.

867
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,409

870
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:07,457

help is available to you.

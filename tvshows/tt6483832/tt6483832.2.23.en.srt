1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,570
Scrub in with The Resident.

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,605
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,542
and check out
our other Fox programs...

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

7
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:15,749
Only on Fox.

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,064
- Previously on The Resident...
- A few weeks ago,

9
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,590
a wonderful man who loved me
proposed.

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,493
I took so long to decide
that he changed his mind.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,604
- Wait, is this for us?
- Yes, of course it's for us.

12
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:31,065
- We can get a hot tub. Raise chickens.
- What?

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,434
I don't move in with you,
so you just leave me.

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,045
If you're not interested
in going forward, for me,

15
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,704
it's time to take a step back.

16
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,847
So my kidneys will
never work again?

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,240
You have to stay on dialysis

18
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,409
- for the rest of your life, Jess.
- Come on.

19
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,010
There's got to be
another option.

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,945
It's not that you can't
give Jessie your kidney,

21
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,214
it's that you won't!

22
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,682
Why can't you for once,
for once,

23
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,050
do something that
is not selfish?

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,468
That's exactly my point!

25
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,460
- Hey, this is Kyle.
- You know what to do.

26
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,852
What's wrong?

27
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,154
Everything okay?

28
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,190
Can I come in?

29
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,301
Look...

30
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,570
I've been thinking a lot
about us.

31
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,804
And I realized something,

32
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,974
so just hear me out.

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,043
Of course.

34
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,146
Life is hard.

35
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,549
And the problems keep coming.

36
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,018
And I keep... trying
to solve them all by myself.

37
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,721
Jessie, my dad, our patients.

38
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,224
I seem...

39
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:14,228
completely incapable
of asking for help.

40
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,230
I don't know why I do that.

41
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:19,333
Well, you lost your mom

42
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,868
- as a kid.
- No, no, I don't...

43
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,035
I don't want to do that.

44
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,036
I don't want to make excuses.

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,738
I want to see the pattern,

46
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,841
take responsibility, and change.

47
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,446
Okay, I'm listening.

48
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,016
You said you want
to move forward

49
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,618
in our relationship.

50
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,621
I want that, too.

51
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,924
I just need you
to meet me halfway.

52
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,527
- What do you mean?
- It means...

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,229
I want to start talking
about moving in,

54
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,633
marriage, a family, all of it.

55
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,635
But you can't push me.

56
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,236
You can't rush me.

57
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,840
Let me do this at my own pace.

58
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,711
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,513
I can do that.

60
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,918
This is a big deal.

61
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,856
Yeah.

62
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,330
I'm in.

63
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,405
I just...

64
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,941
I just only have one request.

65
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,943
What?

66
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,146
I really want those chickens.

67
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,183
No chickens.

68
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,259
Your company,
Red Rock Mountain Medical,

69
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,095
is the top health care
conglomerate in the Southeast.

70
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,964
Your motto? "We're like family."

71
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:01,168
But your family is missing
a crucial piece.

72
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:05,138
We now own every major hospital
within a hundred-mile radius.

73
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,174
We don't need Chastain.

74
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,275
But you do.

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,277
To control pricing.

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,179
You need to eliminate
the competition.

77
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,190
Chastain is in no position
to undercut our pricing.

78
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,183
You're $100 million in the red.

79
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,551
We have an amazing staff.

80
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,553
Talented doctors and nurses.

81
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,289
We're a top facility.
We're unmatched.

82
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,058
But our research shows the words
most closely associated

83
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,861
with Chastain are "Dr. Lane
Hunter" and "QuoVadis."

84
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,130
That's behind us. It's old news.

85
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,399
And, in fact,

86
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,367
I view it as a success story.

87
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,069
We were instrumental
in exposing corruption.

88
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,806
We helped bring down QuoVadis.

89
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,574
We will be stronger together.

90
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,075
Guaranteed.

91
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,179
Well...

92
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,483
we will discuss internally
and get back to you.

93
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,885
In the meantime, Dr. Bell,

94
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,022
do avoid
any further PR disasters.

95
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,661
A bit of news for you.

96
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,397
I'm putting a pacemaker
in Micah today.

97
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,198
Alert the media.

98
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,000
I know.

99
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,769
It's minor.

100
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,380
So, don't worry.
You don't need to be there.

101
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,039
Why wouldn't I assist?

102
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,083
Because you're emotionally
involved with the patient.

103
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,042
No, I'm not.

104
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,610
Our engagement ended weeks ago.

105
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,078
"Weeks"?

106
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,681
Well, that's hardly enough time
to get over heartbreak.

107
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,850
Take it from the heartbreaker
in chief.

108
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,184
Please.

109
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,286
Shira, we're closed here.

110
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,055
We have another surgery.

111
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,559
All good. Let's pack up
the patient and take him to ICU.

112
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,420
We'll never make a 730 show.

113
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,990
And, anyway, I'm not going
to the Atlanta Gore Fest.

114
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,626
Well,
if you love your boo, you will.

115
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,428
Hard out at 645.

116
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,497
Mwah.

117
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,833
Love is complicated.

118
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,234
Sacrifices must be made.

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,445
Horror movies aren't my thing.

120
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,070
I see enough gore all day long.

121
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,939
Want to take my place?

122
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,183
Jessica wouldn't want
to hold hands

123
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,509
and scream with me in the dark.

124
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,176
And I have
a previous commitment.

125
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,578
Double shift.

126
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,580
This place is my main squeeze
these days.

127
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,081
You're aware that's pathetic.

128
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,650
Adult male. Age unknown.

129
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,018
Found him in Piedmont Park.

130
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,020
Put him in two.

131
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,323
BP 95/60, blood sugar 82,

132
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,301
possible broken left arm, minor
scrapes and bruises. Okay.

133
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,695
Let's start another large
bore IV and hang another liter

134
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,172
- of normal saline. One, two, three.
- One, two...

135
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,899
Okay.

136
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,537
Can you tell us your name,
please, sir?

137
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,549
No wallet. No phone.

138
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,183
Okay.

139
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,185
Torn clothes.

140
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,120
Dirt under his fingernails.

141
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,188
He could be homeless.

142
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,627
Sir, your name, please.

143
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,829
Okay, let's add LFTs,
coags, UTox,

144
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,398
aspirin/acetaminophen levels,
and a blood alcohol level.

145
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,867
Page social work.

146
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,034
See if they recognize him.

147
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,070
If not, have them call
local shelters,

148
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,014
see if anyone's missing or fits
the description, while we try

149
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,050
- to get his pain under control.
- I'll order an X-ray

150
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,010
and get Dr. Voss
to take a look at that arm.

151
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,313
Must be very rewarding
to be a transplant coordinator.

152
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,848
It is, but it's frustrating.

153
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,850
We need more donors to step up.

154
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,152
Too many people die waiting
for an organ.

155
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,521
That's my biggest fear
with my sister.

156
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,523
How is she doing on dialysis?

157
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,026
Not well.

158
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,028
Um, she's
in early heart failure.

159
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,097
It's causing a lot of problems.

160
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,332
A new organ
could help her heart.

161
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,570
Yeah. But we can't wait years
to get one.

162
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,741
Excuse me.

163
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,576
Hi. Welcome to Chastain.

164
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,077
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, maybe.

165
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,378
I'm looking for a doctor.

166
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,047
Her name is Shira Smook.

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,283
Shira... Smook.

168
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,520
Okay. Anesthesiology.

169
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,055
Would you like me to page her?

170
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,524
Nah. Anesthesiology.

171
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,759
I'll call her myself,

172
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,093
tell her I'm here.

173
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,401
They had to abort dialysis
because her pressure dropped.

174
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,106
Your sats are a little low.

175
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,209
Please-please make it stop, Nic.

176
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,077
Gonna do our best.
This should help.

177
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,112
First order of business

178
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,814
is to switch up
your heart medication

179
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,415
so you can tolerate dialysis.

180
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,124
All right, Nic and I need
to discuss our options.

181
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,292
Then I'll be right back.

182
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,729
It's gonna be okay.

183
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,397
Just give me a sec.

184
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,071
Elevated JVP.

185
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,174
And I saw signs
of hepatojugular reflux.

186
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,743
Her heart failure
is getting worse,

187
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,111
more rapidly than we expected.

188
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,813
This is a disaster.

189
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,350
Treatment of dual organ failure
is challenging,

190
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,286
not impossible.

191
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,189
Heart failure alone
could kill Jessie.

192
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,191
She needs a new kidney.

193
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,126
Soon.

194
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,796
There are cases where that alone
improves heart function.

195
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,699
She might not need a new heart
for ten years.

196
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,701
Your father's
still the most logical donor.

197
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,368
He's here. He's a match.

198
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,971
Kyle refused to donate.

199
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,973
And now I can't find him.
He's disappeared.

200
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,309
- I-I've called him over and over again.
- Which is why

201
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,820
I asked my dad to try
and track him down.

202
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,188
He put his private investigator
on him,

203
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,714
and now I have an address.

204
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,016
You want it?

205
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,294
Trying,

206
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,696
um,

207
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,132
i-ingman...

208
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,201
Dad bum.

209
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,171
He has expressive aphasia.

210
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,742
He knows what we're saying,
but he can't speak.

211
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,011
Maybe when he fell and broke
his arm, he-he hit his head.

212
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,814
Still no kin we can find,
no proxy to tell us who he is.

213
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,250
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

214
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,718
All right. There you go.

215
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,822
We're up to the letter "S" now?

216
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,390
We're calling him Sunflower One.

217
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,392
Nothing personal, my friend.

218
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,495
When we can't identify patients,
we name them after flowers.

219
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,564
Yeah.

220
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,266
He needs a CT.

221
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,835
Bell's been tightening
the screws down here.

222
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,170
He told me, and I quote,

223
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,772
"Platinum care
is reserved for those

224
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,106
with platinum credit cards."

225
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,175
Since when do we do anything

226
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,177
but try to work around Bell?

227
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,112
Her...

228
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,647
herb.

229
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,186
Herb.

230
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,888
Given his age
and how he was found,

231
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,857
he might have dementia.
In which case, this...

232
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,859
is his baseline.

233
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,395
We need to take care
of this man.

234
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,230
Whether or not he's homeless,

235
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,599
or whether or not he's insured.

236
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,634
If there is an underlying
diagnosis,

237
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,569
like a brain bleed or a tumor,

238
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,072
delay could cause irreparable
damage, even death.

239
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,442
At the bare minimum,
a CT is standard of care.

240
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,311
Good.

241
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,246
Let us know
when we have the results.

242
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,181
Take it from there.

243
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,090
So it's definitely a type 2
second-degree heart block.

244
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,126
Which explains my dizziness.

245
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,828
Electrical impulses

246
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,138
aren't getting through
to your heart.

247
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,564
How serious is the surgery to...

248
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,475
- implant a pacemaker?
- It's no big deal, bruh.

249
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,837
Quick procedure; In an hour,
you'll be a new man.

250
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,305
Good. Thank you.

251
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,842
So, otherwise...
everything okay?

252
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,243
You seem to be in good spirits.

253
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,078
Man, I have never been better.

254
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,013
Seriously, on top of the world.

255
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,648
- Nice.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,851
Sorry I'm late.

257
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,261
- Traffic was terrible.
- Yeah, yeah.

258
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,987
Come in, come in.

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,764
This is Dr. Austin.
He's going to be putting in

260
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,023
my pacemaker this afternoon.

261
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,626
- Jolene Landis.
- Hi.

262
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,896
Thank you for taking
such good care of my Micah.

263
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,305
- Hey, I've been looking for you.
- What are you doing here?

264
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,673
You promised me.

265
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,179
Leave or I'll call security.

266
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,082
I'll meet you
in the parking lot in an hour.

267
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,121
My ex. He's a stalker.

268
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,390
Terrible choice in men,
working on that.

269
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,455
Hey.

270
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,192
I've been trying to reach you.

271
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,529
I didn't want to be reached.

272
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,099
Look, I know things

273
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,169
ended badly and I'm sorry if...
you've been upset.

274
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,704
But you're not sorry
for what you said.

275
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,242
Look, can we just...
Can we go inside?

276
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,876
- Can we talk?
- No, I just...

277
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,446
moved in, it's, um...

278
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,881
it's a mess.

279
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,184
Sit.

280
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,718
Nice?

281
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,021
I'm the caretaker.

282
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,689
Free rent. Good job.

283
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,091
Want a beer?

284
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,126
It's a little early for me.

285
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,795
I've got a...
a long drive back, so...

286
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,099
So... what's this about?

287
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,301
You know what
this is about, Kyle.

288
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,136
Jessie.

289
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,205
She relapsed again?

290
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,639
No.

291
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,109
No, she's... she's sober,

292
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,945
and she's determined
to stay that way.

293
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,981
But her situation has changed.

294
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,785
It's not just
her kidneys anymore.

295
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,388
Her, um...

296
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,790
her heart's failing.

297
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,726
Wait, what...
what does that mean,

298
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,571
- her heart is failing?
- We're trying to stabilize it

299
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,063
so she's still eligible
for a kidney,

300
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,065
but the truth is,
she has a very...

301
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,668
narrow window right now, so...

302
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,105
If you would
reconsider donating,

303
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,572
she might have a chance.

304
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,975
I know you wanted her
to be sober six months

305
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,152
to make sure
she doesn't relapse,

306
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,778
but she doesn't have six months.

307
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,481
How long do we have?

308
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,749
Days.

309
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,284
Weeks. I don't know.

310
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,186
But what I do know is that...

311
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,922
right now you're the only person
who could save her.

312
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,157
I'm 63.

313
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,691
I smoked.

314
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,161
I still drink
more than I should.

315
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,164
I can't believe that my kidney
is her best option.

316
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,833
It's her only option.

317
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:18,045
Strange I ended up by a lake.

318
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,182
Never learned how to swim.

319
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,419
I hate dark water.

320
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,026
You're scared.

321
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,869
Yeah.

322
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,039
Is it so wrong of me?

323
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,177
I mean, the risk is...

324
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,212
is pretty low... for the donor.

325
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,247
But it exists.

326
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,016
There is a risk.

327
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,395
I'm sorry.

328
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,709
Next time I see you will be
at Jessie's funeral.

329
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,248
And it'll be the last time
that I see you.

330
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,131
He does have
a ruptured aneurysm.

331
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,899
But it's small, right there
in your Broca's area.

332
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,935
Which could explain
why he can't speak.

333
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,070
Or all his symptoms
are caused by dementia,

334
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,773
so we'll ask
for a neuro consult.

335
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,243
What if they say
he needs surgery?

336
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,045
He's uninsured.

337
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,881
He's been classified
as "unbefriended."

338
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,117
No living relative, no proxy.

339
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,886
Which means the hospital
decides all his care,

340
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,422
and Bell is the hospital.

341
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,090
Right.

342
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,768
Let's be conservative
a little while longer.

343
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,961
Take him to the ER
for observation.

344
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,063
If Sunflower gets worse,

345
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,732
then we have a stronger case
to make to Bell,

346
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,969
one that will be harder
for him to refuse.

347
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,079
Hey.

348
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,081
Where you been?

349
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,184
Nowhere good.

350
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,354
But now I'm here with you.

351
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,491
What's this?

352
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,061
It's my advance directive.

353
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,699
You're my proxy.

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,835
All my wishes are spelled out.

355
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,171
The hospital has a copy, too.

356
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,310
Nic?

357
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,645
Let's be brave

358
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,779
and honest, okay?

359
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,847
That's what I want.

360
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,349
The truth.

361
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,018
We're in a bad spot, aren't we?

362
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,122
Yeah.

363
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,891
No one's giving up.

364
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,694
If I die...

365
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,698
I know you'll find a way
to blame yourself.

366
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,735
This is not your fault.

367
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,205
Sorry.

368
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,041
You went to see Dad, didn't you?

369
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,811
Conrad found him, and...

370
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,949
I went to let him know
where we stand.

371
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,386
I was hoping he'd step up.

372
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,855
I don't understand. He can't.

373
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,424
He's not a match.

374
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,027
He's a match.

375
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,264
He's, um...

376
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,266
he's scared of the surgery.

377
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,538
How is this
not infuriating to you?

378
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,576
I'm disappointed.

379
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,813
But I understand.

380
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,250
I'm a lot like him.

381
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,854
You are not.

382
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,056
You're like Mom.

383
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,093
He's not a bad person.

384
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,862
He's just...

385
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,964
weak.

386
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,267
We have to keep fighting...

387
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,635
together.

388
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,637
Okay? You promise me?

389
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,840
We will.

390
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,110
But if we lose the battle...

391
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,249
there's just one more thing
I'll ask, okay?

392
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,220
Try to forgive Dad...

393
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,456
if you can.

394
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,128
And let him know
that I forgive him, too.

395
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,098
Okay.

396
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,106
430, OR Two.

397
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,075
Is that the surgery
you and Dr. Austin

398
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,310
were talking about earlier?

399
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,778
With your ex-fiancé?

400
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,113
You're doing it with us?

401
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,350
Yep. See you in there.

402
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,126
- I have a request.
- Same here.

403
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,295
I wish this corned beef
was more tender.

404
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,665
Shira is the anesthesiologist
on Micah's surgery.

405
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,133
I need you
to take her off the case.

406
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,470
- Why?
- Gut instinct.

407
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,348
Something's up with that girl.
I do not trust her.

408
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,808
And you want
what's best for Micah.

409
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,110
Okay. Deal.
I'll get Paul Chu on it.

410
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,712
Hey.

411
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,714
You still planning
on scrubbing in?

412
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,848
Yes.

413
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,361
Micah has a new girlfriend.

414
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,997
She's here at the hospital.

415
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,732
She's very pretty.

416
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:16,836
And he says he is happier
than he has ever been.

417
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,841
I'm sorry, Mina.

418
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:25,412
I did not enjoy delivering
that ten-blade to your heart.

419
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,247
But I had to see if you still
had feelings for your ex-fiancé,

420
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,016
and by your reaction, you do.

421
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,585
So no, you will
not be scrubbing in.

422
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:38,357
And for what it's worth...

423
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,092
you deserve better.

424
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,263
Anybody who could
replace you so quickly

425
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,066
doesn't deserve you.

426
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,979
All right. Thank you so much.

427
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:05,151
Jessie just gave me
her advance directive.

428
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,355
I can't bring myself to read it.

429
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,766
Yo.

430
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,534
Nicodemus.

431
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,470
Nickelmeister.

432
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,672
Anybody need a kidney
around here?

433
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,949
Thank you, Dad.

434
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,768
I've got some good news.
Thanks to Dr. Hawkins,

435
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,060
your heart failure
has improved for now.

436
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,997
We can move ahead with the
transplant if we move fast.

437
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,765
So what's next?

438
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,333
First, we'll bring you
to the OR.

439
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,935
As we're removing your kidney,

440
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,670
a second transplant team

441
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,338
will prep your daughter
in a separate OR.

442
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,283
When she's ready, we'll implant
your kidney into Jessie.

443
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,109
Six to eight hours from now,

444
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,645
you should both wake up,
ready to make a full recovery.

445
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,480
Six to eight hours
from right now?

446
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,115
Right now.

447
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,084
Well, you guys, um... you don't
fool around, do you?

448
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,920
It can't wait.

449
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,988
See you on the table.

450
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,412
Dr. Voss, I need your help.

451
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,221
Dr. Bell, meet Sunflower.

452
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,792
Sunflower?

453
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,227
- We don't know his real name.
- It's...

454
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,996
It...

455
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,331
I...

456
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,201
can't... even...

457
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,573
Unbefriended and uninsured.

458
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,408
- Yes.
- But you understand

459
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,580
I have a patient like Sunflower
on every floor of this hospital.

460
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,549
This is exactly the kind of case
that's bankrupting Chastain.

461
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,886
Sunflower has a brain bleed, and
his symptoms are getting worse.

462
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,496
Well, it could be sundowning,
nighttime confusion.

463
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,055
It's common with dementia.

464
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,158
It's possible,
but I don't think it's dementia.

465
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,661
Well, I... You can't be sure.
This bleed is small.

466
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,030
Well, it could be the cause
of all his symptoms.

467
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,233
It could be curable, Dr. Bell.

468
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,538
We had a neuro consult,
and he recommended surgery.

469
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,741
Are you going to deny it?

470
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,710
Look at this man.

471
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,880
He was found in Piedmont Park,
wearing sweats.

472
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,683
If he was jogging, had a fall,

473
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,085
that could explain why
he had no wallet or I.D.

474
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,097
There is no police report,
no missing persons file.

475
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,856
Yeah, he could be
from out of town.

476
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,092
Even if he's homeless,
what does it matter?

477
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,294
Pravesh, a hand!

478
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,267
What about the health
of this hospital?

479
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,469
We can't keep doing this.

480
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,639
Chastain is on the brink
of a disaster.

481
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,307
I need to save it, too.

482
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,143
Just stay with him
for five minutes.

483
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,211
That's all I'm asking.

484
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,015
See the human being
and not the numbers this time.

485
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,129
Want to...

486
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:40,767
beg... beg...

487
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,769
What are you trying to say?

488
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,805
This... awful.

489
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,406
I...

490
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,309
I-I-I can't even...

491
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,378
You can't... what?

492
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,651
Help.

493
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,825
Wait. What's that...
What is that for?

494
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,493
That's to start an IV, Dad.

495
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,864
My-my-my... my mouth is so dry.

496
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,234
Can you give us a second?

497
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,404
We have
an excellent transplant team.

498
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,774
Great doctors, great staff.

499
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,011
Brave is not my resting state.

500
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:04,050
You're gonna come out
of this just fine.

501
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,886
And for the rest of your life,
you are going to be happy

502
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,687
that you did this,
I promise you.

503
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,560
For Jessie.

504
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,063
I was leaving

505
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,565
for the day, and I saw this guy
breaking into a car.

506
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,500
He says he's a friend
of a doctor here,

507
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,569
but nobody has this amount
of drugs

508
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,072
unless they're dealing,
or using or both.

509
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,107
Who is this registered to?

510
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,080
Shira Smook?

511
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,716
Hey, man, come on.

512
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,908
I forgot my phone.

513
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,709
Shira, you all right?

514
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,711
Yeah.

515
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,646
Just tired.

516
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,982
I'll get a coffee.

517
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,884
I've been working long hours.

518
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,920
All good.

519
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,306
Hey.

520
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,875
Dad.

521
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,946
D-Dad, thank you.

522
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,747
Thank you.

523
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,749
Nothing I'd rather do,

524
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,784
no place I'd rather be.

525
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,855
You're my baby girl.

526
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:56,128
I'll s... I'll see you
in a few hours, okay?

527
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,231
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,138
Nic? Nic, there's something
that I really need to tell you,

529
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,174
s-something I should have
told you a long time ago.

530
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,042
You can tell me
on the other side.

531
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,978
- No, no, sweetheart, this is important.
- Dad.

532
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,180
It's gonna be okay.

533
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,348
Hello there, Mr. Nevin.

534
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,050
I'm Dr. Shira Smook.

535
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,751
I will be your anesthesiologist
tonight.

536
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,736
They're about to ligate

537
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,805
the vessels
and remove the kidney.

538
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,520
- Dr. Bell?
- Yeah?

539
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,555
We have a problem.

540
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,394
I've been working long hours.

541
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,663
You promised me.

542
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,416
I'll meet you in
the parking lot in an hour.

543
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,737
OR One.

544
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,843
The recipient is open and ready
to receive the donor kidney.

545
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
Ten-blade to me.

546
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,614
Time to give this kidney

547
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:25,551
a new home.

548
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,459
What the hell?

549
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,893
Lap pads. Suction.

550
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,263
We lost his airway. IV's out.

551
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,330
My God, he cut an artery.

552
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,870
She's not breathing!

553
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,738
- Call a code!
- Start bagging Shira!

554
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,175
Get another anesthesiologist!

555
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,047
He's crashing!
Jump in. My hands are full.

556
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,748
Tubes and lines are all pulled.

557
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,050
I'll re-intubate.

558
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,986
His airway's full of blood.
Suction!

559
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,961
He can't go much longer
without oxygen.

560
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,929
It's too swollen.
I can't get the tube in.

561
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,399
Sats are 60 and dropping.
He's gonna code.

562
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,943
We need to do a cric.
It's the only way.

563
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,304
Betadine. Give me that.

564
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,208
- Ten-blade.
- Okay.

565
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,182
- Trach tube?
- Got it.

566
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,151
In.

567
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,124
Got it. Okay.

568
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,159
Thank you.

569
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,328
- Done.
- All right, we're in.

570
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,164
All right.

571
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,000
Come on, Dad.

572
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,002
Come on, come on, come on.

573
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,708
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

574
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,178
Oxygen levels are still
really low.

575
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,183
Bilateral breath sounds.
Tube is in place.

576
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,721
His sats are climbing.

577
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:13,192
- What happened?
- Shira collapsed.

578
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,494
Let's load her on a gurney,
and we'll take her to the ER.

579
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,002
What the hell is that?

580
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,637
An IV port.

581
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,273
She's an addict.

582
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:32,010
That's her... Dr. Smook.
What-what the hell happened?

583
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,579
She OD'd in the OR.

584
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,415
Tell the ER
we're gonna need Narcan!

585
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,188
Can we proceed
with harvesting the kidney?

586
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,756
- The risk is higher, but the bleed is stopped.
- Are you sure?

587
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,001
Because he's been through a lot.
If we get him to the ICU,

588
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,694
he could fully recover
before we move on.

589
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,863
But Kyle is currently stable.
Airway is secure.

590
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,608
- BP is holding.
- Jessie's window for a kidney is closing.

591
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:57,136
Her best shot is now.
I say we go on.

592
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,109
Okay.

593
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,878
Administering Narcan.

594
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,049
Come on, come on, come on.

595
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,423
Wh-Where the hell am I?

596
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,757
You can't do this.

597
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,959
I'm a doctor.

598
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,964
You OD'd in the OR
in the middle of surgery

599
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,109
and you almost killed a patient.

600
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,268
Let me go, get away from me!

601
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:34,440
Thank you for covering for me

602
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,575
while I was stuck
in the other OR, Dr. Austin.

603
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,911
Looks good. Stand by
to reperfuse the kidney.

604
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,480
How's it going?

605
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,116
So far, so good.

606
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,785
They're about to see
if Jessie's new kidney works.

607
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:50,622
Unclamping.

608
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,327
- She's in V-tach.
- Get the defibrillator.

609
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,496
- Give 300 of amio.
- BP is dropping.

610
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,298
I'll reclamp until she
stabilizes.

611
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,002
Charged to 120.

612
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,374
Clear.

613
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,314
Charge at 200.

614
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,349
- Clear.
- Her heart is too weak.

615
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,952
V-fib. We need to get that
rhythm under control now.

616
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,130
We're at max joules.
Charge again.

617
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,289
Clear.

618
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:32,097
Okay. Sinus tach. All right,
that's what I like to see.

619
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,034
Let's unclamp these vessels
and, try this again.

620
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,738
Unclamping again.

621
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,146
Rhythm's holding steady.

622
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,049
All right, it's showtime, baby.

623
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:58,657
That is a beautiful thing.

624
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,092
It's urine.

625
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,197
The new kidney is working
like a champ.

626
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,512
Her heart took a beating, so
she's still not in the clear,

627
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,406
but... this is good.

628
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,157
Hey.

629
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,325
Hey.

630
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,062
Devon told me
you okayed the surgery

631
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,398
on our unbefriended patient.

632
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,833
And good on you.

633
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,736
Yeah, well, it's gonna go
in the red column for Chastain.

634
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,838
That column is already
very long.

635
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,540
Why did you do it?

636
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,450
I saw myself in him.

637
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:10,262
I should probably let you know

638
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,331
I'm, I'm back
with my ex-husband.

639
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,604
Um... Okay.

640
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:22,140
But I care about you
and I believe in you.

641
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,577
Nurture the man
I see right here.

642
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:31,182
Well, I will... if I can.

643
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,974
Any change?

644
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,776
The same.

645
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,215
I still can't believe
all this happened.

646
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:09,154
Nic.

647
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,756
Take a break, get some air.

648
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,424
I'll keep watch.

649
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:16,027
I promise I'll page you
if anything changes.

650
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,498
Thanks.

651
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,794
I discharged Micah.

652
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,829
He's in fine health.

653
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,030
Great.

654
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,033
Good news.

655
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:01,206
What have we got next?

656
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,042
Lung biopsy.

657
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,011
Cool.

658
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,893
Hi.

659
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,328
I'm Dr. Pravesh.

660
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,996
You just had surgery.

661
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,264
It went very well.

662
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,766
Do you know where you are?

663
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,675
You're at Chastain Park
Memorial Hospital.

664
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,944
And we've been
taking care of you.

665
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,713
Can you tell us your name?

666
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,155
George.

667
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:55,126
Wilson.

668
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,128
George Wilson.

669
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,465
Well, it's nice to meet you.

670
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:03,034
Is there someone we can call
for you, Mr. Wilson?

671
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,336
To let them know where you are?

672
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,314
M...

673
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,789
My wife.

674
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,465
For the record,

675
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:35,233
Dr. Smook was not our fault.

676
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,011
I've learned the medical board
of Pennsylvania pulled

677
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,137
her license for drug abuse,
so she moved here.

678
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,438
Doctor's records don't travel.

679
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:42,641
They can lose their license
in one state

680
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,109
and just move to another.

681
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,477
I know.

682
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,088
You are fortunate
that your original pitch

683
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,647
was so well received.

684
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,083
Red Rock Mountain is still
willing to move forward...

685
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,153
with some conditions.

686
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:03,461
Well, I remain as CEO,
that's nonnegotiable.

687
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:07,098
Agreed. But your authority
would be curtailed.

688
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,134
All administrative decisions

689
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,036
about the running
of the hospital would shift

690
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,471
to Red Rock Mountain Medical.

691
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,140
Your signature, please.

692
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,387
I have to read this, I have
to consider it carefully.

693
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,158
No, you don't. There's nothing
left to consider, Dr. Bell.

694
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:51,209
Nic. This time I'm here.

695
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,579
For her. For you.

696
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,418
There you go.

697
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,658
Anybody need a kidney
around here?

698
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,166
I'm afraid.

699
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,502
You're gonna come out
of this just fine.

700
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,743
You're my baby girl.

701
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,641
Get the pads, one of epi.

702
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,245
Where's the crash cart?!

703
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,451
- What happened?
- Nic, no, don't go in!

704
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,787
- I have to.
- Conrad's running the code. He's got it.

705
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:33,044
Captioned by Media Access Group
at WGBH access.wgbh.org.

706
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,822
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

707
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,390
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

708
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,729
I tried to force a fairy tale.

709
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:27,265
But that doesn't happen
for people like us.

710
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,500
I still believe we're gonna
all get our happy ending.

711
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,572
Star needs everybody
that loves her by her side.

712
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,941
I'm just gonna say bye.

713
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,709
I'm just gonna say bye.
Let me say bye!

714
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:43,782
We're a family, no matter what.

715
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,952
You built this life for yourself.
Keep fighting.

716
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:50,722
Star. Wednesdays at 900 on Fox.

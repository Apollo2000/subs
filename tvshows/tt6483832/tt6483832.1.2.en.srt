1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,402
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
<i>- Top of your class,</i>

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,797
followed all the rules, and you
think that puts you at an advantage.

3
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:05,805
It doesn't.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,040
<i>It just means you have more
to unlearn than the guys</i>

5
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:10,189
<i>- who weren't paying attention.</i>
- I need a new resident.

6
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:12,336
- Mine's impossible.
- You got Conrad.

7
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,382
- Watch and learn.
- Start compressions.

8
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:20,192
I will do whatever it
takes to get you back.

9
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:24,040
- Hey.
- You're here.

10
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:25,809
Lily means a lot to all of us.

11
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,246
From now on, she's your patient.

12
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,549
- What are my odds?
- The next few months will be rough.

13
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:30,947
But you can beat this.

14
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,192
All we want to do is help our patients,

15
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,118
but what they don't
teach us in medical school

16
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:36,673
<i>is there are so many ways to do harm.</i>

17
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,755
You got the best hands in the business.

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,957
<i>But he's still the most
requested surgeon.</i>

19
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,292
Did you hit an artery?

20
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:43,727
On an appendectomy?

21
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,199
Maybe he had a heart attack.

22
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,429
That's exactly right.

23
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,003
You need to consider a change
before you kill any more patients.

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,066
How dare you.

25
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:52,468
<i>Is your pride really worth more
than the life of a patient?</i>

26
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:54,014
You watch yourself, Conrad.

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,092
Career day. Exciting, right?

28
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,791
Time for you guys to
think about your future.

29
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,194
And I want you to aim high.

30
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,330
For example, you could
be a doctor like...

31
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:08,947
Dr. Hawkins here, who diagnosed
my heart condition early.

32
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,256
And, God willing, he's gonna be
the man that saved my life. So...

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,908
let's give him a warm welcome.

34
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:19,478
Okay, one more time or we're gonna
do a pop quiz on the periodic table.

35
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,016
All right. You guys are wound up now.

36
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,658
They're all yours. Good luck.

37
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,287
Wow.

38
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:28,087
When I was about your age,

39
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,656
I was driving with my dad.

40
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,858
Guy on a moped swerved in front of us,

41
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,526
right into the path of an oncoming car.

42
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,063
Wham. The impact threw this
guy's body onto the pavement.

43
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,495
He must have slid 50 feet.

44
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,366
And my dad, he just sat there,

45
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,104
pissed at being held up.

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,811
But a woman in the car
behind us jumped out,

47
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:50,410
and she worked on that kid
until the ambulance came.

48
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,412
This incredible woman had the ability

49
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,247
to save a life right in front of me,

50
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,615
and I knew, in that moment,

51
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,116
that I wanted to be a person

52
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,786
who could jump out of
the car to help people.

53
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:02,277
So that's what I do.

54
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:06,194
So, has anyone thought
about becoming a doctor?

55
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,128
I've thought about
becoming a millionaire.

56
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,564
That's not a career path.

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,035
So, do you cut people
open and take them apart?

58
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,163
That's...

59
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,700
a surgeon, Treena.

60
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:27,624
I'm an internist.

61
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,482
Someone has to first
figure out what's wrong.

62
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,351
- Micah?
- Yeah...

63
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,515
I got you.

64
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,089
Someone call 911.

65
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:38,091
No cell phones... allowed in class.

66
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,860
It's my teacher. Please help.

67
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,930
It's his heart. Sanford High.

68
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,932
The rate's too fast. I got to slow it

69
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,066
to get more blood into your heart.

70
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:48,543
Grab that funnel

71
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,203
and some tubing, on the counter.

72
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,472
You. Balloon. Go.

73
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,054
Get the nurse.

74
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,185
- What are you doing?
- Makeshift stethoscope.

75
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,157
I hear a friction rub.

76
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,558
Might be an effusion.

77
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,489
Hang on, hang on.
Don't worry. We got you.

78
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,664
Pulse is getting weaker.

79
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,801
Elevate his legs.
Elevate-elevate his legs.

80
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,837
Blow as hard as you can.

81
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,143
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

82
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,570
Coming through.

83
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,514
Okay.

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,419
Lost his pulse. Back up.

85
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,188
Back up, back up, back up. You stay.

86
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,224
Stay.

87
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,937
28-year-old pre-transplant patient

88
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,806
with V tach arrest.

89
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,310
Take him to Chastain.

90
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,973
Am I... out of time?

91
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,311
Not yet.

Remember, once we get the signal,

94
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,991
we get into position.

95
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,357
Mitch and I fire first.

96
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,044
Keep the muzzle of your gun pointed up.

97
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,030
Last thing you want to
do is shoot your dog.

98
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,399
- And don't mess with Lane.
- Oh, I'd never.

99
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,334
She saved my sister-in-law's life.

100
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,845
Breast cancer.

101
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:33,249
Okay, I'm ready to see some quail now.

102
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,393
Wow.

103
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,762
That was fun.

104
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,086
Oh, my God.

105
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,821
Trip shot Mitch.

106
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,156
- Trip?
- It's okay, it's okay.

107
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,390
Mitch, you're gonna be fine. Hold on.

108
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,025
- He's pulseless!
- Take a deep breath.

109
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,595
- He's had a heart attack!
- Calm down. I'm right here.

110
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,302
I love hearing your voice
first thing in the morning.

111
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,538
Conrad, listen.

112
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,173
<i>Breakfast at the cafeteria?</i>

113
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,041
- Hard pass. <i>
- Grits.</i>

114
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,644
Pancakes. Sausage. Just like old times.

115
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,679
- That's not why I'm calling. <i>
- I don't care</i>

116
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,581
why you're calling.
Just that you're calling.

117
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,340
I have your heart.

118
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,615
Always.

119
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,870
Your patient's heart.

120
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,368
Where have you been?

121
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,546
No one's telling me anything.

122
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,405
I'm dying of suspense, literally.

123
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,608
We heard from UNOS.

124
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,577
This time it's a perfect match.

125
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,774
Oh.

126
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,218
When-when can we do a transplant?

127
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,223
As soon as the heart gets here.

128
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,755
There's a short window when
a donated heart is viable.

129
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,691
Transplant team has been called in.

130
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,393
I will be with you
every step of the way.

131
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,729
- Okay.
- Recovery from this kind of surgery

132
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,915
can take months. You sure
you're up for it, Micah?

133
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,065
With me and my God,

134
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,197
there's nothing we can't handle.

135
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,807
New heart. New heart.

136
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,307
New heart.

137
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,715
Thanks.

138
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,646
- Trauma One?
- Right, straight into one.

139
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,248
Witnessed arrest outside of
the hospital, now unconscious

140
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,816
with a thready pulse. He's critical.

141
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,086
Page cardiology.

142
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,207
Here I am.

143
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:28,354
Second patient.
Gunshot wound to the buttocks.

144
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,989
Get surgery here for Trauma Two.

145
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,491
It's okay, Mitch.

146
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,200
You're gonna be all right.

147
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,029
Have two litres of O neg
standing by... is that enough?

148
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,597
Check glucose and blood.

149
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,366
Must have had a
heart attack in the field.

150
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,434
- Is that Congressman Dunlap?
- Yep.

151
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,170
- How long was he down?
- Two minutes.

152
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,704
Witnessed, we achieved
ROSC in the field.

153
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,110
Any medical history we should know?

154
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:50,276
Well, hypertension, high cholesterol.
Not sure of anything else.

155
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,411
EKG showed Q waves, which means

156
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,580
there was an MI in the past, as well.

157
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,882
Well, I'm surprised he
survived another one.

158
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,618
Yeah. We'll do a...
echo and a cardiac cath,

159
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,855
- figure out what's going on.
- ST depression.

160
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,632
- What's going on?
- Not sure yet.

161
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,993
I just heard it was
some kind of accident.

162
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,161
Dr. Hunter and Bell were there.

163
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,606
Victim must be a VIP.

164
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,909
That's the head of publicity
for the hospital.

165
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,632
Clean up on aisle nine.

166
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,068
How is Congressman Dunlap?

167
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,469
Medics stabilized him in the ambulance.

168
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,872
Peterson's gonna run a bedside echo,
and we'll know more soon.

169
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,574
Mitch's wounds are superficial.

170
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,741
Hey, how you doing? Dr. Hawkins.

171
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,143
- Hi, Doctor.
- Nice to meet you. Brody, how we feeling?

172
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,344
I'm just gonna lift up

173
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,694
your shirt here, check things out.

174
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,380
This is a PR disaster.

175
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,816
We take a congressman and
our lobbyist out hunting,

176
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,518
and they both end up in our ER.

177
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,471
Well, we can still change the narrative

178
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:36,096
if we can save 'em.

179
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,195
Did you hear what happened?

180
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,697
Yeah. Remind me not
to go hunting with you.

181
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,366
Dr. Hunter, so pleased to meet you.

182
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,567
I'm Dr. Devon Pravesh,

183
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,035
and I just read your paper

184
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,071
on aggressive treatment
of stage IV bladder cancer.

185
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:54,573
- Are you done sucking up yet?
- Nope. A five-year survival

186
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,909
was higher with platinum-based therapy.

187
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,277
It's incredible.

188
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,678
Oh, man. My new intern.

189
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,680
- He's a real gunner.
- Cancer is fascinating to me.

190
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,782
And you are the top
oncologist in Georgia,

191
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,784
so... maybe if you have
some time someday...

192
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,453
Absolutely. I'd love to help.

193
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,355
Sucking up works for me.

194
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,159
I think Dr. Feldman could
use some help in Trauma Two.

195
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,332
It was good to meet you.

196
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:19,231
Roughly 200 bird shot evenly
distributed across the buttocks.

197
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,499
He's sedated and prepped for you

198
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,673
to start removing the
pellets, Dr. Okafor.

199
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,236
These are superficial wounds.

200
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,071
You don't need a surgeon.
Any fool could do this.

201
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,635
Got to go. The OR just paged me.

202
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,022
Dr. Pravesh.

203
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,990
Just the man. Divide and conquer.

204
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,612
You take the right
cheek, I'll take the left.

205
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,917
<i>Conrad.</i>

206
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:50,562
Micah's heart's arriving
earlier than expected.

207
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,431
- The medevac's five minutes out.
- Don't leave.

208
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,868
I need you.

209
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,201
Sorry. Got a situation here.

210
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,836
Devon, come with me.

211
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,005
Seriously? Seriously?

212
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,714
I've got a case that's
gonna take my full attention.

213
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,259
I know you'll be crushed
to hear you're on your own.

214
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,512
It's Independence Day.

215
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,880
What's Independence Day?

216
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,231
Your first day as a
doctor without my help.

217
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,151
Start by handling sign out.

218
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,552
Doctors at the end of their shifts

219
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,154
must debrief you on all their patients.

220
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,789
You write down every
single word since you know

221
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,472
absolutely nothing about these cases.

222
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,475
You'll be covering 20 patients solo.

223
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:22,027
- No backup.
- Poor bastard.

224
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,329
What do you mean, "no backup"?

225
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,388
You'll have Nic.

226
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,231
Page me if there's a serious
problem, but remember,

227
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,967
that's a sign of weakness.
Don't let him kill anyone.

228
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,512
I'll do my best.

229
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,046
_

230
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:35,908
How many surgical
residents did you beat out

231
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,015
to scrub in on a heart transplant?

232
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,279
All of them.

233
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,522
You excited?

234
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,382
Don't I look it?

235
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:45,073
No.

236
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:47,019
I am excited. For Micah.

237
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,854
I want him fixed.

238
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,309
Me too.

239
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,330
Oh, my God.

240
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,233
Um... uh, my name is Dr. Devon Pravesh,

241
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,068
and I'm handling sign out today.

242
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,170
Dr. Pravesh.

243
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:07,853
I've never done this before,
so please, uh, speak slowly,

244
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:10,743
uh, one at a time,
and-and be-be patient.

245
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,911
First patient is Leona
Bates, 62-year-old female,

246
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,747
status is post appendectomy in 1991.

247
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,415
- This is her EKG from admission.
- All right.

248
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,517
- Slow down, slow down.
- And then from ten minutes later,

249
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,419
- and then from an hour after that.
- Okay, okay.

250
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,221
Uh...

251
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,857
- All right, go ahead.
- 39-year-old male with a history

252
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,258
of diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis

253
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,893
due to increased triglycerides presented

254
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,962
with abnormal LFTs and a
heterogeneous liver mass.

255
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,131
Lucinda Cooley's blood
glucose level is in the 50s.

256
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,632
She was getting way too much insulin

257
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,067
because the nurse was telling me

258
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,403
- that she'd been hypoglycemic...
- Due to acute illness.

259
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:39,438
Which super pisses me off.
That's Nurse Raymond.

260
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,373
Watch out for him, okay?
He's a total dick.

261
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,541
All right.

262
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,143
Olivia Coffin, 76-year-old female.

263
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,277
She's a mess.

264
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,578
- Also a whiner.
- And a talker.

265
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,414
On the pain-in-the-ass scale,

266
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,612
- she's ten. - Probably about a ten.
- Super complicated...

267
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:54,369
Micah Stevens' heart, Doc.

268
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,446
Hey.

269
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:14,564
Mitch.

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,999
I-Is Mitch all right?

271
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,776
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

272
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,778
We have the results
of the cardiac catheterization.

273
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,014
There's good news and bad news.

274
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,615
You had a very serious heart attack,

275
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,684
and the only reason
you're still with us at all

276
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,786
is because you were with these two.

277
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,856
- What's the good news?
- That <i>is</i> the good news.

278
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,548
The bad news is, your
heart was badly damaged.

279
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:36,261
The ejection fraction
is severely reduced.

280
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,110
What that means, Trip,

281
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,632
is... you're gonna need a transplant.

282
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,900
Oh, good Lord.

283
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,802
We'll contact UNOS immediately.

284
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,537
You'll be status 1A.

285
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,873
So that'll put you at the
top of the organ donor list.

286
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,915
You'll be top priority for a new heart.

287
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,663
Well, how long is it
gonna take to find one?

288
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,858
Well, unfortunately,

289
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:55,110
finding the right match can
take weeks, sometimes months.

290
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:57,871
Well, maybe.

291
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:00,819
We do have a new heart at
Chastain. It just flew in.

292
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,588
- That organ is already allocated.
- Well, let's

293
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,478
just wait, see if it's a match.

294
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:07,275
And if it is, we will un-allocate it.

295
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,303
Right?

296
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,214
Ready?

297
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,101
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

298
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,579
Gonna get you back to your class.

299
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,709
Got to teach those students, right?
They need you.

300
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:32,413
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

301
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,311
- Let's do this.
- Sorry, Micah. I need Dr. Hawkins

302
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,072
- for just a moment.
- Okay.

303
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,963
Is everything all right?

304
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:48,425
- Micah's surgery was canceled.
- Why?

305
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,894
His heart was reallocated
to Congressman Dunlap.

306
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,229
They can't do that.

307
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,966
Yes, they can. The hospital
went through proper channels.

308
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,268
- They got the okay from UNOS.
- You mean they pulled strings.

309
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,191
Look, I'm pissed, too, but
they didn't break any rules.

310
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:03,206
Dunlap has higher priority
than Micah because he's sicker.

311
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,037
There's nothing you can do.

312
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,027
Says who?

313
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,902
I called Dunlap's wife.
Turns out they're separated.

314
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:18,288
The daughter's coming.
Flying in from California.

315
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,057
Divorce blowback. You get
sick, you're all alone.

316
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,959
Yeah, could happen to us, too.

317
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,961
How many exes have we got between us?

318
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,529
Four, last time I counted.

319
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,147
Unless, of course, you've been busy.

320
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,566
No. No.

321
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,301
But I still haven't given up hope.

322
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:34,537
Me, I'm off the romance
track permanently.

323
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,206
From here on in, I'm married to my work.

324
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:38,775
Never say never.

325
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:40,674
There's Conrad.

326
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,479
He's the resident in
charge of Micah's care.

327
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:43,813
Don't I know it.

328
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,583
Go easy on him.

329
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,086
Dr. Hawkins, I know you're
upset. I would be, too.

330
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,088
This is against all
protocol, and you know it.

331
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,990
Micah's waited two years for a heart.

332
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,092
You can't just cut in line
for a VIP who hasn't waited

333
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,894
- two minutes.
- Well, they-they both need a heart.

334
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,863
There was only one. It
was a tough decision.

335
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:02,265
My patient is 28, with his
whole life ahead of him.

336
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,205
That heart could give him 50 more years.

337
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,826
Trip Dunlap is 63 and a smoker.

338
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:09,460
His body's far more
likely to reject the heart.

339
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:11,441
And even if the transplant
takes, what does it buy him,

340
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,752
- ten more years?
- Look, Dunlap is critical. I mean,

341
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,523
he could die tonight. And
Micah, he's waited this long.

342
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,625
- He can safely wait a bit longer.
- His quality of life is zero.

343
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,718
He was an athlete.
He's a science teacher.

344
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,887
Loved by his students.
I know him. We all do,

345
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,076
because he's been in
and out of here so often.

346
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Three times we thought we had a heart.

347
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,576
Three times he was sent home.

348
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:31,835
Zero complaining or self-pity, ever.

349
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,209
This guy, he's golden.

350
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,632
You want to tell Dunlap's daughter
her father is less deserving?

351
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,801
Why? Because he's a VIP
who can help out Chastain.

352
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,237
You really speak your mind.
It's just, it's a juvenile habit.

353
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:43,873
The decision was made
for medical reasons alone.

354
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,010
I think we both know
that's not the truth.

355
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,745
I'm gonna cut you some slack
because you're upset.

356
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,685
Chief of surgery,

357
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,360
resident.

358
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,985
Try to remember that.

359
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,090
All good news, Mr. Ramirez.
Your EKG looks normal,

360
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,262
- and you should be out of here tomorrow.
- Thank you.

361
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,430
You forgot to
listen to his heart, Doctor.

362
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,642
I don't need to listen to his
heart. I looked at his EKG.

363
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,742
Why didn't the murmur
show up on his EKG?

364
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,243
Occasionally, you can
get a normal reading

365
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,011
in patients with
significant heart disease.

366
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,346
Always use your stethoscope.

367
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,327
If you don't, Conrad will ream you.

368
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:27,517
- Do you have to tell him?
- No, because I know you're never

369
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,120
gonna skip listening to
a patient's heart again.

370
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,555
Devon, I want you to call
the OPO every 15 minutes.

371
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,758
- We need to find another heart.
- Can you get

372
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,761
a physician's assistant to do it?
I'm handling 20 patients.

373
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:38,808
Most people take a few hours
to fail Independence Day.

374
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:41,130
You just broke the record.
What has it been, 40 minutes?

375
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,400
- I smell carbs!
- Chad, you have surgery

376
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,135
scheduled today to remove
that foot. You can't eat.

377
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,570
No pizza. Take it back.

378
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,305
How 'bout chocolate pudding?

379
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,662
Four or five cups should slay the beast.

380
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:53,076
You can aspirate food under anesthesia

381
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,078
and die. Even chocolate pudding.

382
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:57,699
- I told him that.
- Well, I didn't believe him.

383
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,337
Is he a real doctor?

384
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,421
Tachycardia 5918.

385
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,744
Doobie's heart rate's spiking.

386
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,893
I want you to call the OPO every
15 minutes. And don't page me

387
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,228
about a patient unless it's
an emergency. It's a sign

388
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,794
- of weakness.
- It's a sign of weakness.

389
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:19,490
What's going on, Doobie?

390
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:21,073
Nothing.

391
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:25,074
His heart rate's falling.

392
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,242
Are you all right?

393
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,776
<i>Are you ready for your injection?</i>

394
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:33,979
<i>I don't care if you are.</i>

395
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,315
<i>You're getting it.</i>

396
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:37,063
"Naughty Nurses"? Really?

397
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,189
When in Rome?

398
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,358
You are recovering from
major heart surgery.

399
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:43,760
Get the mittens.

400
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:45,950
Mittens?

401
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,233
<i>Do you like it? Do you like that?</i>

402
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,236
<i>- Do you like it? Yeah! Yeah!</i>
- Oh...

403
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,658
Where have you been?
I paged you three times.

404
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,354
I'm already on your cheek.

405
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,988
- Nic is really good.
- You just noticed?

406
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,773
Why didn't she want to be a doctor?

407
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,346
Because she's smart.

408
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,967
Nurses get to spend time
with patients. We don't.

409
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:18,406
They have a strong union,
earn overtime, make good money.

410
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:20,163
For all of residency, if you
figure the hours we're working,

411
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,833
interns and residents make minimum wage.

412
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:26,717
Well, I still think she'd
make a good doctor.

413
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,188
She's working on her
doctorate. Doctor of Nursing.

414
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,591
How long has he been coughing?

415
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,842
A while. His heart rate's over 100.

416
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,911
O2 saturation 93.

417
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,687
He's been immobile for several hours.

418
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,088
I'm hearing some abnormal breath sounds.

419
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,312
Pleuritis?

420
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,219
I think it's a possible
pulmonary embolism.

421
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,939
Let's get him to CT, stat.

427
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:18,404
That we're sending him home
for a fourth time? Not yet.

428
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,430
Do I have to?

429
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,421
Yeah.

If you mean Dr. Pravesh, quite well.

433
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,913
- Don't change the subject.
- I want to change the subject.

434
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,904
Let's talk about anything else.

435
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:57,927
- It's not your fault.
- It feels like it is.

436
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:02,184
I come up against Bell...
he's like a wall.

437
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,748
I look for a work-around, a side
door, a window... there's none.

438
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:07,802
You'll find one.

439
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,510
You always do.

440
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,734
God, I love it when you believe in me.

441
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:20,709
I never stopped believing in you.

442
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,744
_

443
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,269
This the lobbyist who got shot?

444
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:53,750
Yes.

445
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,952
Filling defect in the
right pulmonary artery,

446
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,035
- suggesting...
- Massive lung clot.

447
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,671
Nice catch.

448
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,758
Particularly impressive for an intern.

449
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,674
His pressure just dropped.

450
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,265
Let's get him out of there. Mitch?

451
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,838
Hey, Mitch.

452
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,461
Mitch? He's unconscious.

453
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,940
He needs thrombolysis.

454
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:15,534
Activate the interventional team.

455
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,952
No. His pressure's 70/30. Page surgery.

456
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:21,225
Why? I can do the thrombolysis
with a local catheter right now.

457
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,360
It won't work with this patient.
We have to crack his chest open,

458
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,103
remove the clot, and save
whatever lung can be saved.

459
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,872
That's extreme and way too
big a call for you to make

460
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,510
without backup. Page Conrad.

461
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,366
- I'll page him.
- No. I know exactly what to do.

462
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:34,202
We've got IV access. Let's
give him a stat IV direct

463
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:36,876
thrombin inhibitor.
Tell the OR we're coming.

464
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,527
- On my call. One, two, three.
- Two.

465
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:44,331
What's happening?

466
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,301
You've got a blood clot
in an artery in your lung.

467
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:48,270
We're taking you to emergency surgery.

468
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:49,846
Am I going to die?

469
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,084
No. You're gonna be fine, Mitch.

470
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,307

And they have a heart
that's a match for Micah.

478
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,048
That's great news.

479
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,732
Why do you look like
you're going to a funeral?

480
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,702
It's Chloe.

481
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,612
My first medical error.

482
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,248
You told me to stop CPR,
and I didn't do it.

483
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:51,154
Rule one: do what I tell you to do,

484
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,353
- no questions asked.
- Conrad, ease up.

485
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:56,249
She's brain-dead. Neuro confirmed.

486
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:57,521
They did a full workup.

487
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,258
That's no longer a human
being... that's an organ farm.

488
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:03,296
- What's the problem here?
- Her mom called the OPO about

489
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,288
- donating her organs, and then she backed off.
- Why?

490
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,080
She can't accept the diagnosis.

491
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:12,739
Is there any chance that
something good can come of this?

492
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:15,308
Yes, so many people could
receive her other organs, too.

493
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:17,711
If the family can be
made to face the truth.

494
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:19,618
- Want me to speak to them?
- No.

495
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:20,543
- No.
- No.

496
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,579
- Then you speak to them.
- I can't.

497
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:25,316
Not anymore. No doctor whose patient

498
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:27,354
could benefit from an organ
donation can make the case

499
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,822
to a family to withdraw life support.

500
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,057
It's a hard and fast
rule, and a good one.

501
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,528
The hospital, on the
other hand, could step in.

502
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,592
Ugh.

503
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:42,129
Before you say
anything, I'm not here to argue.

504
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,265
I have a solution.

505
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,101
You have one minute. Go.

506
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:49,475
There's a brain-dead patient
in the ICU. Chloe Gellar.

507
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,475
Her heart could save Micah's life,

508
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,511
and you are the only
person I can think of

509
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:55,664
who can convince the mother
to withdraw life support.

510
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:59,786
So... so your solution
is to have me walk in

511
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:02,722
and ask a grieving mother
to unplug her child?

512
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,057
Her child is gone.

513
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,792
- The answer's no.
- No one is better

514
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:07,227
at communicating than you.

515
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,895
Thanks for the compliment, but no.

516
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,031
Chloe's organs would save so many lives.

517
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,753
You know, humanitarian
considerations aside,

518
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,447
to force a mother's hand

519
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,304
- would risk a lawsuit.
- So Chloe stays

520
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,172
on life support in our ICU indefinitely?

521
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:22,642
If her family can handle
it financially, yes.

522
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:24,544
In other words, it's all
about the bottom line.

523
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:26,346
You would gladly step in

524
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,914
if Chastain weren't
making 100 grand a week

525
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,749
on Chloe's gold-plated insurance.

526
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,087
The whole world is
about the bottom line.

527
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:41,161
Your white blood cell
count is improving, Lily,

528
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:42,896
but still a bit lower
than we'd like to see.

529
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:44,831
I think you need to stay
here a little longer.

530
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:48,335
No, please, Dr. Pravesh.
I just want to go home.

531
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,570
Dr. Hunter already said that I could.

532
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,405
I'm not sure she's seen
your most recent numbers.

533
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,407
Your immune system is still
badly compromised, Lily.

534
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,276
You could easily get
another infection and

535
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,211
- end up back in the ER again.
- And that's a huge risk

536
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,680
with leukemia and what
brought you to the ER

537
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,596
- in the first place.
- How we doing in here?

538
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:04,851
Dr. Hunter, hi!

539
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,144
How you feeling, darling?

540
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,879
Better. Really, so much better.

541
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:11,157
Well, no fever.

542
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,726
- She did have one this morning.
- Exactly.

543
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,294
That's why I'm trying
to get her out of here.

544
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,129
Lily's more likely to
get another infection

545
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,031
here than she would be at home.

546
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:21,801
One in seven patients end up
with a hospital-based infection.

547
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:25,829
People on chemo are most at risk for
everything from the flu to MRSA.

548
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,308
That's why I get my chemo
at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

549
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:30,942
Makes sense.

550
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:32,512
It does, doesn't it?

551
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:33,747
Excuse me.

552
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,947
I haven't had the chance to thank you

553
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,683
for taking such good care of my patient.

554
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:40,553
- Of course.
- Wow. That's high praise.

555
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,735
She doesn't trust anyone but Conrad.

556
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:46,259
Well, now I can trust Dr. Pravesh, too.

557
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,395
<i>And back in the day,</i>

558
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,663
of course, we had no
way to retract skin flaps

559
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,432
without holding your arms

560
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:55,668
in an extremely uncomfortable
position for hours at a time

561
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,272
until I invented...
this automatic retractor,

562
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,474
which the company named the "Bell."

563
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:03,009
Out of modesty,

564
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,111
of course, I demurred,
but they insisted.

565
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,347
Dr. Bell, can I speak with you a moment?

566
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,983
Of course. How is Congressman Dunlap?

567
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:12,552
Well, there was a complication
with his pre-op tests.

568
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:16,478
- That's concerning.
- And it appears when he fell,

569
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,159
he fractured a rib,
lacerated his spleen.

570
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:22,462
We can still do the transplant,
but he'll need a splenectomy first.

571
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:24,998
And your outcomes after splenectomy

572
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,005
set the national standard.

573
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,408
Can we count on you to scrub
in with the transplant team?

574
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,045
I'd love to.

575
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:33,625
All right. Thank you.

576
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,871
Well, you know, when I was your age,

577
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:12,274
we did not have this
technology to practice on.

578
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,379
I used to practice making
stitches with my hands

579
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:21,413
jammed inside a tin can, just to
simulate that tight body cavity.

580
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,280
Could you back up?

581
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:25,355
Your cologne.

582
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:34,873
I came to offer you an opportunity.

583
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,966
I'm doing a splenectomy prior
to Dunlap's heart transplant,

584
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:39,734
and I'll need to be quick

585
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,003
with zero pancreatic injury
to keep his outcome in line

586
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,672
with my past successes,

587
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:46,408
and you are welcome to observe

588
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,279
and possibly even assist.

589
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,252
You blackmailed me.

590
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,418
You wouldn't help me get my visa

591
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:59,689
unless I did the robotic
surgery you were supposed to do.

592
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:03,529
Then... you took all the credit.

593
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,859
I'm never saving your ass again.

594
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,478
How's Mitch doing?

595
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,941
He's not dead yet.

596
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:21,476
Wait. What do you mean?

597
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,271
Were there complications in surgery?

598
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,447
The clot was extensive.
I'm monitoring his vitals.

599
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:27,482
I'll give him another
arterial blood gas in an hour

600
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:30,353
and adjust his ventilator, but
he's not out of the woods yet.

601
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:47,802
I couldn't discharge him, Conrad.

602
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:49,237
He's getting steadily worse.

603
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,972
I can barely feel his pulse.

604
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,408
His hands and feet are cold.

605
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,051
I can't... lie down.

606
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,873
When I do... it feels like I'm drowning.

607
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,148
Your lungs are building up with fluid,

608
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:03,385
because your heart
is struggling to pump efficiently.

609
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,888
- I'm scared.
- Oh, you got

610
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:08,256
to hold onto that faith of yours, Micah.

611
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,558
You got to stay strong.

612
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:12,294
I don't know... if I can.

613
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,552
Where's my miracle, Dr. Hawkins?

614
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,201
I'll find one.

615
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,547
There you are.

616
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:33,949
We're running out of time.
They're prepping Dunlap

617
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,817
- for surgery in an hour.
- I know.

618
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,836
- What are you doing?
- Nothing you need to know about.

619
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,459
Who's Samuel Poole?

620
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:48,099
Whatever you're doing, don't do it.

621
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,017
Hey, Noni.

622
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:05,619
You are looking lovely today, as always.

623
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:07,182
Pretty lovely yourself.

624
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:08,950
What is it? What...?

625
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,387
Those are cute earrings.

626
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:15,769
So, um, I need a favor.

627
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:16,870
Name it.

628
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,636
Can you get me two blood samples?

629
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:20,095
I have to verify they weren't hemolyzed

630
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,397
in case that messed with
the analysis, and I would

631
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,919
consider it a special favor

632
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,589
if you would do it for me while I wait?

633
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,425
Anything for you, Conrad.

634
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,035
Trip Dunlap, the congressman?

635
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:32,231
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And Samuel Poole.

636
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,220
Okay.

637
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:12,114
All good, Noni.

638
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:15,143
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:23,163
These aren't consistent with Trip's

640
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,375
blood tests you ran earlier today.

641
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,945
No, the incompatibility is a rare one

642
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,515
that didn't show up the first time.

643
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:31,638
Randolph, this HLA result means that...

644
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:33,373
Oh, he'd have a life-threatening

645
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,609
immune reaction if exposed to
this particular donor heart.

646
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:37,944
The heart would
be destroyed in the process.

647
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:40,370
We both know this heart
won't work for Dunlap,

648
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,616
but can, however, still
work for Micah Stevens,

649
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:46,143
the patient who was supposed
to get it in the first place.

650
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,246
And Stevens doesn't
have the same HLA issue?

651
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,210
- No, he doesn't.
- Hmm.

652
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:52,225
This is quite a save.

653
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,593
What inspired you to run the test again?

654
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:54,995
Well, I can't take the credit.

655
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,596
Conrad Hawkins asked me to do it

656
00:30:56,631 --> 00:31:00,311
as a precaution, which leaves
us with a pretty big problem.

657
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:03,481
The press is outside waiting
to report on Dunlap's surgery.

658
00:31:03,517 --> 00:31:05,184
He's in critical condition.

659
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,820
Who's going to go out and tell them

660
00:31:06,856 --> 00:31:08,319
we don't have a heart for him anymore?

661
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,136
Nobody.

662
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:32,532
To me, the people who...

663
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,902
He could talk a dog off a meat truck.

664
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,105
...will see the gift.

665
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,638
He's finally helping
us do the right thing.

666
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,597
For all the wrong reasons.

667
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:56,489
I hear Chloe's mother
agreed to donate her organs.

668
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:57,991
That's nice work, Bell.

669
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,860
No, I believe the credit's all yours.

670
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,196
You found a patient with
an HLA incompatibility and

671
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,265
the same blood type as Dunlap's,
you switched the samples,

672
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,334
and then you told Peterson
to run the test again.

673
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,202
- Mm. Prove it.
- I'll have them check the vials

674
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:12,939
- for fingerprints, and then I'll run the DNA.
- Go for it.

675
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,719
Micah will already have his heart.

676
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:17,088
And you
will never practice medicine again.

677
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,385
Two patients are getting
organs, two lives saved.

678
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:28,043
If you want to dirty this win
with a scandal, be my guest.

679
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,034
I don't.

680
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,707
I'll do nothing.

681
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,753
If I get what I want in return.

682
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

683
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,876
- Good luck, Micah.
- Good luck, Micah.

684
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:54,547
- Mina?
- What's up?

685
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,182
I have to scrub in for Micah's surgery.

686
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:58,018
I want you to take Bell's offer instead.

687
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,687
Don't let him screw up the
congressman's splenectomy.

688
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:03,540
Why would you, of all people,
want me to help HODAD,

689
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:06,191
- the hands of death and destruction?
- It's not about helping him.

690
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:08,328
I'm thinking about the best
way to advance your career.

691
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:11,097
Bell's still the most
requested surgeon at Chastain.

692
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:12,532
He gets the most interesting cases,

693
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,934
and he trusts you to operate beside him.

694
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,936
You need the practice.
Win-win situation.

695
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:17,492
Congressman Dunlap,

696
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,439
he doesn't deserve to be harmed
by a botched splenectomy.

697
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:20,774
You could potentially save a life.

698
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,243
Isn't that what we're here to do?

699
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:26,235
You had me at "advance my career."

700
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,701
Dr. Okafor. Now, my approach
to this complex procedure

701
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,737
will die with me if it isn't passed on

702
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,841
to the next generation.
We are a teaching hospital.

703
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:04,384
See one, do one,

704
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,053
teach one. It's our tradition.

705
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,156
Don't be nervous. I'll
talk you through it.

706
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:12,670
Careful not to avulse the spleen.

707
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,130
Avoid injury to the splenic vein.

708
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,734
You see that? That pulsing little worm?

709
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:56,870
That's an extra abnormal artery.

710
00:34:56,905 --> 00:34:58,838
And if you don't ligate it,
the field will get bloody fast,

711
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:01,041
and you won't be able
to see what you're doing.

712
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:39,892
Where's Lily Kendall?

713
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:41,379
She went home.

714
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:44,072
Nic?

715
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:47,099
Dr. Hunter. I just want
to make sure you're aware

716
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:50,136
- that Lily's absolute neutrophil cell count...
- Was much better.

717
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,472
Really? 'Cause I saw the numbers, and,

718
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,073
I mean, I just glanced at it,

719
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,345
- but I'm pretty sure...
- I did another draw late today.

720
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:58,715
Her count improved substantially.

721
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,224
Oh. That's terrific.

722
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,088
Please don't question me
in front of the staff, Nic.

723
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:09,922
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

724
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,624
- I didn't mean to.
- I know you didn't.

725
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:13,459
And I know you won't
let it happen again.

726
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:14,996
Thanks.

727
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:34,947
So they let you keep the foot?

728
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:37,884
Yeah. Not ready to part with it.

729
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,520
Is that weird?

730
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:44,592
Well, I hope you like pepperoni.

731
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,162
Not with pineapple.

732
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,329
All right.

733
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:52,064
Give it to the nurses, then.

734
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,957
You leave with that pizza,

735
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:56,102
and I'll put one of your feet in a jar.

736
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:57,770
Sit down.

737
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,373
Grab a slice, Doctor.

738
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,743
Better not be one of them
cauliflower crusts, either.

739
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:14,432
Good night, Nic.

740
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:15,909

What is it?

755
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:25,958
Dr. Hunter discharged Lily today.

756
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,861
But her white blood cell
count was still really low.

757
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:31,631
She said it had recovered, but
I went to check Lily's files,

758
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,633
and... they were missing.

759
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:35,701
Dr. Hunter keeps her
patients' records separate

760
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:38,304
on her own server at her
clinics, not at the hospital.

761
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,604
Why would she do that?

762
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,241
Most of her people
are in clinical trials,

763
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:45,411
and the drug protocols and
combinations are patent-pending.

764
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:46,979
So she owns them?

765
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:48,670
Yeah.

766
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,716
And stands to profit from them?

767
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:53,886
Absolutely. Anyone who discovers
a new weapon against cancer

768
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,021
deserves a reward, don't you think?

Uh, incoming.

819
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,738
In the ER, I caught Mitch's
PE, which Irving missed,

820
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:29,008
and then I handed off 30
patients to the next shift

821
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:30,910
with no issues, and
I did the whole thing

822
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,077
without asking you one question.

823
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:34,580
Mm. Okay, well, are you
looking for an attaboy?

824
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:36,253
'Cause you won't get one.

825
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,584
You should have asked a question

826
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:41,281
before you sent Mitch for
an unnecessary thoracotomy.

827
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:43,088
Did you even see a
thoracotomy in med school?

828
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:45,291
It's when they cut someone open
in the middle of their chest

829
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:46,692
laterally all the way to their back,

830
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,494
and then they peel back the skin

831
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:49,929
and literally crack open their ribs

832
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:51,660
to get to the pleural cavity.

833
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,365
And poor Mitch could have
had a noninvasive femoral cath

834
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,733
and been home in a few days,

835
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,936
but now he's gonna be in the
hospital for at least a week

836
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:59,805
- enduring a hellishly painful recovery.
- Wrong.

837
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:02,574
You didn't check Mitch's records. I did.

838
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,201
And it turns out he has a
hereditary platelet dysfunction,

839
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:08,073
which means a femoral cath
would have caused him massive bleeding,

840
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,676
and he would have died.

841
00:42:09,712 --> 00:42:11,245
So I made a fast call,

842
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:12,964
and it was the right call,

843
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,753
that may have saved his life.

844
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,589
- And you know how I know that?
- Hmm?

845
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:18,224
He's doing great in recovery right now.

846
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,658
Look at this guy. He
forgot rule number one.

847
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:21,495
I didn't forget it.

848
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,361
I broke it.

849
00:42:24,315 --> 00:42:26,065
And I will again.

850
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,573
Because you are not always right.

851
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,275
No one is.

852
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,472
That's why this job is so difficult.

853
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:36,242
And when you're wrong, I will
be the first one to tell you.

854
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:38,774
And if you don't like that...

855
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,614
cut me.

856
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:44,311
Right now, right here.

857
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,435
I don't care. End my career.

858
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:51,325
Because I am not your slave,
your shadow, or your echo.

859
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,462
Devon!

860

passed Independence Day.

1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,386
Previous on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:04,888
- So I wanted to go out with you.
- I don't date patients.

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,224
Romantic love is just
a trick the brain plays on you

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,753
- to get you to pump out babies.
- I was just like you.

5
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,304
Closed off. Until I learned
to use that emotion as fuel.

6
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,510
You were born to be a surgeon, Randolph.

7
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,168
But you're a damn good CEO.

8
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:19,398
I think Lane's committing

9
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:20,908
insurance fraud
by overtreating her patients.

10
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,584
- We have to do something about Lane.
- Nic,

11
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,240
can we meet at the clinic at 4:00 a.m.?

12
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,756
- I will get you Lily's files.
- They set me up.

13
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,925
- Where are you?
- Atlanta Detention Center.

14
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:32,996
The world at your feet.

15
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,665
Always imagined myself
in a place like this,

16
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,667
with a man like you.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,540
It just feels so... right.

18
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:47,244
You know, I sold my house
in Buckhead at a loss.

19
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,080
In debt. I was floundering.

20
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:53,850
And then, you encouraged me
to go after that CEO job,

21
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,219
and I got it.

22
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:57,754
You're my good luck charm.

23
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,144
I see the greatness in you, Randolph.

24
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:13,323
Always have.

25
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,244
I don't know who you're looking for.

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,767
Her name is Nicolette Nevin;
I've been trying to find her

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,203
for 36 hours, but there is no one...

28
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:26,304
Arraignments are in room 304.

29
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:28,128
She's already been arraigned.

30
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:29,796
I just want to get her out of here.

31
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:30,975
Bail hearings will be in a few hours.

32
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,033
- A few hours?
- She broke the law.

33
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:34,946
What do you think, it's like
paying for a parking ticket?

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,941
She's a nurse.

35
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,442
All she's ever done is help people.

36
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,228
Who cares?

37
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,870
How do I get to see her?

38
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:42,586
Wait till they call you.

39
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:50,946
Wow. Wow.

40
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:57,385
We should not have done that.

41
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,798
- I think we could go again.
- Micah,

42
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,689
you're a heart transplant patient.

43
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:04,300
You've only just been cleared
for sexual activity.

44
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,061
So you're saying you can't keep up?

45
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:08,930
I'm saying we have to be careful.

46
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,298
Come back.

47
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,093
I have to get to work.

48
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,702
I need coffee.

49
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,972
Even waking up together
was not what I had planned.

50
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,123
You may not realize this yet,
but we're a thing.

51
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,579
- We're not a thing.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:26,982
Last night, and then again this morning.

53
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,603
I think that's a thing.

54
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,438
You think I'm someone I'm not.

55
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:34,408
You have to understand, if
I love anything, it's my work.

56
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:37,445
I'm not built for romance.

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,580
This was sex.

58
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:40,946
Nothing more.

59
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:43,434
I don't even know how
you like to take your coffee.

60
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:44,801
Milk?

61
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:45,902
Cream?

62
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,901
Sugar?

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,988
Micah.

64
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:55,578
Did you hear me?

65
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:20,770
Yeah, you got to work that.

66
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,039
That's what I'm talking about.

67
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,376
What?

68
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,957
- Hey.
- Are you all right?

69
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,260
Allie finally agreed
to give me the records.

70
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:48,865
So I went to meet her at
the clinic, but it was a setup.

71
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
Have charges been filed?

72
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:51,768
Breaking and entering.

73
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,369
A felony.

74
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,772
If I'm convicted, I'll lose my license.

75
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:58,119
- I'll never work as a nurse again.
- That's not gonna happen.

76
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:00,877
What was I supposed to do?
We both know Lane killed Lily.

77
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:02,923
What about her other patients?
We still have to do something.

78
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:04,392
I'm gonna find the money
for bail, and I'm gonna

79
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,815
get you out of here.

80
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,280
28-year-old male,

81
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,323
Post-heart transplant
hypotensive,

82
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,161
with labored breathing and a weak pulse.

83
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:17,927
Micah? It's going to be okay.

84
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,596
Hey, Micah, stay with me.

85
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,168
Get us up to speed.

86
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,736
It's Micah. Sudden collapse,

87
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,604
shortness of breath, thready pulse.

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,972
Possible cardiogenic shock?

89
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,338
Trauma Two.

90
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,110
Mina, what are you doing here?

91
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,745
What's his BP?

92
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,413
80/40 in the ambulance.

93
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,182
Micah, can you hear me?

94
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,151
How long have you been short of breath?

95
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:44,987
- More than a day?
- On three, two...

96
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,156
- Any chest pain?
- It started this morning.

97
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,925
- After...
- Exertion.

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,293
He needs inotropic support.

99
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,988
Start a dobutamine drip
at two and a half mics.

100
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,118
And add dopamine

101
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:55,009
for blood pressure support;
He needs a blood gas.

102
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,133
- I'll do it.
- Getting an EKG.

103
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,193
- We should add milrinone.
- Do it.

104
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,535
Start it peripherally,

105
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,138
and I'll add a central line in the CCU.

106
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:03,005
Micah, we need your heart
beating stronger.

107
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,704
The drugs we're giving you should help.

108
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:09,112
Could his body be rejecting the heart?

109
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:10,813
Always possible.

110
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,115
Infection of the heart muscle?

111
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,349
- Myocarditis?
- We won't know

112
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,151
until we run more tests.

113
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,355
BP's 110/70.

114
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,890
He's tachy,

115
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,159
but no ST elevations
to suggest an infarction.

116
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:24,994
Get him to the cardiac ICU.

117
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,018
I will see you there.

118
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,900
You okay?

119
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,368
Just worried about him.

120
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,536
Like you are.

121
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,804
Sure it's not more than that?

122
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,872
I'm sure.

123
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:37,874
I'm due in surgery.

124
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,656
I'll keep you posted.

125
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:41,911
I got to be there!

126
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,146
You can't stop it!

127
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,815
You...

128
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,650
All right, breathe.

129
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:48,885
What's going on?

130
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,253
Elias Everett, 47,

131
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:51,532
kidney failure, post-hemodialysis.

132
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:53,668
He's delirious, ataxic and aggressive.

133
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,067
How long has this been going on?

134
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,493
He has been worsening
progressively for three days.

135
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,428
Tests were inconclusive.

136
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,011
Follow my finger.

137
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,597
Follow my finger...

138
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,068
Right eye's fixed.

139
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,104
Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion.

140
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,173
All signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

141
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,042
The dialysis is causing him
to lose water-soluble vitamins.

142
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,877
He has acute thiamine deficiency.

143
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,290
Give him 500 milligrams of thiamine

144
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:17,713
three times a day for two days.

145
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:19,015
A few weeks, he'll be fine.

146
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:22,385
How the hell does he do that?

147
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,020
It's infuriating.

148
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,022
Hang a Thiamine drip, stat.

149
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:27,623
Hello?

150
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:28,702
This is the Georgia Department

151
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,092
of Corrections.

152
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,895
- You have a collect call from...
- Nic Nevin.

153
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,962
To accept this call, press one.

154
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,435
Nic?

155
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,781
A lawyer from Lane's clinic
must have called

156
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,138
the prosecutions' office.

157
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,773
They're calling me a flight risk.

158
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:46,943
Conrad, the judge set bail at $100,000.

159
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:49,045
For a first offense? That's insane.

160
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,746
Okay, don't panic.

161
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,560
What do you mean, "don't panic"?
What am I gonna do?

162
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,317
I told you, I will get you out today.

163
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:55,918
You can't promise that.

164
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,590
I'll see you in a few hours.

165
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,725
What are you gonna do, rob a bank?

166
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,241
Kind of.

167
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,741
Stay safe.

168
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,685
Conrad?

169
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,739
It's an emergency.

170
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,341
I-I need your help.

171
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,967
Well, tell me what it is,
and I'll have it fixed.

172
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,552
- How we doing?
- You tell me.

173
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,521
He's not saying anything.
He's making me nervous.

174
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,257
Well, you look a damn sight
better than you did an hour ago.

175
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,793
This is just like a bump
in the road, right, Dr. Hawkins?

176
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,429
I was due some blowback
from that transplant.

177
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,763
I'll be right back.

178
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,005
I'll find out what's happening.

179
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,406
Okay.

180
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,050
Images from the echo.

181
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,496
What's this here,
where the heart's attached

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,220
- to the aorta?
- Aortic root dissection.

183
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,309
A complication of the original
transplant procedure.

184
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,260
Exertion caused a-a rise
in blood pressure,

185
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,648
which worsened a small tear.

186
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,998
So, surgery.

187
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,167
We repair the aortic root
before it worsens.

188
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,403
We try to avoid operating
on a transplanted heart.

189
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,060
Sometimes, it doesn't start again.

190
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,792
But it's possible. It's been done.

191
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,775
Yes, but the mortality rates

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,977
from this type of surgery
are extremely high.

193
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,546
It's likely to kill him.

194
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,155
Obviously, this is very bad news,

195
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,135
but... I don't accept it.

196
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,962
Excuse us.

197
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,663
Dr. Okafor?

198
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,039
I'll tell Micah.

199
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,208
What will you tell him?

200
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,510
He has no chance?

201
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,611
He's gonna die soon?

202
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,712
In the OR, or at home?

203
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,180
You're too emotionally involved.

204
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,549
I don't know what you're talking about.

205
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,062
Mina, okay, whatever you say, I just,

206
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,697
I think you should take
a step back, let me do my job.

207
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,887
Let me do mine.

208
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,625
Dr. Peterson isn't a surgeon.

209
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,476
Before you take all hope away,

210
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:22,226
let me get a cardiothoracic consult.

211
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,329
Fair enough. I just don't think

212
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,966
you'll like what they tell you.

213
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,519
Nicolette Nevin's bail has been paid.

214
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,354
They'll release her within the hour.

215
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,767
I told you, all I needed was ten percent

216
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,024
to pay the bail bondsman.

217
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,286
This was cleaner and faster.

218
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:59,243
Money makes problems disappear
in our legal system.

219
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,532
It's not a level playing field.

220
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,401
It's just like medicine.

221
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,972
Obviously, I'm grateful.

222
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,009
You're my son.

223
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,911
I'd do anything for you.

224
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,881
This is a...

225
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,436
new beginning between us.

226
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,088
And I have a plan
in the works for our future.

227
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,527
So Mina and Micah.

228
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,047
That's a shock?

229
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,731
Is it possible
that she's in love with him?

230
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,245
In love? Are you joking?

231
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,767
Mina doesn't do relationships.

232
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,102
She's just getting laid.

233
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,937
The sex must have been amazing.

234
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,706
It did give him a heart attack.

235
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,207
It's the way I'd want to go out.

236
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,308
Death by coitus.

237
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,943
Preferably with Mina.

238
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,316
No. Olivia. Long time no see.

239
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,752
I feel like it's only been
a couple weeks.

240
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,921
- Eight days, actually.
- Olivia.

241
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,199
- Yes?
- You're not sick.

242
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:00,985
I most definitely am very seriously ill.

243
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,428
The disease you have is hypochondria!

244
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,475
I can arrange a psych appointment.

245
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,165
I have a rash

246
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,234
- and a persistent cough.
- Okay.

247
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,035
- I...
- Just come here.

248
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,971
It's all good.

249
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,840
I will check her out. Give me the chart.

250
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,875
- All good.
- Thank you. My hero.

251
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,629
Okay. Lay it on me.

252
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:21,830
I have rat-bite fever.

253
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,617
Have you been in close proximity
to rodents?

254
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,333
I hear them in the wall sometimes.

255
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:26,494
Okay, it's called rat-bite fever.

256
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,758
The operative word is "fever."

257
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:28,854
Your temperature is normal.

258
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,972
Can it be hantavirus?

259
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,364
Again, you would have a fever.

260
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,631
Leptospirosis?

261
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,299
Leptospirosis is contracted
by swimming in water

262
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,957
in which animals have recently urinated.

263
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:38,525
Have you been river rafting in Kenya?

264
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,060
Well, I read online

265
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,895
that there was a factory worker
in Arizona

266
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:45,587
who got it when he drank from a
rat-urine contaminated soda can.

267
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,667
Did you drink

268
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:49,203
from a contaminated soda can
in a factory in Arizona?

269
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:51,672
There's one more possibility.

270
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,875
Can this rash be caused by lymphoma?

271
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,578
Because I just had
my first round of chemo.

272
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,913
Chemo? You had chemo?

273
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,083
Who diagnosed you with lymphoma?

274
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,185
Dr. Lane Hunter.

275
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:15,872
Hey. Conrad, where is he?

276
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,674
Over there.

277
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,112
Hey, Conrad. Look at this.

278
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,891
Nevin, Nicollete. Let's go.

279
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,027
- Where to?
- Just hurry up.

280
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:39,325
Come on, come on, come on.

281
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,366
Your boyfriend said you're a nurse.

282
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,734
He's not my boyfriend.

283
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,403
Well, maybe he is.

284
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:47,537
I saw him.

285
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,439
Nice problem you got there.

286
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:50,640
Let's go.

287
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,998
Name's Jenny.

288
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,279
She's been like that
for the last 30 minutes.

289
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:58,048
Confused, can barely speak.

290
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,684
And when it started,
she got really light-headed.

291
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,752
She's not my girlfriend.

292
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,954
Well, maybe she is.

293
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,026
Sounds like low blood sugar.

294
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,361
Hypoglycemia.

295
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:12,629
Are you diabetic, Jenny?

296
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:15,198
Are you taking any new medication?

297
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:16,700
Antibiotics.

298
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:18,406
A sinus infection.

299
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,949
SMX-TMP. It's a sulfa drug.

300
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,986
Sulfa drugs can sometimes make the body

301
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,408
produce too much insulin.
It's rare, but it happens.

302
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,143
You need glucose.

303
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,389
Do you have anything sugary? Any candy?

304
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,747
- I have orange juice.
- Perfect.

305
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:32,415
You're gonna be fine.

306
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:33,824
You just have to get
your prescription changed

307
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,157
and then maybe go see a doctor.

308
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,653
It could be a kidney issue.

309
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,188
That should help.

310
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,796
Thank you.

311
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,500
What she said.

312
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:51,935
And you're free to go.

313
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,104
- What?
- You made bail.

314
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,973
Let's get you your clothes
and get you out of here.

315
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,424
Extremely high risk.

316
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,627
As in "bleed out,
die on the table" high risk.

317
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:19,796
Even if you manage to get in safely,

318
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,831
the scar tissue makes it hard
to see the heart.

319
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:25,035
At that point, odds are
you could cut the wrong vessel.

320
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,137
Only someone with a God-given talent

321
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,172
and an ego the size of Texas
would try it.

322
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:39,549
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

323
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,618
You're not, looking
to have lunch, are you?

324
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,654
Because I don't believe crow
is on the menu.

325
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,825
Don't fret, princess.

326
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,331
I can save your patient.

327
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,796
You know about Micah Stevens?

328
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:54,242
Whole hospital is talking about him.

329
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:56,700
Apparently, the brother
has quite a fan base.

330
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,535
I spoke to three
top cardiothoracic surgeons

331
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,970
and they all say

332
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,805
operating on Micah is likely to kill him.

333
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,373
Yeah, well, you spoke to hacks.

334
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:05,408
I wouldn't trust them to cut cheese.

335
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:07,967
Micah is a gentle, decent man,

336
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:09,518
a great teacher who loves his kids.

337
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,348
He has more integrity
in his little finger...

338
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:13,383
Blah, blah, blah, spare me. Whatever.

339
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:14,918
I don't care that he's Mother Teresa.

340
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,898
I think it's an interesting case
and I'll take it.

341
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,555
Micah's not a science experiment.

342
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,834
If you don't believe he has a chance...

343
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,524
Well, his odds do suck,

344
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,660
but in my hands, they're not zero.

345
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,062
Besides that, I can't give you a number.

346
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:28,765
I mean, we're all guessing
every time we scrub in, right?

347
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,868
I mean, there's always
art balanced with science.

348
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:35,005
And fortunately,
I happen to be Rembrandt.

349
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,873
Kill me now.

350
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:38,575
You know what I like about you, Okafor?

351
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,777
You're arrogant, just like me.

352
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:43,446
What I don't like
about you is you're not me.

353
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:45,682
We'll schedule for surgery
if Micah agrees.

354
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,250
He already has.

355
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,689
Let me guess.

356
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:54,724
You're all-in because if he dies

357
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,526
within a year of his surgery,

358
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,295
it's a black mark on
Chastain's transplant program.

359
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,198
And without surgery,
that baby is going to blow.

360
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:04,067
I looked at the imaging.

361
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:05,869
It's sooner rather than later.

362
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:09,660
So, let's give Micah a chance.

363
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:12,409
And Chastain.

364
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,112
That's what you wanted, right?

365
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,617
Rembrandt, baby.

366
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,456
- Nic, hi.
- Hey, Jess.

367
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,791
What are you doing here?

368
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:29,128
Are they letting you come back?

369
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,094
Nic. We've been jonesin' for you.

370
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,595
Hey, um, not yet.

371
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:33,930
Um, but look, where's Conrad?

372
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,265
- Nic.
- I...

373
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,767
- I'll see you later. Hey, Devon.
- Bye.

374
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:38,880
Hey, Nic.

375
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,905
How the hell did you pull that off?

376
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,040
Later. This is more important.

377
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,612
What's going on?

378
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:51,881
Look at these labs.

379
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,350
Blood work from my patient
in the ER, Olivia Tan.

380
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,879
- Our frequent flier hypochondriac?
- Yes. You see anything abnormal?

381
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,292
Nope. Perfectly healthy, as usual.

382
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:01,658
Well, last week, Dr. Hunter

383
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,993
diagnosed Olivia with lymphoma.

384
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:06,229
And she just received
her first round of chemo.

385
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,366
She has no cancer markers at all.

386
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:15,505
Lane's giving chemo to patients
who don't even have cancer.

387
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,334
Nic warned us that Dr. Hunter
was overdosing cancer patients

388
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,103
- with aggressive chemo.
- Which is Medicare fraud.

389
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,494
Tough to prove,
particularly since Dr. Hunter

390
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,341
keeps all of her patient
records at her clinics.

391
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:31,399
And Dr. Pravesh just discovered
that she's also been diagnosing

392
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,558
healthy patients with cancer,

393
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,270
which explains her miraculous cures

394
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,483
because some of her patients
were never sick to begin with.

395
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,918
Including Lily Kendall.
She had a form of cancer

396
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,465
that you can get from aggressive chemo.

397
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,652
Look, Th-this is absurd.

398
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,805
You're trying to tell me.

399
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,813
Dr. Hunter gave Lily Kendall cancer

400
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,431
and then killed her to cover it up?

401
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,709
Lily was in the process
of getting a second opinion.

402
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:52,467
That oncologist would have
demanded her records.

403
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:53,713
Which would have shown
her original diagnosis.

404
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,237
Dr. Hunter consistently refused
to share them.

405
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,206
And Nic tried to get her records
after Lily died

406
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,175
and Dr. Hunter set her up
and had her arrested.

407
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,911
You're accusing Dr. Hunter
of cold-blooded murder,

408
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,679
one of the best doctors in the hospital.

409
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,481
Wouldn't believe that in a million years.

410
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,695
It's not necessary that you
believe us because we've already

411
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,051
contacted the FBI

412
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,554
and they're getting a warrant
to seize Lane's records.

413
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,556
The truth is gonna come out, Dr. Bell.

414
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:18,026
You called the FBI? Without telling me?

415
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,928
It's required by law,

416
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,541
considering what Dr. Pravesh discovered.

417
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,198
We're here to make sure you remove

418
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,166
all of Dr. Hunter's patients
from her care.

419
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:27,502
And if you don't, moving forward,

420
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,804
both you and Chastain will be liable.

421
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,888
Okay, well, this... it's shocking.

422
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,391
And I don't know what to believe.

423
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:55,130
But I will suspend
Dr. Hunter's privileges,

424
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,464
pending a full investigation.

425
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,304
And I would ask you not to say anything.

426
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,267
This is her career

427
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:04,400
and Chastain's reputation
that is on the line.

428
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,976
These accusations will have to
be backed up with hard evidence.

429
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,800
They will be.

430
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,755
You ready?

431
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,625
I'll be with you in surgery all the way,

432
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,404
looking out for you.

433
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:36,265
I may not see you again.

434
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:40,169
Of course you will, on the other side.

435
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:43,739
What other side? The really,
really far other side?

436
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,043
In recovery.

437
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,179
You can be honest with me, Mina.

438
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,915
I know a Hail Mary pass when I see one.

439
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:54,962
Whatever happens, I'm at peace with it.

440
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,452
Don't talk like that.

441
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,755
I've had one miracle, my new heart.

442
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,227
If God gives me another miracle,
then this will be a great day.

443
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,464
If not, His will be done.

444
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,609
I'm ahead already.

445
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,310
- My man, Harold.
- Hey.

446
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,212
Let's do this.

447
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,512
We still on for dinner tonight?

448
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,925
Um, close the door.

449
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,973
- What's wrong?
- Um...

450
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:29,579
The FBI is getting a warrant
to search your offices.

451
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:31,982
The FBI?

452
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:37,119
Have you diagnosed healthy
patients with incurable cancer

453
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:38,754
in order to treat them?

454
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,957
What? No.

455
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,625
Why would you even say such a thing?

456
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,527
'Cause there's a patient
in our ER right now

457
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,622
that you diagnosed with lymphoma.

458
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,232
She doesn't have cancer.

459
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,568
Well...

460
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,770
I know, and you should, too,

461
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:58,407
that the difference between
a low white blood cell count

462
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,744
and actual leukemia can be really small.

463
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,779
I mean, if an error was made,
or a judgment call...

464
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:06,225
How bad are the mistakes?

465
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,645
And how many others like this one?

466
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,624
Is Chastain vulnerable?

467
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,429
I've told you over and over again

468
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,798
that I'm on your side.

469
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,840
I have been there for you.

470
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:29,005
You've made terrible mistakes,
and I've helped you fight back.

471
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,317
Whose side are you on, Randolph?

472
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:31,792
I'm on your side.

473
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:43,238
Now, the FBI can't get a warrant
until tomorrow morning.

474
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,022
What are you thinking?

475
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,313
Go to your clinic right now and...

476
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,432
get any records
that could be misconstrued,

477
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:57,667
and don't shred them,

478
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:00,269
'cause they can be reconstructed.

479
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:01,715
And bring any files you don't want found

480
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:02,990
back to my apartment.

481
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:07,777
And we'll-we'll burn them
in my fireplace together.

482
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,430
You're protecting me.

483
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,978
I'm protecting us.

484
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,539
Quickly.

485
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:51,505
All right, please confirm

486
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,341
the name of the patient.
Micah Stevens, 11-22-85.

487
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,277
Attending physician, AJ Austin.

488
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,312
Procedure... aortic root
dissection repair.

489
00:23:58,347 --> 00:24:00,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow your roll, Beauregard.

490
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,049
I am not cutting anybody open

491
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:03,951
with the cast of Deliverance assisting.

492
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:06,754
Where is Okafor?

493
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:11,809
Well, hello, Dolly.

494
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,682
I love that sound. So sexy.

495
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:36,917
Median sternotomy.

496
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,053
We are cracking open the chest.

497
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,323
Stop. He has to go on pump.

498
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:43,936
If you go through the bone
and hit the heart,

499
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,493
the pump will save him.

500
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,596
You know, the longer he's on bypass,

501
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:51,165
the more chance for poor
blood flow to the brain.

502
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,100
You want him to wake up with pump head?

503
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:56,467
Nah, I say he flies without a net

504
00:24:56,502 --> 00:24:58,360
while I slice and dice.

505
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:00,140
And maybe hit his heart and kill him.

506
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,553
Let's just make this a smoother case.

507
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:03,043
Not tempt fate.

508
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,480
Fine. We're goin' pump.

509
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:28,677
Hey.

510
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:32,072
Listen, Olivia, you don't have cancer.

511
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:33,807
No, I-I have to have cancer.

512
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:36,377
It explains everything, all my symptoms.

513
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:38,212
The stiff neck, I mean,

514
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,314
I'm pretty sure that's meningitis.

515
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,585
You have been a victim

516
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,587
of a wide-ranging medical fraud.

517
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:50,391
I need you to expose
the doctor that did this.

518
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,061
There is a reporter here
right now tracking the story.

519
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,429
No, I ca... I can't.

520
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,264
You'll be famous.

521
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,206
Yeah, okay.

522
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,145
My name's Priya Nair.

523
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,555
I want to hear your story.

524
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,309
Finally.

525
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:34,410
- Be careful.
- Be quiet.

526
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:40,307
All right. Retract dermis and rib cage.

527
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,668
Retractors.

528
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:47,068
There's too much scar tissue.

529
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:48,637
We can't crack open his chest.

530
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:51,473
All right. Then I will fix that.

531
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,679
Bovie cautery and tissue forceps.

532
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:56,144
Thank you.

533
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:04,352
Please go slowly.

534
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:05,665
You can hit an artery or the aorta...

535
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,689
Please contain your emotions, Okafor.

536
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:09,278
I know what I'm doing.

537
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:31,511
Chest retractor.

538
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,014
Metz.

539
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:49,731
Heart is intact.

540
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,467
Don't sound so surprised.

541
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,835
Full flow on the pump.

542
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:59,841
And then we stop his ticker and
bring him closer to his maker.

543
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,055
News from the OR, guys.

544
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:15,690
They're through the chest wall safely.

545
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,592
Isolating the heart
and preparing to operate.

546
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:19,223
Yes!

547
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,330
Dr. Okafor,

548
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,353
please clamp the aorta.

549
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,708
Starting cardioplegia.

550
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:00,969
Deader than a doornail.

551
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,508
That is until I bring Lazarus
back to life.

552
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:19,087
Hello, trouble.

553
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,923
Meet the solution.

554
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,901
Get that to Pathology.

555
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:37,301
And then Dacron graft to Okafor, ASAP.

556
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:39,474
Me?

557
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,643
Well, you're the famous seamstress

558
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,178
of Chastain, aren't you?

559
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,350
I can't.

560
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:50,819
What do you mean you can't?

561
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,688
I just... can't.

562
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,623
Then what are you doing here?

563
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,103
Making sure you don't
behave like a madman

564
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,463
and risk Micah's life.

565
00:29:58,499 --> 00:29:59,663
Would you like me to take over...

566
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:01,529
No. She's gonna do it.

567
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:07,802
You broke the cardinal rule of the OR.

568
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,805
You are emotionally involved
with this patient.

569
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:14,042
Is that why you
can't operate, Dr. Okafor?

570
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:16,111
Or are you just not up to the task?

571
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:19,180
Don't be mad.

572
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:20,815
UPS is hiring.

573
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:23,218
God, I hate you.

574
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,849
That's the first time
you've called me by my name.

575
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:30,859
Admit it.

576
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:35,163
You have feelings.

577
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:37,611
You care.

578
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:40,502
You can have passion,
you can love somebody even.

579
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:43,304
It does not make you less of a doctor.

580
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,703
No, in fact, it makes you a better one.

581
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,844
You can help fix Micah

582
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,314
if you can harness that passion
to elevate your art

583
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,716
because hear me out:

584
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:58,674
There is no great art without passion.

585
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,091
Now chop-chop.

586
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:05,560
Lover boy does not have all day.

587
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,980
3-0 prolene.

588
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,254
Slow the bypass flow.

589
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,323
Let's get this heart restarted.

590
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:12,093
Dr. Okafor, intermittent cardiac massage

591
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,529
for circulation por favor.

592
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,774
He's in V-fib.

593
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,109
Paddles, stat.

594
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:28,943
Continue massage.

595
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,216
Initial shock.

596
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,279
Ten joules.

597
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,482
Lidocaine's in.

598
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,783
Clear.

599
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:44,292
- He's still in V-fib.
- Another 20 joules.

600
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:46,194
No, no, no. This is not happening.

601
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:47,324
Clear.

602
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,136
30 joules.

603
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,875
Clear.

604
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,168
Okafor, clear.

605
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:33,708
We have sinus rhythm.

606
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:35,877
All right.

607
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,419
Well done.

608
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,566
If, he wakes up.

609
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:59,681
FBI, Dr Hunter I need you
to put down what you carry.

610
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,482
I- I think this is a kind of mistake.

611
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:02,769
I need you put down what you carry.

612
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,431
- All right, all right, fine.
- Slowly.

613
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,537
- Ok, ok.
- Slowly please.

614
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,867
There is some kind of
misunderstanding here.

615
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,933
Please I am a doctor here,
I own this facility.

616
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,990
- What is this about.
- Keep your hand on your head.

617
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:14,763
Ok. All right.

618
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,443
Let's go. Let the evidence please.

619
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,253
Listen, my work

620
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:20,000
- Back up.
- What I have done.

621
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,437
My god, My god.

622
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,825
This is ridiculous.

623
00:35:22,852 --> 00:35:24,651
Spread your legs please.

624
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:26,225
Ma'am you have any weapon on you.

625
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,226
Of course not, I'm a physician.

626
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:16,970
Comes as a terrible
shock to the city of Atlanta.

627
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,472
So we are waiting right now
for CEO Dr. Bell

628
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:21,755
to make a statement...

629
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,873
I know, right?

630
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:26,101
Here he is.

631
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,450
I'm Dr. Randolph Bell,

632
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:36,817
CEO of Chastain.

633
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,752
I have a prepared statement to read.

634
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:43,991
Today, like much of Atlanta,
I am in a state of shock.

635
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:46,059
Our profession, the medical profession,

636
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:50,097
to heal, to save lives.

637
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,400
You know, we...

638
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:57,198
We believed Dr. Lane Hunter
shared that mission.

639
00:36:58,107 --> 00:36:59,907
And she fooled us all.

640
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:03,310
She stands accused today
of unspeakable crimes

641
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:07,080
that tear at the bond
that we work so hard to earn,

642
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:09,082
between patients and doctors.

643
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,984
But I must emphasize that

644
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,987
these crimes were committed
at her clinic,

645
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,923
not at Chastain Park Memorial,

646
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,758
which is why she eluded
detection for so long,

647
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:21,128
and we had no idea what was happening.

648
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,196
But two of our heroic young residents

649
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:26,033
and a very determined nurse
practitioner were the first

650
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,001
to see the warning signs,

651
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,648
and the moment they brought it
to my attention,

652
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,773
of course, I called the FBI.

653
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:36,209
Well, that's amazing,
he's taking all the credit.

654
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:37,811
Is it true that you personally helped

655
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:39,479
the FBI catch Dr. Hunter

656
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,155
as she was attempting
to destroy evidence?

657
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,886
Well, anyone with a conscience
would've done the same.

658
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:48,522
He's like a cat
that always lands on his feet.

659
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,856
Now, I'd encourage you to direct

660
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,024
the rest of your questions

661
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,793
to law enforcement. Thank you very much.

662
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,565
I see he's off the vent.

663
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:15,615
They're going to do a head CT.

664
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:20,198
Well, we're all pulling for him.

665
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,090
And for you.

666
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,793
You see?

667
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,449
I told you I was right.

668
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,299
I knew we were a thing.

669
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,811
Yeah.

670
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,330
- There.
- Pancreatitis?

671
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,678
- I think so.
- Mrs. Arby, we're gonna

672
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:39,599
admit you just so we can

673
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:40,945
- run a few more tests, okay?
- I-I'm worried

674
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:42,469
about this place. I saw the news.

675
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:44,491
A-Am I safe here?

676
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,676
You're absolutely right to ask,
Mrs. Arby.

677
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:51,344
You should always keep a sharp lookout.

678
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,447
Because doctors, they're like cops.

679
00:39:53,482 --> 00:39:56,416
Some are heroes here to save your life,

680
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:58,585
and others, you need to be careful of.

681
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,120
Dr. Pravesh?

682
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,322
Rookie of the year. MVP.

683
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:03,790
He's one of the best.

684
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,294
But watch out for Dr. Feldman.

685
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:11,098
He's funny, right?

686
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,133
Very well.

687
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:47,901
Conrad, it's...

688
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:49,836
I know, I know, I know.
It's still complicated.

689
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:53,907
It's just I...

690
00:40:53,942 --> 00:40:55,909
I don't know where we're going.

691
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:00,981
I don't know where I'm going.

692
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:03,650
I mean, can I even stay here
with Bell in charge?

693
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:06,286
We are all asking ourselves
the same question.

694
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:10,357
But the patients need us.

695
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,374
I'm glad you're back.

696
00:41:38,754 --> 00:41:42,389
- See you around.
- See you around.

697
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,461
Nurse Nevin, Mrs. Franklin
didn't finish her breakfast.

698
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:50,797
Hawkins, I have a woman
with a fever of unknown...

699
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:24,264
People say you saved
the hospital, Dr. Bell.

700
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:31,705
Well played. Bravo.

701
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,843
Making you CEO was
the smartest thing we ever did.

702
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,015
I want to introduce you to your new boss.

703
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,317
Marshall Winthrop.

704
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,257
I think you know each other.

705
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:51,260
We've crossed paths.

706
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:56,307
Marshall is our new
chairman of the board.

707
00:42:58,634 --> 00:43:00,367
Marshall holds a majority stake

708
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:02,135
in several huge corporations

709
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,272
that could boost our bottom line.

710
00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:08,108
You navigated
a PR nightmare very cleverly.

711
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:09,709
Congrats.

712
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:11,945
Now it's time to put this hospital

713
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,214
on a firm financial footing.

714
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:27,821

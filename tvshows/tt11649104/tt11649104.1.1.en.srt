That's not why I'm here, sir.

126
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,055
So, four days after the murders,
a man walked into

127
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:16,415
Pembroke Bespoke Jewellers
and sold a 22-carat gold band.

128
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,254
The band matched the description of
Peter Dixon's stolen wedding ring.

129
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:23,134
And the seller of the ring
had signed the receipt J Cooper.

130
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:26,014
Now, on the basis of
this information,

131
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,494
one of your team, a DC Dylan Rees?

132
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:34,854
He questioned a John William Cooper
of 28 Rose Meadow Lane, Birchmede.

133
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,695
Cooper said that the ring
was his own

134
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,534
and that he sold it
because he needed the cash,

135
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,815
and then his wife
confirmed the story.

136
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,014
And then no further action
was taken.

137
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:48,774
I'm curious to hear your view
on this.

138
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,494
<font color="yellow">I sent a DC to do a DCI's job.</font>

139

<font color="yellow">I should've questioned Cooper</font>

<font color="yellow">Nothing. When we mentioned</font>

What would you say if I told you
his offending kit for the robberies

00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:36,405
was black gloves, balaclava

recovered from a robbery gone wrong
in the village of Sardis.

245

256
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,565
DI Richards and myself
were called in to assist.

257
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:15,844
The two boys knew about guns.

258
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,485

<font color="yellow">a bit of rabbiting.</font>

Their description of the shotgun
that the attacker used

260
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,245
exactly matched that gun.

00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,644
I think he did them all.

284
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,285
PHONE RINGS

285
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,404
Not now, Jack.

286
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:03,805
<font color="cyan">Here they come.</font>

287
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,164
<font color="#008000">How did Operation Huntsman</font>
<font color="#008000">miss all this?</font>

288
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,364
They didn't, ma'am.

289
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:12,565
They questioned Cooper
on all three cases

290
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,404
and he just stayed mute.

291
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,924
Plus, as I touched on earlier,
there was no hard evidence.

292
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,805
<font color="#008000">Where's your hard evidence, Steve?</font>

293
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,604
It's waiting for us to find, ma'am.

294
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,205
Thanks to Huntsman
and the original investigations,

295
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,565
we have access to over 3,000
exhibits in storage.

296
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:33,245
That's a potential treasure trove
of victim and perpetrator DNA.

297
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,644
At the time of Huntsman,

298
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:37,205
the science wasn't up to scratch
on age-degraded trace DNA.

299
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,485
But as we know,
things have come a long way since.

300
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,765
<font color="#008000">Say you get enough to charge him.</font>

301
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:46,444
<font color="#008000">Charging a man with the murders</font>
<font color="#008000">of four adults is clear, simple.</font>

302
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,884
<font color="#008000">But you add five minors, rape,</font>
<font color="#008000">sexual assault,</font>

303
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,924
<font color="#008000">the Crown's case could seem muddled.</font>

304
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,285
<font color="#008000">The CPS won't like that.</font>

305
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,485
<font color="#008000">Perhaps it would be wiser to confine</font>
<font color="#008000">the review to the two murders.</font>

306
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:01,725
<font color="yellow">With respect, ma'am, I interviewed</font>
<font color="yellow">the five victims as a WDC.</font>

307
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,765
<font color="yellow">And it made quite an impression</font>
<font color="yellow">on me.</font>

308
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,205
<font color="yellow">So much so, I've kept tabs on them</font>
<font color="yellow">over the years.</font>

309
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,565
<font color="yellow">Now, some are doing better</font>
<font color="yellow">than others, but...</font>

310
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,285
<font color="yellow">all of them have been</font>
<font color="yellow">scarred for life.</font>

311
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:14,644
<font color="yellow">They had their childhood</font>
<font color="yellow">stolen from them that night.</font>

312
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:17,684
<font color="yellow">They deserve another chance</font>
<font color="yellow">at justice.</font>

313
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,965
<font color="#008000">As do all the victims</font>
<font color="#008000">and their families.</font>

314
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:22,005
<font color="#008000">All I'm saying is,</font>
<font color="#008000">if you try to prove too much,</font>

315
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,205
<font color="#008000">you could lose everything.</font>

316
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:28,485
The killings at Scoveston Park and
Coastal Path are like two bricks.

317
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:32,084
And the attacks on the kids is
the mortar that holds them together.

318
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:34,644
It has elements of both cases.

319
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,565
<font color="cyan">And, ma'am, erm...</font>

320
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,045
<font color="cyan">what are the odds that offences,</font>

321
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,124
<font color="cyan">which share so much similar</font>
<font color="cyan">fact evidence,</font>

322
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:44,604
<font color="cyan">in such a small area,</font>
<font color="cyan">were committed by more than one man?</font>

323
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:51,164
<font color="#008000">You know, if we reinvestigate</font>
<font color="#008000">and it doesn't go our way,</font>

324
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:55,565
<font color="#008000">the media, the public, the families,</font>
<font color="#008000">they'll crucify us.</font>

325
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,765
And if we don't go ahead,
it could be far worse.

326
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,205
We've put a call into MAPPA.

327
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:02,525
A date's been set
for his parole hearing.

328
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,245
He could be out in three months.

329
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:06,404
If he did do these murders,

330
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:08,725
he is, by definition,
a serial killer.

331
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,444
And given the opportunity,
men like him...

332
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,164
they always kill again.

333
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:29,805
<font color="#008000">Next.</font>

334
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:57,644
The next time you visit,
make an effort, will you?

335
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:02,124
You look like an old woman.

336
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,965
<font color="yellow">Adrian's back.</font>

337
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,205
What?

338
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:07,045
<font color="yellow">I saw Shirley from Birchmede.</font>

339
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,924
<font color="yellow">Her daughter's a receptionist</font>
<font color="yellow">in the hospital.</font>

340
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:12,325
<font color="yellow">Apparently,</font>
<font color="yellow">he was walking with a stick.</font>

341
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,684
A stick?

342
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,245
Well, that's gotta be a scam.
<font color="yellow">Well, that's what she said.</font>

343
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:18,245
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Adrian wasn't like that.</font>

344
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,644
<font color="yellow">He was a worker.</font>

345
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,525
What, you're defending him now,
are you, hm?

346
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:23,844
He's dead to us.

347
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:38,364
HE GASPS

348
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,005
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Andrew. Did I hurt you?</font>

349
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,805
It wasn't you.

350
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:46,525
<font color="yellow">It's all right, just relax,</font>
<font color="yellow">I've got you.</font>

351
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:50,164
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

352
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:20,164
28 Rose Meadow Lane.

353
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:22,525
Cooper's last home
before he went inside.

354
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:26,124
Walk in any direction
from this point

355
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:29,444
and you'll hit a home he targeted
between '83 and '96.

356
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,124
It's the hub of the wheel.

357
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:32,844
In this tiny area,

358
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:36,364
34 burglaries and robberies,
one rape of a minor,

359
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:38,164
one indecent assault of a minor...

360
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:40,444
..and two murders.

361
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:44,884
<font color="yellow">If walls could talk.</font>

362
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,725
Been back since?

363
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,725
<font color="yellow">A few times to see how the kids</font>
<font color="yellow">were doing.</font>

364
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:04,965
So, I was thinking a start-up team
of six, including us,

365
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,245
cherry-picked from division.

366
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:09,045
That way, we can keep things covert

367
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,644
and it should be easier
on our budget.

368
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,444
<font color="yellow">Mm, sounds like a plan.</font>

369
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:16,005
<font color="yellow">I really appreciate you bringing me</font>
<font color="yellow">in on this, Steve.</font>

370
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:18,565
Your reputation brought you in.

371
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,045
WDC to DI in ten years.

372
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,084
<font color="yellow">Says Mr DS to Superintendent.</font>

373
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:24,565
<font color="yellow">London.</font>

374
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:26,245
The worst years of my life.

375
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:32,045
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I was sorry to hear about</font>
<font color="yellow">you and your missus.</font>

376
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:34,805
It is what it is.

377
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:53,805
<font color="yellow">They were so close to home</font>
<font color="yellow">when he attacked them.</font>

378
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:57,444
<font color="yellow">It looks so bloody ordinary.</font>

379
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:04,084
To Operation Ottawa.

380
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,725
<font color="yellow">To Operation Ottawa.</font>

381
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:50,849
NUMBER PAD BEEPS

382
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,529
<font color="cyan">It's all right.</font>

383
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,809
This is home.

<font color="yellow">The first rule of Operation Ottawa</font>

<font color="#008000">It's a film.</font>

389
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,609
<font color="cyan">Thank you, Barry Norman.</font>

390
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,009
<font color="yellow">We don't say a word to friends,</font>
<font color="yellow">colleagues or family.</font>

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,490
<font color="yellow">Yeah, they'll get narky with us,</font>
<font color="yellow">but it's the way it has to be.</font>

392
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,529
<font color="yellow">We don't want Cooper, or the media,</font>

<font color="yellow">Boss...</font>

394
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,809
Cold cases are 99% forensics.

395
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,170
So, we need to do everything we can

396
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,410
to help the scientists
find that DNA golden nugget,

397
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,170
the DNA hit that unites culprit and
victim in the same time and place.

398
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,410
<font color="cyan">Now, our forensics</font>

399
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,490
<font color="cyan">mustn't be tainted by any of</font>

400
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:03,970

<font color="cyan">by the Forensic Science Service.</font>

402
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,089
<font color="cyan">But the science has moved on.</font>

403
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,329
<font color="cyan">We need a fresh pair of eyes</font>

<font color="cyan">we could send for analysis.</font>

416

<font color="cyan">But...</font>

417
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,450
<font color="cyan">forensic work is not cheap.</font>

00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:05,009
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the habit of agreeing to</font>

<font color="yellow">interfere with that?</font>

The killer, or killers,
think they've got away with murder.

536
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,929
A news piece would rattle them,
make them vigilant.

537
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,369
And that would be weeks of
covert police work down the toilet.

538
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,690
So...

539
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,409
I'll tell you what.

540
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,610
If you agree to shelve
your proposed documentary,

541

maintain a news blackout,

544
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:44,530
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

545
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,730
<font color="yellow">OK, it's a deal.</font>

546
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,449
I want Dyfed Powys Police

and start collaborating.

But...

549
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,769

00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,784
I can't share that information.

Although we've got
a stay of execution,

00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:04,905
he's guaranteed another
parole hearing within 3-6 months.

our golden nugget,
he'll be released.

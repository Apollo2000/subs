00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,894
'Oh, yes.'

148
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,335
Business class.

149
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,815
See, it doesn't cost anything
to be polite.

150
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,055
<font color="yellow">He takes the bait.</font>

151
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,494
<font color="cyan">He's old.</font>

152
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,894
He still looks strong, though.

Where's the big cheese, then,
the one off the telly?

I certainly did.

<font color="yellow">Why was that, John?</font>

170
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,734
I don't know.

171
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,894
Maybe he was ill with his asthma.

172
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,854
You've been talking to him,
have you?

<font color="yellow">No, John.</font>

179
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:11,935
HE SCOFFS

180
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,215
Well, an estate agent tricked me
out of a lot of money.

181
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:16,014
My solicitor lied to me.

182
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,734
When you come into a bit of money,

183
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,774
well, the cockroaches
come out of the woodwork.

184
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,374
<font color="cyan">It can't have been easy,</font>

187
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,494
A man doesn't sit around moping.

188
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,534
He's got to get out there,
got to get grafting.

189
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,494
<font color="cyan">Between 1978 and 1983,</font>
<font color="cyan">you spent over £125,000.</font>

<font color="cyan">That's £35,000 more</font>
<font color="cyan">than your winnings on Spot The Ball.</font>

191
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,014
Well, you've got to speculate
to accumulate.

192
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:45,614
<font color="yellow">Is that when you started gambling?</font>

193
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,295
What, £3 or £4 a week?

194
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,935
A 50p round robin?

195
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,935
I'd hardly call that gambling.

00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:19,455
I don't like your tone.

<font color="#008000">Oh, don't shut down, John boy.</font>

<font color="cyan">..if you don't want to talk to us,</font>
<font color="cyan">we'll respect that.</font>

<font color="cyan">today.</font>

206
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,415
I'm not a thief.

207
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,134
<font color="#008000">Well done, Rambo.</font>

208
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,854
<font color="cyan">'OK. You told Huntsman'</font>

209
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:05,095
<font color="cyan">that you visited Scoveston Park</font>
<font color="cyan">for the first time in August 1984,</font>

210
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,614
<font color="cyan">when you went to meet</font>
<font color="cyan">Richard and Helen Thomas</font>

211
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,815
<font color="cyan">about working on their land.</font>
<font color="cyan">Is that correct, John?</font>

212
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,614
I know what Adrian told Huntsman
about Scoveston Park.

213
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,935
About me telling him and his mother
to lie to the police

214
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,854
about us all being in that night,
the night of the fire.

215
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:21,695
That the truth was,
according to him,

216
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:24,774
that I came home late
smelling of a bonfire.

217
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:27,014
Now, you say you haven't spoken to
him. Fair enough.

218
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,575
But there's something
I want to get off my chest.

219
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,415
'Everything that comes out'

220
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,734
of that boy's mouth is lies.

221
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,935
Has been ever since
we didn't take him to Spain.

222
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:43,295
When me and Pat got back...

223
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,055
he was a different boy.

224
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,614
He was surly.

225
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,254
He was disobedient.

226
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:51,695
Bunking off school.

227
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,134
Smoking wacky baccy.

228
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:57,815
Forging cheques.
Stealing money... off us.

229
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,175
And all because
we didn't take him on holiday.

230
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,774
As a father...

231
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,055
I take no pleasure in saying this.

232
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,055
But the truth is, the real truth,
the night of the fire...

233
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,935
..the murders...

234
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,654
Adrian was the one
who came home late.

235
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,614
<font color="#008000">He's pointing the finger</font>
<font color="#008000">at his own son?</font>

236
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,095
<font color="#008000">Piece of filth.</font>

237
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,964
<font color="yellow">You know, I've been across the table</font>
<font color="yellow">from wife-beaters,</font>

238
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:36,805
<font color="yellow">rapists, paedophiles.</font>

239
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:39,884
<font color="yellow">And I let him get to me.</font>
And you made something happen.

240
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,204
When he feels under threat,
he blames Adrian.

241
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:43,805
That's something to keep an eye on.

242
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:45,325
So...

243
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,884
tomorrow...
<font color="cyan">Huntsman.</font>

244

246
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,445
HE SIGHS

247
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:21,844
<font color="cyan">Now, John, I want to ask you</font>
<font color="cyan">about some exhibits</font>

248
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:24,765
<font color="cyan">found by Operation Huntsman.</font>

249
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:27,964
<font color="cyan">Some of them pertain</font>
<font color="cyan">to one particular robbery,</font>

250
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:31,405
<font color="cyan">the so-called Sardis robbery,</font>
<font color="cyan">for which you were convicted.</font>

251
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,805
Wrongly convicted.

252
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:37,204
<font color="yellow">'For the tape,</font>
<font color="yellow">I am showing Mr Cooper a photograph'</font>

<font color="yellow">a black glove.</font>

254
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,645
<font color="cyan">Do you recognise this glove, John?</font>

255
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,244
I haven't got the foggiest.

256
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,645
I had a bit of an accident
last night.

257
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,325
I can't see a thing without them.
Sorry.

258
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,285
'I know you're on a tight schedule.'

259
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,805
<font color="yellow">We know you had a problem</font>
<font color="yellow">with your glasses during Huntsman.</font>

260
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,004
<font color="yellow">We got your prescription</font>
<font color="yellow">from Dyffryn Prison.</font>

261
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,724
<font color="yellow">Just in case.</font>

262
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,045
I don't actually wear gloves.

263
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,765
Adrian's the glove-wearer
in the family.

264
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:14,244
<font color="yellow">For the tape, evidence photo</font>

<font color="cyan">'and confirmed to be yours?'</font>

270
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:35,165
Yes.

271
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:36,844
<font color="cyan">And yet you said it wasn't yours.</font>

272
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,244
That... was a mistake.

273
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,525
I was wrong.
I think that was mine.

274
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,685
Ten years in prison,
a man gets into a lot of thinking.

275
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:57,805
He remembers things that he hasn't
thought about for ages.

276
00:15:57,844 --> 00:16:00,004
And one of the things I do remember,

277
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,405
and it was about 20 years ago,

278
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,084
was I did used to have
a black balaclava

279
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:06,285
just like that one
that I used to wear

280
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,124
'when I went fishing
with a boat that I had.

281
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:12,204
'Well, remembering that,
everything slotted into place.'

282
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,964
There's only one explanation
that makes any sense.

283
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,445
I didn't lose the balaclava.

284
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:20,805
It was stolen.

285
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:23,165
By the same individual
who did the robbery

286
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,445
'that I was wrongly convicted of.'

287
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,244
<font color="cyan">OK, John.</font>

288
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,484
<font color="cyan">On we go.</font>

289
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,084
<font color="yellow">Huntsman exhibits...</font>

290
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,604
<font color="yellow">'PAS/1, a sawn-off shotgun,'</font>

291
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,525
<font color="yellow">and PH/2,</font>

292
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,484
<font color="yellow">a sawn-off shotgun</font>
<font color="yellow">with customised shoulder strap.</font>

293
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,004
<font color="cyan">Do you recognise these shotguns,</font>
<font color="cyan">John?</font>

294
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:43,484
You're trying to trick me.

295
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,525
This gun is mine.

296
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,525
This one is not.

297
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:51,844
<font color="cyan">Huntsman found this gun,</font>
<font color="cyan">wrapped in oilcloth,</font>

298
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,204
<font color="cyan">buried underneath the duck run</font>
<font color="cyan">at your home.</font>

299
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,724
<font color="cyan">Why did you bury it, John?</font>

300
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,325
I didn't want Adrian to find it.
Didn't want him hurting himself.

301
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,045
<font color="cyan">And this gun, PH/2,</font>

302
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:03,685
<font color="cyan">was found with the glove</font>
<font color="cyan">and balaclava under the hedge</font>

303
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,205
<font color="cyan">close to the scene</font>
<font color="cyan">of the Sardis robbery.</font>

304
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,924
I'm aware. Huntsman must have
told me about a hundred times.

305
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:10,444
<font color="cyan">If you look closely, John,</font>

306
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:14,325
<font color="cyan">you will see that both guns</font>
<font color="cyan">have the same modifications.</font>

307
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:17,485
<font color="cyan">Sawn-off barrels</font>
<font color="cyan">and sawn-down stocks.</font>

308
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,805
<font color="cyan">Screws in both barrels and stocks</font>

309
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,205
<font color="cyan">'for a shoulder strap.</font>

310
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:25,285
<font color="cyan">'John, how do you account</font>
<font color="cyan">for the fact that'</font>

311
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:28,604
<font color="cyan">the very same</font>
<font color="cyan">distinctive DIY modifications</font>

312
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,805
<font color="cyan">were made to both shotguns?</font>
Coincidence.

313
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:33,124
Stranger things have happened,
right?

314
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:35,285
And while we're on the subject...

315
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:40,805
..I want to talk about the gun that
Huntsman found under the hedge.

316
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,084
For the tape.

317
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:43,525
<font color="#008000">Here we go again.</font>

318
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,525
'During the Huntsman trial,
and I remember this very clearly

319
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,084
'because I thought
it was very strange at the time,'

320
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:52,805
the prosecution barrister handed me
the gun on more than one occasion.

321
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:57,765
Well, what I'm saying is,
if my DNA is on that,

322
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,404
that's the reason why.

323
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,844
<font color="#008000">His time in the library</font>
<font color="#008000">was well-spent.</font>

324
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:10,285
He's digging his own grave.

325
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,565
Today was a result for us.

326
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:13,604
The lengths he went to

327
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:18,325
to distance himself from the Sardis
exhibits means we are bang-on.

328
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,684
His story about the gun
being handled in the trial.

329
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,285
The balaclava being stolen
20 years before, in 1988,

330
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,164
the year before Coastal Path.

331
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:31,485
He wasn't just telling us
the man who stole the balaclava

332
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,725
did the Sardis robbery,

333
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,644
he was saying the man
murdered the Dixons.

334
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:37,325
Today, he confirmed
what we'd always suspected.

335
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:40,045
And he gave us something new
into the bargain.

336
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,805
When he killed
Peter and Gwenda Dixon...

337
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:44,525
he wore that balaclava.

338
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,325
And PH/2 is, without a doubt,
the murder weapon.

339
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:50,124
<font color="cyan">What exhibits shall we send back</font>
<font color="cyan">for re-testing, then, boss?</font>

340
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,844
The Sardis robbery gun
and the balaclava.

341
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,285
Don't bother with the duck run gun.

342
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,765
Save that money for something else.
<font color="yellow">What about the glove?</font>

343
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58,884
<font color="yellow">He said Adrian was the glove-wearer.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's got to mean something.</font>

344
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,525
Put it in.

345
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,965
<font color="cyan">Don't all call me a twat at once...</font>

346
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,884
MEN: <font color="#008000">Twat!</font>

347
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,485
<font color="cyan">..but what's the point in re-testing</font>

348
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,684
<font color="cyan">when we already know</font>
<font color="cyan">they'll come back negative?</font>

349
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:11,485
<font color="yellow">Testing for trace DNA is like</font>
<font color="yellow">battleships. It's a guessing game.</font>

350
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,644
<font color="yellow">The boffins can't see</font>
<font color="yellow">what they're looking for.</font>

351
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,644
<font color="yellow">They test small areas</font>
<font color="yellow">they think are most likely</font>

352
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:18,124
<font color="yellow">and hope for the best.</font>

353
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,684
<font color="yellow">But there's always bits</font>
<font color="yellow">that haven't been tested.</font>

354
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:22,684
So...

355
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,364
..tomorrow is our last day with him.

356
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,684
I'm happy to risk
a bit of confrontation.

357
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,725
Rambo, I want Ella to lead.

358
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,124
<font color="cyan">Right.</font>

359
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,325
<font color="cyan">Hey, don't leave me hanging!</font>

360
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,924
HE CHUCKLES

361
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:46,045
<font color="yellow">John, do you think</font>
<font color="yellow">the man in the drawing</font>

362
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,285
<font color="yellow">bears any resemblance to yourself</font>
<font color="yellow">as you were in July 1989?</font>

363
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,684
No, not at all.

364
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:59,404
Even the detective who came round
the house said as much at the time.

365
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,805
<font color="yellow">Detective Rees.</font>
<font color="yellow">The one who used to drink with you?</font>

366
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:04,684
Yeah.

367
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,285
<font color="yellow">So, John, how did you look</font>
<font color="yellow">in July 1989?</font>

368
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,485
Haven't you got any photographs?
<font color="yellow">No, John.</font>

369
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,684
<font color="yellow">Which is why we'd appreciate</font>
<font color="yellow">your help.</font>

370
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:14,245
I don't remember.
It was 20 years ago. <font color="yellow">19, actually.</font>

371
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:17,164
<font color="yellow">Let me get this straight.</font>

372
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:19,084
<font color="yellow">You can't remember</font>
<font color="yellow">how you looked back then,</font>

373
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:22,245
<font color="yellow">but you're confident that</font>
<font color="yellow">this sketch, made at that time,</font>

374
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,285
<font color="yellow">'doesn't resemble you at all.'</font>

375
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,325
'I'm sure.

376
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,965
'Because I know
I didn't have hair that long.'

377
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,644
<font color="yellow">You never had collar-length hair?</font>
I don't like it on my neck.

378
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:34,164
<font color="yellow">What about the clothes the man</font>
<font color="yellow">in the drawing's wearing, John?</font>

379
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,604
I don't go in for shorts.

380
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,965
Shorts were more Adrian's thing.

381
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:43,005
Stick with the shorts, Ella.

382
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,765
<font color="yellow">The witness who saw this man</font>
<font color="yellow">using Peter Dixon's stolen cash card</font>

383
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,364
<font color="yellow">said that the shorts he was wearing</font>
<font color="yellow">were khaki coloured.</font>

384
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,725
<font color="yellow">Did you ever own</font>
<font color="yellow">a pair of khaki shorts, John?</font>

385
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:53,765
Yes.

386
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,565
But they were more bathers

387
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,444
'than shorts.'

388
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:00,644
They were shorter.
Those are long shorts.

389
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,485
Mine were short shorts,
more like bathers.

390
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:05,404
'Adrian used to wear them
more than I did.'

391
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,325
He was always borrowing my clothes.

392
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:23,965
<font color="#008000">These are the only shorts</font>
<font color="#008000">that Huntsman found</font>

393
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,644
<font color="#008000">at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.</font>

394
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,245
<font color="#008000">No khaki,</font>
<font color="#008000">and they're all a lot shorter</font>

395
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,684
<font color="#008000">than the ones in the wanted photo.</font>

396
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,005
<font color="yellow">What about bathers?</font>

397
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,404
<font color="yellow">He said that more than once.</font>
<font color="#008000">Bathers.</font>

398
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:35,884
<font color="#008000">Shorts. Swimming trucks. Trousers.</font>
<font color="#008000">We did the lot.</font>

399
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,245
He said Andrew wore them.

400
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:39,404
That's his tell.

401
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:42,725
Something about those shorts
worries him.

402
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,124
Why?

403
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,205
<font color="#008000">And where the hell are they?</font>

404
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,045
KNOCK ON DOOR

405
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,844
Mrs Patricia Cooper?

406
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:58,005
Detective Superintendent
Steve Wilkins.

407
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,444
This is DI Ella Richards.

408
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,084
Can we come in for a minute, please?

409
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:02,884
WHISPERS: <font color="cyan">Come in.</font>

410
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,444
<font color="cyan">You won't find anything.</font>

411
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:19,965
<font color="cyan">Well, you lot took everything</font>
<font color="cyan">of John's nine years ago.</font>

412
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,485
<font color="yellow">Not us, Mrs Cooper.</font>

413
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:25,604
<font color="yellow">You used to work at Ocky White's,</font>
<font color="yellow">didn't you, Mrs Cooper?</font>

414
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,565
<font color="cyan">I was the best seamstress they had.</font>

415
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:37,805
These were taken the year
your husband won on Spot The Ball?

416
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,245
1978?

417
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:41,005
Yes?
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

418
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:46,124
<font color="cyan">A professional photographer</font>
<font color="cyan">came to the house.</font>

419
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,884
Do you have any later photographs
of the two of you, Mrs Cooper?

420
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,084
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

421
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,924
<font color="cyan">We weren't big on family photos.</font>

422
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:01,404
1978, that was the year
you went on holiday to Spain, right?

423
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:03,884
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

424
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,485
Do you mind me asking,
why didn't you take Adrian with you?

425
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:08,924

<font color="yellow">What's that about?</font>

438
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,219

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

439
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:26,059
<font color="yellow">They took all your clothes when</font>
<font color="yellow">you were arrested. You know that.</font>

440
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,019
I want you to get hold of Adrian.
Find out if he's got them.

441

<font color="yellow">I don't have a number for him.</font>

442
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,979
Well, Shirley's daughter, she's
a receptionist in the hospital.

443
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,819
She'll give it to you.
You're his mother.

444
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,059
<font color="yellow">You're telling me...</font>

445
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,420
<font color="yellow">to get in touch with Adrian?</font>

446
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,940
Yes!

447
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,779
<font color="cyan">Forensics said they took it apart,</font>
<font color="cyan">tested every nook and cranny,</font>

448
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,539

449
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah, they also said re-testing</font>
<font color="yellow">it for DNA</font>

450
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,739
<font color="yellow">would be a complete waste</font>
<font color="yellow">of Ottawa's money and their time.</font>

451
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,380
That's not their call to make.

<font color="cyan">here.</font>

458
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,140
<font color="cyan">I think we should have a sit-down</font>

459

<font color="yellow">It's where the finish has worn off.</font>
<font color="yellow">That thing was made in the 1940s.</font>

462
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:27,259
And that's the manufacturer's
finish? <font color="cyan">Yeah, we assumed.</font>

463
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,860
<font color="cyan">Obviously, we've not seen the thing</font>
<font color="cyan">in the flesh. </font>Assumed?

464
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,259
Really, Lynne?
Glyn?

465
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,299
Did Huntsman recover any paint
from Cooper's home?

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,940
I want that taken out of storage.

LYNNE: <font color="yellow">Your team have been</font>

475
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,019
<font color="yellow">and all we've got to show for it is</font>

476
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,259
<font color="yellow">a partial for Peter Dixon's DNA</font>

<font color="cyan">we're seeing this a lot.</font>

478
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
<font color="cyan">This obsession with DNA</font>
<font color="cyan">at the expense of...</font>

479
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,059
<font color="cyan">..well, other, less fashionable</font>
<font color="cyan">avenues of analysis.</font>

480
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,580
<font color="cyan">Ottawa's insistence</font>
<font color="cyan">that we focus solely on DNA</font>

481
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,739
<font color="cyan">has put my team in a straitjacket.</font>

482
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,700
<font color="yellow">No. No, no, no.</font>
<font color="yellow">We asked you to prioritise DNA,</font>

483
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,499
<font color="yellow">but not to the exclusion</font>
<font color="yellow">of everything else.</font>

484
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,940
<font color="cyan">But that's the impression</font>
<font color="cyan">you gave my colleague.</font>

485
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,539
Dr Gallop...

486
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,819
..let's say we remove
the straitjacket.

487
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,819
How would that change things?

488
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,059
<font color="cyan">Well, it would allow us</font>
<font color="cyan">to widen our search,</font>

489
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,779
<font color="cyan">look for other types of evidence.</font>

490
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:59,180
<font color="cyan">Now, we're agreed that</font>
<font color="cyan">the killer wore gloves, yes?</font>

491
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,979
<font color="cyan">We look for textile fibres.</font>

492
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,459
Fibres are circumstantial.

493
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:05,059
We need hard proof.
<font color="cyan">Yes, but...</font>

494
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,940
<font color="cyan">if we can find enough fibres</font>
<font color="cyan">linking culprit to victim,</font>

495
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,779
<font color="cyan">it could tell</font>
<font color="cyan">an equally compelling story</font>

496
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,459
<font color="cyan">about the circumstances</font>
<font color="cyan">of the crimes.</font>

497
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,299
<font color="cyan">Maybe even get you over</font>
<font color="cyan">the charge threshold with the CPS.</font>

498
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,259
OK.

499
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,380
Let's go for it.

500
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,219
<font color="cyan">All right.</font>

501
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,779
We have one other request.

502
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,459
We believe...

503
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:31,100
that this is the Coastal Path
murder weapon.

504
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,499
<font color="cyan">Yeah, PH/2.</font>

505
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,700
<font color="cyan">I heard you'd asked the team</font>
<font color="cyan">to have another look.</font>

506
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,900
Yes, but this is
a different request.

507
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,380
Among the items recovered
by Huntsman

508
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,620
from the shed at Cooper's home

509
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,700
was this 750ml tin
of Anvileen satin black metal paint.

510
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,860
I think Cooper
painted the barrels of the gun

511
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,620
to make it less visible at night.

512
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,860
<font color="cyan">Hm.</font>

513
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,100
The murders were in 1989.

514
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,499
Anvileen didn't manufacture
this particular paint until 1995.

515
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,059
So, if PH/2 is the murder weapon,

516
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,860
there could still be trace DNA
under the paint.

517
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,499
<font color="cyan">Well, that's more than six years.</font>

<font color="cyan">would've been cleaned,</font>

<font color="cyan">rained on, exposed to the elements.</font>

520
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,900
<font color="cyan">Are you sure this is the best use</font>
<font color="cyan">of what's left of your budget?</font>

521
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,019
I'm sure.

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,900
<font color="yellow">Every week.</font>

570
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,940
Is he gonna live here with you
when he gets out?

571
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:33,700
<font color="yellow">I'm his wife.</font>

572
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:35,059
<font color="yellow">Where else is he gonna live?</font>

573
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,380
<font color="yellow">He's a bit worked up at the moment.</font>

574
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,940
<font color="yellow">The police are bothering him again.</font>

575
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,259
Oh, yeah?

576
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,860
<font color="yellow">Actually...</font>

577
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,739
<font color="yellow">it's a silly thing.</font>

578
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,420
<font color="yellow">You don't have an old pair</font>
<font color="yellow">of khaki bathers of his, do you?</font>

579
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,940
Still running things,
even from in prison.

580

SHE SIGHS

581
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,900
It wasn't true what I said earlier
about an accident at work.

582
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,620
He did this to me.

583
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,940
The same year
you had those stupid photos done,

584
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,539
he broke my back.

585
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,019
<font color="yellow">He didn't break your back.</font>

586
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,019
A year ago, I was fit and strong,
working in Ireland, hod-carrying.

587
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:27,779
One morning, it was like
I was struck by lightning.

588
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,620
Nine hours of surgery.

589
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:34,380
Rods and screws in my pelvis
and spine.

590
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,739
I thought it was the work that
caused it, but the consultant

591
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,420
told me
it was an injury from childhood.

592
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:43,900
Straight away, I knew
it was that punch in the back.

593
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,180
You knew something was seriously
wrong when it happened,

594
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,100
but you didn't take
me to the hospital

595
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,700
because he was worried
someone might be suspicious.

596
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,219
<font color="yellow">I never knew it was serious.</font>

597
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,620
I couldn't move!

598
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,940
You left me to lie in my own urine
for five days.

599
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,299
You didn't even
change my sopping sheets.

600
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,860
You brought me plenty of toast
and strawberry jam, though!

601
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,540
A couple of weeks later,
you left me with nan

602
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,700
and all took off for sunny Spain.

603
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,339
I was 12 years old.

604

<font color="yellow">We thought</font>
<font color="yellow">it was better that you rested.</font>

605
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,819
What's wrong with you?

606
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't know.</font>

607
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,540
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

608
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,140
<font color="yellow">Don't go, Adrian.</font>

609
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't just call you</font>
<font color="yellow">because he told me to.</font>

610
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,100
<font color="yellow">I've missed you.</font>

<font color="#008000">Well done.</font>

618
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:32,020
Yup. Well...

<font color="yellow">after a shit day?</font>

625
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:53,859
What?

626
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:55,379
<font color="yellow">I go home...</font>

627
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,259
<font color="yellow">and I eat a large amount</font>
<font color="yellow">of unhealthy food with my family.</font>

<font color="yellow">Be with your boy.</font>

631
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,739
Evening!

632
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,180
Jack?

633
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:10,819
I've got fish and chips!

once in a blue moon,

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,779
you'd answer your phone
or responded to a text.

There's no need for that.

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,819
I'm sorry, Jack.

657
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,980

Hey, now, come on. That's not fair.

00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,819
Look, I'm sorry
I forgot about the trial.

661
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:41,140
I'm sorry I'm not a perfect dad.

662

It's no excuse.

00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,980

<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

667
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,859
Right, well...

668
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,700
get some kip.

669
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,594
This is last chance saloon, guys.

670
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:28,314
Cooper will be home in a week.

671
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:30,915
We have got to go over everything.

672
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:34,754
I mean,
not having a photograph of Cooper

673
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:37,314
that we can compare
to the artist's impression,

674
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:38,794
it's a hole in our case.

675
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:43,154
Nige, Glyn,
doorstep his and Pat's relatives.

676
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,955
Tell them that we need family
photographs for our records.

00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,634
<font color="yellow">What about Pat?</font>

681
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:13,555
<font color="yellow">He'll be housed somewhere else,</font>
<font color="yellow">right? She can't live with him now.</font>

682
00:39:13,594 --> 00:39:15,274
They've been married a long time,
Andrew.

683
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,634
If he was gonna do something
to her, he'd have done it by now.

684
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:18,875
<font color="yellow">You don't know that.</font>

<font color="yellow">He's been in prison ten years.</font>
<font color="yellow">Who knows what that's done to him?</font>

686
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:26,314
<font color="yellow">She's still scared of him.</font>

687
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:29,194
<font color="yellow">I went to see her.</font>

688
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,395
<font color="yellow">She called me.</font>

689
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:33,634
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

690
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:37,355
<font color="yellow">I thought she wanted</font>
<font color="yellow">a mother-and-son reunion.</font>

691
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,355
<font color="yellow">But she was just following orders.</font>

692
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:45,835
<font color="yellow">He wanted her to find out if I had</font>
<font color="yellow">an old pair of bathers of his.</font>

693
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,395
<font color="yellow">Does that mean anything to you?</font>

694
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:50,634
Do you have them?

695
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,835
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't wear anything of his.</font>

696
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:57,355
Get down there, Jack!

697
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,035
Come on!

PLAYERS SHOUT

701
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:10,194
Yes!

702
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:11,475
Go on, son!

703
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:13,794
Yes!

704
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,395
<font color="yellow">So, the scout was there again today.</font>
He was? Did he speak to you?

705
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:20,395
<font color="yellow">He's gonna give me a ring</font>
<font color="yellow">after the weekend.</font>

706
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:24,355
<font color="yellow">Thanks for being there today, Dad.</font>
Oh, my pleasure, sunshine.

707
00:40:24,395 --> 00:40:27,234
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I've been a bit of a pain.</font>
Oh, don't you worry about it.

708
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,995
Hey, I'll see you later.

709
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:31,395
<font color="yellow">You're not coming in?</font>
I'd better not.

710
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:34,274
<font color="yellow">Is it something to do with work?</font>

711
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:36,674
It's one of his old haunts.
<font color="yellow">You're joking?</font>

712
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:40,475
I shouldn't go in.
Someone might recognise me.

713
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:41,955
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

714
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:44,314
Well, I don't want
you connected to me.

715
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,035
It's just a precaution.

716
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,075
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll go in ahead of you.</font>

717
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,754

718
00:40:50,794 --> 00:40:52,515
<font color="yellow">Come on, you know you want to.</font>

719
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:58,035
It's fine.
Go on, I'll pick you up in an hour.

A pint of lager shandy, please.

724
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:44,515
All right, lads?

725
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,594
Excuse me.

726
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:04,955
Dyfed Powys Police.

727
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:10,835
Can you identify
the man in the picture?

728
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:14,475
<font color="yellow">With the 'tache?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aye, that's Johnny Cooper.</font>

729
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:15,875
When was the photograph taken?

730
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:18,114
<font color="yellow">I don't know, the late '80s.</font>

731
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:20,314
<font color="yellow">Probably about the time</font>
<font color="yellow">he was on that...</font>

732
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:22,995
<font color="yellow">What do you call it?</font>
<font color="yellow">That darts quiz show on telly.</font>

00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:25,435
Bullseye?
<font color="yellow">Aye. That's the one.</font>

734
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:32,794
STEVE: Bullseye, 1989.

735
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:36,634
<font color="yellow">You are shitting me!</font>

736
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:38,355
The year he killed the Dixons,

737
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:40,555
Cooper was throwing darts
on national television.

738
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:41,674
On ITV!

739
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:45,154
We've been looking for a photo
of the bastard from '89.

740
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,594
And we might well have
a whole bloody video.

741
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,634
<font color="yellow">Jesus Christ...!</font>

744
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:48,475
Come here.

745
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:59,114
<font color="yellow">So, Bullseye was produced</font>
<font color="yellow">by Central Television in Birmingham.</font>

746
00:43:59,154 --> 00:44:02,314
<font color="yellow">But recordings of old shows</font>
<font color="yellow">are held in an archive in Leeds.</font>

747
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:03,754
<font color="yellow">Now, the librarian there</font>

748
00:44:03,794 --> 00:44:05,794
<font color="yellow">has been going through lists</font>
<font color="yellow">of old contestants</font>

749
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:07,835
<font color="yellow">from old shows from the '80s.</font>

750
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,674
<font color="yellow">And in series nine,</font>

751
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:13,435
<font color="yellow">there's two contestants identified</font>
<font color="yellow">as being from South Pembrokeshire.</font>

752
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:18,274
<font color="yellow">Now, the episode they were in</font>
<font color="yellow">was broadcast in October '89.</font>

753
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:20,955
<font color="yellow">But it was recorded on 28th May.</font>

754
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:25,355
A month and a day
before the Dixons were murdered.

00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:54,995

<font color="yellow">to the contestants?</font>

<font color="#008000">isn't it?'</font>

767
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:08,555
'Well, we've got the coastline,
yes.'

768
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:11,355
STEVE: And there's the
shoulder-length hair he never had.

00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:12,835
'Well, we've got the deep water...

<font color="yellow">I won't be long!</font>

783
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:11,435
I could get in with you.
<font color="yellow">No, John.</font>

784
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:14,194
<font color="yellow">I'm shy.</font>
Shy?

785
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:16,194
I've seen it all before, you know?

786
00:46:18,955 --> 00:46:21,274
Come on, missus, let me in.

Can you pause it there, please?

Rewind a bit.

There.

791
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:45,314
It may not prove
he killed the Dixons.

792
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:47,515
But it proves what he looked like
four weeks before.

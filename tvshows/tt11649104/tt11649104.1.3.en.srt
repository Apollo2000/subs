Long time.
<font color="cyan">Steve.</font>

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,640
<font color="cyan">We've done as you asked,</font>
<font color="cyan">removed Cooper from the scene.</font>

5
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,920
<font color="cyan">He is giving a statement</font>
<font color="cyan">down at Haverfordwest Station.</font>

6
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,599
<font color="cyan">The paramedics put her</font>
<font color="cyan">on the floor for CPR.</font>

7
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,920
We need the Home Office pathologist
on this.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,200
<font color="cyan">I'll call the coroner.</font>

9
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:46,920
And Anwen...

10
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,640
make sure everyone knows
it's possible there's no crime here.

11
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,679
Cooper should be treated
as sensitively

12
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,719
as any husband
who's just lost his wife.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,559
ELLA: <font color="yellow">There's no signs</font>
<font color="yellow">of a struggle.</font>

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,080
No bruising on the arms or neck.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,439
We could have prevented this.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,080
We won't know if he killed her until
we get the pathologist's report.

17
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,399
Till then, he won't be allowed
back in the house.

18
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,279
He's staying with his brother.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,800
But this is a warning.

20
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,360
John Cooper is out,
and no good can come of that.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,800
And...

22
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,719
we could be shut down any day.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,679
So, it's not good enough
for us to sit around

24
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,640
waiting for forensics
to save our arses.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,679
We have to make something happen.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Those khaki shorts are out there.

27
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,600
Morning.

28
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,040
Ahead of you is 28 Rose Meadow Lane,
Cooper's last home.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,920
Behind you is Sardis village.

30
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,959
This was his hunting ground.

31
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,360
Those fields were his rat runs.

32
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,920
And thanks to Huntsman, we know that

33
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,959
these hedgerows
were his so-called "safes",

34
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,679
where he hid items he'd stolen
or his offending gear.

35
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,999
Now, these khaki shorts
worried him in the interviews.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
He thinks they're out there still.

<font color="cyan">No chance.</font>

on behalf of my team and myself...

00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,239
I'm sorry.

<font color="yellow">He's right, Steve.</font>

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
<font color="yellow">It wasn't our fault.</font>

69
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,160
If Cooper was still inside,
Pat would still be alive

70
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,800
and Andrew
would still have a mother.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,360
HE SIGHS

72
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,600
But with Pat out of the picture,
he's even more dangerous.

73
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,239
It's like a ticking time bomb.

74
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,400
Living on his own
is new territory for him.

75
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,879
Just him and his thoughts.

76
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,879
His fantasies, compulsions.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,319

<font color="cyan">Yeah, they did, yeah.</font>

<font color="cyan">John,</font>

167
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:28,515
<font color="cyan">you said that</font>

<font color="cyan">what you described as khaki bathers.</font>

<font color="cyan">they're not bathers, John.</font>

173
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,395
<font color="cyan">The fabric's too heavy.</font>

174
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,715
<font color="yellow">I used them as bathers.</font>
<font color="yellow">So, to me, that's what they are.</font>

<font color="cyan">with the excess fabric turned down,</font>

182
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:04,194
<font color="cyan">the difference in length between</font>

Since the July 2008 interviews,

188
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,355
certain forensic discoveries
have been made

189
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,074
which we would like to discuss
with you

190
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:20,515
so that you can have an opportunity
to comment.

191
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:23,794
In reference to AJM/165/B,

192
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,115
this white circle indicates an area

193
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:28,794
where an amount of Peter Dixon's
blood was found.

194
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,515
Can you give us an explanation
as to how that might be?

195
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,834
<font color="yellow">Pat got most of my clothes</font>
<font color="yellow">from the Oxfam and Army Surplus.</font>

196
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,235
<font color="yellow">Oh, and you should also</font>
<font color="yellow">be talking to my son.</font>

197
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,395
<font color="yellow">As I told you all before, he was in</font>
<font color="yellow">the habit of borrowing my clothes.</font>

198
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,515
John...

199
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,715
was Peter Dixon's blood

200
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,834
deposited on the khaki shorts
when you shot him?

201
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,275
<font color="yellow">I've never killed anybody</font>
<font color="yellow">in my life. </font>These shorts...

202
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,515
sorry, bathers...

203
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:07,674
were something of a treasure trove,
John. Especially the pockets.

204
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:12,194
Photo AJM/166.

205
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:15,475
What this photo shows us, John,
is a microscopic image

206
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:18,314
of the fluff found in the pockets
of your khaki bathers.

207
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,515
Fluff that consisted of human hair.

208
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,275
Yours. Skin cells. Also yours.

209
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:25,875
But nothing of your son, though.

210
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:30,314
Certain fabric fibres
were also found in the fluff.

211
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:33,635
<font color="cyan">For the tape, glove BB/109,</font>

212
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:37,914
<font color="cyan">found under the hedgerow near</font>
<font color="cyan">your home at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.</font>

00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:42,914
<font color="cyan">MTJ/5 and 7 recovered by Huntsman</font>
<font color="cyan">from the Sardis trail.</font>

214
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,635
John, are these three gloves yours?

215
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,674
<font color="yellow">Absolutely not.</font>

216
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:51,395
<font color="yellow">As I told you before, Adrian</font>
<font color="yellow">was the glove-wearer in our family.</font>

217
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:54,235
<font color="yellow">I never wore gloves.</font>
<font color="yellow">I found them too cumbersome.</font>

218
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,834
What about the new pair
we found in the boot of your car?

219
00:13:58,475 --> 00:13:59,794
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

220
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,314
<font color="yellow">obviously, I wear gloves now.</font>

221
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,275
<font color="yellow">Now I'm older, I feel the cold more.</font>

222
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,475
Fibres exactly matching
the constituent fibres

223
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,434
of these three gloves
were found in the fluff

224
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,154
from the pockets
of your khaki bathers.

225
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:13,235
How do you account for that?
<font color="yellow">Are you deaf?</font>

226
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,074
<font color="yellow">I told you, Adrian wore the bathers</font>
<font color="yellow">more than me.</font>

227
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,875
When two articles of clothing
come into contact with each other,

228
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,515
there is always
an exchange of fibres.

229
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,674
On glove BB/109,

230
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:30,235
our team found fibres
from another source.

231
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,794
For the tape, BM/1,

232
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,275
a sock belonging to Richard Thomas.

233
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,995
The only item of clothing
recovered from his body

234
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:42,034
after it was destroyed in the fire
at Scoveston Park in 1985.

235
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:46,275
Fibres from this sock
were found on glove BB/109.

236
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:49,275
And fibres from this glove
were found on this sock.

237
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:52,554
Are you with me so far, John?
<font color="yellow">Oh, keep talking, yeah.</font>

238
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:53,554
<font color="yellow">I know you want to.</font>

239
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,034
These discoveries are consistent
with the accepted view

240
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,355
that Richard Thomas' killer
wore gloves

241
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,674
when he dragged his body
from the outbuilding

242
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:03,034
into the main house at Scoveston.

243
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:04,914
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to this, huh?</font>

244
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:07,275
<font color="yellow">This is Fantasy Island.</font>
John...

245
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:08,715
are you the person responsible

246
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,475
for the murder
of Richard and Helen Thomas

247
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,314
at Scoveston Park in December 1985?

248
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,834
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

249
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,235
<font color="yellow">I was not.</font>

250
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,235
<font color="cyan">Fibres are the gifts</font>
<font color="cyan">that keep on giving, John.</font>

251
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,995
<font color="cyan">Other fibres,</font>
<font color="cyan">from a different source,</font>

252
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,554
<font color="cyan">were found on gloves MTJ/5 and 7.</font>

253
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,715
<font color="cyan">For the tape, BKG/9.</font>

254
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,194
<font color="cyan">Those fibres were an exact match</font>

255
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:33,314
<font color="cyan">with constituent fibres found</font>
<font color="cyan">in the underwear of a young female</font>

256
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:37,874
<font color="cyan">who was raped</font>
<font color="cyan">on the evening of the 6th March 1996</font>

257
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:40,794
<font color="cyan">in a field by the Nolton Hill</font>
<font color="cyan">Estate, Milford Haven.</font>

258
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:44,275
<font color="cyan">John, are you the person who,</font>
<font color="cyan">on 6th March 1996,</font>

259
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,074
<font color="cyan">pointed a gun at five young people,</font>

260
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:49,034
<font color="cyan">three females and two males,</font>
<font color="cyan">on Nolton Hill</font>

261
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,554
<font color="cyan">and searched them for money?</font>

262
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:54,114
<font color="cyan">Mr Cooper has not answered.</font>

263
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:57,114
<font color="cyan">John, are you the person</font>
<font color="cyan">who raped one of the young females?</font>

264
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:01,874
<font color="cyan">Mr Cooper has not answered.</font>

265
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,915
<font color="cyan">John, are you the person</font>
<font color="cyan">who indecently assaulted</font>

266
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:06,074
<font color="cyan">one of the other young females?</font>

267
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:16,074
For the tape...

268
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:19,915
PH/2, the sawn-off shotgun
found on the Sardis trail,

269
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,834
which matches the description

270
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,755
given by two of the victims
of the Nolton Hill attack,

271
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,995
and the victim
in the Sardis robbery,

272
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:30,594
a crime we know
you were convicted of in 1998.

273
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,275
<font color="yellow">If you're gonna say</font>
<font color="yellow">that you found my DNA</font>

274
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,275
<font color="yellow">on that, I told her...</font>

275
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,715
<font color="yellow">about the prosecution making me</font>
<font color="yellow">handle it during the trial.</font>

276
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:40,275
Well, we did find DNA on the gun,
John.

277
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,715
But not yours.

278
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:44,955
You see the black finish
on the barrel and stock?

279
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,435
Anvileen satin black metal paint.

280
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:52,955
For the tape, JAW/100,

281
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,995
recovered by Huntsman from the shed
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

282
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,195
John...

283

On some of the flakes,
our forensic scientists

288
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,995
noticed a reddish cast
that tested positive for blood.

Peter Dixon's blood.

John...

291
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:25,594
did you shoot Peter and Gwenda Dixon
with this gun?

<font color="yellow">I'm a stubborn bastard.</font>

414
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,530
<font color="cyan">Isn't it true, Adrian,</font>

415
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,449
<font color="cyan">that when you were living</font>
<font color="cyan">at 28 Rose Meadow Lane</font>

416
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,130
<font color="cyan">you often used to wear</font>
<font color="cyan">your father's clothes?</font>

417
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,290
<font color="yellow">No, I never wore his clothes.</font>

418
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,449
<font color="cyan">What about gloves, Adrian?</font>

419
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,850
<font color="cyan">Isn't it true that you were</font>
<font color="cyan">the glove-wearer of the family?</font>

420
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,850
<font color="yellow">I used to wear gloves.</font>
<font color="yellow">But so did he.</font>

421
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,130
<font color="cyan">And who do you mean by "he"?</font>

422
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,330
<font color="yellow">John Cooper.</font>

<font color="cyan">Your father?</font>

424

<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

425
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:53,650
<font color="cyan">Isn't it true, Adrian,</font>

426
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:57,330

00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,009
<font color="yellow">Yes, a bit, maybe.</font>

428
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,370
<font color="cyan">Your disobedience developed</font>
<font color="cyan">into theft, did it not,</font>

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,249
<font color="yellow">There was a rope swing.</font>

<font color="yellow">We took the shortcut</font>
<font color="yellow">across the farmer's field.</font>

490
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:35,929
<font color="yellow">We were about halfway along</font>

491
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:37,769
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

492
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,929
<font color="yellow">We all turned round...</font>

493
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:43,570
<font color="yellow">and saw someone coming towards us,</font>
<font color="yellow">shining a torch in our eyes.</font>

494
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:49,249
<font color="yellow">I thought it was a boy we knew,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I shouted at him...</font>

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,530
<font color="yellow">.."Shine the light in our eyes,</font>
<font color="yellow">why don't you, Martin?"</font>

496
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:00,610
<font color="yellow">But the person shouted back</font>
<font color="yellow">in a man's voice...</font>

497
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,290
<font color="yellow">.."Do I look like Martin?"</font>

498
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,810
<font color="cyan">We all thought</font>
<font color="cyan">it was the farmer then.</font>

499
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,090
<font color="cyan">But, erm...</font>

500
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,449
<font color="cyan">as he came closer, we could see he</font>
<font color="cyan">had a mask on over his head with...</font>

501
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:20,290
<font color="cyan">holes for the mouth and eyes...</font>

502
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,890
<font color="cyan">and er, he had a shotgun</font>
<font color="cyan">pointing at us.</font>

503
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,610
<font color="cyan">Er, David started to apologise</font>
<font color="cyan">to the man for us being on his land.</font>

504
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,090
<font color="cyan">The man told him to shut up</font>

505
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,769
<font color="cyan">and er, he...</font>

506
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,969
<font color="cyan">hit him over the head</font>
<font color="cyan">with the shotgun.</font>

507
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,409
<font color="cyan">And, erm...</font>

508
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,530
<font color="cyan">..David started crying then.</font>

509
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,130
<font color="cyan">And then he told us to walk down</font>
<font color="cyan">to the lower part of the field,</font>

510
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:54,689
<font color="cyan">which you can't see from the estate.</font>

511
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:57,810
<font color="cyan">He...</font>

512
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,969
<font color="cyan">made us say our names.</font>

513
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,009
<font color="cyan">His voice was angry.</font>

514
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,570
<font color="cyan">We were all really scared.</font>

515
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,130
<font color="cyan">And then he told us</font>
<font color="cyan">to lie down on the ground...</font>

516
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,009
<font color="cyan">..and keep our faces in the grass.</font>

517
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,370
<font color="cyan">And then I felt him...</font>

518
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:17,169
<font color="cyan">pulling my hair at the back.</font>

519
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,370
<font color="cyan">He told me to stand up...</font>

520
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:29,890
<font color="cyan">..and to go with him.</font>

521
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:35,570
<font color="#008000">Mrs Davies, the ordeal</font>
<font color="#008000">that you and your friends suffered</font>

00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:46,370

<font color="cyan">No.</font>

536
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,409

537
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:21,209
<font color="#008000">..at no time did you, or any</font>
<font color="#008000">of your friends, see his face?</font>

<font color="cyan">No.</font>

A loving husband who was married
to his wife for 42 years.

541
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:56,410
We had a son
who was the apple of our eye.

542
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,930
An apple that went bad
and broke his mother's heart.

543
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:05,490
I believe that the heart attack
that killed my wife

544
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,649
was brought on because of the...

545
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:11,530
the stress,
the sadness and the shame

546
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:14,289
because of all the time that I spent
in prison as an innocent man.

547
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,649
The police and Mr Elias
tell you I'm a liar.

548
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:23,330
That I'm lying when I say
that most of my clothes,

549
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,289
most significantly,
my khaki bathers, were second-hand.

550
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,530
Well...

551
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,970
obviously, they don't know
what it's like to be poor.

552
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,810
This suit that I'm wearing today,
it's second-hand.

553
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,330
In my wardrobe at home,

554
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,450
I've got an overcoat second-hand
that I wore to my wife's funeral.

555
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,410
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I spent ten years of my life

556
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,729
in prison
for crimes that I did not commit.

557
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:48,010
Please... Please, do not allow

558
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,370
the police to carry out another
miscarriage of justice against me.

559
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,289
I am not a murderer.

560
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,450
I am not a rapist.

561
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,410
I am an innocent man
who's been wronged.

562
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
Thank you.

563
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,490
<font color="#008000">Mr Elias...</font>

564

565
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,010

<font color="#008000">a suitable time for me to rise.</font>

<font color="#008000">Are you content to begin</font>

568
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,249
<font color="yellow">If My Lord would permit,</font>

569
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,689
<font color="yellow">I would like to have</font>
<font color="yellow">a few minutes with Mr Cooper.</font>

570
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,890
<font color="#008000">Very well, Mr Elias.</font>
<font color="yellow">Thank you, My Lord.</font>

571
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,930
<font color="yellow">All right, Mr Cooper...</font>

572
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,249
<font color="yellow">I would like to ask you</font>
<font color="yellow">a few questions about</font>

573
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,050
<font color="yellow">the balaclava which was discovered</font>

574
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,649
<font color="yellow">under the hedgerow near the scene</font>
<font color="yellow">of the Sardis robbery.</font>

575
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:32,490
<font color="yellow">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>
<font color="yellow">you will remember</font>

576
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,370
<font color="yellow">that this is the balaclava which,</font>
<font color="yellow">in the course of the Huntsman trial,</font>

577
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,769
<font color="yellow">it was found that</font>

578
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,530
<font color="yellow">there were a number of the</font>
<font color="yellow">defendant's head hairs within it.</font>

579
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,970
<font color="yellow">Could you please give Mr Cooper</font>
<font color="yellow">exhibit MTJ/14, please?</font>

580
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:52,289
<font color="yellow">It's all right, Mr Cooper.</font>

581
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,209
<font color="yellow">The item has been cleared</font>
<font color="yellow">forensically.</font>

582
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:56,209
<font color="yellow">Touching it won't compromise you</font>
<font color="yellow">in any way.</font>

583
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Cooper...</font>

584
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,010
<font color="yellow">is that your balaclava?</font>

585
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,729
To the best of my knowledge.

586
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:09,209
<font color="yellow">Yes or no, Mr Cooper?</font>

587
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,769
Yes. But I did not commit
the Sardis robbery.

588
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,970
Like I said,
that was stolen off my boat

589
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,729
long before it was found
under the hedgerow.

590
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:20,530
<font color="yellow">But you accept</font>
<font color="yellow">that the balaclava is yours?</font>

591
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,209
Yes.

592
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:28,089
<font color="yellow">Mr Cooper, that isn't what you told</font>
<font color="yellow">the jury during the Huntsman trial</font>

593
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:29,649
<font color="yellow">in 1998, is it?</font>

594
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:32,410
I know. I made a mistake.

595
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,609
<font color="yellow">During that trial, under oath, you</font>
<font color="yellow">denied that the balaclava was yours.</font>

596
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,169
<font color="yellow">So, my question to you, Mr Cooper,</font>

597
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:45,370
<font color="yellow">is were you lying to the jury</font>
<font color="yellow">then...</font>

598
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,010
<font color="yellow">or are you lying to the jury now?</font>
I'm not a liar.

599
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,530
I forgot. I made a mistake.
<font color="yellow">Let me rephrase the question.</font>

600
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:52,810
<font color="yellow">What was the truth?</font>

601
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,689
<font color="yellow">What you told the jury in 1998</font>
<font color="yellow">or what you've told the jury today?</font>

602
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:59,089
No, I didn't deliberately...

603
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:00,209
I misremembered.

604
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:04,450
<font color="yellow">Misremembered in 1998</font>
<font color="yellow">or misremembered today, Mr Cooper?</font>

605
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,530
<font color="#008000">Mr Cooper...</font>

606
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:11,089
<font color="#008000">the question is a simple one.</font>

607
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,330
<font color="#008000">Which was it?</font>

608
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,890
<font color="#008000">What you said to the court in 1998</font>
<font color="#008000">or what you have told us today?</font>

609
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,169
Today.

610
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:28,129
<font color="yellow">So, you admit that in 1998</font>
<font color="yellow">you lied to that jury?</font>

611
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,169
Yes, but...
<font color="yellow">Thank you, My Lord.</font>

612
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,490
<font color="#008000">So...</font>

613
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,689
<font color="#008000">..members of the jury...</font>

614
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,450

00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,209
<font color="#008000">Remember, at all times,</font>
<font color="#008000">you must keep in mind</font>

616
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,490
<font color="#008000">that it is for the Crown to prove</font>
<font color="#008000">the guilt of John William Cooper...</font>

617
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:57,249
<font color="#008000">..not for the defence</font>
<font color="#008000">to prove his innocence.</font>

618
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:02,010
<font color="#008000">If the Crown have failed to do that,</font>
<font color="#008000">then you must find him...</font>

619
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,569
<font color="#008000">not guilty.</font>

620
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,010
BELL TOLLS

621
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,050
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>
Yeah.

622
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:27,609
<font color="yellow">What are those?</font>

623
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:29,810
That's my post-verdict statements
for the press.

624
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,649
Guilty. Not guilty.

625
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:36,249
<font color="yellow">Well, you can get rid of that one.</font>

626
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:38,450
That's my letter of resignation.

627
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

628
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,689
I'd have failed the victims
and their families.

629

00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:31,169
This is a fit-up!
This is not justice!

674
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,890
JUDGE: <font color="cyan">Mr Cooper, be quiet,</font>
<font color="cyan">or I will have you removed.</font>

This is not justice!
<font color="cyan">..will mean just that.</font>

686
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,569
I'm an innocent man!
<font color="cyan">Take him down.</font>

687
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:12,530
This is not justice!

688
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:14,089
This is persecution!

689
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:18,569
Persecution of John Cooper,
carried out by Steve Wilkins!

690
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,050
A man is gonna spend time in prison
for a crime he did not commit!

691
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,530
I am not a rapist!
I am not a murderer!

692
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,089
This is a fit-up!

693
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:29,729
FADES INTO DISTANCE:
I am not a murderer!

Today's verdicts give the families
of Richard and Helen Thomas,

696
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,569
Peter and Gwenda Dixon,

697

and their families justice.

699
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:51,490
But there is no sentence
the court could have imposed

700
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,649
on John William Cooper

701
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:54,850
that could ever compensate them
for their loss.

702
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:59,649
Today's verdicts
are a warning to all individuals

703
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:01,850
who would commit
such terrible crimes.

704
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,410
Whatever they touch...

705
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,649
..will bear witness against them.

706
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,169
Evidence lasts.

707
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,890
It does not forget.

708
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,490
And it cannot lie.

709
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:17,729
And it will always be found
by those with the will to find it.

Hey, what's this?

00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,970
I thought you were in school?
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I got the afternoon off.</font>

731
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,410
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd come and see</font>
<font color="yellow">where it all happened.</font>

732
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,050
Well, there's not much to see now.

736
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,209
Quite the job description, eh?

Of course she does.

<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of joining the police.</font>

Seriously?

744
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,530
What about the football?

What makes you think
you'd be any better as a policeman?

<font color="yellow">You made a success of it.</font>

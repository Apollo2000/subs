2
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,091
Someone there?

3
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:53,705
I repeat... is someone there?

4
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,752
Help, please.

5
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,841
Unh!

6
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,364
Oh, thank God.

7
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:01,713
Please, you gotta help me.

8
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,150
They've been after me for days.

9
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,673
Who?

10
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:07,676
I'm not really sure.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,418
Well, it appears
you've lost them.

12
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,726
What's your name?

13
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,685
It's Walter.

14
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:19,122
You hungry, Walter?

15
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,083
Eat.

16
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:27,087
I'll keep an open eye.

17
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,835
Good, right? Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,837
You know beans
were the first staples

19
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,404
humans ever cultivated?

20
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,277
They were right there with us
at the beginning.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,149
Seems only fitting
that we'd be enjoying them

22
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,630
as we march toward
the inexorable end.

23
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,980
Uh-huh. These are good.

24
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:53,504
What's in them?

25
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,084
A chef never reveals
his secrets.

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,174
'Sides,
it's my brother's recipe.

27
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:12,741
Hmph.

28
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,849
He'd probably kill me
if he knew I spilled the beans.

29
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,658
'Course.

30
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,269
I understand.

31
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,446
Doesn't matter.

32
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,492
These are
mighty fine-tastin' beans.

33
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,800
Shit.

34
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,152
Easy there, friend. Easy.

35
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,679
Damn hound's been on my ass
since Laredo.

36
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,421
Good boy, Rufus.

37
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,813
You know his name?

38
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,643
Of course I do. He's my dog.

39
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,310
It's Tabasco, Walter.

40
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,735
You there?

41
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,302
Hello?

42
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,956
I repeat... are you there?

43
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,872
Who's asking?

44
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,134
Virginia.

45
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,006
I've got a job for you.

46
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,486
It will have to wait.

47
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,271
I have a delivery to make
in Galveston.

48
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,318
Gonna burn a lot of gas
getting down there.

49
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:55,147
I'll make sure
you never want for it again.

50
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,759
Who are you looking for?

51
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,153
A man named Morgan Jones.

52
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,765
Is Mr. Jones dead or alive?

53
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:09,118
I... I don't know.

54
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,251
You will soon.

55
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,865
I'm right here!

56
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,214
Shit.

57
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,464
Wait! Wait.

58
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,905
Thought you were one of them.

59
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,821
Never seen them
walk away from a meal.

60
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,352
How long
has it looked like that?

61
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:01,051
Five, six weeks?

62
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,665
I lost track of time.

63
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:10,495
How long has it smelled like that? Hey,
you need to leave.

64
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,889
I used to be a corpsman
in the Marines.

65
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,586
Two tours in Afghanistan.

66
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,763
I saw worse in the field. Yeah.

67
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,983
Person who did this...

68
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,638
she is still looking for me.

69
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,423
You don't want
to get mixed up in this.

70
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,947
That smell?

71
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,513
That's gangrene.

72
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:29,993
Tissue necrosis.

73
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,692
I know
what's going to happen to me.

74
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,042
Doesn't have to happen to you.

75
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:40,656
I got something for you.

76
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,137
Hey, I told you,
I don't want any... I heard you.

77
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,184
Found these
in a vending machine.

78
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,447
They're my wife's favorite.

79
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,449
They were hard
to come by before.

80
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:55,497
She would kill me if she knew
I was giving these away.

81
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,805
But... you look like
you could use a boost.

82
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,244
Save them for your wife.

83
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,380
You change your mind,
they're right here.

84
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,256
My name's Isaac.

85
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,910
No.

86
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,565
I do not want
to get to know you.

87
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:26,136
Yeah, I got that.

88
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,272
Do the dead always ignore you
like they did back there?

89
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,370
Stay back.

90
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,502
Attaboy.

91
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,069
Suss 'im out, Rufus.

92
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,470
Who's in there?

93
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,994
Is that you, Mr. Jones?

94
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,869
No need to fear, my friend.

95
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:05,132
Just want to have a little chat
is all.

96
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,884
No, don't.

97
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:20,016
Don't.

98
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,990
Hi, there.

99
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,080
Hey, buddy.

100
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,909
Hey, uh,
I don't want any trouble.

101
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,172
Then we won't have any.

102
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,349
This fella didn't eat Mr. Jones,
Rufus.

103
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,525
So what is you smellin'?

104
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,846
Have you seen this man?

105
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,499
He could be dead or alive.

106
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,762
If he were alive,
he wouldn't be alone.

107
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,113
He would've lost
quite a bit of blood.

108
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:15,289
Why you lookin' for him?

109
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,987
You answer
my question first. Look, buddy, I...

110
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,598
It's a part
of the social contract.

111
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,949
I say hello, you say hello back.

112
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,385
I ask a question,

113
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,474
you answer it
before asking one of your own.

114
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:28,868
I haven't seen him.

115
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,086
Are you sure?

116
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,132
Social contract goes both ways.

117
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,394
What does that mean?

118
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,309
You help me
with one of my problems,

119
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,006
I help you with one of your own.

120
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,182
What makes you think
I got problems?

121
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,793
We all have problems.

122
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:59,637
Do I know you?

123
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:00,987
I don't think so.

124
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,858
Trust me... I'd remember

125
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,687
if I ever met a man
with an axe like that.

126
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,819
I don't think I can help you.

127
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,734
Sorry.

128
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,000
All right, then.

129
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,532
Why is my dog so intrigued?

130
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,708
He's your dog, buddy.

131
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,624
Was anyone else in there
with you?

132
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,626
Nope.

133
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,674
My, my, my.

134
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,286
You sure are sweatin'.

135
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:42,898
The heat...
Must be getting to me.

136
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,424
So why don't we go inside
so we can cool down?

137
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,362
Scoot, boy.

138
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,287
My dog was compelled hither
'cause this blanket

139
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,725
holds the scent of the man
I've been looking for.

140
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,554
But you said
you hadn't seen him.

141
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,340
I got attacked by dead
out there.

142
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,863
Holed up in here.

143
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,735
O-Ones I didn't kill
wandered off.

144
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,695
Got tangled up in that
when your guy attacked me.

145
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,089
Ah.

146
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,873
So he's dead then.

147
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,050
'Fraid so.

148
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,848
Come on!

149
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,633
You're just gonna attract
more of them.

150
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:06,938
I told you they wandered off.

151
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,418
He's probably
right down the road.

152
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:30,962
If the man I'm looking for
is where you say he is,

153
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,140
I'll uphold my end
of the social contract.

154
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,056
Hey, you can't... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay!

155
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,623
Stop. It's okay!

156
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,320
It's not okay! The bullet's still in...

157
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,061
You can't be in here.
I can take that out.

158
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,541
I said you gotta go!

159
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,804
The bullet could be close
to your pulmonary artery.

160
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:32,198
If it fragmented
and you move the wrong way,

161
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,287
you could die. I told you...

162
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,159
I know.

163
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,856
Did you stitch yourself up? No.

164
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,704
'Cause no doctor would've left
that bullet in there.

165
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,860
How did you find
this place?
Your bag.

166
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,862
It had coordinates
written in it.

167
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,212
Took a chance.

168
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,648
Why?

169
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,259
Because I need your help.

170
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,175
My wife, she's pregnant.

171
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,611
Eight months,

172
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,614
but, uh, contractions started
a couple nights ago.

173
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,529
If the baby comes early,

174
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,664
it's gonna need oxygen,
maybe more.

175
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:06,449
The rotters surrounded
the place my wife's at

176
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:07,885
while I was away.

177
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,757
I tried to push through 'em
on the way back,

178
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,324
but there were too many.

179
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,065
I was looking for a gun
to clear them with when we met.

180
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,502
A gun?

181
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,678
Yeah, they're getting harder
and harder to come by.

182
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,289
Why? You got ammo?

183
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,211
All right.

184
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,781
Take this, and then leave.

185
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,011
It won't work.

186
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,100
Two shots isn't enough.

187
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,580
It's just gonna
draw more of 'em.

188
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:58,893
But you... you could walk us
right past the rotters.

189
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,330
They wouldn't even know
you were there. I can't help you.

190
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,900
Sure, you can, Morgan.

191
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,905
What?

192
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:13,081
What is it?

193
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,475
What's wrong?

194
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,002
How do you know my name?

195
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:24,962
I saw the tape you made
at a truck stop outside Luling.

196
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:28,749
I wasn't sure if it was you
or not outside the thrift shop,

197
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,292
but all this... I don't
do that anymore.

198
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,534
Why not?

199
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:32,970
Because I don't.

200
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,842
I just don't.

201
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:43,067
Now I need you to leave me be.

202
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,987
I'm sorry.

203
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,599
I'm running out of time here.

204
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,253
I don't have
a whole lot of options left.

205
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,821
I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

206
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,651
This isn't gonna go...

207
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,009
Aah!

208
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:25,196
Good boy, Rufus.

209
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,293
Isaac!

210
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,555
You lied to me.

211
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,991
You lied to me!

212
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,647
Over here!

213
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,824
Over here!

214
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,304
The gun!

215
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,708
You already dead.

216
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,362
I can see it.

217
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,146
I can smell it.

218
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,324
Morgan, do it! Shoot him!

219
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,156
The truck.

220
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:57,158
We're gonna have to take
the long way around.

221
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,769
I'm going back.

222
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,426
What did you say?

223
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,297
He'll be gone.

224
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,560
Walkers won't bother me,

225
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,300
and I can salvage what's left.

226
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,911
He's not gonna stop
looking for you.

227
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,826
He's probably
already on our trail.

228
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,480
Forget that place. It's done.

229
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,090
It is not.

230
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:18,832
Can't be.

231
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,268
What's the matter with you?

232
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,898
Why would you risk
going back to that place?

233
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,881
That tower is the only reason
why I'm still breathing.

234
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,144
Oh, so you've lost
your secret hideout.

235
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:28,929
Guess what...
It wasn't that secret.

236
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,235
That dog found you
in less than a day.

237
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,716
And whether that asshole
kills you or not,

238
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,196
you're gonna be
dead soon anyway.

239
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,720
The tower wasn't for me.

240
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,505
Who was it for?

241
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,945
You asked me
if I stitched myself up.

242
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,425
I did not.

243
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,123
Somebody else did.

244
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,516
Who?

245
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,169
I don't know.

246
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,433
I was shot. I was...

247
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,173
barely hanging on.

248
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,524
Walkers were about
to tear me apart.

249
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,917
Then I heard gunshots.

250
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,745
Walkers dropped.

251
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,399
I blacked out.

252
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,185
Woke up later, and...

253
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,971
I was patched up.

254
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:15,062
And whoever did that,
they left me this.

255
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,593
What message?

256
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:27,074
It don't matter.

257
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:34,037
Whoever you were fixing
that place up for,

258
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,779
I'm guessing
it was to keep them safe.

259
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,782
It's not gonna do that now.

260
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,568
It probably never was.

261
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,396
But where I'm going,
where my wife is,

262
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,224
it is safe.

263
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,185
Whoever you were setting
that tower up for,

264
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:53,361
they'd be safe there, too.

265
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,669
And why would you
do that for me?

266
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:01,325
You get me to my family,
and I will take care of yours.

267
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,555
Okay. Let's go.

268
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,556
You really thought you could
fit everyone in that tower?

269
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,451
It wasn't for everyone.

270
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,453
Who made the cut?

271
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,934
John? Alicia?

272
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,806
It was Grace.

273
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,285
Pad Thai?

274
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,287
Books at double-speed? Yeah.

275
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,942
I thought she was... Everybody did.

276
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,990
She wasn't.

277
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,252
She was pregnant.

278
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,689
I found out
the night I got shot.

279
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,038
And everyone else?

280
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,649
What happened to them?

281
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,609
Ginny split you up, didn't she?

282
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:10,873
Whoa.

283
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,572
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, now.

284
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:17,706
Is there something
you're not telling me?

285
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,187
You knew my name.

286
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,232
And now you know hers?

287
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,626
I get what you're thinking.

288
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,194
I'm thinking this is bullshit,

289
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,109
and you are leading me
straight back to her.

290
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:31,067
Now, why would I do that?

291
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,113
I ran away from her, too.

292
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:39,206
I used to be one of her rangers.

293
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,425
I should've told you,

294
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,862
but I didn't think
you'd trust me.

295
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:50,086
You're right.

296
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,132
But I wasn't lying before.

297
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,525
I did see your tape.

298
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,527
I was on patrol.

299
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,094
And you were giving away

300
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,444
what Ginny was charging people
their freedom for.

301
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,142
Thought there was no way
that could work.

302
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,926
Well, you're right again,
'cause it didn't.

303
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,754
Well, it did for me.

304
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,930
When my wife got pregnant,

305
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:11,064
I realized
that future Ginny was building,

306
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:12,737
I didn't want my kid
to have to pay the price

307
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,807
it was gonna cost.

308
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,330
But what you were doing...

309
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,375
At least what
you were trying to do...

310
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,943
Seemed a whole lot better.

311
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,554
So my wife and I ran away
to do the same.

312
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,257
Is that where we're going now?

313
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,477
Someplace
you think that can happen?

314
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:36,393
Oh, I know it can.

315
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:39,396
And you can be a part of it.

316
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,790
But you gotta let me
take that bullet out.

317
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,357
Told you, it's too late.

318
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:48,188
You and I know that's not true.

319
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,756
You're leaving that in there

320
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,410
'cause you think you deserve it.

321
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,433
There it is.

322
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:19,306
I tried
to lead the rotters away...

323
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,178
but that keeps drawing 'em back.

324
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,313
And there's no good place
to take 'em.

325
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,535
You get these to my wife.

326
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,930
Her name's Rachel.

327
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,025
This place is not safe.

328
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,636
Virginia's gonna find her.

329
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,465
She won't.How can you be sure?

330
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,771
'Cause I never found it

331
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,338
even when
I was one of her rangers.

332
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,471
Even if someone does,

333
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:57,692
we fortify that gate,
no one's getting past that wall.

334
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,785
You better get a move on.

335
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,570
What are you gonna do?

336
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,574
There's another way in
through the mountains.

337
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,055
It's gonna take
at least a couple days.

338
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,756
Hopefully I get there
before the baby does.

339
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,638
Here.

340
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,730
Be careful.

341
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,431
Thank you, Morgan.

342
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,780
Keep going!

343
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:17,963
Hey!

344
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,226
I'm right here.

345
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,495
I'm right here.

346
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,826
Hey.

347
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:33,098
I think... I think
this is better coming from you.

348
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,456
My grandpa
used to bring me fishing

349
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:46,415
at a lake around here
when I was a kid.

350
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,464
So where's the lake?

351
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,033
We're standing in it.

352
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:00,125
There used to be water
filling this valley

353
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,561
far as you could see.

354
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,563
Huh.

355
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:08,437
When the dam gave,
it uncovered all this.

356
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:13,964
You look at a map,
all you see is a lake.

357
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,444
Huh.

358
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,969
That's why she'll never find it.

359
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,668
Huh?

360
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,893
Oh, no.

361
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,595
Isaac...

362
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:41,688
I got here
as fast as I could.
You okay?

363
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,995
Now I am... knowing you are.

364
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,998
The contractions,
they're getting closer.

365
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,088
It's okay. I'm here now.

366
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:54,309
Rachel, this is Morgan.

367
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:56,224
He helped me get back here.

368
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,747
How far apart
are the contractions?

369
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,009
A few minutes.

370
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,664
Well, we gotta get ready.

371
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,623
This baby's coming.

372
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:17,506
Won't be much longer now.

373
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:23,643
Whenever my grandpa
used to take me fishing,

374
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:26,211
he'd always tell me
this crazy story

375
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:30,867
about how they flooded a town
to make the lake.

376
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:34,132
I thought he was pulling my leg.

377
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,437
But when Rachel and I came here

378
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,874
looking for his fishing cabin,

379
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,572
we found this instead.

380
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:42,749
It was here all along.

381
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,796
World just had to end
for us to find it.

382
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,584
There's water here.

383
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:55,544
Soil's rich from all the silt.

384
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,461
We can rebuild this place.

385
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:02,072
No, no, no, no.

386
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,553
No.

387
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,385
But you can.

388
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,736
I survived something
most people don't.

389
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,827
'Cause I knew there was
something I had to do.

390
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,090
Thought the water tower was it,

391
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,483
but maybe I was wrong, you know?

392
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,007
Maybe...

393
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,143
Maybe it was all about
getting you here.

394
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,677
He found us.

395
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:44,027
Isaac, what is that?

396
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,812
Who's out there?

397
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,292
Emile.

398
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,990
Not the first time Ginny's
used him to find someone.

399
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,513
Stay here.

400
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:52,949
Morgan, stop.

401
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:55,517
He's not here for you.
He's here for me.

402
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,128
I won't let you do this,
not after you got me here.

403
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,522
Hey, you just do what you said.

404
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:04,004
My people, you find them,
you bring 'em here.

405
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,314
You take care of your family.

406
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:10,750
And mine.

407
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,143
Morgan,
you can't let it end like this!

408
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,494
He only fights
'cause people pay him!

409
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:16,843
You got something to fight for!

410
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:18,105
Isaac...

411
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,282
Stay with me.

412
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:37,429
Even I can smell you
from a mile away.

413
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,697
Hey, I can't fight you.

414
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,307
I'm what you came for.

415
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,743
Virginia can have it.

416
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:51,138
Long as you leave
the other people here alone.

417
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:52,835
This isn't a negotiation.

418
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,663
I'm trying to make it easy.

419
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:57,492
That's got to count
for something.

420
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,021
You make a good point.

421
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:07,894
Consider it a deal.

422
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,896
All right.

423
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,539
You won't even feel this.

424
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,908
Isaac, get up.

425
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,649
Get inside.

426
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,524
You can't die, Morgan.

427
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,588
You have to do what we said
with this place.

428
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,091
Your people...

429
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,224
That's what
you're gonna do.
I can't.

430
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:20,793
Oh, no.

431
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,621
Got bit coming back in here
the first time.

432
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,840
Before I went looking
for the gun.

433
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,103
Wasn't about
getting me back here, Morgan.

434
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,496
It was about getting you here.

435
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,758
I can't.

436
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,369
That's why
it didn't work before.

437
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,458
I can't be
who they need me to be. I changed.

438
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,416
So can you.

439
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,939
Morgan.

440
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:59,919
Aah!

441
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:09,902
You couldn't do it then...

442
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,991
and you won't do it now.

443
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,117
That message...

444
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,468
You know what I told them?

445
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:03,695
Told them to live.

446
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:08,569
Just live.

447
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:16,185
You should g...
You should go meet your kid.

448
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:19,145
I think you're right.

449
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:29,285
I'm just gonna...

450
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,853
I'm gonna rest right here.

451
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:35,291
You know? And just...

452
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,564
Ugh!

453
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,494
He insisted
he take it out.

454
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,889
He didn't think you'd mind.

455
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,077
A boy or a girl?

456
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,079
A girl.

457
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:28,040
We have a daughter.

458
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,173
Yeah.

459
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,959
We named her Morgan.

460
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:40,182
It was Isaac's idea.

461
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,144
Huh.

462
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:46,754
And where is he?

463
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,364
I should, uh...

464
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,366
I-I should thank him.

465
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:23,573
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

466
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,537
Virginia?

467
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:49,257
If you're there...

468
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:53,392
if you can hear me...

469
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:56,090
I want you to listen
and listen good.

470
00:47:58,136 --> 00:48:03,184
I thought I needed you
to be dead for this to work.

471
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:05,491
But I don't.

472
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:10,191
I just need them
to think you are.

473
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:12,977
Which they will.

474
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,590
'Cause if you even try
the tiniest bit

475
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:23,988
to convince them otherwise,
I will add them to this pile.

476
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:28,644
One by one.

477
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,864
Do you copy?

478
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,825
Morgan Jones is dead.

479
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:42,441
And you are dealing
with somebody else now.

480
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,450
Load up!

481
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:53,974
Move it! Now!

482
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:53,816
He should have been here by now.

483
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:57,733
There are gonna be more.

484
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:00,388
We can't stick around.

485
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:03,000
We need that key.

486
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:12,444
We're gonna have to wait
somewhere else.

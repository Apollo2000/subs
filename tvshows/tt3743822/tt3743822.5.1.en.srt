2
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:15,485
I thought we were always
on our own in this world.

3
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:16,709
I was wrong.

4
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,038
So, what's your story?

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:19,362
I met new people

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,657
who became friends...

7
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:24,629
and we survived a hurricane...

8
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,175
... truckers...

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,787
- That's a half point.
- ... an alligator...

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,491
These aren't friendly waters.

11
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:32,582
Well, we ain't going for a swim.

12
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,907
... beer runs.

13
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:36,806
This world can surprise you...

14
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,025
but it's hard to know who to trust.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,748
You lied to us, and
then you shot my brother.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,161
Someone poisoned us.

17
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,914
Nooo! No!

18
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,588
I've got things to make up for,
same as everybody else.

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,011
But if you're out there on your own...

20
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:52,520
we can help you.

21
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:54,060
Hang on.

22
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,820
We're comin'.

23
00:00:57,902 --> 00:00:59,103
Don't be scared.

24
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,163
I'm not scared.

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,208
Is it going to be loud?

26
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,308
No. It won't be loud.

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,480
Actually, I'm completely lying.

28
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,396
It's gonna be one of the louder
things you've ever heard.

29
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,743
Louder than when Dad's
barbecue exploded.

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,894
Annie said there was a
crowd of growlers nearby.

31
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,374
That's the next problem we'll handle.

32
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,785
Dylan, you can do this.

33
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,194
Come on!

34
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,721
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:58,401
I hit it.

36
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,583
Yeah, you did.

37
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,098
They heard us.

38
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:08,557
We can get it out of here in time.

39
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,448
- Max...
- I got it.

40
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,876
It's... It's jammed!

41
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:23,648
- Max!
- I know!

42
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,416
Max!

43
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,559
Down!

44
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:47,845
Come on.

45
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:55,938
Whoa.

46
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:02,975
The growlers.

47
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,569
We gotta keep moving.

48
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,117
Let's go.

49
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:45,997
Come on.

50
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,317
Stay back.

51
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:14,057
Max?

52
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,162
Stand back, Dylan.

53
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,363
It's okay.

54
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,870
We're here to help.

55
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:30,727
Get inside!

Wait. He's not a biter.

59
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:11,451
Are you okay?

60
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,706
I-I-I, uh...

61
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,275
I think so, yeah.

62
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:17,286
Oh, shit. It's still jammed.

63
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,411
Get back!

64
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,913
God!

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,812
Oh, God!

66
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,124
Who are you people?

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,293
We came to help.

68
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,487
Are you... Are you with Logan?

69
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:38,911
Who's Logan?

70
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,693
Alicia!

71
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,535
We can't stay long.

72
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,894
Morgan.

73
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:50,491
Yeah.

74
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,280
Luci, you okay?

75
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,007
Oh, my God.

76
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,994
You just don't move, don't move.

77
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:02,888
June!

78
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,865
June!

79
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,424
Al, can you hear me?!

80
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:15,433
Stay with me.

81
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,068
- It's okay.
- Oh, God.

82
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,604
Everything's gonna be okay.

83
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,589
Hey, you, come here.

84
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,108
It'll be all right.
Just tell me your name.

85
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,520
- Dylan.
- Dylan, I'm Morgan.

86
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,112
You want to help me help my friend?

87
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,618
Gonna need you just to
put pressure right here

88
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:30,903
until I get back.

89
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:32,754
And all you have to do is
make sure you don't move her.

90
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,030
Come here. Come on.

91
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,038
Just down here, and one hand here.

92
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,530
Keep pressure on it, all right?

93
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,792
Easy, easy. Right there.

94
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:43,193
- Pressure on.
- Where are you going?

95
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,464
Make sure nothing out
there gets in here.

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,132
What if something gets through?

97
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,104
If it's dead, shoot it.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,087
Al. Al.

99
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,844
Al.

100
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:15,769
Okay. Al.

101
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,692
Okay. Yeah.

102
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,029
Okay. You're hurt.

103
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,631
So are you.

104
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,174
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Easy.

105
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,266
Easy.

106
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:35,456
Your hands, Alicia.

107
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,606
Yeah.

108
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:46,495
Ah!

109
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,485
Aah! Okay. Okay.

110
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,296
Okay.

111
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,435
John.

112
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,135
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

113
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,018
Up there.

114
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,361
Up there.

115
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,091
- How far to the truck stop?
- I don't know.

116
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,660
We're maybe 10, 15 miles
from the touchdown site.

117
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,632
- We're not gonna make it in time.
- No, we will make it.

118
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,101
Morgan, where are you?

119
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,758
Logan?

120
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,234
- What happened to...
- Logan, do you copy?

121
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,586
We... We are...

122
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:55,189
Listen, if you copy, we are coming.

123
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,581
Just might take us a little longer
to get there than we thought.

124
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:01,926
Alicia?

125
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,798
Hey, we need to buy
everybody some more time.

126
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:06,936
Come on.

127
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,392
Shoot the sons of bitches!

128
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,930
Strand, if you can hear this,

129
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,153
we made it over the mountain,

130
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:51,311
but we crashed the plane.

131
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,304
I crashed the plane.

132
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:55,949
Go back to the mill

133
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,500
and get my personal backups.

134
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:59,925
There's a tape labeled "Skidmark".

135
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,483
Watch it.

136
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,712
The guy on it has a small plane.

137
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,191
We need you to come get us.

138
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:13,743
Looks like you're gonna
get to fly after all.

139
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,328
Do you copy?

140
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,696
Strand?

141
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,315
He can't hear us. We
gotta be outta range.

142
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,520
Shit.

143
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,061
Come on.

144
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,646
- Aah! Aah!
- It's okay.

145
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:02,981
It's okay.

146
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,549
My name's Dylan.

147
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:07,452
Your friends, they're
trying to get you help.

148
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,038
Easy. I'm the nurse.

149
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,630
I just want to look at her.

150
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,133
Let go. Good job.

151
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,196
Shit.

152
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,354
Go.

153
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,115
Don't stay because of me.

154
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,183
No.

155
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,351
We're not going anywhere.

156
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,335
Jesus.

157
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,611
How is she?

158
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,723
We got to cut her free.

159
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,027
The boxes, there were hacksaws in them.

160
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,262
Yes.

161
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:53,701
They're out there.

162
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,642
Check it out.

163
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:06,563
- You got anything?
- No.

164
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:07,728
Shit!

165
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,653
Aah!

166
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,806
Shit!

167
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,717
Al?

168
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:03,775
Yeah.

169
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,199
- You good?
- It's okay.

170
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,925
- Didn't bite me.
- I found it.

171
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,051
Come on.

172
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,813
Put your hand on my hand, okay?

173
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:19,981
It cannot move.

174
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,651
All right.

175
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,746
We need to clear a path.

176
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,341
How many rounds you have?

177
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,633
- Uh, seven.
- We'll make it work.

178
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:51,920
We can do this.

179
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,548
Alicia.

180
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,249
Okay. I'll take the lead.

181
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,722
Morgan, you take the side.

182
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:04,256
June, Al, keep her safe.

183
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,058
You two, stay in the middle,

184
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,060
watch your back, okay?

185
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,228
Okay.

186
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,873
Now.

187
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:29,916
Get in!

188
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:31,874
Who are you?

189
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,234
That's our sister. Come on.

190
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,295
Always hated flying.

191
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:46,621
Don't think you'll ever have to
set foot in that tin can again.

192
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,058
Watch out, watch out.

193
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:51,937
Dead are everywhere.

194
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,818
Growlers are the least of our problems.

195
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,742
You have no idea where
you landed, do you?

196
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,469
Are you sure she said, "Skidmark"?

197
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,909
How you gonna get this bear in the air,

198
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,534
assuming we can track it down?

199
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,320
I've got it covered.

200
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:36,145
That's what you said
about the last plane, Vic.

201
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,147
You sure you up for this, man?

202
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,216
I'm sure.

203
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,467
What happened here?

204
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,236
Saw some signs back at the crash site.

205
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:03,338
We don't know.

206
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:04,916
We stay away from them.

207
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,486
We were passing through
the area with our parents,

208
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,678
and we kind of... got stuck.

209
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,724
The roads to the east are washed out,

210
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,182
landslides in the pass.

211
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,176
Roads to the south and west
have those signs on them.

212
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,318
Are you a pilot?

213
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,448
Journalist.

214
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,741
No wonder you guys crashed.

215
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,667
We didn't crash.

216
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:33,869
Crash-landed.

217
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,504
For the record, we lost an engine.

218
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,781
I wasn't supposed to be the
only one behind the wheel.

219
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,166
Could've gone a lot worse,
you hadn't done what you did, Al.

220
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,311
Aah!

221
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,680
We should stop.

222
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:48,165
- No, we can't stop.
- Hang in there, okay?

223
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,790
Logan, his people, they need us.

224
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,954
This Logan, is he part of your crew?

225
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,657
No, he's just someone
we're trying to help.

226
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,791
- You don't know him?
- No.

227
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:59,499
We talk to him on the radio.

228
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,538
- Anything?
- Nothing.

229
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,731
Hate to break it to you,
but he's probably dead.

230
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,877
No, they have plenty of food and water,

231
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,935
supplies to last them for weeks.

232
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,637
- Then why'd they need you?
- They got into some trouble.

233
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,963
Place they were holed up in
was surrounded by the dead.

234
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,817
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

235
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:20,147
- Hey, easy!
- You're driving us toward a bunch of growlers?

236
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,627
She's injured.

237
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,017
It's nothing we can't handle.

238
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,263
People don't just go around
helping people they don't know.

239
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,386
Yeah, but you did.

240
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:28,890
You helped stop Luciana's bleeding.

241
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,249
Didn't feel like I had a choice.

242
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:33,940
Well, neither do we.

243
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,606
Why?

244
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,632
We answered your questions,
now you answer ours.

245
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:40,333
We're trying to do everything we can

246
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,924
to make things better out here.

247
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:44,480
Good luck with that.

248
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,394
This place is worse than it seems.

249
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,344
You keep saying that.
What does that mean, exactly?

250
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,855
It's not just the signs.

251
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,009
It's the...

252
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:04,524
You'll see.

253
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,664
Mustard just keeps
gettin' uglier, don't it?

254
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,057
Do you know who did this?

255
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:13,925
No.

256
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,072
But they're all over the area.

257
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,624
We need to keep moving.

258
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:27,384
I'm not driving into that.

259
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:28,962
Then we'll walk.

260
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,822
You want to help me with Luciana?

261
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:35,180
Are you serious?

262
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,738
This is something we have to do.

263
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,394
You said you don't even know this guy.

264
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,388
And I'll be honest with you.
We've been...

265
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:46,224
we've been doing this for a
while, this helping people.

266
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:49,115
And we haven't had a whole lot of luck.

267
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,097
What does that mean?

268
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:54,999
Everyone's either dead, missing,

269
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:56,223
or don't want to be found.

270
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:01,094
Logan, his people,
they're the first who do.

271
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,114
He better be worth it.

272
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,717
Get in.

273
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,245
Thank you.

274
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,288
Logan said they were surrounded.

275
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:39,909
Logan?

276
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:42,896
Table.

277
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:44,165
Yeah.

278
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,858
They have to be somewhere.

279
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,073
Easy.

280
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,679
Hello?

281
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:04,677
Oh, thank God.

282
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:05,979
Logan, do you copy?

283
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,499
Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan, do you copy?

284
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:11,024
We are at the truck stop.

285
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:12,919
Logan, do you copy?

286
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,088
We're gonna do this.

287
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:17,726
Okay? How you feeling?

288
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,340
Like a human coat rack.

289
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,431
Gotta be honest, it hurts.

290
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,774
You're doing great.
You're gonna be okay.

291
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:31,176
- Logan?
- All right, I need dressings, peroxide,

292
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,968
and whatever antibiotics you can find.

293
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:35,226
- Okay.
- It's not gonna be pretty.

294
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:36,551
You done this before?

295
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:38,075
In a trauma center, yeah.

296
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,690
In a truck stop?

297
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:42,364
No.

298
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,549
What are these for?

299
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:12,412
The man who set all this up...

300
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:15,976
he drove trucks.

301
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,318
Just like that one.

302
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:21,704
Why would people need toys?

303
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,163
His way of giving people
something to believe in.

304
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,544
Where is he?

305
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,035
He's gone.

306
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:42,325
But we're trying to
keep what he did alive.

307
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:46,846
We are trying to turn
it into something more.

308
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,283
How?

309
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:53,671
Dylan.

310
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,257
You know, she's right.

311
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,528
We got a place on the other side,

312
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:03,675
used to be a denim factory.

313
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,029
Not as bad as it sounds.

314
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:07,831
We even have a movie night.

315
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:09,967
You kids like movies, right?

316
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,309
You know, we're trying to work on it,

317
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,835
make it into a place
that people can feel safe,

318
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,543
make it a place that
people can call home.

319
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,692
Places like that don't exist anymore.

320
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,389
I used to think the same thing, hon.

321
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,515
But they do.

322
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:27,287
You should come back with us.

323
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,049
You should be a part of it.

324
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:33,823
Morgan, nobody's been
here for a long time.

325
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:36,409
I had to bleed the genee
just to get it started.

326
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,395
Logan called from a truck stop.

327
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,030
- Are there any others around here?
- It's the only one for miles.

328
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,567
Something's not right.

329
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,237
No, we just heard him on the walkie.

330
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:47,793
They gotta be around here somewhere.

331
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,721
What's wrong with you people?

332
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,579
He's not here. No one's here!

333
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,649
Load up whatever you
can fit in your bag.

334
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:55,556
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.
- Wait, Morgan.

335
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,896
I know you've been through a lot,

336
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,258
but you can trust us. You
don't have to be afraid.

337
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:01,021
That's what people always say

338
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:02,606
when there's something to be afraid of.

339
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,855
Morgan, we don't have
any more time, okay?

340
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,457
We just have to help our friend,

341
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,015
and then we'll keep talking after.

342
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,673
No, we're done talking! Dylan!

343
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:12,376
Look, no one's going anywhere
until we figure out...

344
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,844
- We'll be fine...
- what's going on.

345
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,302
- Max!
- We've managed on our own so far.

346
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,521
Please don't do that right now.

347
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:19,613
Go.

348
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,072
If you're smart, you'll
do what we're doing.

349
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,375
Stitch your friend up and
get the hell out of here!

350
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,114
Please wait.

351
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:31,505
- You can't help us.
- No.

352
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,221
We're going. Come on.

353
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,167
- Alicia.
- Just do it.

354
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,454
- Alicia.
- Let's go.

355
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,755
Shit.

356
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,291
Alicia, please, right now.

357
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:44,406
Let's do this.

358
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,895
If it starts to bleed, we
don't have much time. Okay?

359
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:48,922
Are you ready?

360
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:50,331
Stay calm.

361
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,389
Do it.

362
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:52,513
On three.

363
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,638
Here we go.

364
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,391
1, 2...

365
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,545
3.

366
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,905
Hello?

367
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,240
Those kids are just like
everyone else we try to help.

368
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:37,142
No, they're not.

369
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:39,047
They're alive.

370
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,035
For now.

371
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:11,176
You're very lucky.

372
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,079
Been off by a centimeter or
we hit a bad bump in the car,

373
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,077
she wouldn't be here.

374
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:21,773
Anything?

375
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,244
Logan, do you copy?

376
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,005
Come on.

377
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,536
We're here. Where are you?

378
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,494
Do you copy?

379
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:34,243
Something's not right.

380
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,411
Morgan, is that you?

381
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:38,847
You copy?

382
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:42,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

383
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,658
Hey, man, you had us worried.

384
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:47,340
Just hold a minute.

385
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,105
Hello, Morgan?

386
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:58,536
We're here.

387
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:00,850
Tell us where you are,
we'll come to you.

388
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,184
Yeah, that's, uh...

389
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,273
That's gonna be a little tricky.

390
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:10,693
And why's that?

391
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,851
Well, kemosabe...

392
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:18,601
I'm here with my crew.

393
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:22,379
Looking at your crew.

394
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,675
And the most spectacular
view of the river.

395
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,743
I always loved this view.

396
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,355
Got here in the mornings,

397
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,465
just to see the sky change.

398
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,103
What are you talking about?

399
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:37,918
I see y'all have been
driving a big rig, right?

400
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:45,927
With that C&L plastered on the trailer?

401
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:48,306
From what I gathered,

402
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:50,617
those boxes you've been
leaving on the road,

403
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,499
you've met the C.

404
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,235
I'm the L.

405
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:57,542
And, unfortunately,

406
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,724
I don't share Clayton's
charitable nature.

407
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:03,576
Always got him into trouble.

408
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,260
He never learned.

409
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,047
Maybe you will.

410
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:10,584
Why'd you bring us here?

411
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,687
I wanted what was mine.

412
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,305
We're not ones for fights.

413
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,626
And it was the only way I could think of

414
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:21,385
to get you far enough away

415
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,813
so that me and my crew could
slip in without a big fuss.

416
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,607
We found a plane.

417
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:29,846
We crashed it...

418
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,771
because we wanted to help you.

419
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:35,107
A plane? Wow.

420
00:32:35,143 --> 00:32:36,275
Man...

421
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,245
You make Clayton look like an amateur.

422
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:40,415
Hey, d-d...

423
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:45,818
Where did you bring us?

424
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:47,499
I just picked a truck stop

425
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,422
as far away from here as I could find.

426
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:50,990
If you hurt any of our people...

427
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,125
What people?

428
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,584
Doesn't seem like you're having
too much luck on that front.

429
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,763
How long you been at this?

430
00:32:58,118 --> 00:32:59,865
I'm just reclaiming what's mine.

431
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,267
Everything else, you can have it back.

432
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,599
You see, there is one
thing Clayton used to say

433
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,057
that I do agree with...

434
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:11,109
"Take what you need,
leave what you don't."

435
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:24,633
Please, don't do this.

436
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:26,725
Already did, sweetheart.

437
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,408
Hey, sweetheart, you
know, I'm gonna find you,

438
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:31,415
and I'm gonna kill you myself!

439
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,750
A, you're killing me
over taking back a place

440
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:38,076
where I am the legal owner of the deed?

441
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:42,874
B, it seems to me you already
have a more pressing quandary.

442
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:47,545
And, C, that attitude is
exactly why I just wanted to...

443
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:53,111
move you people along and not
get into any kind of standoff

444
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:55,556
or firefight or any of that horse shit.

445
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,486
I-I don't want to see you people dead.

446
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:58,891
I just want what's mine.

447
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,060
I've been watching you.

448
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:04,478
Listening.

449
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,187
You're trying to help other people.

450
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,568
Now...

451
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,838
looks like you're gonna
have to help yourselves.

452
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:38,055
You missed a real shit
pie a la mode today, Jimbo.

453
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,159
The jagoff kept half
my stash I was growing.

454
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:44,682
Mm.

455
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:50,634
Ah. Joke's on them.

456
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:52,837
Kind of swilly.

457
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:54,003
Yeah.

458
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,608
♪like vinaigrette.

459
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,369
But, you'll get there.

460
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,023
Where am I gonna brew, Wendell? Damn it.

461
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:04,013
We shouldn't just let
them take the mill.

462
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,785
I can find a way in.

463
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:14,490
Drive that bad boy in there,

464
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,087
you'll have his ass waving a white flag.

465
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:19,698
I got the tape Al was talking about.

466
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:21,820
The gentleman has standing,

467
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,516
but everything is negotiable.

468
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,316
We'll get the mill back.

469
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:26,669
But first, we get them back.

470
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,971
I should've been on that plane today.

471
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,441
I'm sure as hell going
to be on this one.

472
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,029
Mmm.

473
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:07,075
You should let June take a look at that.

474
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,830
This here.

475
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:14,282
We have to go back to the plane.

476
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:18,086
Morgan, there's a story here that...

477
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,088
We'll go in the morning,
see what we can scavenge.

478
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:21,799
This might not still
be there if we wait.

479
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:28,529
I-I know my tapes haven't done
shit to help us so far, but...

480
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:30,572
this one might.

481
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:32,523
It's not your fault, Al.

482
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:34,571
It's not, so it...

483
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,076
You'll go see June?

484
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,412
Sure.

485
00:37:14,642 --> 00:37:15,842
- Hey.
- Hey.

486
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:17,187
How's she doing?

487
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:18,978
She might have nerve damage,

488
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:20,980
- but we won't know for a while.
- Yeah.

489
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,514
She definitely needs to rest.

490
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,024
Hey.

491
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,087
Hmm?

492
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,479
Look what I found.

493
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,327
Polar Bear had very good taste.

494
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:39,299
Think I'll save it.

495
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:43,636
When we got people to show it to.

496
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:46,072
There's that VCR in the back room.

497
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:48,975
No, let's wait.

498
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,047
We will find people, John.

499
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,653
I don't know.

500
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:02,600
I'm starting to think

501
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,774
maybe we got all the luck in this world.

502
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,567
We crossed our fingers and
put ourselves in the air.

503
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:14,844
We survived something.

504
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:17,436
People just don't survive.

505
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:18,539
Again.

506
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,013
Most people don't got
that kind of good luck.

507
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,648
And if we are the only
ones that have it...

508
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:35,752
... if no one will let us
share what we got with them...

509
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,617
that'd be a shame.

510
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:43,173
That'd be a shame.

511
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,931
Okay.

512
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:56,347
I didn't think that
anyone could help me,

513
00:38:57,728 --> 00:38:58,926
not even you.

514
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:05,082
Until you made me believe it.

515
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:07,064
Yeah?

516
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:09,086
So that's all we have to do.

517
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:10,888
We just have to find a way

518
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:13,558
to make other people believe it, too.

519
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,728
Okay.

520
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:42,319
Alicia, hey.

521
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:43,422
Hey.

522
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:57,196
We could've died today.

523
00:39:59,288 --> 00:40:00,716
Luciana almost died today.

524
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:03,150
- She didn't.
- She almost did.

525
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:06,544
The people we came for
took what we had back home.

526
00:40:07,768 --> 00:40:09,168
Those kids ran from us.

527
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:15,192
We can't make up for
the past if we're dead.

528
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,706
- We were stupid.
- No.

529
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:18,031
- This was stupid.
- No.

530
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:19,222
We were trying.

531
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:21,414
And you can't make up for
the past if you don't try.

532
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:22,938
We've done so much.

533
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,980
My mom did so much to make
sure we were standing here.

534
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:27,205
Okay.

535
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:28,765
But then why stand?

536
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:31,821
Why sleep, why eat,

537
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,813
why even live after all of this shit,

538
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:35,638
Alicia, if it doesn't mean anything?

539
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:38,007
If we're out here, we got
to make it mean something.

540
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:39,964
That's what we need. That's what I need.

541
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:42,149
'Cause I'm not done yet.

542
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,663
I'm gonna keep looking for these kids.

543
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:53,908
They don't want our help.

544
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:55,557
Then we should just keep trying...

545
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,159
keep trying until they do.

546
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,195
We...

547
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:07,031
It's not supposed to be easy.

548
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,984
Can't just pick up and walk in, say,

549
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,484
"We want to help," and that's it.

550
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:14,734
'Cause we kill people, Alicia.

551
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:18,213
The things that we have done,

552
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:19,606
the things that I have done...

553
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:23,695
should be hard.

554
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,221
It should be.

555
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:29,259
Maybe that's how we know
we're on the right track.

556
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:34,303
It shouldn't be this hard.

557
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:44,799
Well, we're still standing.

558
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:48,886
Even after today, after everything,

559
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:49,945
we are still here.

560
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,014
So, until we're not, we...

561
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,186
We have to keep at it.

562
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:33,686
How long have you been here?

563
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:36,104
Where'd you get all this stuff?

564
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,232
What do you do with it?

565
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:41,360
This isn't gonna work

566
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:43,226
unless you try to answer my questions.

567
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,034
Let's start with something easy.

568
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,599
Your name.

569
00:42:48,395 --> 00:42:49,502
Daniel.

570
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,487
Daniel Salazar.

571
00:42:58,677 --> 00:42:59,871
Talk to me, Vic!

572
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:01,273
When we gonna get that plane?

573
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:33,942
Morgan, do you copy?

574
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:35,166
I'm back at the plane.

575
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:41,036
Morgan, come in.

576
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,272
Al, come on.

577
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:44,831
We said we'd wait till tomorrow.

578
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:47,334
You said we'd wait till tomorrow.

579
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:48,794
I was right.

580
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:53,044
There's a story here.

1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,437
All right,
Professor Proton fans,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,759
get ready to meet
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,478
and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,
a pair of real-life scientists

4
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:11,821
who may win
the Nobel Prize.

5
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:13,868
That's like
the Kids' Choice Award,

6
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:17,298
but with more science
and less slime.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,861
Hi, thanks for having us.

8
00:00:19,947 --> 00:00:22,845
Kids' Choice Award?
Why would they let kids choose anything?

9
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,978
They're basically
human larvae.

10
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,837
Well, they are kind of
our target audience.

11
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,587
Greetings, children.

12
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,048
Toys, am I right?

13
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,290
He is.
He has hundreds of them.

14
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,579
So you two have
discovered something

15
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:43,720
that a lot of people
are really excited about.

16
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,157
<font color="#ffff00"><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></font> We have.

17
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:46,853
Now,
before you explain it,

18
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,338
keep in mind that
our average viewer is this many.

19
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:54,376
Okay, imagine
you're looking in a mirror.

20
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:56,798
The image you see
looks just like you.

21
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,697
That's called
symmetrical.

22
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,415
Now imagine
you have a billion mirrors,

23
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,368
and each of them reflects one thing
about you correctly

24
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:06,915
and a billion things
about you incorrectly.

25
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,306
And imagine
the set of incorrect things

26
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:12,892
are floating in an abstract
n-dimensional hyperspace.

27
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:16,587
Now imagine there was never
a mirror to begin with.

28
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:20,029
Oh, was that
a doorbell?

29
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,748
I didn't
hear anything.

30

<font color="#ffff00">(doorbell rings)</font>

31
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,099
Huh, there it is again.

32
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,177
Sheldon,
why don't you answer it?

33
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:31,435
But I don't know who it is.

34
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,912
Maybe it's a special guest

35
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,748
who I invited
just to surprise you.

36
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,851
Why don't you open it up
and find out.

37
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:39,474
This is a terrible message
to send to children.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,076
Children,
you never open the door

39
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,538
if you don't know
who's on the other side.

40
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:44,623
You always make
your mommy or daddy do it

41
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,818
while you hide under the bed
and try to imagine

42
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:49,935
what your superhero name will be
when you avenge their deaths.

43
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,600
I'll get it.

44
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:55,458
But it can't be The Silver Shadow...
that's mine.

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,958
Hello.

46

Captain on the bridge!

47
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,018
You're William Shatner.

48
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,151
You can call me Bill.

49
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,690
- Ooh, can I call you Captain?
- No.

50
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,722
- Please?
- No.

Sure.

And w-will you call me
Science Officer Cooper?

54
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,933
This has got to stop.

55
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,886
I think you know
how to make it stop.

56
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:27,042
Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.

57
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,652
Put her there,

Poor Shatner?
I have to eat lunch now.

61
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:43,675
Look, Sheldon's
pretty embarrassed,

62
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,175
so when he gets here,
we should...

63
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,211
- Make fun of him? <font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>
- A lot. -

64
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,923
Guys, don't you think
that's a little mean?

65
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,633
- Yeah.
- Okay, just so we're all

66
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,180
- on the same page.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:55,609
So, Sheldon,
did you get

69
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,588
William Shatner's autograph,
or maybe his dry cleaning bill?

<font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>

71
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,633
Very funny,
get it all out.

72
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,883
Like you did on
William Shatner?

73
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,941
Raj, do you have
something to add?

74
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,875
You brought shame upon
yourself and your family.

75
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:12,617
It's not funny,
but it's true.

76
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,078
I will admit the meeting
did not go the way I wanted.

where no man has barfed before?

78

Well, the next time I meet him,
it will go better.

79
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,410
Next time? What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

80
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:29,699
Wil will give me another chance.
He thinks the world of me.

81
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,347
Awh.
One of the reasons I love you

82
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,449
is you actually believe that.

83
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,940
Thank you.

00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,905
"Captain Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"?

- Nope. - No.
- Certainly not.

You don't even know
what it's about.

119
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,741
Is it about
a superhero

120
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,511
who finds her voice
by doing stand-up?

121
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,653
That's so much better
than what I had.

122
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,291
Mine is just a Jewish girl

123
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,248
I'd read that.

Guys, guys,
Wil Wheaton

125
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,148
hosts a secret
celebrity D&D game.

126
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,518
- How do you know?
- Who was there?

127
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,061
Why are you damp?

128
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,498
I was trying to peek
in Wil's window,

129
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,034
and he turned
the sprinklers on.

130
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:45,420
Oh, that means they
must be really famous.

131
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,506
I'm almost positive
I heard William Shatner.

132
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,678
I wonder
who else is playing.

133
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:53,498
I-I bet we can use graph theory
to determine who Wil knows

134
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,825
- and who is likely to play D&D.
- Yes.

135
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,014
Okay,

136
00:05:57,115 --> 00:06:01,232
obviously he's connected
to the whole Next Gen cast...

137
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,912
So this is the rest of our night,
huh?

138
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,394
Oh, no,

139

about celebrities
who play D&D.

143
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,592
Oh! A-And he was
on Wil's podcast,

144
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,780
so they know each other.

145
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,084
G-Go on his Instagram,
see if you can find anything.

146
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,264
Yeah, he-he posted something
an hour ago:

over his shoulder?

152
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,264

I think it's Stuart.

154
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,390
That <i>is</i> Stuart.
What-What's he doing there?

155
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,392
Maybe he died
in Wil's house

156
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,772
and he can't leave
until he solves his own murder.

157
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,723
Why would Wil invite
Stuart and not us?

158
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,850
I know the answer.
Yeah.

159
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,569
We all know the answer.

160
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:17,725
Hey, guys.

161
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:19,709
You're home late.

162
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,881
Uh, yeah.

163
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:25,825
I had a crazy night.
I went to the pharmacy.

164
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:29,233
I like to be there when
the new decongestants drop.

165
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:31,699
Cut the crap.
We know where you were.

166
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,911
We know what
you were doing.

167
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:36,270
Yeah, I just told you.
I was at CVS breathing my ass off.

168
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:37,734
Oh, you were breathing,
all right.

169
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,563
You were breathing the
rarefied air of celebrities.

170
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:41,578
I don't know what
you're talking about.

171
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,813
Then why are
you trembling?

172
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,493
I'm always trembling.

173
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,421
We know you were
at Wil's D&D game.

174
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,556
We saw you on Instagram.

175
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,679
We just want to know
how you got invited.

176
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:53,554
I can't talk about it or they
won't invite me back next week.

177
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:55,147
So there's another
game next week.

178
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,827
No, I didn't mean
to say that.

179
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,054
- Who's in it?
- I can't tell you!

180
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,921
- How do we get invited?
- I don't know!

181
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,085
How many hit dice are they
playing the wereboar as having?

182
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:08,015
12d8 + 24...
I mean, I don't know!

183

<font color="#ffff00">(phone ringing)</font>

184
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,577
- Hey, Stuart.
- I don't want to play anymore.

185
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,084
It's too much pressure.

186
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:21,584
- Why, what happened?
- I've-I've said too much.

187
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,436
You haven't said anything.

188
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,319
Not to you, to them.
Who's them?

189
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,983
Ah!
Now I have said too much!

190
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,428
But y-you blocked
your number, right?

191
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,630
Relax,

192
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,225
this is not my first
creepy phone call.

193
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:42,920
It's like riding a bike...
slowly past a girl's house.

Of course not.

Sheldon, why are you walking
everywhere? Just get a horse.

207
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,259
I had a horse.
It got hit by a train.

208
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,267
Get another one.

209
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,829
I can't just replace
Chauncey.

210

Hey.

213
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,509
Hey, Leonard, I have an opening
in my D&D game next week,

214
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,685
and I was wondering if you
were interested in playing.

215
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,401
Well, yes, thank you.

216
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,642
<i>Okay, great.</i>

217
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,947
Now, here's the thing,
you can't tell anyone.

218
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,847
I'm serious,
not Howard, not Raj,

219
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,641
and certainly not Sheldon.

220
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:55,891
Okay.

221
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,885
I'm really sorry to put you in a position
where you have to lie

222
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,876
to your friends...
See you there!

223
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,552
You come face to face
with a massive monster

224
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,852
with a gaping maw

225
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,791
full of teeth, three huge legs,
and flailing tentacles.

226
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:12,673
What do you do?

227
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:16,751
Fellas, it looks like
we're facing a, an otyugh.

228
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:19,680
Here's the plan...

229
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,391
Hold on there, Bill.

230
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,095
Now what, Kareem?

231
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:30,227
How do we know it's not a Neo-otyugh?
Same way I know the difference

232
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,929
between an owlbear
and a bugbear.

233
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,053
Does that answer
your question?

234
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,329
No.

235
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:41,470
Look, there's one way
to settle this:

236
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,345
we chop it up
and look at the pieces.

237
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,936
Oh, come on, why do you always
got to attack everything?

238
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:47,569
Why can't we just try
talking to it?

239
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,764
Big surprise, Podcast
here wants to talk.

240
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,006
What do you think, Leonard?

241
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,835
I think this is the greatest day
of my entire life.

242
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:04,819
It's all right, buddy,
one day you'll meet a girl.

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,935
Hey, how was your lecture?

244
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,946
Oh, it was so good.

245
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,436
I-I-I mean,
it-it started great,

246
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:19,819
and then the, the middle
was great,

247
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,386
and then the ending was like...

So great.

249
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,803
Leonard, if you went to House
of Pies again, just say it.

250
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,458

Wait, if you think I'm lying,

251
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:32,600
why do you think
I'm eating pies?

252
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,787
Why don't you think I'm...
having an affair?

253
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,311
Listen, I-it's fine, just
next time, bring me a slice.

254
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:41,997
Okay, well, if you
really want to know,

255
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,302
I'll tell you where I was.

256
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:46,380
I was at Wil's D&D game,
but that's all I can say.

257
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,872
Oh, fun.
Were there famous people there?

258
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,021
Ah, sorry, I-I-I can't
tell you that.

259
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:54,615
Okay, well, yes,

260
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:58,701
but I-I-I-I can't
tell you who.

261
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,812
Well, no, I-I can
tell you Shatner,

262
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,091
but that's only because
you already knew that one.

263
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,419
Well, I'm glad you had fun.
Yeah.

264
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,145
Ugh, I wish I could tell you
who else was there.

265
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,405
<font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>
I can't, I promised.

266
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:13,333
Yeah, if it makes you feel
better, I couldn't care less.

267
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,434
That's true,

268
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,784
you don't care, so there's
no harm in telling you.

269
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,627
Okay, you really
don't have to.

270
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,112
All right,
I'll tell you. Uh...

271
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:24,479
<font color="#ffff00">(stammers)</font>
Kevin Smith was there,

272
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:27,885
and-and, uh, this really
tall guy named Kareem.

273
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,846
Wait-wait,
K-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

274
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:34,268
I don't know, it was, uh,
Kareem something Jabbar.

275
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,268
How do you know him?

276
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:39,143
How do you not know him?

277
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,100
Well, I know him now
'cause he was there.

278
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,338
Wow.

279
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,127
That is so cool.

280
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,010

the guy that played

282
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,520
he was there.
Wh... Joe Manganiello?

283
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,803
Uh, yeah.
From <i>Magic Mike?</i>

did he look...
like this?

but, yeah.

met Joe Manganiello.

00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,123
- Is he nice?
- Oh, he's so nice.

291
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,732
I-I-I rolled my dice
underneath the couch,

292
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,459
and he just lifted
it up, one hand.

293
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:21,771
Oh, I-I bet he did.

294
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,389
Hi. Okay, can you guys
keep a secret?

295
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,245
- Yeah.
- Sure.

296
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,037
Good, 'cause I can't.

297
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,310
Leonard played
Dungeons & Dragons

298
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,264
with the hot guy
from <i>Magic Mike.</i>

299
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,709
- I never got to see that movie.
- Seriously?

300
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,146
Yeah, Howie made us leave

301
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,623
as soon as he realized
it wasn't about magic.

302
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:46,014
Well, I have seen that movie
one or seven times,

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,826
and trust me,
it is magic.

304
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,599
- Which guy?
- That one.

305
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,922
Abracadabra.

306
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,318
Hey, you know what was fun?

307
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,412
That time we played
Dungeons & Dragons.

308
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:06,240
That was fun.
We should play that more.

309
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,217
Sorry, what now?

310
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:17,912
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

311
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,415
Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon
might have left something.

312
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,741
Oh, you mean,
besides his lunch?

313
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,342
<font color="#ffff00">(laughter)</font>

314
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,139
You are so funny, Wil.

315
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:31,373
Ohh! We were just talking
about how funny you are.

316
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,514
Yeah, Leonard told you,
didn't he?

317
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,017
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yup. - Yeah.

318
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,699
It's Manganiello?

319
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,335
- Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,917
Feel good about yourselves?

321
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,154
- Nope. - No.
- Yeah.

322
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:46,773
- Oh, we're going with no?
- No.

323
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,342
Hey, guys.

324
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,515
What are you smiling about?

325
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,499
What?
This is my regular face.

326
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,863
No, it's not.

327
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:00,538
Y-Your regular face
is more like this...

328
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:07,695
No, no, I-it's-it's more
in the eyebrows, like this...

329
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:13,159
<font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>
Okay, make your jokes.

330
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,495
I'm still in a great mood.

331
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:16,737
<font color="#ffff00">(phone ringing)</font>

332
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:21,620
Hey.
Wait, what?

333
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,143
Why?

334
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,126
Oh, come on, but...

335
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:32,112
O-Okay, fine.

336
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,745
Huh, Raj was right,
it is more in the eyebrows.

337
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,190
What was that all about?

338
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,440
Wil kicked me out
of his D&D game.

339
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,401
You were
in Wil's D&D game?

340
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:45,472
- With William Shatner?
- And you didn't tell us?

341
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,276
I'm sorry,
Wil made me promise not to.

342
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,595
I thought
we were friends.

343
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,432
Oh, come on,
you guys would do the same

344
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,156
thing. No, we wouldn't!
I told you when I was

345
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:55,565
in spin class with
Scarlett Johansson.

346
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,601
It didn't even turn out
to be Scarlett Johansson.

347
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,916
Well, that's her
fault, not mine!

348
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:01,885
It doesn't matter

349
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:04,478
because Penny blabbed about it
and now I'm out.

350
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:09,156
So there's an open seat.

351
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,894
Wil!
Wil Wheaton!

352
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,642
Open! Open!

353
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,885
No. No. No.

354
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,549
Hell no.

355
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,820
Look, we know Leonard is out.
You need to fill a seat.

356
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,424
It should be one of us.

357
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,939
Or give me another chance.

358
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,736
I think me and Joe Manganiello
were really hitting it off.

359
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:32,363
- Joe Manganiello was there?
- From Magic Mike?

360
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,752
You guys suck.

361
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,213
Agreed. You guys suck.
Let's go, Wil.

362
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,719
No.

363
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,439
All of you.

364
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,236
You're just
trying to use me

365
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:45,072
to get close
to my famous friends.

366
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,844
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

367
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:49,080
Flattered? <font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>

368
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,082
Used.

369
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,823
I was gonna
guess that.

370
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,167
One of the worst things
about being a celebrity

371
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:59,538
is you never know if people
like you for you.

372
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,507
Well, thanks
for letting me know.

373
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,609
<font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font>

374
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,431
You're right, that was
really crappy of us.

375
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:10,919
Yeah, I guess we just got
caught up in the excitement.

376
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:14,009
We're sorry, Wil.
We do like you for you.

377
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,560
And if it makes
you feel

378
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:18,568
any better, I don't even really
consider you a celebrity.

379
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,060
Should we go or do you want
to wait for the sprinklers?

380
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:34,138
Guys, I-I still feel
a little bad about Wil.

381
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:35,404
Me, too.

382
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,803
Yeah. We should invite him
to come play with us.

383
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,775
Ask him to bring
some chips

384
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,131
because we're all out.

385
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,379
<font color="#ffff00">(stammers)</font>
Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.

386
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,613
<font color="#ffff00">(gasps)</font>
Make it Bugles.

387
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,056
No, no, no, no, no,
pretzel sticks.

388
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,719
No, no, no, Bugles.

389
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,619
We're gonna play some D&D

390
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,056
and thought you might
want to join us.

391
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,189
<i>Thank you, Leonard, but actually</i>

392
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,890
I can't do it tonight.

393
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,664
Uh, how about another time?

394
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,969
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

395
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,711
Okay, where were we?

396
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:09,938
I was about to go all
Wrath of Khan on the ogres.

397
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:11,739
Oh, man, that's it.

398
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,899
Put another dollar
in the Star Trek jar, Bill.

399
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:17,125
Worth it.

400
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:22,305
Speaking of putting
dollars in things...

401
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,223
I loved you
in <i>Magic Mike.</i>

402
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,618
<font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>
Thanks. <font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font>

403
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:32,399
Switch places with me.

404
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,155
Are we playing musical chairs

405
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,399
or Dungeons & Dragons?

406
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,903
Yeah, let's teach that ogre
what my broadsword tastes like.

407
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,704
I like your moxie.

408
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,704
Aw, and I like
your grandpa words.

409
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,821
My dad and I watched you win
back-to-back championships.

410
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,727
And I watched you sniff Joe's
hair when he wasn't looking.

411
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:07,261
Thank you again for inviting us,
and don't worry,

412
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,079
we won't tell the guys.

413
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,125
You know what, why don't
you tell the guys?

414
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,039
In fact, let's all
take a picture

415
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,719
and send it to
them right now.

<font color="#ffff00">(phones buzzing)</font>

417
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,001
That's weird.

418
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,329
We deserve that.

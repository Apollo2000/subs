00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,040
The decline of the Roman
Empire begins at 15,000 feet,

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,000
on some of the world's
most unforgiving terrain.

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,950
Fifty-thousand barbarian warriors
from across the ancient world

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,930
have united against
a single enemy.

6
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,360
Leading them is a general,
bound by blood,

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,600
to avenge his family honor,

8
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,790
and destroy Rome

9
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,710
before it consumes
everything in its path.

10
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,770
History may regard the
Roman Empire as inevitable,

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,960
but its rise was neither
swift, nor guaranteed.

12
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,090
To achieve its goals,

13
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,970
Rome blankets the continent
in blood and tyranny. ets the t

14
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,340
Pillaging resources from the land
and the people who live there,

15
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,510
dividing the
ancient world in two,

16
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,050
Roman and barbarian.

17
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,130
From the hordes,
emerge the unlikely leaders

18
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,580
who will challenge
Rome's domination.

19
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,930
Bandits,

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,430
slaves,

21
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,340
warriors, rebels.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,160
This is the story of their rise.

23
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,220
In the 3rd century B.C.,

24
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,460
Carthage is the most powerful
state in the Western world.

25
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,760
It builds its wealth
through trade,

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,000
and uses its advanced naval force
to dominate the Mediterranean.

27
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,010
Carthage really was Rome's
only competitor as an empire

28
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,930
in the central and
western Mediterranean.

29
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,710
There were no other great states
that could compete with it.

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,340
Rome is a small but growing
republic with outsized ambition.

31
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,660
It knows that to defeat Carthage
is to control the ancient world.

32
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,620
The conflict between
Rome and Carthage

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,520
escalated into a
life-and-death struggle

34
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,470
between the two principle powers
in the western Mediterranean.

35
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,600
When the two sides
clash over Sicily,

36
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,210
Rome is the rising power.

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,800
And it's also adaptable, building
a navy from the ground up

38
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,950
that deals Carthage
a shocking defeat.

39
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,880
Rome forces Carthage to sign
a crippling peace treaty

40
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,310
in an attempt
to break its enemy.

41
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,290
It's implications for
Carthage are pretty stark.

42
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,520
Uh, among other things, Carthage
is effectively de-militarized

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,130
or de-navalized.

44
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,770
Uh, it is also subject to
paying a substantial indemnity.

45
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,640
The defeat
is a personal humiliation

46
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,910
for the Carthaginian General
in Command, Hamilcar Barca.

47
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,020
His oldest son, Hannibal,
is only nine years old.

48
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,740
Hamilcar forced his
young son, essentially,

49
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,020
to dedicate his entire
life to one purpose,

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,780
the destruction of Rome.

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
The oath, Hannibal.

52
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,500
I swear by the deathless Gods

53
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,680
that I shall not rest
until the heart of Rome

54
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,610
bleeds dry on the
sword of Carthage.

55
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,480
Again!

56
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,710
I swear by the deathless Gods

57
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,560
that I shall not rest until
the heart of Rome bleeds...

58
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,650
Again!

59
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,560
I swear by the deathless Gods

60
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,660
that I shall not rest until
the heart of Rome bleeds dry

61
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,930
on the sword of Carthage!

62
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,980
Hannibal waits nearly two decades
for a chance at revenge.

63
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,760
In 219 B.C., Rome makes
an alliance with Saguntum,

64
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,460
a fortified city on
Carthage's northern border.

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,460
Hannibal sees the move
as an act of war.

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,450
Our neighbor has been turned.

67
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,810
Saguntum is on our
side of the border.

68
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,390
Forget borders.
They're for politicians.

69
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,620
Rome's alliance with Saguntum was
designed as a deliberate insult.

70
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,830
And if we don't respond?

71
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,260
Who are we?
Cowards?

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,590
You know the answer to that.

73
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Then we fight!

74
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,100
And avenge the vow
we made to our father.

75
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,110
We take the city.

76
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,810
Rome will have no choice

77
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,750
but to fight for its new ally.

78
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,950
We call her out.

79
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,690
Draw her here, to Hispania.

80
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,330
Hannibal besieges
Saguntum for eight months.

81
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,970
When the city falls,
he launches his master plan,

82
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,070
to unite the barbarians of the
ancient world against Rome.

83
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,240
Outside of the great empires,

84
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,620
the people of Europe are organized
into small tribal groups, essentially.

85
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,990
They don't really have an overarching
national or ethnic identity.

86
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,790
They are tribal societies,

87
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,550
and often spend a lot of time
fighting amongst each other.

88
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,770
Hannibal faced an enormously
difficult challenge.

89
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,510
How to build an alliance with
disparate groups of barbarian tribes,

90
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,160
who spoke different languages.

91
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,070
And they really saw no distinction
between Rome or Carthage.

92
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
It's safe to say they hated
both of them equally.

93
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,950
He had to give them
a good reason

94
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,290
why they should fight with him.

95
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,980
And the good reason was,

96
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,990
if we win, then
you will be free.

97
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,330
If we lose, then
you will be slaves.

98
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,420
Hannibal g calls to arms tribes

99
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,830
from Iberia, to Gaul,
to North Africa,

100
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,660
and the Lusitanians
of western Hispania.

101
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,470
The Lusitanians
were great warriors.

102
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,070
They were fantastic fighters.

103
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,350
And, um, they were
used to independence

104
00:08:52,450 --> 00:09:00,450
for centuries and centuries,
so they would never give up.

105
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,920
The Lusitanians will
complete our army.

106
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,270
It is said they have
no word for truce.

107
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,310
They've never needed one.

108
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,300
Well, they'll either
listen to us or kill us.

109
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,680
The last time your people were
foolish enough to come here,

110
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,900
they tried to conquer us.

111
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,950
They failed.

112
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,580
So, why have you come back now?

113
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,470
We face the same great enemy.

114
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,670
Rome.

115
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,960
And it will not rest
until it's consumed us all.

116
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,060
Rome is your enemy, not ours.

117
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,180
And even if it were,
we fear no one.

118
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,500
A good warrior never underestimates
the might of its enemy.

119
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,510
Or himself.

120
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,890
Carthage cannot
defeat Rome by itself.

121
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,860
So if we fall to her
legions, you will be next.

122
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,690
It already has eyes
on Hispania and Lusitania.

123
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
But Rome can be stopped
if we fight together.

124
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,330
Then perhaps we should fight with
Rome against you and Carthage.

125
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,510
Go ahead.

126
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,140
And see what happens, when
it uses you to destroy us,

127
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,440
and then turns on you
and Lusitania.

128
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,050
And you?

129
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,450
And Carthage?

130
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,990
Would reward you.

131
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,780
With, uh...

132
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,090
The riches of a republic

133
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,900
whose wealth is
beyond imagining.

134
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,830
When you pay tribute
to our honor,

135
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
understand this,

136
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,610
you are not buying it.

137
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,610
Then it is settled?

138
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,980
You are their creature now.

139
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,190
And soon, they will be ours.

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,020
Let us hope.

141
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,390
They will join us.

142
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,120
If they do not,

143
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,930
they'll all be dead.

144
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,460
As Hannibal
waits for allies to respond,

145
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,730
Rome gathers an army of its own.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,530
The senate calls on the most feared
military family in the republic.

147
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,480
Wealthy, powerful and ruthless,

148
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,890
Publius Cornelius Scipio commands a vast
army of highly-disciplined soldiers.

149
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,540
Scipio is the greatest
general of the Romans,

150
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,080
and has the full support
of the Roman Senate

151
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,160
to take on and destroy
the army of Hannibal.

152
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,000
The Roman fighting
machine was, um,

153
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,590
an incredibly disciplined
and organized body.

154
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,470
People were trained
systematically,

155
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,700
they were formed up in cohorts.

156
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,440
Um, they knew how
to fight by system.

157
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,930
They practiced their weapons.
These were professionals.

158
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,580
Within seven months,

159
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Hannibal's barbarian army
grows to 30,000 men.

160
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,490
But still, he waits
on the Lusitanians.

161
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,430
Without them, Hannibal's favorite
kind of war is mobile war.

162
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,230
He's not much given
to static warfare.

163
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,500
And the Lusitanian's
epitomize mobile warfare.

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,900
They're fast,
they have light cavalry,

165
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,570
they're good at ambushes.

166
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:48,170
So Hannibal and the Lusitanians
are made for each other.

167
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,890
If you're right,

168
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,160
and Rome is the greatest fighting
force the world has ever seen...

169
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,860
I am right.

170
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,800
Then you'd better have
something they don't.

171
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
I do.

172
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
And his name is Cumelios.

173
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,500
The empire that will one
day rule the ancient world

174
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,640
begins as a small but
ambitious republic,

175
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,040
with designs on absolute power.

176
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,970
Power can either be good or bad.

177
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,780
Uh, what really matters is
who is wielding that power,

178
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,720
what motivates them
and how they use it.

179
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,950
But as Rome
spreads its culture by force,

180
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,750
some rise up to fight back.

181
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,690
Among them is
Hannibal Barca of Carthage.

182
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,130
To challenge the Republic,

183
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,900
he unites an army of disparate
barbarian tribes under one banner.

184
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,270
And gambles on a bold strategy that
has never been attempted before.

185
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,400
Military leaders who have become
great captains in history,

186
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,500
have done so because
they had the ability

187
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,680
to visualize several moves ahead

188
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,620
and plan for them.

189
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,800
Each move is like
a separate game of chess.

190
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,460
Rome will cower

191
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
when they dock at Saguntum

192
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,490
and see thousands of us waiting.

193
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,800
They won't.

194
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,030
They won't come
ashore at Saguntum?

195
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,000
They won't see thousands.

196
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,970
We're not fighting in Saguntum?

197
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,770
We're going to destroy
them on their own soil.

198
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,400
I don't understand.

199
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,650
We're going to march on Rome.

200
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Impossible.

201
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,870
You only say that because
it's never been done.

202
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,260
You're going to march an army
more than 2,000 miles?

203
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,460
Have faith.

204
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,460
Hannibal's force
sets out for Rome.

205
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,640
But 700 miles into the journey,

206
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,840
his plan is disrupted

207
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,110
when Scipio decides to resupply

208
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,120
on his way to intercept
the barbarians in Hispania.

209
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,070
Hey!

210
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,910
Romans!

211
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,610
Half a day to the south.

212
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,310
They have discovered our scouts.

213
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,950
They've smelled their prey,

214
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,860
now they want to hunt us down.

215
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,060
We can face them now.

216
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,430
Tell the lookouts downriver
and call out the men.

217
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,820
Prepare the cavalry and get provisions.
We must leave tonight!

218
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,560
No.

219
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,110
We must strike camp

220
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,730
and head east
into the mountains.

221
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
But, Han...
Now!

222
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,910
Strike the camp!

223
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,320
Leadership is about confidence,

224
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,250
sometimes, self-delusional
confidence.

225
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,010
I always think that
you've got to believe

226
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,050
with such an unshakeable
amount of confidence

227
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,260
that others might
think you're crazy.

228
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,920
If you insist on
sticking to the plan...

229
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,090
We'll look like cowards!

230
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,240
If we stay and fight
Scipio's army,

231
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,410
we'd win a great
and glorious victory.

232
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,070
Exactly! But it
would mean nothing.

233
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,840
We'd win the battle
but not the war.

234
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,940
They'd come at us
again and again.

235
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,500
But, brother... We strike
at the heart of Rome.

236
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,940
We scale the walls
of the Republic.

237
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,950
Rome believes the mountains
are an impenetrable fortress,

238
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,300
a natural barrier
protecting it from attack.

239
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,270
Hannibal's plan to invade
by land is a blind side.

240
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,540
And crossing through the Alps is a move
calculated to intimidate the enemy.

241
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,180
The crossing of the Alps is
spectacular because it's unique

242
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,350
in the ancient time.

243
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,370
Nobody before him
had ever dared,

244
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,120
not even to imagine
to do something like that.

245
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,850
Hannibal's willingness
to take on this challenge

246
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,750
to cross the Alps,
to go into the unknown,

247
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,920
tells us volumes
about him as a leader.

248
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,320
It's why he's recognized as one
of the greatest military leaders

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,970
in all of human history.

250
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
Hannibal seems to have completely
outthought Scipio at this point

251
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,070
by the speed of his advance.

252
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,070
The fact of the matter is
that Hannibal alludes him.

253
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,540
Um, and had he not alluded him,
uh, the dream of invading Italy

254
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
uh, might have been
prematurely halted.

255
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,410
The mighty Alps.

256
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,750
Carved out of the landscape more
than two million years earlier,

257
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,680
are the gateway to Rome.

258
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,290
To this day, the Alps stand as a
synonym, as a shorthand if you will,

259
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,480
for an impenetrable barrier.

260
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,570
Hannibal's force begins its
ascent in October, 218 B.C.

261
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,080
Thirty-eight thousand
barbarian warriors,

262
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,980
twelve thousand African
cavalry and their horses

263
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,370
and 36 war elephants,

264
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,440
prized as Hannibal's
signature attack weapons.

265
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,680
It's apparently insane.

266
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,990
And strange enough,

267
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,190
he didn't wait for spring.

268
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,990
He started the enterprise
in the fall.

269
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,790
So he got ready
to cross the Alps

270
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,430
in the worst
conditions possible.

271
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,150
What begins as a grand
and glorious campaign,

272
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,700
quickly becomes a nightmare.

273
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,660
When Hannibal gets to
the high passes of the Alps,

274
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,090
he's dealing with an environment

275
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,230
such as he's never faced before.

276
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,120
It's winter in all its fury.

277
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,100
It's ice, it's snow, it's wind,

278
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,700
It's avalanches, it's ravines,

279
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:15,800
it's frostbite.
It's just terrible.

280
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,650
How many more men have to die

281
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,680
before you admit your mistake?

282
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,290
You and your arrogance.

283
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,990
Your visions of glory.

284
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,720
You can't eat glory, Hannibal.

285
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,380
We've not lost yet.

286
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,200
They'll sing songs about us.

287
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,470
I promise.

288
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,940
And what if we're dead?

289
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,340
Especially if we're dead.

290
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,040
For Hannibal,

291
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,320
the darkest time of his career,

292
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,960
without a doubt, had to be when
they were bogged down in the Alps.

293
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,060
Even when you have doubts,

294
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,930
you cannot reveal them

295
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,150
because doubt could
become contagious.

296
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,020
The leaders must use
a light of hope

297
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,660
in the darkness of despair.

298
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,640
It looked like he had led his
army into unmitigated disaster.

299
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,460
Two titans of the ancient world

300
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,960
are battling for supremacy.

301
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,160
By 218 B.C.,

302
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,510
Rome has set out to conquer
the continent,

303
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,280
but Carthage is determined
to stop its advance.

304
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,110
Hannibal recruits
a massive barbarian army

305
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,120
to execute
an audacious strategy,

306
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,440
an over-land attack
through the Alps.

307
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,230
Caught in the high passes
of the mountains,

308
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,230
Hannibal's bold gambit
is becoming a disaster.

309
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,640
He loses 25,000 men
in a single month.

310
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,630
When you look at these, um,
examples of strong leadership,

311
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,270
it's not about them, it's about
the people who they are leading.

312
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,970
It's bigger, um, than any
one of them as individuals.

313
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,150
Mago was right.

314
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,610
Who was I to think I could

315
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,890
do the impossible?

316
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,300
You won't find the courage
to lead in yourself,

317
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
you'll find it in the belief
of those who follow you.

318
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,580
The great leader is able

319
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,200
at the worst of conditions, at the
worst of times to continue on.

320
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,450
The man who can conquer his own
feelings, thoughts and emotions,

321
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,590
can conquer the world.

322
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,410
Mago!

323
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,870
Cumelios!

324
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,900
Seven months
after leaving Hispania,

325
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,390
Hannibal escapes the Alps.

326
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,740
But he arrives in Italy
with half of the army

327
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,940
that marched into the mountains.

328
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,380
Only four of his 36 mighty
war elephants survive.

329
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,350
Once Hannibal arrives
into the Italian Peninsula,

330
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,140
uh, he's in a bit of a bind.

331
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,420
Because on the one hand,
his forces are depleted

332
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,980
and he needs to recruit new
allies to supplement his forces.

333
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,790
But in order to do this,
in order to build up his rep,

334
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,190
he actually has to start beating
the Romans on the battlefield.

335
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,430
The crossing of the Alps had an
amazing effect on the Roman psyche.

336
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,660
They didn't see this coming.

337
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,270
He's taken them
completely by surprise.

338
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,240
So now, they have
to face, unexpectedly,

339
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,180
a hostile army
in northern Italy.

340
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,570
Hannibal
sets out to conquer Rome.

341
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,780
His barbarian army
leaves a trail of death

342
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
as they head
for the capital city.

343
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,460
They rout the Romans
in battle after battle.

344
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,530
At Ticino,

345
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,450
Trebbia, Lake Trasimene.

346
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,540
With every victory, Hannibal
is one step closer to Rome.

347
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,230
Determined
to press his advantage,

348
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,480
Hannibal seizes a critical
grain supply at Cannae,

349
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,640
to starve the Republic
into submission.

350
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,620
The move forces a showdown.

351
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,750
On the plains outside the city,

352
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:20,820
the armies meet for
an apocalyptic clash.

353
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,100
I swear by the deathless Gods

354
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,880
that I shall not rest

355
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,780
until the heart of Rome
bleeds dry

356
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,020
on the sword of Carthage.

357
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,460
Sixteen legions.

358
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,290
Eighty-five
thousand men.

359
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,890
We're outnumbered
almost two-to-one.

360
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,900
Good.

361
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,770
Let them bring their
remaining men to this field.

362
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,310
They'll fall right
into our trap.

363
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,040
It was the barbarians who sought
to protect their own freedom.

364
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,180
It was the barbarians,
so called,

365
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,950
who opposed slavery.

366
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,320
It was the barbarians
who refused to succumb

367
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,290
to the efforts of Rome
to make them slaves.

368
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,490
They were the earliest
freedom fighters.

369
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,290
Two thousand miles ago,

370
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,170
we could have stayed
and fought Rome in Hispania.

371
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,010
But we didn't want to fight
just an arm of Rome.

372
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,010
We wanted to wrap

373
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,940
our jaws around her neck
and bite off her head.

374
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,150
A thousand miles ago, we could
have fought Rome again,

375
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,510
but we fought the
mountains instead.

376
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,800
And the thousands
who stand here today,

377
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,760
won that battle.

378
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,120
Here,

379
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,940
on Roman soil,

380
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,670
we are finally ready to fight!

381
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,080
No more waiting.
No more walking.

382
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,910
No more dreaming.

383
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,020
Today, we will be victorious!

384
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,520
Today, we will take our revenge!

385
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,420
Rome's power is on the rise.

386
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,710
But it has one formidable rival
for control of the ancient world,

387
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,150
Carthage and its
great general, Hannibal.

388
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,130
His barbarian force
scaled the Alps

389
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,100
to strike directly
at Rome's heart.

390
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,230
Now, two ancient armies
stand ready for an epic clash.

391
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,560
On one side,

392
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,400
eighty-five thousand
Roman soldiers.

393
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,910
On the other,
50,000 barbarian warriors

394
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,680
determined to stop Rome's
advance across the continent.

395
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,790
Scipio imagines
a glorious victory,

396
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,730
but he's underestimated
the barbarian commander.

397
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,360
Hannibal has set a trap.

398
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,330
Hannibal's plan for the Battle of
Cannae is absolutely brilliant.

399
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Strategists, tacticians,
ever since,

400
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,040
have striven to copy
what he achieved

401
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,710
because it represents
tactical perfection.

402
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,750
Hannibal's battle plan hinges

403
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,540
on three key moves.

404
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,250
First, he concentrates
his infantry in the center,

405
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,450
to attract the Roman advance

406
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,930
and pull them inside
the barbarian line.

407
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,660
It's extremely important

408
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,930
to Hannibal's plan

409
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,820
that the frontline holds.

410
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,300
If they break,
if the cohesion is lost,

411
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,370
the entire plan is undone, and the
Carthaginians will be defeated.

412
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,570
Then, two bands of elite troops

413
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,280
advance from the flanks,

414
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,150
boxing the Romans inside.

415
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,840
Finally, a surprise cavalry
attack from the rear

416
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,160
surrounds them on all sides,
cutting off their escape.

417
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,550
If Hannibal succeeds,
Rome will have nowhere to run.

418
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,860
Hold the line!

419
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,010
Hold!

420
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,310
Hold!

421
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,690
Now!

422
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,400
The Roman Army is designed
to steamroll forward.

423
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,110
That's what it does best.

424
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,450
And that's going to work fine,

425
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,940
unless, you deal with an
enemy who practices jujitsu.

426
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,250
Who knows how to turn your strength
against you, and turn it into a weakness.

427
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,460
And that's what Hannibal can do.

428
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,130
The result is slaughter
on an unprecedented scale.

429
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,820
While only 6,000 barbarians
fall in battle,

430
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,000
Rome loses
a staggering 70,000 men,

431
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,970
more than 80% of its troops
in a single day.

432
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,970
The Battle of Cannae
was a bloodbath.

433
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,750
And there were more people
killed in one battle,

434
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,440
than all the Americans
killed in the Vietnam War.

435
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,290
Such a defeat
on the battlefield,

436
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,890
should lead to the
Romans seeking terms

437
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,930
and the Carthaginians
imposing them.

438
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,460
The Senate sends word to
Hannibal, seeking to negotiate.

439
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,330
But Scipio has other plans.

440
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,370
Why are we talking of peace?

441
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,640
We lost.

442
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,710
Now we await their terms to...
You dare...

443
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,910
Dare speak of
surrendering to Hannibal

444
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,710
and his army of animals,
of barbarians?

445
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,670
It need not be over yet.

446
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,890
A negotiated treaty is very different
from unconditional surrender.

447
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,720
We agree to neither.

448
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,000
Hannibal is waiting for us to
bow our heads in obedience.

449
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,490
Well, we let him wait

450
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,820
while we beat this great
general at his own game,

451
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,500
by taking the fight to Carthage.

452
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,470
For the next 15 years,

453
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,400
Hannibal and Scipio
battle for control of Italy.

454
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,250
The rival powers fight
themselves into a stalemate.

455
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,370
Hannibal never reaches
the capital city,

456
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,740
and Scipio must constantly
keep the barbarians at bay.

457
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,510
The Romans are very fast learners
when it comes to their military.

458
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,060
They are very adept at taking the
best bits from their enemies,

459
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,700
of analyzing their tactics and
their formations and their troops,

460
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,540
and assimilating those
into their own tactics,

461
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,160
and to turn the
enemy's strengths

462
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,410
into Roman strengths as well.

463
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,110
Scipio breaks
the standoff in 204 B.C.

464
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,340
He invades North Africa,

465
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,990
forcing Hannibal to chase him

466
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,990
across the Mediterranean
to defend Carthage.

467
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,380
Their final showdown
takes place at Zama,

468
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,460
where Scipio
defeats his nemesis,

469
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,100
using the maneuver
Hannibal unleashed on him,

470
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,860
at Cannae, 14 years earlier.

471
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,640
One of the sad ironies of
Hannibal is that in the end,

472
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
he ends up being Rome's
military schoolmaster.

473
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,740
It must have been incredibly distressing
and frustrating for Hannibal

474
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,850
to see that Scipio
had been able to use

475
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,320
his own tactics against him
in this final conflict.

476
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,780
It is Hannibal's
first and only defeat.

477
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,080
If you look at
the record of great captains,

478
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,900
um, they may win two times,
three times, four times,

479
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,670
but they don't necessarily
always dominate forever.

480
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,460
They have their day.
Someone else comes along

481
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,110
and can do the same thing,
with more resources,

482
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,500
better troops, new technology,
and their day's over.

483
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,340
After his loss,
the great general retires.

484
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,750
But Rome continues
to see him as a threat,

485
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,190
long after he
lays down his sword.

486
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,290
Hannibal is one of
the few figures

487
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,660
who actually knocked
the Romans down.

488
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,870
And he is the one that
comes closest to winning.

489
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,260
He shows the world that it's
possible to take down this empire.

490
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,110
In 195 B.C.,

491
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,830
the Republic demands that Carthage
hand over their old enemy,

492
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,580
but Hannibal
refuses to surrender.

493
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,080
He volunteers to be exiled.

494
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,490
Now in his early 60s,

495
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,920
the man who is perhaps the greatest
soldier the world has ever known

496
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,000
deals his mortal enemy
one final defeat.

497
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,020
Hannibal's united army
won some battles,

498
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,560
but not the war.

499
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,250
And the next time the
barbarians stand against Rome,

500
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,920
they'll need a new tactic
to defeat an enemy

501
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,070
that's becoming unstoppable.

502
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,690
With Carthage defeated,

503
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,070
the Republic is free to
conquer the Mediterranean.

504
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,110
By 150 B.C.,

505
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,600
its borders stretch
from Greece in the east

506
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,510
to Hispania in the west.

507
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,820
But as the barbarians continue
to resist the Roman way of life,

508
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,480
they learn the consequences of
rebellion against the Republic.

509
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,430
Those barbarians that had aligned
themselves with the Carthaginians

510
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,130
have to pay a price, and they're
gonna pay a terrible price.

511
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,560
Tribes that allied
with Hannibal against Rome

512
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,130
are the first to come
under the sword.

513
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,790
The Lusitanians,

514
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,080
Celtic warriors of western
Hispania are Rome's next target.

515
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,370
The Roman action
had to be so terrible,

516
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,440
so cruel to dissuade, uh,

517
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,690
the rest of the Spanish
nation from resisting.

518
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,420
Twenty-eight years
after Hannibal's death,

519
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,690
Rome invades western Hispania.

520
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,020
Governor Servius Galba
is granted authority

521
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,090
to use force against
the Lusitanians.

522
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,390
But he does far more.

523
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,290
Galba summons the tribes to hear
the terms of a peace treaty.

524
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,010
A deal that promises to
resettle them to new lands.

525
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:06,240
What follows is a brutal
lesson in Roman diplomacy.

526
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,090
Father!

527
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,030
Viriathus!

528
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,350
The barbarians of western
Hispania are under siege

529
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,460
as Rome invades their homeland

530
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
seeking revenge for their
part in Hannibal's war.

531
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,820
Lured by the promise of peace,

532
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,820
the Lusitanians instead become the
latest victims of Roman treachery.

533
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,040
He gathers them together
and massacres them.

534
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,360
Uh, it's an act
of great brutality.

535
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,170
It's an act of betrayal.

536
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,800
And it shows how little
respect he has for them.

537
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,010
Thousands lie dead.

538
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,880
The survivors are running
for their lives.

539
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,250
Among them is a shepherd
named Viriathus.

540
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,450
Thirty thousand are butchered or
enslaved in Galba's massacre.

541
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,120
The few Lusitanians who survive

542
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,030
are hunted by
Roman death squads.

543
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,800
When a military force rounds
up the women and children

544
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,520
and eliminates the population

545
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,470
or attempts to do so,
that's genocide.

546
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,410
Genocide can never
be 100% effective.

547
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,880
And if it isn't 100% effective,

548
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,740
it will simply generate
the desire for revenge.

549
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,850
The overreaction of the
oppressor to the oppressed,

550
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,050
removes fear.

551
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,140
When their back's
against a wall,

552
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,180
the oppressor
removes all options.

553
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,560
Then the poor lash
out and they rebel.

554
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,130
They promised new lands.

555
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,840
Said the soil was rich.

556
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,010
Yeah, it is...

557
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,410
with Lusitanian blood.

558
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,220
You cannot stay here.

559
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,990
Galba's murder squads
will return.

560
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,670
But the children
need food, water.

561
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,100
Scavenge what you can from here.

562
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,500
Use the cover of night.

563
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,410
Keep to the low lands.

564
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,410
You're coming with us?

565
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,310
But we need you.
You're a fighter.

566
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,160
I am a shepherd.

567
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,790
I'm no fighter.

568
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,930
Yet you fight?

569
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,560
Do as he says, Reburrus, go.

570
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,170
Go!

571
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,090
If you leave,
these people will die.

572
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,250
We all die, old man.

573
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,440
We all die, shepherd,

574
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,870
but not today,

575
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,970
not here.

576
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,020
Will he live, Tagus?

577
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,920
He will.

578
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,450
Only wish he hadn't.

579
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,920
The Republic now occupies

580
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,160
more than 100,000 square miles

581
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,290
of barbarian territory
in Hispania.

582
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,340
Roman roads begin to
cut across the landscape,

583
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,100
part of the
transportation network

584
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,100
that ferries plundered
resources back to Rome

585
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,210
and carries death squads
to put down any resistance.

586
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,080
The Romans
built forts, encampments.

587
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,640
Establishing roads,
lines of communications,

588
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,620
buying supplies from
the local population.

589
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,320
That's what enables
the transformation

590
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,220
of a wilderness into a territory

591
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,890
Isn't much.

592
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,790
You need it more than me.

593
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,200
Galba has these
territories surrounded.

594
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,840
We are prisoners
in our own land.

595
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,070
His men will return.

596
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,880
They will not stop hunting us.

597
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,870
We strike camp,
move forward again today.

598
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,880
Head for the mountains.

599
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,940
We took what we could
from the village.

600
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,850
No food, no blankets.

601
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,150
No tools, weapons.
Nothing of use.

602
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,550
These people will die, too,

603
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,160
if we don't find food
and shelter for them.

604
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,930
Then don't go forward.

605
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,070
Go back to Galba's
killing field.

606
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,160
Take what you can
from the bodies.

607
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,530
We can't!

608
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,050
You must.

609
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,350
We must.

610
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,790
Did you find your wife and boy?

611
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,950
Soldiers on the new road.

612
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,840
Get them to the lowlands.
Follow the river west.

613
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,550
I will find you.

614
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,560
Where are you going?

615
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,860
Hunting.

616
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,830
Barbarian tribes

617
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,460
living on the borders of the
Republic are thrown into chaos

618
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,590
as the Roman killing machine
descends on their lands.

619
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:33,570
But Viriathus, a shepherd,
decides to make a stand.

620
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,210
Lusitania has a
message for Galba.

621
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,510
Viriathus'
message to Rome is clear.

622
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,740
Lusitania won't surrender
without a fight.

623
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,670
Get that bound again,
and get some rest.

624
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,570
We move on at first light.

625
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,340
Is this what we've become?

626
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,440
A nation of refugees?

627
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,410
We must fight.

628
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,680
If Rome wants this land,
then let us bury them in it.

629
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,620
The sources tell us that
Viriathus was a shepherd.

630
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,720
To survive as a shepherd, you
had to be a bit of a bandit.

631
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,220
You were out there in the mountains,
you had to deal with wolves,

632
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,670
uh, and other predators, and you
often had to deal with real bandits.

633
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,200
So I think that Viriathus
has exactly the skills

634
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,340
that the surviving Lusitanians
desperately need

635
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,810
in order to continue
the resistance against Rome.

636
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,180
Viriathus begins to transform
his band of survivors

637
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,120
into an organized resistance.

638
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,110
They use the forest as cover

639
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,610
to launch small-scale raids
and escape undetected.

640
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,830
Viriathus knew very well
how to attack and retreat.

641
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,760
And run away.

642
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,830
This can be converted
very easily

643
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,770
into a very effective
military action.

644
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,840
This is what we call today
guerilla warfare.

645
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,780
It's perhaps the
most ancient form of warfare,

646
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,350
revived and rebooted
to play to the strengths

647
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,740
of the outnumbered and
under-equipped tribes

648
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,710
fighting for their freedom.

649
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,520
The enemy was invisible.

650
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,750
It would attack and disappear.

651
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,300
Hit and run.

652
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,890
He's going to their very psyche.

653
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,090
He wants to create
the impression

654
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,940
that the Romans are not operating
in friendly territory.

655
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,600
This will become the signature
weapon of the barbarian resistance

656
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,550
in the battles to come.

657
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,470
And in Lusitania, it's a strategy
that catches the Romans off guard.

658
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,390
Viriathus starts to
build a name for himself,

659
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,620
and Rome takes notice.

660
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,160
A rebellion is like a virus.

661
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,230
You know, if you can get
it right when it starts,

662
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,720
when it's in its infancy,

663
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,760
you have a good chance
of eradicating it.

664
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,990
But if you ignore it
or you allow it to grow,

665
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,640
it's gonna continue to spread

666
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,130
until it reaches a point
where you can't handle it.

667
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,050
Who is this Viriathus?

668
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,680
This ghost?

669
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,950
And still the sound of
silence is deafening.

670
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,150
Three years
into Viriathus' rebellion,

671
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,680
Rome appoints a new commander.

672
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,220
Gaius Vitellius is
Galba's former enforcer.

673
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,060
He's handed control of Lusitania
with one simple mission,

674
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,060
end the barbarian uprising.

675
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,440
You're the last of your people.

676
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,480
Tell me where
I can find Viriathus,

677
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,970
and I will let you go.

678
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,620
We take their weapons,
we take their land,

679
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,170
we take their lives,
and still they fight back.

680
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,500
They are a proud people.

681
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,030
Then we will take their pride.

682
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,860
Let the men have him.

683
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,540
When they've finished, cut off
his sword-hand and let him go.

684
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,040
If Viriathus unites the tribes?

685
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,340
I cannot go back to Rome
without the head of Viriathus.

686
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,740
The head of your ghost, sir?

687
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,680
We don't even know who he is.

688
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,280
Someone does, Marcus.

689
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,610
And I will find him, and hunt that
bastard to the edge of the earth.

690
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,750
You do not need to fear us.

691
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,650
We're not bandits.

692
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,460
It's what they've
made us become.

693
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,200
Scavengers?

694
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,810
Survivors.

695
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,040
My name is...
Viriathus, the shepherd.

696
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,380
And you are?

697
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,820
Ditalicus, last
of the Igeditani.

698
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,590
The others?

699
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,690
There are no others.

700
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,560
Gaius Vitellius,
there were repercussions.

701
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,090
From what?

702
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:45,040
From your so-called rebellion.

703
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,060
Something we see again
and again in Roman history

704
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,900
is the tremendous dilemma
that faces rebels.

705
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,580
Every success against the
Romans will lead to a reprisal.

706
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,120
Every victory will lead to bloodshed
on the part of the innocents.

707
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:04,210
So, those fighting against
Rome face a paradox.

708
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,150
I am responsible for the
massacre of his tribe.

709
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,330
Vitellius has murdered
his people, not you.

710
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,030
My actions.

711
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,700
How many more people has
your rebellion saved?

712
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,230
It is a path that Rome

713
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,440
has forced
you to walk, Viriathus.

714
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,670
And there will be more Lusitanian blood
on your hands before this is over.

715
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,730
Despite the danger,

716
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,750
Viriathus must convince
new allies to join him

717
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,890
to keep the fight going.

718
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,610
The oppressed must never
surrender to suppression.

719
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,740
They must resist.

720
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,640
And that becomes
a great temptation

721
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,250
when you become weary and tired.

722
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,270
"Maybe we can't win."

723
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,380
And that's where leadership

724
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,280
has to merge against
all these odds.

725
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,240
"Yes we can,
we will, we must."

726
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,560
I know what many of you
think of this fight.

727
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,950
This war.

728
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,360
I do not want war. I do not
crave it, but we need war.

729
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,890
We cannot stop what is coming.

730
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,160
We cannot hide any longer.

731
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,670
We cannot run or watch as our
people starve at the hands of Rome.

732
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,650
Do nothing as our children
die, as Lusitania dies.

733
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,920
So I stand here
asking you to fight,

734
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,020
not for me, but with me.

735
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,290
Look at us.

736
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,290
We are an army of refugees.

737
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,400
How are we supposed to take
on the entire Roman Army

738
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,930
with a handful of
weapons between us?

739
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,470
If we fight Romans
like Romans, we will fail,

740
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,940
so we must fight them
as Lusitanians.

741
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,210
Without our fathers' swords?

742
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,210
Yes, they took our
fathers' swords,

743
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,280
but we still have their weapons.

744
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,950
The weapons our fathers
left us are here

745
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,520
and here.

746
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,450
We know this land.

747
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,220
This terrain,
it is in our blood.

748
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,760
Rome took our blades,

749
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,190
but we still have the most
precious weapon of all.

750
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,190
The barbarians
of ancient Hispania

751
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,440
have defended their homeland

752
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,080
against invasion for
hundreds of years.

753
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,430
But Rome is unlike any enemy
they have faced before.

754
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,730
In Lusitania, Vitellius
cracks down on the population

755
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,560
in order to crush
their rebellion

756
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,910
and flush out
its leader, Viriathus.

757
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,910
He intensifies
weapons collections,

758
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,800
tortures captives

759
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,350
and hunts down
refugees in hiding.

760
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:03,490
For Vitellius, the pressure
is enormous.

761
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,180
He has no alternative.

762
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,090
There is only one
acceptable outcome.

763
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,230
And that is, he returns
with the head of Viriathus.

764
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,020
But despite the danger, survivors
flock to the rebel cause.

765
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,370
The Romans expected that the
Lusitanians would give up, terrified.

766
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,570
Instead, it was the opposite.

767
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,400
They were eager for revenge.

768
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,810
With followers
now numbering 10,000,

769
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:34,910
Viriathus escalates his guerrilla
raids on the Roman occupiers.

770
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,090
Viriathus seems always to be

771
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,990
one step ahead of Vitellius,
one step ahead of the Romans.

772
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:43,630
He's a natural at this.

773
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,990
He's been trained

774
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,130
in dealing with the countryside

775
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,060
and living off the land
his whole life.

776
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,330
Viriathus is
putting in motion a plan

777
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,630
to deliver Rome a death blow.

778
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:57,870
But success depends on his
ability to evade Vitellius,

779
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,500
who has now launched
a full-scale manhunt

780
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,210
to find the rebel leader.

781
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,900
And he calls us barbarians.

782
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,170
Is what we've done any better?

783
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,550
There are more hidden
throughout the village.

784
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,930
Vitellius chases
Viriathus for months,

785
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,730
but is outsmarted at every turn.

786
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,200
When they're chasing a
fugitive or an escapee

787
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,840
and they're in
their own backyard,

788
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,000
you know, from our perspective,
it's like chasing a ghost,

789
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,800
I mean, these guys,
they disappear,

790
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,810
they get help from
people on the outside,

791
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,110
they know the environment,

792
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,450
they certainly know,
you know, their own backyards

793
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,190
and where they feel
comfortable in hiding.

794
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,640
Bribes of food and shelter
fail to entice the barbarians

795
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,160
to betray their leader.

796
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,150
Brutality also fails.

797
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,290
Vitellius changes tactics and offers
the refugees a chance at peace.

798
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,690
He travels from camp to camp
to spread the word.

799
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,130
And you are?

800
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:17,750
Gaius Vitellius, Praetor
of Hispania Ulterior.

801
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,940
Supreme authority
in these lands.

802
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,370
And you?

803
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,580
Rome's aggressive
expansion provokes an uprising

804
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,300
in the Lusitanians' homeland.

805
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,310
Deep in the forest,

806
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,140
Viriathus comes face
to face with the man

807
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,180
who has been chasing him
for four years.

808
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,510
If he's identified, it will mean
the end of the barbarian rebellion

809
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,790
and of the Lusitanian people.

810
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,400
And you are?

811
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:58,330
Gaius Vitellius, Praetor
of Hispania Ulterior.

812
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,570
Supreme authority
in these lands.

813
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,510
And you?

814
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,950
A shepherd.

815
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,220
A Lusitanian.

816
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,350
And a poacher?

817
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,610
A free man.

818
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,060
A shepherd?

819
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,960
And yet...

820
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,500
You lead these people?

821
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,230
I do not lead these people.

822
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,000
You may need to tell
them that, shepherd.

823
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,710
What do you want, Roman?

824
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,670
I can grant these people,

825
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
your people,

826
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,620
lands in our territories.

827
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,760
They are not your lands to give.

828
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,130
Galba murdered our families,
he stole the land from us.

829
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:57,190
Praetor Galba is
no longer in charge.

830
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,190
I am.

831
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,230
And now I'm offering
the lands back.

832
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,360
At what cost?

833
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,160
Silver.

834
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,270
Iron.

835
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,470
Whatever these
lands can provide.

836
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,720
The Republic is expanding.
It needs grain.

837
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,750
To feed the army that
comes to kill us.

838
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,550
War is an expensive business.

839
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,950
We require your people
to farm the lands again.

840
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,680
And the Republic
will take a small tax.

841
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,090
These are our lands.

842
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,820
These are Rome's lands now.

843
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,630
You have a choice.

844
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:38,470
Stay in these camps
and watch your nation

845
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,940
and your people die.

846
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:47,110
Or take my offer and live again.

847
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,920
Speak with the other tribes,

848
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,020
many of them have already
agreed the terms.

849
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,450
You have until dawn to decide.

850
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,550
And if we do not?

851
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,490
You have until dawn.

852
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,580
Ditalicus led them here.

853
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,220
I saw him.

854
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,670
You've endangered us all
bringing them here.

855
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,970
No more than you do
attacking them.

856
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,770
You've heard them,
Viriathus, they offer...

857
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,010
They offer death!

858
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,340
We are already dying.

859
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,010
They offer life.

860
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,610
They bring more food
than can be said for your...

861
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,850
My what?

862
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,360
rebellion.

863
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,190
I fight for these people.

864
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,360
These people follow you
because they are lost!

865
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,030
They are not soldiers.

866
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,700
We cannot win this war.
You cannot win this fight!

867
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,230
Are you going to kill me
for speaking the truth?

868
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,980
You are more Roman
than they are.

869
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,370
I know Gaius Vitellius
cannot be trusted.

870
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:32,080
But what they offer us
is survival for our people.

871
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,810
They offer us nothing.

872
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,060
These lands are our birthright,

873
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,710
yet Rome takes them.

874
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,150
They murder our people,
our traditions, our culture.

875
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:47,270
This fight is a fight
for our freedom.

876
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,640
You say you don't believe
in this rebellion,

877
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,360
yet you did not tell
Gaius Vitellius my name?

878
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,700
He would have
slaughtered us all.

879
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,270
You do as you must,

880
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,010
but I will make
no deal with Rome.

881
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,070
Gaius Vitellius
wants an answer by dawn,

882
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,240
we will give him one.

883
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,660
I have a message for Vitellius.

884
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,030
This was my father's.

885
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,450
As long as that bastard
lives or breathes,

886
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,840
this is the last silver
he will take from these lands.

887
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,130
There is a fire coming.

888
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,940
Who are you?

889
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,940
Viriathus, the shepherd.

890
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,670
The barbarians' battle for
control of the ancient world

891
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,930
rages on in western Hispania.

892
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,350
Where after four years
of fighting in the shadows,

893
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,280
the rebel leader Viriathus,

894
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,520
has finally revealed himself to the
Roman who is out for his head.

895
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,530
Crude, isn't it?

896
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,500
The shepherd is my ghost.

897
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,070
And you allowed him to escape.

898
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,970
We will hit their
camp at first light.

899
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,770
That camp is already gone.

900
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,200
I want you to double my guard.

901
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,150
Burn every refugee camp...

902
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,680
But many will be camps we've made
deals with. We can't just...

903
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,590
I'm renegotiating our terms!

904
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,710
We will burn them anyway.

905
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:07,150
Send word to Rome.

906
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,550
If Viriathus
wants a war of fire...

907
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,000
I shall give him one.

908
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,700
With the elusive barbarian
leader finally revealed,

909
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,970
Vitellius raises two legions, as many
as 10,000 men, to hunt him down.

910
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,740
The Romans are playing right
into Viriathus' hands.

911
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,920
He's planned
a full-scale assault

912
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,750
designed to give his
fighters the advantage

913
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,750
against Rome's superior numbers.

914
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,290
It's an evolution of the
barbarian's guerilla war.

915
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,390
The campaign's
reached a crucial point now,

916
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:50,660
and Viriathus wants to end this.

917
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,190
To annihilate his enemy is
basically the way that he thinks

918
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,340
is the best to go forward.

919
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:56,660
The paradox of guerilla warfare

920
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,540
is that you can cause
the enemy great pain,

921
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,140
but you can't win a war
with simply guerilla tactics.

922
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,070
At a certain point,
you have to switch over,

923
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,580
and put everything on the line

924
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,420
and risk everything
in a big engagement.

925
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:13,320
The Lusitanians won't face
Rome on an open battlefield

926
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,290
or in small lightning raids.

927
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:20,630
Instead, Viriathus engineers a series
of coordinated guerilla attacks,

928
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,930
using the natural terrain
as a gauntlet

929
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,730
that will give Rome no escape.

930
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:04,440
This is the third
camp. Nothing.

931
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,940
Tracks lead off
in every direction.

932
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,880
The shepherd gathers his flock.

933
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,210
There has been another
Viriathus ambush.

934
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:17,490
Only one guard dead,
the rest, they maimed.

935
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,960
He pushes me, Marcus.

936
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:25,150
He's evaded us for all these
years and now he shows himself.

937
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,930
Why?

938
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,890
He's trying to distract me.

939
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,230
What is it he doesn't
want me to see?

940
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,340
The warrior shepherd
and his guerrilla army

941
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,680
draws Vitellius and his force of 10,000
legionaries deeper into the forest.

942
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,520
He aims to spread
the Roman line thin,

943
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:54,360
like a snake winding through
the ravines and gullies.

944
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,710
Viriathus will target the head.

945
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,590
And 9,000 barbarian allies will
push the tail towards a deadfall,

946
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,930
over the edge of a high cliff.

947
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,940
The plan depends on
Vitellius taking the bait

948
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,940
and chasing Viriathus
without let up.

949
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,930
Viriathus let you live?

950
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,090
Why?

951
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:36,800
I do not fear death.

952
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,570
Perhaps you should.

953
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,140
Where is my ghost?

954
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,560
Where is Viriathus?

955
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,480
He runs for Tribola.

956
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,980
The mountains.

957
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,780
Where?

958
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:58,610
I don't know, but he
knows you will follow.

959
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,760
If this is true.
If...

960
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:07,930
If this is true, Viriathus
will be forced into the open.

961
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,170
We will lead both
legions on Tribola.

962
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,460
Crush the insurgence before he
can unite any remaining tribes.

963
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,340
Viriathus is no fool.

964
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,940
Even he would not lead his men
against an army of 10,000.

965
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:25,040
You will lead the advance
party, lure him out.

966
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,820
The legions will
back up our rear.

967
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,510
And Ditalicus,

968
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:32,550
shall I kill him?

969
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:36,720
No,

970
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:39,720
he may be of some use.

971
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,300
Set him free.

972
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,700
Forward!

973
01:14:58,910 --> 01:14:59,970
Formations!

974
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:01,740
Formations!

975
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,740
We cannot wait for the legion.

976
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:06,890
We must take the auxillia!

977
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,990
Hunt that bastard down!

978
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,430
Stay together!

979
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:19,430
Vitellius leads his men
directly into a narrow gully...

980
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:22,430
The Roman forces are
stretched into a thin line,

981
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:27,470
two miles long, on the
edge of a deadly ravine.

982
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:29,570
Nine thousand barbarian warriors

983
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,570
are poised to
descend from the forest

984
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:39,670
and push the Roman line
into the abyss.

985
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,990
Formations!

986
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,160
In western Hispania,

987
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,240
Viriathus and his
barbarian rebels

988
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:52,440
launch a coordinated guerrilla
attack against the Roman legions

989
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,780
that have brutalized them
for four long years.

990
01:16:56,210 --> 01:17:00,380
It is the most ambitious battle
plan they've ever attempted.

991
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,420
Formations!

992
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,790
Testudo! Testudo!

993
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,250
The barbarian attack
descends from the hills,

994
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,800
pushing the Roman legions back
towards the edge of a deadly cliff.

995
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,220
Have you come for this?

996
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:43,910
No.

997
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,360
Keep it.

998
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,380
My father took that from
a dead Roman at Zama.

999
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,090
Rome will pour men
onto this land

1000
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,440
until ever corner of every field

1001
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,740
is ripped from your hands.

1002
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,940
Let them come.

1003
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:40,670
For it is Rome who have united
us, and we will not be defeated.

1004
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,110
Rome will never fear you...

1005
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,040
shepherd!

1006
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,450
It is not I they should fear,

1007
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,030
but the generations to come.

1008
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,040
Viriathus and his guerilla army

1009
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,690
slaughter 4,000 Romans
in the Battle of Tribola.

1010
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
Thousands more are wounded.

1011
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:48,640
Viriathus' ambush at Tribola
is a great shock to the Romans

1012
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,970
and it's a great achievement
for him and his army.

1013
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,750
Lusitania became

1014
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,900
the Roman Empire's Vietnam.

1015
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,020
- Formations!
- Testudo! Testudo!

1016
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,380
They were on an
unknown environment,

1017
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,460
unknown landscape,

1018
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,100
unknown way of fighting.

1019
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,730
This defeat of the Romans

1020
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:11,900
at the hands of what were
effectively a small bandit nation,

1021
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,800
sends a message to the rest
of the communities there

1022
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,630
that they can make it
on their own.

1023
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:21,070
The barbarians hold the upper
hand for the next eight years.

1024
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,970
Being a successful guerilla warrior
is like walking a tightrope.

1025
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,680
You know that it's very
difficult to keep your balance,

1026
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,690
and you know how easy
it is for the enemy

1027
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,510
to get to you
and how vulnerable you are.

1028
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,050
Viriathus understood that he couldn't
keep fighting against Rome forever,

1029
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,400
and that's why he eventually
decides to seek peace terms.

1030
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:43,170
But Viriathus
makes a fatal error.

1031
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:46,340
The Republic cannot be trusted
to make peace deals.

1032
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,040
Using gold
plundered from Lusitania,

1033
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:54,080
Rome bribes Viriathus' own men
to betray their leader.

1034
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,180
Eight years after
his victory at Tribola,

1035
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,070
he's assassinated.

1036
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:08,650
Lusitania falls to Rome less
than a year after his death.

1037
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,500
The Republic seizes control

1038
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,590
of all of the trade routes
across the Mediterranean.

1039
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:16,990
It's now the unrivalled
superpower of the ancient world.

1040
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,210
Rome uses the riches it plunders
from across the continent

1041
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,380
to build its
wealth and influence,

1042
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,800
while it slaughters and enslaves

1043
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,680
the barbarians in its path.

1044
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,840
The tactics that Viriathus
used to defeat the Romans,

1045
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:39,910
these guerrilla tactics, this
mobile nature, the hit and run,

1046
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,580
is something that will
become part of the way

1047
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:45,960
that the barbarians take on
the Romans in the future.

1048
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,440
But every time
the barbarians rise,

1049
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,700
it chips away at Roman power.

1050
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,340
Freedom is inevitable.

1051
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,680
The arc is long,
the journey's long,

1052
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,470
but it bends towards freedom.

1053
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,580
Next time on
Barbarians Rising...

1054
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:12,390
You will regret
making enemies of us!

1055
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,850
From today, we cease
to do Rome's bidding.

1056
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,170
From today, we go
to war with Rome.

1057
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,770
I have something you have
never known, freedom.

1058
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,010
They don't need to respect me,

1059
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,080
they need to fear me.

1060
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:38,770
We're no longer the underdogs.

1061
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,240
We're the rising power.

1062
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,720
Nothing can save you now.

1063

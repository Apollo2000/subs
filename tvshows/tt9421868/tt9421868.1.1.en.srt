00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,242
Sel.

3
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,374
Selena.

4
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,255
I can't do this.

5
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,258
Sel…

6
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,342
AB!

7
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,513
Yes, you are.

8
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,308
You already told the record company yes.
It's done.

9
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,646
We went though this already.

10
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,147
You're just scared.

11
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,608
Yeah, because I'm not doing this
without you guys.

12
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,361
Don't get puffy.

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,157
How many times have we talked
about an English record, hmm? Forever?

14
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,802
- We've been dreaming about this…
- I know, but…

15
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,986
…since we were sleeping on the floor
at Uncle Hector's,

16
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,121
and now we get to do it.

17
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,415
Then I think about being on tour for it,
and I'm on stage, and…

18
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,755
I turn around, and y'all aren't behind me.

19
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,467
Then look off to the side some.
I'll be there.

20
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,511
In the wings.

21
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,181
On the bus to tell you to
"Move your butt, we're gonna be late."

22
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,102
And I'll be working on songs
for our next record together.

23
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,813
You're not losing us, okay?

24
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,920
Now…

25
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,924
I would like to dedicate this song

26
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,717
to all of you…

27
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,513
because you guys made this song a hit,
the first hit for us…

28
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,516
here in the US,

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,935
as well as in Mexico.

30
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
Hope you remember this song.

31
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>♪ Baby, I'mma hold you
Baby, I'mma need you… ♪</i>

32
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,045
Selena.

33
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,340
It was supposed
to be our daughter's name…

34
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,218
until he turned out to be a son.

35
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,514
- Ours was supposed to be a boy.
<i>- </i>Well, she was supposed to be a tumor.

36
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,766
Abraham.

37
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,478
First doctor couldn't tell I was pregnant.
Thought I had a tumor.

38
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,188
Wanted to operate.

39
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,981
So we saw a second doctor, just...

40
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,611
He took one look and said,
"This tumor has two arms and two legs."

41
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,863
And that's her.

42
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,283
He was so sure it was gonna be a boy.

43
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,369
Marco Antonio Quintanilla.

44
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,456
You know,
we didn't even pick a girl's name.

45
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,293
Well, Selena's available.
You're welcome to it.

46
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,586
Selena.

47
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,676
Selena Quintanilla.

48
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,681
- I like how that sounds.
- Hmm.

49
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,021
Selena.

50
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,943
Selena.

51
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,863
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

52
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,262
"Selena.

53
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,514
From the Greek.

54
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,516
Goddess of the Moon."

55
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,369
Okay, but you have to keep your fingers
all the way down.

56
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,872
Dad, I'm ready!

57
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,582
Don't squeeze, press.

What did I do wrong?

70
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,557
Nothing.

71
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,646
The notes are good.
You're just not…

72
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,816
It's about love.

73
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,028
You know? How you…

74
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
how you had it and then you lost it.

75
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,531
Abraham.

76
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,242
She's eight years old.

77
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,952
She doesn't know about love yet.

78
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,829
I know about love.

79
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,247
I love you.

80
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,956
I love Dad.

81
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
I love Suzette.

82
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,713
- I even love AB.
- I know.

83
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,008
But what she's saying is…

84
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,760
…it's a different kind of love.

85
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,596
Like your father and me. That kind.

86
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,354
I can't explain it, but…

87
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,146
you meet someone,

88
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,569
and now it feels
like there's a fist around your heart,

89
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,530
and if someone was to take that away…

90
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,158
oh, it would feel like…

91
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,702
like they're taking
your whole heart with it.

92
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,328
Like that.

93
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,956
Well…

94
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,750
I don't want that.

95
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,087
You will.

96
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,465
For now…

97
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,509
you just copy how I do it.

98
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,387
And then one day it'll just…

99
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,680
make sense.

100
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,598
Okay?

101
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,780
So, I was thinking…

102
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,199
if Selena likes to sing and…

103
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,909
AB is learning bass,

104
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,287
I could be on guitar and we could
all have fun playing together.

105
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,831
I love that idea.

106
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,876
You know, for relatives at parties maybe.

107
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
How come?

108
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,048
Well, because playing music
is a privilege,

109
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,884
and it gave me some
of the best times of my life, and…

110
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,220
I want you to have that too.

111
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:06,016
But Cousin Jesse, he went home,
and he was the one who played the drums.

112
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,102
Yeah,
but the drums are still here…

113
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,396
waiting for someone to play them.

114
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,569
What?

115
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,987
The drums.

116
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,114
What? No!

117
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,532
It'll be fun.

118
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,742
No, it won't.

119
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,594
- It's just for family, <i>mijita.</i>
- No!

120
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,121
I don't wanna play drums.
Girls don't play drums.

121
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,831
Sheila E. does.

122
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,750
Then get Sheila E.

123
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,253
- Mom.
- Maybe if you try it, it might be fun.

124
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,756
Mom, no!

125
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,175
Dad, please!

Hey, go bus those tables by the window.

00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,479
Oh, and you said
you know somebody that plays guitar?

Yeah, why?

139

I'm kinda looking out of place up here

00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,776
I'm thinking ahead.

141

142
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,738
Sure, why not?

00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,281
Okay.

144
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
Here you go.

145
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,502
Hey, tell 'em we ran out of chicken.

146
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:44,174
Uh, sorry, folks, we've run out
of arroz con pollo or…

147
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,927
well, anything <i>con pollo,</i>
so try the carnitas.

148
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,556

Are you worried people are gonna stop
coming to the restaurant?

159
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,714
Already seeing a half-empty
restaurant on our good nights.

160

<i>I don't know, people just stopped

165
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
I know you.

166
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
You're that little girl
who sings at Papagayos.

167
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Sorry.

168
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,676
Wrong room.

169
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,636
- Abraham.
- Wrong room. Let's go!

170
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,681
Abraham.

171
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,559
Abraham!

172
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,980
You don't have to be embarrassed.

173
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,649
My family on food stamps…

174
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,360
If I wasn't embarrassed,
there would be something wrong with me.

175
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,696
You're proud. I know that.

176
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,198
But right now forget about proud.

177
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,784
Let's just feed our family, okay?

178
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,292
- Come on.
- Come on.

179
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,135
Two.

180
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,850
Okay, that should be enough.

181
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,772
- I can go if you want.
- No.

182
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,233
I'll go.

183
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,947
Suzette.

184
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,407
AB.

185
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,958
I didn't even know
the store was open this late.

186
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,127
It's the best time to shop.

187
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,963
No people, lines move faster…

188
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,758
- List. We get everything?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
Okay.

190
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,221
Let's, uh…

191
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,767
let's check out.

192
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,816
Listen…

193
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,320
there's no shame
in taking help sometimes.

194
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,116
Now, I've worked hard. I've paid my taxes

195
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,451
so the government can help us
when we need it.

196
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,703
No shame in that, right?

197
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,541
Good.

198
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,295
Good. Go check out.
I'll see you in the car.

199
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,966
Wait… what?

200
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,283
Stop!

201
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,452
Stop!

202
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,372
What are you doing?

203
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,586
- Playing.
- You sound like you're chopping wood.

204
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,006
No one's together. It's like
you're not even in the same room.

205
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,174
Tell Suzette.

206
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,843
Tell AB. He won't follow my beat.

207
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,428
You can't even stick to one.

208
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,346
I'm doing fine.

209
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,931
- Hey!
- Enough!

210
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,727
Inside now!

211
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,694
This is "Confidencias de Amor"
by my old band Los Dinos.

212
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,823
Listen to the song…

213
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,993
and then tell me
what every instrument is doing.

214
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
AB.

215
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,005
Can you hear the guitar?

216
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,089
Yeah.

217
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,674
- Selena.
- Yes.

218
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,012
Suzette.

219
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,722
- No.
- It's okay.

220
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,558
Listen again.

221
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,109
You hear it?

222
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,821
Yeah, and the bass is like…

223
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,367
hum… dum…

224
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,034
dum.

225
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,580
You hear it now?

226
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,874
Yeah.

227
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,380
- Really?
- No.

228
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,881
I don't know.

229
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,134
- I hear the music.
- Okay, okay. So, that is what I'm saying.

230
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,302
The music…

231
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,847
is the separate parts
all playing together.

232
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:11,603
But also, each one of you listening
to what everyone else is playing.

233
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,897
- I'm trying to hear the parts, but...
- Good.

234
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,816
- So let's try again.
- No!

235
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,901
I don't hear it, okay?

236
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,737
I don't have to.
I just have to keep the beat.

237
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,116
You're wrong. I'm sorry.

238
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,576
The drummer is the heart of the band.

239
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,998
And just like your heart, which...
it keeps the beat for you too.

240
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,959
But if it gets just a little bit off,

241
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,335
then you're in trouble.

253
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,010
We can do different. We can change it up.

254
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,887

We got replaced.

264
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,629
By a record player.

265
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,006
I know.

266
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,551
You guys sounded great, though.

267
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,053
"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,"
best it's ever been.

268
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,806
Because we practice it all the time.

269
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,890
I know.

270
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,185
But if you keep practicing,
pretty soon it's all gonna pay off.

271
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,270
Just watch.

272
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,150
Do you trust your father?

273
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,486
Yes.

274
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,041
We were going on a field trip next week.

275
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,921
You were?

276
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,551
We were gonna ride on a bus.

277
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,308
I bet you can ride on a bus
at your new school.

278
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,020
And your cousins go there,
so you'll have people you know.

279
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,981
Well, what about me? I don't.

280
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,608
All my friends are here.

281
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,371
What am I supposed to do
in Corpus Christi?

282
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,362
Make the best of it, that's what,
just like the rest of us.

283
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,407
We're lucky that we have family there.

284
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,534
My brothers and sisters, they…

285
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,580
- they don't wanna see us unhappy.
- I wasn't unhappy.

286
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,290
They're trying to help.

287
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,127
That's what family does.

288
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,340
- And I'm grateful for it. You understand?
- Yes.

289
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,720
I know that you guys don't like this,

290
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,847
but this is how it has to be.

291
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,767
You trust your father?

292
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,478
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

293
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
Okay.

294
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,361
Are we really gonna fit in the same house
with all the cousins and everyone?

295
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,239
Uncle Eddie, see,

296
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,617
he says that he has a place
that we can stay in for now, just us.

297
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,911
It's gonna be good.

298
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,415
Come on.

299
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,677
I know it looks bad…

300
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,428
but…

301
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,474
we can, you know, the tires will go.

302
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,143
No.

303
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,730
I mean, if we just
move some things around...

304
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,815
Abraham!

305
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,733
No.

306
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,032
Sorry.

307
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,585
You guys need anything?

308
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,047
No, brother, we're good.

309
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,759
- Good night, then.
- Good night, Hector.

310
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,002
Good night, Marcella.

311
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,847
Good night, kids.

312
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,266
Good night.

313
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,018
Good night.

314
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
All that skill…

315
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,874
could be put to some use.

316
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,834
It is.

317
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,088
I'm making something
to carry our equipment.

318
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,173
For the band.

319
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,175
For the band.

320
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,221
Eddie says he might need someone
to drive a truck.

321
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,807
I'll drive a truck, sure.

322
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,353
As long as it doesn't interfere.

323
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,230
With the band.

324
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,899
With the band.

325
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,861
You haven't changed.

326
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,407
Hector…

327
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,867
<i>…</i>you wouldn't understand.

328
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,328
I know, your music.

329
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,793
Have you heard her, brother?

330
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,880
My Selena can sing.

331
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,718
I drive a truck. I drive another truck.
I drive another truck.

332
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,804
In ten years, I'm still driving a truck,

333
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,389
or in ten years, she's a star.

334
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,432
She's not me.

335
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,061
She's going places.

336
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,314
- In a homemade trailer.
- In whatever it takes!

337
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,704
You remember Ozzie? Hmm?

338
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,166
His daughter's getting married.

339
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,836
Maybe talk to him.

340
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,392
I just got back.

341
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,936
I saw Hector, and he said
that your Sofia's getting married.

342
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,980
- How's that even possible?
- I know, right?

343
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,023
It goes by so fast.

344
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,275
Congratulations.

345
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,527
Thank you.

346
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,947
Hey, so, for the party after.
You have a band yet?

347
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,992
Nah, bands are expensive.

348
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,162
- We got a DJ.
- A DJ.

349
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,955
No, no, no, no, no, no.

350
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,459
Sofia deserves a band.
I tell you what, let me do it for you.

351
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,546
Not much more than a DJ,
plus we play Tejano music, pop…

352
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,673
whatever keeps your guests
dancing all night.

353
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,672
It's just in the backyard.

354
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,636
We don't have lights or sound.
The DJ was bringing all that.

355
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,929
Not a problem.

356
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,182
We have it all.
Lights, sound… lots of lights.

357
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,266
Don't worry.

358
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,059
We got you, huh?

359
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,145
Sit down,
like when we were kids.

360
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,877
Hey. Come with me.

361
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,798
- Where?
- To get some lights. Come on.

362
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,866
New lights. This is what I've been saying.
We need to step up.

363
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,577
Get a real lighting package
with a dimmer board,

364
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,745
so we look professional.

365
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,707
Plus, bigger amps, bigger speakers,
so we can play at bigger places.

366
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,465
So, how far are we going for these lights?

367
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,093
Not far.

368
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,014
Where are we going?

369
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,934
Why are we at Luby's?

370
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,562
Ah. We're gonna eat first.

371
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,067
- Peach cans?
- Number four and number nine peach cans.

372
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,235
Perfect sizes.

373
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,738
You said we were buying lights.

374
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,199
Well, we don't have money to buy lights.

375
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,743
My buddy says
they throw these out every day.

376
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,204
With these and the others,
we'll make our own lights.

377
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,831
What do you mean "others"?

378
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,920
- Dad.
- What?

379
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,424
Why do I have to go in?

380
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,467
I was in the army. What have you done?

381
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,887
I wasn't the one who told the guy
we were gonna buy lights.

382
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,889
Sometimes that's how you have to do it.

383
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,141
When you jump out of a plane
without a parachute,

384
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,392
you better make one or else.

385
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,853
It's called a leap of faith.

386
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,980
That's called a dumpster dive.

387
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,692
Whatever. Get in there.
I wanna go home. It's cold. Go.

388
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,164
Oh!

It was always the same way for me
after a show too.

400
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,071
That's why musicians have weird hours.

401
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,447
They stay up all night,

402
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,700
and they only hang out
with other musicians.

403
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,204
Well, other musicians don't have school.
Get some rest.

404
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,915
You see what I was talking about, AB?

405
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,751
Is he awake?

406
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,919
I'm awake.

407
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,922
We're all awake.
You guys won't stop talking.

408
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,383
It's like I said.
You can't wait for a parachute.

409
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,927
You have to step out of the plane.

410
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,220
What plane?

411
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,805
What are you telling them?

412
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,723
Not a real plane, Mom.

413
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,684
No one's jumping out of any plane.

414
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,977
Tonight was good.

415
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,605
It's all gonna be worth it, see, guys?

416
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,941
So, can I get a car?

417
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,526
- Shotgun!
- No fair.

418
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,902
No, no car.

419
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,903
Someday.

420
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,198
A Mercedes convertible.

421
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,492
560SL.

422
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,746
The insurance would be sky-high.

423
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,372
Mm. Okay.

424
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,292
Go to sleep, everybody.

425
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,715
The whole party smelled like peaches.

Pleasure doing business with you.

431
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you.

432
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
Hey. We loaded up.

433
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,133
Can we eat now?

434
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,388
Here. Go get something.
I'm gonna take a look around.

435
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,806
Don't be too loud. They just went to bed.

436
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,892
I'm just trying to find out
what makes these guys so special.

437
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,895
- Who?
- That Tejano band that we saw at the fair.

438
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,898
Oh. The ones that packed the dance floor?

439
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,733
The beat was nice.

440
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,987
Los Dinos was an 11-piece orchestra

441
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,364
playing mambos and cha-chas
and bossa nova,

442
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,325
but this…

443
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,620
Times have changed.

444
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,455
The music has changed.

445
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,376
- Something hasn't changed.
<i>- </i>What?

446
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,086
All the songs are in Spanish.

447
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,133
I don't know,
just Spanish is more romantic.

448
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,217
Don't you think?

449
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,513
Couples need to dance
and just fall in love.

450
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,600
And that's never gonna change.

451
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,189
You know what else will never change?

452
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,356
What?

453
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,486
My love for you, pretty lady.

454
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,238
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

457
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,723
I like that one.

458
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,019
You need to learn to sing like that.

459
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,940
- Like a man?
- No, in Spanish.

460
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,568
I don't know Spanish.

461
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,652
I do.

462
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,488
You'll get it.

463
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,032
Dad, we don't even listen
to those stations.

464
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,116
Well, maybe you should.

465
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,952
- Can you just turn it back?
- No.

466
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,747
Why do I need to sing in Spanish?

467
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
Because…

468
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,211
people will pay
to hear music that speaks to them…

469
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,338
who they are inside.

470
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,966
And the thing about you,

471
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,592
you have it inside you too.

472
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,222
But… I'm American.

473
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,515
And Mexican.

474
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,352
My family came from Mexico.

475
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,104
You came from me.

476
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,481
Like a thread.

477
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,441
Like a tree.

478
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,695
You know, with the roots over there,
but growing here.

479
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,863
Both countries, Selena.

480
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,282
They come together in you.

481
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,577
So…

482
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,788
you sing in Spanish.

483
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,000
You think you can do that?

484
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,005

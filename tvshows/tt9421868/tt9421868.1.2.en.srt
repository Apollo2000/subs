2
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,534
- Wow, they're good.
- I know.

3
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,578
What about them for our wedding?

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,663
- You think we could afford them?
- Yes.

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,665
Yes, you can.

6
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,226
What are you doing?
Why are you not working, huh?

7
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
That was so fun!

8
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,880
- Wasn't that fun?
- It was so fun.

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,467
- Ugh, my feet are killing me.
- My boots are hard as a rock.

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,886
Hey, Dad. How did we do? Good, huh?

11
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,721
You did fine.

12
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,723
"Fine"?

13
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,309
Don't ask him. He never says we're good.

14
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,354
You were great.

15
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,700
Excuse me, miss. Hmm?

16
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, thank you.

17
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,332
That's so sweet.

18
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,752
It shines
from the inside out, just like you.

19
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
Thank you.

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
Mom, do we have any money?

21
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,594
No, please.

22
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,597
Thank you.

23
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,118
I just wanted to see it.

24
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,143
Why is everybody so worried
about the take all of a sudden?

25
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,396
Because even with people coming in late,
it can't be a lot.

26
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,190
Does it even cover us to get home?

27
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
We're fine.

28
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,614
- Dad.
- Hmm?

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,366
Saying we're gonna continue
to do this is one thing,

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,534
but we need a new band now.

31
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,745
Ooh! And new outfits.

32
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,122
Mom, I can help design
something really cute, huh?

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,584
Let's stay away from
splattering glitter all over my floor.

34
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,585
Okay?

35
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,505
Oh, my God. I vacuumed twice over.

36
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,677
But we still need new songs.

37
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,430
A new record to sell
so someone even knows who we are.

38
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,557
Then I guess you'd better get to work.

39
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,476
- Me?
- Yes, you!

40
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,687
Step up and make it happen.

41
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,399
Okay, but, like, what if…
what if we can't?

42
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,235
Then we don't eat.

43
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,196
This is the road that we picked, son.
There's no exit now.

44
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,331
Selena, you're gonna be late.

45
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,393
- I can't find my shoes.
- They're by the door.

46
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,298
- Selena, come on.
- I am. I had to do my makeup.

47
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,026
Don't take my mascara!

48
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,927
You're gonna wake your brother.

49
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,892
Bye!

50
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,272
Selena, your lunch!

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,992
Hi. My mom's taking some of us
up to Amarillo this weekend

52
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,953
for Hands Across America,
and she said I could ask you to come.

53
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,081
I told her you wouldn't be able to, but…
can you?

54
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,083
What's Hands Across America?

55
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,460
It's where everyone makes
a human chain across the country

56
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,628
to raise money for hunger.

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,256
Kenny Rogers is gonna be there,
and Renegade,

58
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,632
and we're gonna stay overnight.

59
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,428
Yeah, then, no.

60
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,512
No.

61
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,140
Hi, Kevin.

62
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,517
Just ignore us. It's fine.

63
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,603
Even if my parents said yes, I'm busy.

64
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,207
Rehearsals and band stuff.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
Come on.

66
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,276
Certain…

67
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,528
people are going.

68
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,699
You've met my parents, right?

69
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,534
My mom will be there.

70
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,328
Yeah, well, I won't, but thanks.

71
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,414
Here.

72
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,123
For later.

73
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,773
Johnny Canales is almost back. Come on!

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,692
I can't. I'm busy.

75
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,986
You're mad
because he made fun of you.

76
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,655
I'm not mad.

77
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,704
<i>Target, up-to-date fashions,
down-to-earth prices.</i>

78
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,999
<i>There you go! Bravo! Bravo!</i>

79
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,668
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Selena y Los Dinos.</i>

80
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>So, Selena,
how did you paint your outfits?</i>

81
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,506
<i>With paint.</i>

82
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,258
<i>But so our friends in Mexico
can understand…</i>

83
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>Uh, they painted them.</i>

84
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,849
"Los pintaron."
<i>Selena, you need to improve your Spanish!</i>

85
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,894
Wait till you see me next time, Johnny.

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,439
I'll speak Spanish so good
you won't believe it.

87
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,024
I'll speak it better than you.

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,045
<i>More music, Selena y Los Dinos.</i>

89
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,309
<i>Are you going to sing?</i>

90
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,406
- <i>Yes.
- All right!</i>

91
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,861
I think it's just the plugs.

92
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,196
Here.

93
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,241
Where'd this come from?

94
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,742
The can.

95
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,371
- No, that's our safety. Put it back.
- We need a new van.

96
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,291
You want bigger amps, new equipment...

97
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,918
Marcella, I'm gonna go to the bank,
I'm gonna get a loan.

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,255
Why get more into debt
instead of using what we have?

99
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,923
Because that is our safety.

100
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,678
When that's still in there,
I know that we're okay.

101
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,681
Just put it back.
We have gigs coming up.

102
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,601
It's not gonna matter
if we don't have a van to get to them.

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,520
And I'm gonna get us a new record deal.

104
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,775
Manny Guerra
left and started his own label.

105
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,444
AB is coming up with new songs.

106
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm going to take them to Manny.
We're gonna cut a new record, a big one.

107
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,658
So don't worry.

108
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,166
What are they working on that for?

109
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,510
Good.

110
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,262
Good, let it swing like that.

111
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,725
- Dad, this is Roger.
- Roger.

112
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,893
Sir.

113
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,977
New guitarist.

114
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,479
I can see that.

115
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,064
A Fender man, huh?

116
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,734
- Uh, yes, sir. Telecaster preferred.
- Hmm.

117
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,986
You can do a lot with that.
That's for sure.

118
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,821
Did my son here
go over the rules with you?

119
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,119
Dad, I went over everything. It's fine.

120
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,205
This is my family.
You're representing this family.

121
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,415
No drinking. No drugs.
This is not the Rolling Stones.

122
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,879
He could probably tell
from us rehearsing in a dining room.

123
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,298
Where's Selena?

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,801
She's supposed to be here.

125
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,762
I know she's supposed to be here.

126
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,305
Go get her.

127
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,561
Roger, why don't you take a break?

128
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,327
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

129
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,037
Were you kissing your hand?

130
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,247
I was wiping my mouth.

131
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,042
No, you weren't. You were practicing.

132
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,168
For who?

133
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,963
- Is there a boy?
- No!

134
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,009
Doesn't matter how much you
practice, you don't have time for boys.

135
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,430
What about keyboards?

136
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,641
Okay, so you know that guy Ricky
I told you about?

137
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,102
- The keyboard player?
- Yeah, who lives four streets down.

138
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,563
- So, where is he now?
- I tried to get him, but he said no.

139
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,316
You're telling me
about a guy you can't get.

140
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,609
Dad, I tried.

141
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
Why'd he say no?

142
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,990
Well, he came in to audition one time,
a long time ago.

143
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,243
You're gonna throw it.

144
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,953
Okay, fine.

145
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,747
Throw it.

146
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,709
Oh!

147
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,430
Hi, I'm Rick.
I'm looking for Selena y Los Dinos.

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,439
<i>I guess
he didn't get the best impression.</i>

149
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
<i>He didn't think we were serious.</i>

150
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,986
But that was years ago.
I can go back at him.

151
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,071
Do that.

152
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,614
Okay.

153
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,743
Where have you been?
We need to practice, Selena.

154
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,536
Selena was practicing in her room.

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,080
But not "Con Esta Copa."

156
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,873
Wait, why?

157
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,583
Because I did it with Los Dinos.

158
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,293
Yeah, and you guys killed with it.

159
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,004
I'm gonna tell Manny Guerra
we wanna make a big hit record

160
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,088
on his new label.

161
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,801
And I can't tell him
the only thing we have

162
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,678
are old songs from my Los Dinos days.

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
I have an idea.

164
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,641
- What?
- The new songs.

165
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
Yes, new songs.

166
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,895
Like what?

167
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,647
Something upbeat, like…

168
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,524
Jet or Janet Jackson.

169
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
You mean something English?

170
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,944
- Yes.
- No.

171
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,030
Maybe down the road,
but Manny produces Tejano bands.

172
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,490
To him, that's what we are.

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,160
And that's why I'm trying
to get Luis Silva.

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,455
Look, I made a list of all the hit songs

175
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,379
from all the Tejano records
and who wrote them.

176
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,835
Luis Silva, Luis Silva, Luis Silva…

177
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,628
he wrote, like, 75% of them.

178
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,256
So, do you have Luis Silva?

179
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,761
Well, I called and left messages.
I wrote him a letter, but no answer.

180
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,182
And you're just gonna wait
for him to call you back?

181
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,686
I was.

182
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,855
You think he will?

183
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,733
Probably not.

184
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,402
Hmm.

185
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,697
And where do you think
Luis Silva's gonna be this week?

186
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,283
San Antonio, the Tejano Music Awards?

187
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,704
And where do you think I'm going to talk
to Manny Guerra?

188
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
- San Antonio.
- Hmm.

189
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,052
Listen to me, all of you.

190
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,890
If you stand around
and wait for what you want,

191
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,101
you're gonna be waiting
your whole life.

192
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,813
Now, whether it's a keyboard player
or Luis Silva,

193
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,648
you have to go and get it.

194
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,445
Do that, we get to the next level.

195
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
Don't…

196
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,991
we keep playing weddings.

197
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,971
Ay! That old van.
Are you sure it'll last a week?

198
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,767
People said the same thing
about you and me, but here we are.

199
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,810
Mom, take us to the store?

200
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,729
I have an idea for new band outfits.

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,815
One store. That's all.

202
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,784
AB, come out here and help!

203
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Coming!

204
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,668
<i>♪ Ta! ♪</i>

205
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,964

209
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,024

210
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>♪ Too shy-shy, hush-hush… ♪</i>

211
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,030
How much is that?

212
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,665
<i>Welcome to the Tejano Music Awards.</i>

213
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>Nominated in four categories,</i>

214
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>here are the lead vocalists
from Grupo Mazz,</i>

215
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,131
<i>Joe Lopez and Jimmy Gonzalez.</i>

216
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,305
Who's the designer?

217
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,104
Who are you wearing tonight?

218
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,069
Mr. Silva! Mr. Silva!

219
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,864
Mr. Silva!

220
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,876
- Hey, there he is.
- Manny.

221
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,547
You're looking good, my friend.

222
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,882
So are you.

223
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,967
I wanted to, uh…

224
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,262
to come and see
this new company you made. Wow.

225
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,264
It's very small, very modest.

226
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,641
Only a matter of time.

227
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,976
And I wanted to tell you in person,

228
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,313
Selena y Los Dinos will not record
with anyone else.

229
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,898
Abraham…

230
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,486
You were the first to believe in us.
I wanna be loyal to you.

231
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,695
And I'm honored…

232
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,239
but I'm just starting out, and…

233
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,367
I don't have the promotional budget
<i>you </i>deserve.

234
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,454
We do our own promotions.
You know that. I book the tours myself.

235
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,665
The money for production is very low.

236
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,458
Manny.

237
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,876
Abraham.

238
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,131
Mr. Silva, AB Quintanilla.

239
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,257
My hands are wet.

240
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,680
Um, I called you, left messages.

241
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,473
Selena y Los Dinos?

242
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
Right.

243
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,521
Sorry, I get called
by a lot of bands just starting out.

244
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,022
We're not just starting out.

245
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,650
You know us.
We've been performing for six years.

246
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,299
Manny Guerra's gonna make us
the first artist on his new label.

247
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,908
Manny Guerra? Really?

248
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
He's with my father right now.

249
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,078
They're hammering out the deal.

250
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,123
Manny, we made a couple songs together.

251
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,251
How about we make a record?

252
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,919
You know I'm spending my own money now?

253
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,619
- And you know I love you.
- I don't need you to love me.

254
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,673
Abraham.

255
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,426
I need you to make a record.

256
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,428
And I need to come out of the gate
with a hit.

257
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,762
We're gonna give you a hit.

258
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,931
- With someone established, not...
- Not what?

259
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,599
A bunch of kids.

260
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,018
Kids?

261
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,312
I've seen you.

262
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,025
I'm 23. Our drummer's 19.

263
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,651
And Selena's a teenager.

264
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,381
But you'd only know that if you see her,
and you don't need to see her.

265
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,325
All you gotta do
is get her played for the radio,

266
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,967
where everyone's the same age,
except she's better than they are.

267
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,953
People love Selena.

268
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,874
She's a star. You know that.

269
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,460
You know that she's a star.

270
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,630
And you left all your stars behind
at Cara Records,

271
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,050
so what you need right now…

272
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,801
is Selena,

273
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,220
a couple of Luis Silva songs,

274
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,181
and that's gonna put you back on top.

275
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,268
I have to go.
They're almost at my category.

276
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,437
Just give us a couple of songs.

277
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,776
Kid, I have won
song of the year two times in a row,

278
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,486
maybe three by now.

279
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,946
I wouldn't know
because I'm out here with you.

280
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,450
It matters who I give a song to now.

281
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,534
Sorry.

282
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,245
Mr. Silva!

283
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
Do you have Luis Silva songs?

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,167
Who do you think my son, AB,
is meeting with

285
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,002
right now, this very minute?

286
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,170
Mr. Silva!

287
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,634
Look, every single person in that room
was where I am right now

288
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,053
and where you were once yourself,

289
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,138
getting no, after no, after no.

290
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,849
Until, one day, someone said yes.

291
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,941
One song.

292
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,943
I need three.

293
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,906
You're gonna have to sign
an exclusive deal with me.

294
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,575
- Bring me the contract, I'll sign it.
- I'm just starting out.

295
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,327
Bring me the contract.

296
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,169
Two songs.

297
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,426
<i>♪ I'm your Venus, I'm your fire ♪</i>

298
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,011
<i>♪ At your desire… ♪</i>

299
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,766
You missed a spot right there, sis.

300
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,894
- One album.
- One album.

301
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,230
<i>Well, Mom, how do we look?</i>

302
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,357
I think you look like a band.

303
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,837
I said after the last time
I gave her her work early,

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,172
it would be the last.

305
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,590
Why?

306
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,760
Principal said we could do it this way
if she did her work and turned it in.

307
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,223
And at first, it was only occasionally,
and I didn't mind it.

308
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,936
But now Selena is out every Friday,
every Monday, and…

309
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,897
and now, sometimes Thursdays.

310
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,316
We're traveling farther
the more that the band gets known.

311
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,319
Oh, and that's great for the band,

312
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,905
but my concern is for the child.

313
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,825
- Does she get good grades?
- Yes.

314
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,952
So she can read? She can do math?

315
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
Selena is very bright.

316
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,331
So what's the problem?

317
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,957
She's never here.

318
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,001
There are laws.

319
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,086
You can't just drop out of school.

320
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,839
She's not dropping out.
When she's not working, she's in school.

321
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,717
I wouldn't use working as an excuse.

322
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,346
Don't tell me how to raise my daughter.
I know what's best for her.

323
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,891
And it's my job to make sure
every child enrolled

324
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,851
in this grade is in class,

325
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,104
not riding all over Texas
in the back of some van.

326
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,564
- Fine.
- Abraham.

327
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
She's out.

328
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,526
I decide what is best for my daughter.

329
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,611
You don't.

330
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
Thank you.

331
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,629
I like 'em. What do you think?

332
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,967
You know he gave you songs
that other bands rejected, right?

333
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,510
I don't care.

334
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,970
Luis Silva's worst song

335
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,305
is 100% better than anyone else's best.

336
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,059
I like 'em.

337
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,063
And guess what.

338
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,108
When I said that we got Luis Silva,

339
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,568
Ricky Vela said yes
to playing on the keyboards.

340
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,364
So make arrangements for the songs.
We'll start rehearsing.

341
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,159
Hey, Dad.

342
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,870
Can I go to Amarillo next week
to do Hands Across America?

343
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,871
What for?

344
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,375
A really good cause. A chain of people
hold hands against hunger.

345
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,878
And now that I'm not going to school
anymore, I wanna see my friends.

346
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,298
Your commitment to the band comes first.
You know that.

347
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,009
Okay, then, can we do a show in Amarillo?

348
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,386
You can hold hands with Suzette
across the living room.

349
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,304
Dad.

350
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,057
There are hungry kids that really need me.
I really wanna do something to help.

351
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,559
Hey, I'm against hunger too.

352
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,104
Ours. That's why we're going to Laredo.

353
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,069
We can't get a break.
We never get a break.

354
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,353
- Who was on the phone?
- It was Luis Silva's secretary.

355
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,532
She said he made a mistake
in giving us the songs.

356
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,200
He promised them to another band.

357
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,870
That's a lie. He just found
a bigger band to give them to.

358
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,831
I know, Dad. It's a lie.
But now we can't use them anymore.

359
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,877
We don't have any songs.

360
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,734
<i>New developments
in the Challenger explosion today</i>

361
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,820
<i>as the Rogers Commission began looking
into the failure of O-rings</i>

362
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,405
<i>as a possible cause.</i>

363
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,990
- Can we change this?
- No.

364
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,909
Dinner's ready.

365
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,802
Selena, go get your brother.

366
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,563
AB.

367
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,903
I get it.

368
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,698
I know it feels
like nothing's going our way.

369
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,370
Feels like we have to
give up everything for the band.

370
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,208
Doesn't matter if we wanna
save the world or be normal

371
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,294
and go to movie with somebody cute
every once in a while.

372
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,176
But when I think about being on stage

373
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,806
and you on the bass and Suzette
on the drums, nothing else matters.

374
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,102
Except that warm feeling
of making music with you guys.

375
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,729
I know you feel it too.

376
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,402
Okay.

377
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,488
I'll be here for you, okay?

378
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,532
Always.

379
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,937
I think we leave him alone, okay?

380
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,585
What are you moping about?

381
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,635
My life.

382
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,687
I don't have any songs.

383
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,898
I have no job.

384
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,900
No money.

385
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,361
No girlfriend, no car.

386
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,115
All I wanted was a song good enough…

387
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,660
to hear us on the radio.

388
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,414
But I failed.

389
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,625
And I let the family down.

390
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,589
Ah, <i>mijito.</i>

391
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,685
What is a songwriter?

392
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,854
What?

393
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,441
What is a songwriter?

394
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,446
Someone who writes songs.

395
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
And Luis Silva…

396
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,742
he writes songs.

397
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,826
Yeah.

398
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,830
Is he a man?

399
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,416
Yeah.

400
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,420
Are you a man?

401
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,504
Yes.

402
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,131
He has a brain.

403
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,758
You have a brain.

404
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,761
You're a musician.

405
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,141
So write a song.

406
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,438
- Me?
- Yes, you.

407
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
When you get knocked down,

408
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,651
you stand back up,

409
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,737
brush your knees off and keep going.

410
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,073
<i>Mijo,</i> you know what to do.

411
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,658
Figure it out.

412
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,119
And don't stop
until you write us a hit song.

413
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,290
Hey.

414
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,503
You've got this, son.

415
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,217
Let's go eat.

416
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,857
<i>So that's what I'm saying.</i>

417
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:19,322
The music is the separate parts
all playing together,

418
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,742
but also each one of you listening

419
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,869
to what everyone else is playing.

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,477
- I like it.
- Yeah.

421
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,103
Melody's great.

422
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,148
I need words, though.

423
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,316
It's hard, Ricky.

424
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,652
I get why the Champs
finally gave up and yelled "Tequila!"

425
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,863
I can help you with whatever you want.

426
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,698
Good, because I know
you've written songs.

427
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,868
But just straight-up Tejano stuff.

428
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,871
Women and drinking and fighting…

429
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,374
I know. No one wants to hear a 15-year-old
sing about women and drinking.

430
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,709
I know I don't.

431
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,254
Yeah, but I also don't just have to sing
about being a teenager.

432
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,589
I can do more than that.

433
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,802
- You know, I'm not a kid anymore.
- Oh, you'll always be a kid to me.

434
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,469
Mom.

435
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,597
Look, I can help with the band.

436
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,307
I could design our look.

437
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,601
And I can help you write songs.

438
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,063
You know that song "Bésame Mucho"?

439
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,524
I love that song.

440
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,820
You know, your father used
to sing that to me when we first met.

441
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,825
Consuelo Velázquez wrote it
when she was 16 years old.

442
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,493
- No.
- Yeah.

443
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,372
It's a song about a kiss,
and she'd never even been kissed before.

444
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,083
Selena can definitely sing about that.

445
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
Stop it.

446
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,047
- What are you smiling about?
- No reason.

447
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,215
Uh-oh.

448
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,301
A little smile for no reason?

449
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,345
Always trouble.

450
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:53,518
Ugh! Stop!

451
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,567
And then on the third
when the chorus comes in.

452
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,902
- That way it sounds stronger, right?
- Yeah.

453
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,296
- Switch it up.
- Try it like that.

454
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,154
- Okay.
- That works.

455
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,531
- Perfect, okay.
- All right.

456
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,700
Yeah.

457
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,120
- There it is. Yeah.
- Ah, okay.

- You ever miss that?
<i>- </i>What?

490
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,203
Just being a teenager,

491
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,789
running around on a Saturday night
instead of working?

492
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,207
It doesn't feel like work.

493
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,459
No?

494
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,796
I guess when that's all you've done,
it must feel normal.

495
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,715
- That's her!
- Selena, hi!

496
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
Selena!

497
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,676
I mean…

498
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,013
sometimes, I guess, it'd be fun
to just go out with other kids, but…

499
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,849
during the week, nobody goes out and…

500
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,602
on the weekends,
we have shows, which is fine.

501
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,314
Well, I just want you to be happy.

502
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,857
I am.

503
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,108
I am!

504
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:38,910
<i>…new single "Dame Un Beso"
by a local band called Selena y Los Dinos.</i>

505
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,798
Dad.

506
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,657
I just heard "Dame Un Beso."
They're playing it on the radio.

507
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,471
So? Lots of bands have one hit.

508
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,680
Where's your next one?

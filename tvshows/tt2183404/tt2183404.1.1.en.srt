1
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,113
Turn around.
Take your pants off for me.

2
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:14,065
Pull your underpants
down for me.

3
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:18,976
Turn around.

4
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,886
Now, bend over.

5
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:26,757
All right... get up.

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,024
Turn back around.

7
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,631
We're moving to
the holding cell.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,209
Uh, these are
for you, Daniel.

9
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,382
I'm supposed to take
your prison clothes.

10
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:13,844
Would you like
somethin' to drink?

11
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,882
What?

12
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:22,623
When I come back, I could
bring you somethin' to drink.

13
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,924
A Coke.

14
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,827
Ice?

15
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,064
Sure.

16
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:05,153
I don't know why you
wouldn't ride with us.

17
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,484
Something seemed karmically
wrong about that, mother.

18
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,578
Well, we're late, karma or not.

19
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,926
So, have your ID ready and
take off all your jewelry.

20
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,962
I've been there a lot
more than you lately.

21
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:15,831
I know the drill.

22
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,900
Ted, Jr's calling in.

23
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:19,001
Ha, what?

24
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:21,904
Does he wanna stop at
7-11 for a ding dong?

25
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:24,741
We'll see you there, Amantha.

26
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,042
Hey.

27
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,010
Hey, mama.

28
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:28,178
Tell dad he better pick it up.

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,213
It's gonna suck if we're
late for this thing.

30
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:32,649
Ted, Teddy says pick it up.

31
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,217
Um, Teddy?

32
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,219
Yeah, mama?

33
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,954
Could you call me Janet?

34
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,955
What?

35
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,324
Just for a while, just until
Daniel gets used to all

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,527
the changes and everything.

37
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:50,336
She wants us to call
her Janet for a while.

38
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,673
I can't imagine what
she's going through, right now.

39
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,608
Don't assume it's all good.

40
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,343
What do you mean?

41
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,679
Sheriff still believes
he was in on it.

42
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,747
A lot of people do.

43
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,649
Well, you don't think that, do
you, that he could've done

44
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,250
somethin' that horrible to her?

45
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,052
Well, I sure did.

46
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,121
I mean, he was convicted.

47
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:11,057
What would a rational person
think all these years?

48
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,655
Now, hell, I don't know.

49
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:15,020
I never even met the guy.

50
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,854
I still don't understand.

51
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:17,788
Come on, Tawney.

52
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,855
What was I supposed to do?

53
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,557
Go down to death row
and introduce myself?

54
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,427
"Hi, I'm Ted... I'm, uh,
your new stepbrother, and

55
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,729
I'm gonna be takin' over the
business you thought would be

56
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,097
yours one day."

57
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,600
I mean, why torture the guy?

58
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:37,438
I hate to say it, but we all thought
he'd be dead by now anyway.

59
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,237
Hey, Amantha.

60
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,439
Where are you?

61
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,707
Closer by the day.

62
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,942
Uh, if you don't get here
soon, I may have to recruit

63
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:01,211
some people from the crowd
to play the family.

64
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,547
At least pick people who
are glad he's still alive.

65
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:04,782
I'll take a poll.

66
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,750
Have you seen him yet?

67
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,218
No, not yet.

68
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,453
But, he got the suit?

69
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,988
I was assured he did.

70
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,090
God, I hope I don't fall apart.

71
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:15,359
It's okay if you do.

72
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,333
Are you kidding me?

73
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,369
What?

74
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,403
What, Jon?

75
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,506
Roland Foulkes just showed up.

76
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,741
How ya
doin' today... Joel.

77
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:33,042
Son of a bitch.

78
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,410
So nice to see you.

79
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:35,712
Hi, how are you?

80
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,280
I'll have a comment after.

81
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:39,048
So nice to see you, again.

82
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:47,357
They say it's pretty
crazy out there.

83
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,426
Where's your tie?

84
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:53,664
Uh, I couldn't remember.

85
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,898
Remember?

86
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,968
How to tie it.

87
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,905
It's, uh, a Windsor knot.
I think.

88
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,441
Hey, man, I could
tie it for you.

89
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,311
I mean, I don't know if it's a
Windsor, but it's the kind

90
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,413
I do on me, for church.

91
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,280
Tie it on me.

92
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:13,217
Then, we transfer it to you.

93
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,954
Almost two decades ago, I
prosecuted a case where

94
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:23,259
Miss Hannah Abigail Dean was
brutally raped and murdered.

95
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,763
DNA testing on material sitting
in some box in an evidence room

96
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:31,568
all these years is not gonna change
that fact or bring that girl back.

97
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,406
We must remember that she was
only 16 years old, a mere child,

98
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:41,379
with her whole life ahead of
her, and that life was taken

99
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:47,385
in the most heinous manner I
personally have ever seen.

100
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,821
Sources are
reporting that Mr. Holden is

101
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:52,990
still considered a suspect,
in spite of the DNA results.

102
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:57,295
Well, I'm sure our current DA
will address some of these complex

103
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:01,065
procedural questions this new breed
of lawyer loves to go on about.

104
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:05,203
I'm just here to remind ya'll
of a few things that seem

105
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,372
to have gotten lost
in this DNA hysteria.

106
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:12,276
Daniel Holden confessed
to raping Hannah.

107
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,579
He confessed to killing Hannah.

108
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:19,984
Now, where I come from, we put a lot
of stock in that sort of thing.

109
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:26,157
And please-please, don't-don't
report that he was exonerated.

110
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,694
The sentence was vacated on
a technicality, which sure

111
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:33,164
as hell does not make
him an innocent man.

112
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:43,040
I don't know who picked out your tie,
but... they sure have style.

113
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:49,480
- There was nothing to...
- Technicality my ass.

114
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,881
It wasn't his sperm.

115
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,783
Senator is just doing
what he does best.

116
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:53,717
Stay on message.

117
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:54,484
Keep it simple.

118
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:55,419
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

119
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:57,087
Ever heard of forced
confession, asshole?

120
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:57,955
Amantha, please?

121
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,690
I should just walk over there
and kill him, right now.

122
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,459
They can take me
straight to death row.

123
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,159
Skip the middle man.

124
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,362
Just remember, everything we do
is being watched and judged.

125
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,064
Can I at least
flip him the bird?

126
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:06,964
No.

127
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,300
Everyone can say their
hellos to Daniel, briefly.

128
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,673
And then, we have to go straight
to the press conference.

129
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,612
Hellos and
introductions, you mean?

130
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:15,948
I don't know why these
two are even here.

131
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,949
Ahem.

132
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,384
More family looks better.

133
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,153
Remember, just because he's
getting out doesn't mean

134
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,621
this thing is over yet.

135
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,456
At least look like
you give two shits.

136
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,392
Amantha, please.

137
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,787
That suit fits you perfect.

138
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,423
Goddamn... I mean, perfect.

139
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,625
You are perfect, brother.

140
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,895
You are so damn perfect.

141
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,940
Hello, Daniel.

142
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,977
Hello, mother.

143
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,646
Oh!

144
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:18,314
Oh!

145
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,283
Oh, God!

146
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,096
My sweetheart.

147
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:46,076
We are not here to
play politics today.

148
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,747
We are here because Daniel
Holden was convicted of

149
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:54,085
murder and sentenced to death.

150
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:57,989
We are here because of the
perverse miracle that Daniel is

151
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:02,527
still alive, and because of the
outright fluke that crucial

152
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:09,133
DNA evidence was not lost, or
thrown away, or destroyed.

153
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:11,836
We are here because the
DNA testing conclusively

154
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:15,507
disputes that there was a
sole perpetrator, or that

155
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:20,078
the sole perpetrator was Daniel
Holden, as the State had claimed.

156
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,714
Let's hope that the prosecution
and politicians go after

157
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:28,286
the real killers, instead of going
after an innocent man a second time.

158
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,622
Daniel?

159
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:41,899
Hello.

160
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:48,506
I'm not sure what to make of this
drastic change of course in my life.

161
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,842
I'm certainly not against it.

162
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:59,183
Over the past two decades,
I have developed a strict

163
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:05,723
routine, which I followed religiously,
you might say, a way of living

164
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:09,627
and-and thinking, or not
thinking, as was often

165
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,498
the point of, well, the point.

166
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,337
Now, this way of being didn't
encourage the contemplation that

167
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,641
a day like today could ever
occur, or a tomorrow like

168
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:28,680
tomorrow w-will be for me now.

169
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:32,617
I had convinced myself, that
kind of optimism served

170
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:38,357
no useful purpose in the
world where I existed.

171
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:41,693
Obviously, this radical
belief system was flawed,

172
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:49,802
and was, ironically, a
kind of fantasy itself.

173
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:55,141
At the least, I feel that those
specific coping skills were

174
00:10:55,143 --> 00:11:01,681
best suited to the
life there behind me.

175
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:06,320
I doubt they will serve me so
well for the life in front of me.

176
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:10,590
So, I will seriously need to
reconsider my world view.

177
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:22,469
Uh, now would be a good
time to thank everyone.

178
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,205
Yes, thank you.

179
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:27,007
There are many people to thank.

180
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,345
M-m-my mother and sister
for their enduring love,

181
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,914
devotion, and faith.

182
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,873
You gettin' carsick, Danny?

183
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,944
What?

184
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:43,918
I-I don't know.

185
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,455
I feel sleepy, and
I don't know why.

186
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,390
Go to sleep, then.

187
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:52,759
Why not?

188
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,728
I'll keep both hands
on the wheel.

189
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,730
Hey.

190
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,944
He fell asleep?

191
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,815
Like a rock, almost the whole
way, right into the garage.

192
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,316
So, he didn't see the town?

193
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,384
Anything?

194
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,988
Not even the expanded
Dollar Store.

195
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,359
Hand me the peas, dear.

196
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,768
Mom?

197
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,403
Did you check the roast?

198
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,871
I did.

199
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:04,009
Mom, what happened to you
today was okay, you know?

200
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,746
It was a long time
comin', mother.

201
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,149
For God's sake,
it's normal, mom.

202
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,984
How is any of this normal?

203
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,152
How?

204
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,187
Nothing about this has ever
been normal, Amantha,

205
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,689
and it never will be.

206
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,693
And I would like to just not
talk about it for a little bit.

207
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,597
I would like to
simply make supper.

208
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,033
Sure, mom.

209
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,901
Hello?

210
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,336
Anybody in here?

211
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,905
Just us chickens!

212
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,774
Ah, here's my buddy.

213
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,309
Oh!

214
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,411
Don't I get one?

215
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:45,082
Don't I get one?

216
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,251
There's one for you, too.

217
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,354
Take what I can get.

218
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,230
Where is he?

219
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,032
He's in the house, right?

220
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,768
He's upstairs taking
a bath, Jared.

221
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,669
Oh, that's cool.

222
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,939
Mmm-hmm... yeah.

223
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,788
Knees, 4870.

224
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,866
Up.

225
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:10,939
Move it, 4870.

226
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:19,447
Get up, 4870.

227
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:32,061
Won't be killin' three-year-old
girls in here now, will ya?

228
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,465
Three-year-old?

229
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,801
Damn, voodoo.

230
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:39,469
I like your style.

231
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,839
Hope you didn't blow your
wad on the first date.

232
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,107
Shut up!

233
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,942
Can't take it anymore!

234
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:49,145
Try and tune that out.

235
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:51,481
We'll talk later.

236
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:54,083
Compare notes and such.

237
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:31,654
Dear Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this most

238
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:36,124
wonderful day, for this miracle
you've bestowed upon us,

239
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:39,461
for this deliverance of
Daniel back into our home.

240
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:41,764
We ask for your wisdom, as
we go forward into the

241
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:45,601
uncertainty of the days ahead,
that you bless this food for

242
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:49,905
the nourishment of our bodies,
and forgive us of our sins.

243
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,173
In Jesus' name, we pray.

244
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,341
Amen.

245
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,977
Amen.

246
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:57,947
Very nice, Ted.

247
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,281
Very nice, Ted.

248
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,150
Thank you, Daniel.

249
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:03,586
Very nice, Ted.

250
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,191
- Well...
- Sure looks good.

251
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,359
What do you think, buddy?

252
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:11,460
Looks tasty, mom.

253
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:15,164
Thank you, Jared.

254
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,066
Can I have your plate, Danny?

255
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,469
Sure.

256
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:29,213
Danny, you gotta try
this cornbread.

257
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:32,716
There's an end piece
down there somewhere.

258
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:35,118
Looks great.

259
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,420
Thank you, Jared.

260
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,155
You're welcome.

261
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,857
Here's some corn.

262
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:42,326
Are you okay?

263
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,784
I'm not checking on
you or anything.

264
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,786
I just came outside
for a smoke.

265
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:13,589
Do you wanna be left alone?

266
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,658
I can go smoke in the backyard.

267
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,228
I don't know.

268
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:25,402
Well, you wanna do
anything later?

269
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:28,404
Play hearts, or...

270
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,374
I don't know.

271
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:34,376
Go to town.

272
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,911
Okay.

273
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:40,048
See it at first when it's
not so bright, you know?

274
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,784
Of course, honey.

275
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,189
Five times during his
incarceration, Mr. Holden

276
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:51,560
has been scheduled to die, but
each time, his execution

277
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,028
was stayed due to appeal.

278
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,396
Damn.

279
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:58,801
Give me another slice, babe.

280
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,237
There is a lot to
process, right now.

281
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,374
Uh, I'll probably
be happier later.

282
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,843
It's almost like he's playing
for laughs, sometimes.

283
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:08,378
I don't think so.

284
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,114
He just sees
things differently.

285
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:14,951
Perhaps I will be angrier
later, as I will be happier.

286
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:15,919
I'm tired of watching this.

287
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,187
See what else is on.

288
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,189
No, don't!

289
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:21,090
Damn, I was just kidding.

290
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,192
How does it feel to be outside?

291
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:24,027
Free.

292
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:27,997
What'd you think when you
first saw your family?

293
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:31,701
Thought of family, uh, "we."

294
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:35,204
Where'd they go?

295
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:38,107
Just ridin' around.

296
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,943
I feel he should have
his room back, mom.

297
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:43,045
No, Jared.
That's your room now.

298
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,415
Yeah, but it's not like
he went off to college.

299
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,218
Jared, Daniel wanted
you to have his room.

300
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,519
He told you that?

301
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,988
Yes, a long time ago.

302
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,992
It made him very happy to
know you were in there.

303
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,361
He didn't hardly say
anything tonight.

304
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:02,797
Well, he doesn't
know how to, honey.

305
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,866
I kinda don't, either.

306
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,935
Nobody does.

307
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:09,871
We'll just all learn together.

308
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:12,407
Okay?

309
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,612
This way of being didn't encourage
the contemplation that a day

310
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,816
like today could ever occur.

311
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:22,818
Look at him.

312
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,654
You tell me he didn't
kill that girl.

313
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,755
He killed her.

314
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:29,825
Yeah, but there's a little bit
of a hole in the case, now.

315
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,195
They've got multiple semen
samples, and the only sample

316
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,697
they can single out
was not Holden.

317
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,499
Son of a bitch confessed, CJ.

318
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,633
Remember?

319
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:38,867
Yeah, I remember.

320
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,736
Then why in the hell would a
person confess to somethin'

321
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:42,004
they didn't do?

322
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,707
You've had 19 years to
think on that, and you

323
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,943
ain't figured out an answer
other than he did it?

324
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,745
Meaning what?

325
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:54,083
One of those boys saw Holden on top
of that girl, forcin' himself.

326
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,486
But, without a definite hit on
his sperm, those witnesses

327
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:00,823
ain't gonna be quite as
solid this time, are they?

328
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,525
And they might
even be suspects.

329
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:06,529
We know that, CJ, and nobody's
decidin' anything, right now.

330
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:07,797
Decidin' what?

331
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,032
Don't the DA
have a say in this?

332
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:11,800
She's gonna be brought in.

333
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,403
But, not tonight?

334
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:17,606
No.

335
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:20,742
Look, it's reasonable to think
a couple of them other boys

336
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:23,545
coulda had intercourse with her.

337
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:25,313
Doesn't mean they killed her.

338
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:27,916
Doesn't mean they didn't.

339
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,591
Is this, like, weird?

340
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,795
It's not unweird.

341
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:44,399
How long has that video
store been there?

342
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:48,370
Was there about 15 years.

343
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:50,239
Was?

344
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:53,242
Shut down about a year ago.

345
00:22:56,814 --> 00:23:01,784
Hey, we can go to the
Target in Mansfield.

346
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:03,586
What's the Target?

347
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:06,122
You are.

348
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,459
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,094
I'm sorry.

350
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,128
I-I don't know why I said that.

351
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,698
It just came out.

352
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,301
You're a funny, sister.

353
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,702
Oh, good.

354
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:21,438
You got it.

355
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,043
That's kinda how I deal.

356
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:27,344
God loves humor.

357
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:28,879
Exactly.

358
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,949
Of course, you would know
about that, wouldn't you?

359
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,152
I mean, God!

360
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,854
I did it, again.

361
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,990
Mmm-hmm.

362
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:46,497
We call it lethal injection humor...
more humane, but not as funny.

363
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,635
She was his girlfriend.

364
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:53,870
Gives him even more motive.
Can you not see that?

365
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,772
Carl.

366
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:04,613
Nobody wants to open this
back up, CJ, all the pain.

367
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:08,284
But, that's no reason
to let a killer walk.

368
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:11,854
I've got doubts he
is the killer, now.

369
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:16,826
But, are they reasonable doubts?

370
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:27,003
Just forget about the
confession for a minute.

371
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:31,007
He was found sitting beside the
girl's corpse, just holding

372
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,544
her hand, speaking gibberish
half the time, and the other

373
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,981
half saying how sorry he was.

374
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:44,020
He didn't go get help.

375
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:46,989
He didn't scream out.

376
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:51,962
He spent the morning gathering
wildflowers to put in her hair, CJ.

377
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:55,432
And I was the one who found
him with her, remember?

378
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:57,968
I remember.

379
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:03,407
I just wanna make
sure you remember.

380
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,476
Well, what do you
want from me, Roland?

381
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,311
Just tell me.

382
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:11,849
CJ, we just wanna know, if Holden's
re-indicted by the new DA...

383
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:14,718
I'm retired, remember?

384
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,523
You might have to testify, at
some point, grand jury and all.

385
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,992
No shit.

386
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:23,493
Mistakes were made, CJ.

387
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:26,029
No doubt about it.

388
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:30,466
We've all made mistakes in
our own individual lives,

389
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:35,238
things we regret, do different.

390
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,941
That's beside the point,
whether Holden is the killer,

391
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:42,512
which I believe, deep
in my heart he is.

392
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:47,883
I couldn't have lived with myself all
these years otherwise, could you?

393
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:50,319
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let him get away with it now,

394
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:54,257
just because we tried to protect
an innocent girl's reputation,

395
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:58,161
and so as to spare her
mother even more pain.

396
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,966
I'll review the case.

397
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:13,010
Try and get everything
straight in my mind, again.

398
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:19,383
Where's Holden at anyway?

399
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:21,786
At his mama's.

400
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,023
He's not movin'
back here, is he?

401
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,658
Don't know.

402
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,928
Lord-lord-lord.

403
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,064
No matter how you slice
it, I sometimes wonder

404
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:36,635
if this is ever goin' away.

405
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,737
Hmm?

406
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,666
Hello.

407
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:55,301
Hey, it's after 12.

408
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:56,436
I know.

409
00:26:56,438 --> 00:26:57,804
What are ya'll doin'?

410
00:26:57,806 --> 00:27:00,339
Just-just drivin' around.

411
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:02,041
Why are you whispering?

412
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:04,177
Daniel's asleep.

413
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,180
Well, are you gonna
drive around all night?

414
00:27:08,182 --> 00:27:09,848
Probably not.

415
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,417
I'm not gonna worry, then.

416
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,353
No, go on to sleep.

417
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:26,065
I'm not breakin'
the law, asshole.

418
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:46,653
What, are we in high school?

419
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:49,289
Are you kiddin' me?

420
00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:00,295
You like?

421
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:03,265
It's, um...

422
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:10,606
I just wanted it to be
special for ya, honey.

423
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:13,976
I would say you succeeded.

424
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,550
Thank you, Amantha,
for everything.

425
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,854
You're quite welcome, brother.

426
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:26,956
Anytime.

427
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,432
We're lost, aren't we?

428
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:38,634
Totally.

429
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:44,506
Sorry I'm late.

430
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:45,540
Mmm-hmm.

431
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,607
Couldn't sleep last night.

432
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:47,842
I was wound up like a top.

433
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,510
Yep.

434
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:53,714
Me and Tawney got
in a big fight.

435
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,583
You see all that coverage?

436
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,419
Some of it.

437
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,721
Boy, it's controversial, huh?

438
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:01,956
It's that.

439
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:08,362
So, when is he gonna
start workin' here?

440
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:10,831
Whenever he wants to.

441
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:17,204
Dad, the minute he steps foot in
this store, at least half the people

442
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,639
who do business here
are gonna stop coming.

443
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,009
I'm aware of that.

444
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:25,979
A 50% cut in revenue is not
gonna support two households.

445
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:27,347
I'm aware of that, too.

446
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,252
- Look, maybe if we explained
the situation... - No, sir.

447
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:34,320
Dad, he deserves to have all
the information to make

448
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:35,188
an informed decision.

449
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,257
Absolutely not, Teddy.

450
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,059
Now, listen to me.

451
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:41,061
This is his family business.

452
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:42,062
It's not ours.

453
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,396
We just married into it.

454
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,766
Now, if he wants to come
work here, it's his right.

455
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:50,570
We can't put that kind of weight
on him, not with everything else

456
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:54,206
he's had to deal
with in his life.

457
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,377
Well, I might as well start
lookin' for a new job, right now.

458
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:16,729
"Of Human Bondage".

459
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:18,497
"Of Human Bondage"?

460
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:22,668
You want me to read a book
called "Of Human Bondage"?

461
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,037
It's not that kind of bondage.

462
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,173
I would hope so.

463
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,810
Hey, will I be glad when you get
past your dead white man writin'

464
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:33,813
about white Europe stage.

465
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:36,182
I am on kind of a jag.

466
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:38,685
You oughta sprinkle in a
little "Arthur Arthur!"

467
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,920
Brother-brother
from time to time.

468
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:42,255
Okay, sure.

469
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,423
I got somethin' I think
you'll appreciate, too.

470
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:46,192
It ain't modern times, either.

471
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:50,463
It's about black folks owning slaves
in the South before the Civil War.

472
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:51,431
Curious.

473
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:55,701
Free men buyin' their
brothers and sisters for...

474
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:57,003
Hey, man, just read the book.

475
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,504
I'm hooked already.

476
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,842
Then, I'll give your dead Somerset
Maugham a shot when you're done.

477
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:04,645
But, if it don't grab me
early, I'm settin' it down.

478
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:07,814
No rules for a club
that's not a club.

479
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:26,199
My lawyer said he'd be more
optimistic about an appeal

480
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:30,003
if I hadn't done it.

481
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,305
How did you respond?

482
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,774
Just nodded, you know?

483
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:37,377
Less money they get paid, the
more sensitive they are.

484
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:41,915
So, well, hell, at least this
one comes by for a visit

485
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:45,486
every once in a while.

486
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:47,854
I don't know.

487
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:52,059
Maybe I oughta just
throw in the towel.

488
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:54,461
Shorten the exit.

489
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:57,264
I can't do time the
way you do it.

490
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,665
I don't do time.

491
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,600
That's what I'm talkin' about.

492
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:03,503
I can't do time by not doin'
time the way you do time.

493
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:06,005
All that cross-legged
shit just make me antsy.

494
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,374
Well, maybe if you didn't
judge the experience while

495
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:12,145
- it was happenin', then you...
- Man, shut up!

496
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:18,485
You know what's whack?

497
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,858
Lots of things.

498
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,663
Sittin' in this tomb, day after
day, puttin' up with this food,

499
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:32,900
puttin' up wit' your
pale, white ass.

500
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:41,510
What's whack is... I still
wanna live, every day.

501
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:45,014
What's that about?

502
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,249
Vitamin A deficiency.

503
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,896
You trip me out, D.

504
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:03,166
You trip me out, Kerwin.

505
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:15,379
Hungry?

506
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,881
I think I'd like a beer.

507
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:21,519
Oh, um, let's see.

508
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:24,088
Teddy usually has one
or two in the fridge.

509
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,490
Sometimes, he stops
by for a visit.

510
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:27,625
Here we go.

511
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:28,626
Would he mind?

512
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:30,194
Of course not.

513
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:32,396
Yeah.

514
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:41,072
I'm payin' bills.

515
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:45,643
Sit down, if you'd like.

516
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:56,355
Uh, I don't think I wanna
become computer literate...

517
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:59,392
or mobile phone
literate, either.

518
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:02,962
Might be a little
much, all at once.

519
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:20,747
I-I would like a television,
though, with a movie player,

520
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:24,117
a-a DVD player.

521
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,518
We can do that.

522
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,653
I'll pay you back, as
soon as I start work.

523
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,922
Don't be silly.

524
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,090
Okay.

525
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:36,262
No, I mean, we already
have one of those.

526
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,364
I see.

527
00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:54,780
Thank you for the books, mother.

528
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:58,818
Of course.

529
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,254
You know, I-I won't be
around here forever, mother.

530
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:04,190
What do you mean?

531
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,258
Well, at your house and Ted's.

532
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,896
This is your house, too, Daniel...
you can stay as long as you like.

533
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:15,801
Well, I can't quite get a handle
on the concept of time yet.

534
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:18,704
There have been moments here
today where I feel like

535
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:27,113
I've only been gone a few weeks,
and I'm still in high school.

536
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:31,684
But mostly, it seems
like I was always there.

537
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:38,657
So, you may have to
tell me, mother.

538
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:40,992
Tell you?

539
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:45,161
When it's time for me to leave.

540
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:53,436
Hey, Jimmy.

541
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:54,203
How ya doin'?

542
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:54,871
Good.

543
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,272
- Hi, Senator.
- Good morning.

544
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,440
How are ya, sir?

545
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,141
Saw your speech, Senator.

546
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:00,676
But, I still don't understand
why they let him out,

547
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:01,610
if he said he did it.

548
00:37:01,612 --> 00:37:03,345
Oh, I'm as baffled
as you are, Lonny.

549
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,881
My advice is, let your feelings be
known to our current prosecutor.

550
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:11,118
A little heat might
get things cookin'.

551
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,754
Sheriff.

552
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:15,955
Where's your daddy?

553
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,589
He's got belly problems.

554
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,858
Who ain't?

555
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,260
Ain't you a sight for
sore eyes, Marcy?

556
00:37:22,262 --> 00:37:23,795
What'll you have, sweetie?

557
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:26,831
Everybody calls me Senator,
and you call me, "sweetie."

558
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,966
Well, that's 'cause I've known
you "sweetie" a lot longer

559
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:30,200
than I've known you "Senator."

560
00:37:30,202 --> 00:37:31,968
That's a fact.

561
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:37,004
I'll have a wildcat
breakfast, extra sausage.

562
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:41,675
Okay, you got it,
Senator... sweetie.

563
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,776
You ain't still
tappin' that, are ya?

564
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,145
No, I'm on the wagon.

565
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:48,047
Oh, extra biscuits, Marcy!

566
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:49,981
Thought you were havin'
belly problems, too.

567
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:51,416
Perception, Sheriff.

568
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,419
I'm gonna eat like a man
without a worry in the world.

569
00:37:56,956 --> 00:38:00,224
Have you seen today's
"Atlanta Journal?"

570
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:02,659
Two hours ago.

571
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:04,194
Your feelings hurt?

572
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:06,262
I'm tinkled pink.

573
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,097
Having the big city papers
attacking me down here

574
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,734
is a asset, not a liability.

575
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,642
You get a chance to speak
to those witnesses yet?

576
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:24,846
Wasn't sure if I should.

577
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:29,750
She'll wanna talk to
'em, madame prosecutor.

578
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,686
I'd imagine.

579
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:37,959
This is as messed up
as a pile of hangers.

580
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:16,764
A funny place
to have a reunion.

581
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,967
Not so funny.

582
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:23,070
How's Florida?

583
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:25,206
I don't care for it.

584
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,277
Where's your car, Georgie?

585
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,112
I took the bus.

586
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:35,348
Make sure I wasn't
being followed.

587
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,917
By who?

588
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:41,988
Now they know what
they didn't know.

589
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,824
Yes, kinda big news around here.

590
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:51,264
Did you kill her, Trey?

591
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,566
What?

592
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:56,469
No.

593
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,739
Did you, Georgie?

594
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,241
No.

595
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,714
He killed her.

596
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:09,816
How do you know?

597
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:12,686
It's the only thing
that makes sense to me.

598
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,223
I think about it a lot.

599
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,759
That's always been your problem.

600
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:22,495
We were just kids.

601
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:26,800
Wasn't real, you know?

602
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:34,908
What are you gonna do, Trey?

603
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,243
Tell the truth.

604
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:39,346
What is the truth?

605
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,621
Well, what's your point, Jon?

606
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:07,423
My point is that there
are 100 different ways

607
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:10,293
the prosecution can convince a
jury that Daniel did this,

608
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:12,761
no matter what the DNA
does or doesn't say.

609
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:13,729
Of course, they can.

610
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,630
That's what they do.

611
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,699
They're in the convincing
business, Jon.

612
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:20,268
First, they
convince themselves.

613
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,904
Then, they convince anybody
necessary, by any means

614
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:26,441
necessary, including sometimes
the defendants themselves.

615
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,944
All you have to do, if it
comes down to it, is to

616
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,346
convince one out of twelve
people in a jury that the

617
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:35,650
prosecutors are lying, cheating,
son of a bitch bastards!

618
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,626
I'm sorry.

619
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:48,296
Understandable.

620
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,365
How is Daniel doing, anyway?

621
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know.

622
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:55,403
I just wanna hug him all the time,
but I know it'd freak him out.

623
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:59,040
Maybe you can sneak
one in, occasionally.

624
00:41:59,042 --> 00:41:59,817
Why couldn't Ted, Jr. be

625
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:02,410
wrongly convicted and spend more
than half his life on death row?

626
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:04,478
He'd probably come out fine.

627
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,147
That might be a little harsh.

628
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,082
No, it's not.

629
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:10,218
I can't imagine you
and Ted, Jr. living in

630
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,953
the same house as adolescents.

631
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:15,189
We had to share a bathroom,
too... beyond gross.

632
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:16,023
Ew.

633
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:17,325
It's not funny.

634
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,059
No, of course not.

635
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:21,395
I need therapy just for
those three years alone.

636
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:23,030
Post Traumatic Ted Syndrome.

637
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:28,569
It's so under reported, too.

638
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:30,271
I'm coming down tomorrow.

639
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:33,574
Okay, but why so soon?

640
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:38,646
Rutherford Gaines has
pancreatic cancer.

641
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:39,813
Really?

642
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:42,416
I don't wanna regret not
asking him anything important.

643
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:44,051
The only thing I regret is
that he was Daniel's lawyer

644
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:46,286
in the first place.

645
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,821
Talk about a pussy.

646
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,890
Well, I think he
regrets that now, too.

647
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:54,394
Old man regrets... hollow
and too frickin' late.

648
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:56,429
But, I'm glad you're
comin' down, Jon.

649
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:58,865
Me, too, Amantha.

650
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,068
I'm real glad
you're on our side.

651
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,857
Hello.

652
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,426
This has a DVD player in it.

653
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:27,129
You can watch movies and stuff.

654
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,530
Is it yours?

655
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,900
Yeah, but I've got an iPad,
so I stream, mostly.

656
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,635
Okay.

657
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:35,237
Well, thank you, Jared.

658
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,905
Yeah.

659
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,644
Uh, I could help you hook it up.

660
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:46,881
I mean, I know you just plug it
in, but I know where the plug is.

661
00:43:46,883 --> 00:43:48,817
I think I need help.

662
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,969
I'm guessing you don't
have any DVD's yet.

663
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:08,337
No.

664
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:13,475
Yeah, I didn't think so, but
I didn't want to, you know.

665
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:14,710
Presume?

666
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:17,145
Y-yeah, exactly, presume.

667
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:20,048
Uh, anyways, I've got
kind of a collection.

668
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,983
I've been thinking, like,
if you haven't seen movies

669
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:24,753
in a long time, which ones
would be good to start with

670
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:26,521
and work your way up.

671
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:28,590
I'd appreciate the guidance.

672
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,624
Okay.

673
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:30,792
Well, you can go a lot of ways.

674
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:34,629
But, uh, one of my favorites...
it's called "Dazed And Confused."

675
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,865
I like the title.

676
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:39,434
Yeah, I heard that.

677
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:41,536
Uh, anyway, it's a cool movie.

678
00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:43,772
Not too heavy or
anything like that.

679
00:44:43,774 --> 00:44:47,509
And, um, I could even
watch it with you.

680
00:44:47,511 --> 00:44:50,846
Or-or, you might wanna
be by yourself.

681
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:52,748
I mean, it's all good.

682
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,953
I think I'd rather
watch it with you.

683
00:44:57,955 --> 00:45:00,588
Oh, sure... cool.

684
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,826
Uh, right now?

685
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,661
Oh, did you mean right now?

686
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,129
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

687
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:10,332
I-I'll go get it.

688
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:07,859
Sir, you know, every second that
you could let us out early

689
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:10,462
would really increase our
chances of survival.

690
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:12,664
Just like our sergeant told
us before one trip into

691
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:15,834
the jungle... "men!"

692
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:16,835
"Fifty of you are leavin'

693
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:18,337
on a mission.

694
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,439
Forty-five of ya
ain't coming back."

1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:04,570
Hey, buddy. It's
me. Been a long time, huh?

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,441
You heard who's getting out?

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:10,344
Ain't that some shit? Like Lazarus.

4
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:14,348
Anyway, our other buddy's
all tweaked about it.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,351
You know how he used
to be? He's worse now.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,688
Yeah, I know. It's a drag.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,289
Call me.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,561
And you never called Mr. Willis back?

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,463
I didn't.

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,531
What about your phone
conversation with George Melton?

11
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:40,874
George called me and, um,
basically just said that

12
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:44,410
if this all came back, he
wasn't sure that he could...

13
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:45,911
Withstand the pressure.

14
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,648
He just kept saying that
maybe... maybe he should tell.

15
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,983
Tell it all.

16
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,854
That it was harder and
harder to keep it in anyway

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,023
and that it had rotted inside of him.

18
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,961
H-he became, uh...
Incoherent at that point.

19
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,028
Just he started crying.

20
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,563
What did you do?

21
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,132
I just tried to calm him down.

22
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,668
And I said I-I thought it was, uh...

23
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,539
A noble idea, but I didn't
think it was a good one.

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
Why not?

25
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,077
I told him it was too late.
It wouldn't change anything.

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,015
In fact, it... It would
ruin a lot of lives.

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,052
What had rotted, Chris?
What was he going to tell?

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,457
God, it was so long ago.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,727
I'm not the same person.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,729
I wasn't even that person back then.

31
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,899
Chris, everybody here
pretty much knows the gist

32
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,767
of what you're gonna say.

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,637
You just need to...

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,840
You know, go ahead and give voice to it.

35
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:49,542
It evolved, Sheriff.

36
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,778
It wasn't... It wasn't premeditated.

37
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,147
It just became.

38
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,884
Became what?

39
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,189
Rape.

40
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,557
We raped Hanna Dean.

41
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,643
Have you just been sitting out here?

42
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,213
Didn't want to bother anybody.

43
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,249
Daniel stayed with Jon last night.

44
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,785
I don't know why.

45
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,955
I told him you weren't
gonna be here, but...

46
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,824
Too many memories, I guess.

47
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,291
And not just recent ones.

48
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,628
Where you going, Janet?

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,963
Daniel wants to leave today.

50
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,732
We're going on a little road trip first,

51
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,967
and then I'm gonna take him

52
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,601
to the new Canaan house in Nashville.

53
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,538
I see.

54
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,040
Need some help?

55
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,777
I've got it, but... sure.

56
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,147
We'll be gone a few days.

57
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,684
I mean, I will... Three or four.

58
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm not sure.

59
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,191
Want me to check the oil for you?

60
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,727
I'll just check it on the way out.

61
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,730
Janet?

62
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,932
I just got off the phone with Teddy.

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,170
Teddy? About what?

64
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,706
I just wanted to check
in with him before I left.

65
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,140
See how he's doing.

66
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,876
You know, after yesterday.

67
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,712
He asked if it would be all right

68
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,280
if he could stay here for a
little while if he needed to.

69
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,882
Stay here?

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,751
Evidently, he's offered the house to Tawney

71
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,986
if she wants to stay there.

72
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,790
I spent the night there, and
he didn't say a word about that.

73
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,695
Anyway, I said I didn't
have a problem with it.

74
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,933
It's not the same thing, Janet.

75
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:29,802
I'm not saying it is, Ted.

76
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,203
It's not the same thing.

77
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,773
Ted, we're not gonna
figure this out right now.

78
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,041
Can we just put it on
hold until I get back?

79
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:39,211
Sure.

80
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,146
I'll call you from the road.

81
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,300
I don't really have context yet, Jon.

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,669
Okay.

83
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,338
Would this be considered a shitty view?

84
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,775
Within the norm of shitty views?

85
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,211
To me, it qualifies.

86
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,381
I'm still outside the norm, then.

87
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:18,350
You are that, buddy.

88
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:23,355
You have to report to Nashville
probation in four days.

89
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:24,958
Understood.

90
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,098
How's the view for you now, Mr. Stern?

91
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,900
More complicated.

92
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,774
Hey, y'all! I got Swint's doughnuts.

93
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,941
And fritters.

94
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,211
And a mother.

95
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,249
Don't let that woman near the box!

96
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,251
She'll take all the fritters.

97
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,951
- Fritters?
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,155
Amantha, I am your
mother. Give me that box.

99
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,058
Unh-unh. I'm your brother.

100
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,192
And I've painted your pool.

101
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,961
- What?
- I don't know.

102
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,001
Help, Jon. What should I do?

103
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,134
Spit in the box.

104
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,470
Don't give up your day job.

105
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:11,704
Aah!

106
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,111
How was Hanna at that point?

107
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:22,982
She was okay. I mean,
she wasn't, uh... okay,

108
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:27,419
but she had calmed down some, and...

109
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,054
And what?

110
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,060
She... she was kind of apologizing to us.

111
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,463
Hanna was apologizing to y'all?

112
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,300
Yeah, for getting things started, I guess.

113
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,003
But afterwards, she was
more worried about Daniel

114
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:45,471
than what had happened.

115
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:46,872
What do you mean?

116
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,141
Well, she kept asking us not to tell him.

117
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,244
Why do you think she did that?

118
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,950
I don't know why exactly.
I-it was all pretty surreal.

119
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,285
So, did y'all say you wouldn't tell Daniel?

120
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,386
Trey said that we wouldn't if she wouldn't.

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,489
How did she respond?

122
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,095
She just sat there.

123
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,430
Looking ashamed and...

124
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,298
I don't know how else to say this, but...

125
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,500
Kind of pouty.

126
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,536
"Pouty"?

127
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,239
Yeah, like how my
daughter does now sometimes

128
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:25,111
when she's, uh, hurt or mad or...

129
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,446
Disappointed.

130
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,285
Finally, Hanna said that she
wouldn't say anything to anybody.

131
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,821
And we left.

132
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,825
Left her sitting there?

133
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:39,893
Yes.

134
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,327
Still unclothed?

135
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,781
Yep.

136
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,266
And Trey threatened you after that?

137
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,802
He said that, uh...

138
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,137
We'd better keep our mouth shut, or else.

139
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,437
"Or else."

140
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,274
That was what he said.

141
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,346
You want some popcorn?

142
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,881
What?

143
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,150
I microwaved a bag of it... Sweet kind.

144
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,121
No.

145
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,189
All right.

146
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,824
I've been here over an hour, lid.

147
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:16,228
Sheriff got tied up.

148
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,863
I'll see if I can't goose him.

149
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,899
Is that kettle corn?

150
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,336
It's the sweet kind.

151
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,840
I'll take some.

152
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,342
And a coke.

153
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,410
All right, you got it.

154
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:36,115
Trey shows up at my house
pretty early the next morning.

155
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:39,284
Says that if Hanna
decides to change her story

156
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,021
that we had to say that
she was a willing partner.

157
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,190
Trey said he wasn't going down for that,

158
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,593
that she had tried to... Change the rules

159
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,261
in the middle of the game.

160
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,531
Were you brought down
to the sheriff's station?

161
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,501
Later. My father took me.

162
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,604
Did you know why you were
being asked to come in?

163
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,973
They didn't say, but I assumed the worst.

164
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,476
Did anyone ever talk to
you while you were there,

165
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,510
you know, as in officially?

166
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,348
No, we just sat there in the waiting area

167
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,016
with some of the other
kids and their parents,

168
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,886
and then they came out
and said, "you can go,"

169
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,954
and we all just... went home.

170
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,023
Did you know why you were being let go?

171
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,558
Not at the time.

172
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,994
But later?

173
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,346
Well, word got around pretty quick

174
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,664
that, uh, Daniel had confessed

175
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:29,068
to raping and,
uh, and killing Hanna.

176
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,171
Did that surprise you?

177
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,175
Honestly, I just felt relief.

178
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,312
You weren't even surprised
by the confession of the rape?

179
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:45,317
Later, I-I thought about it,
and I... I just tried to...

180
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,321
I don't know.

181
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,889
Just forget.

182
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,059
Can we circle back?

183
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,399
When Trey came by your
house that morning...

184
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,199
Did you know that Hanna was dead?

185
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,335
I did not.

186
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:08,206
And in so many words, Trey
said that if Hanna claimed rape,

187
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,977
that you all must stay united.

188
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,178
That's accurate.

189
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,346
Did you take that to mean

190
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:16,114
that he did not know that Hanna was dead?

191
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:18,650
That's what it meant to me, yes.

192
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,429
After eating fritters in a cheap motel,

193
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,631
the beach is gonna be such a letdown.

194
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,100
You can still come, Amantha.

195
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,503
No, I'll come visit you when you
get all settled in in Nashville.

196
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,439
Mama's boy.

197
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,108
No maudlin goodbyes, then.

198
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,014
Deal.

199
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,516
Now get lost.

200
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,385
That's the plan.

201
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,720
Mr. Stern.

202
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,222
No way.

203
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,658
Oh, cheeky.

204
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,593
Bye, mama.

205
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,468
Here we go.

206
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,471
Here we go.

207
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,238
Daniel.

208
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,486
I love you, sister.

209
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,054
I love you, brother.

210
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:50,075
Perfectly strange goodbye of Daniel Holden.

211
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,384
God be with you, brother.

212
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,754
You getting some of
that old-time religion?

213
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,626
Hedging my bets.

214
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,187
You made it.

215
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,223
I made it.

216
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,760
You didn't have to ring the doorbell.

217
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,096
Oh, well.

218
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,564
I'm glad you're here.

219
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,867
S-so, where are you gonna stay?

220
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,386
Oh, at Dad's.

221
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,871
At your dad's?

222
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:55,376
Janet and Daniel took a trip
down the coast, uh, near Savannah.

223
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:00,081
Oh. Good for them.

224
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,882
But he's not coming back, Tawney...

225
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,085
To Paulie.

226
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,225
That's probably best.

227
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,798
I wonder if he ever
finished his kitchen project.

228
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,400
He didn't.

229
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,004
Dad asked me to help him with it.

230
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,372
But I got it finished.

231
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,747
I'm sure Janet appreciates that.

232
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,948
Yeah.

233
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,386
Well I think I just got

234
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,756
about everything out of here I need.

235
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,295
What is it?

236
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,401
I'd like to change the locks.

237
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,237
Locks?

238
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,207
Here at the house.

239
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,744
I told you I'd give
you all my keys, Tawney.

240
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,211
We don't need to change the locks.

241
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,317
It's just something I need to do for me.

242
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,990
Sure.

243
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,324
Yeah, we can do that.

244
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,161
Uh... might take me a couple days.

245
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,699
Uh... that's fine.

246
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,401
I'll get it done, then.

247
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,909
Thank you, Teddy.

248
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,746
You don't have to thank me, Tawney.

249
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,283
I want to.

250
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,854
Well... Guess that's about it.

251
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,991
See you later.

252
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,429
I mean... sometime.

253
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,232
Okay.

254
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,265
I wonder if Hoppy's is still there.

255
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,067
The seafood extravaganza?

256
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,001
You remember.

257
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,070
It was your father's favorite.

258
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,773
I remember that, too.

259
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,442
We could Google it and find out.

260
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:46,347
Mother, I know that day is
coming... my first Google.

261
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,351
But not to see if Hoppy's is still Hoppy's.

262
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,786
I'd like to find out
the old-fashioned way.

263
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,955
Just don't expect things to
look a lot like the old days.

264
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,227
There might be a lot of
condos and chain stores.

265
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:06,100
Could we take a side trip, Mother?

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,904
Aren't we on a side trip?

267
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,906
A side trip to the side trip.

268
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,941
I don't see why not.

269
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,185
Sure was hard to get
some girls of mine asleep

270
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:29,355
after y'all tore through
my house last night.

271
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,358
An unfortunate part of this business.

272
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,860
What do they call that...

273
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,396
Collateral damage or something?

274
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,504
You just want to come clean, Trey?

275
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,041
Clean of what?

276
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,044
That gun we found by your bed...

277
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:53,547
When was the last time you fired it?

278
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,416
Few weeks ago.

279
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,084
I was shooting at some squirrels.

280
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,319
With a handgun?

281
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,920
Well, I didn't expect to hit 'em.

282
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,923
I was just...

283
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,491
Just doing it for sport.

284
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,594
Can you account for yourself
on march 23rd of this year?

285
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,563
I don't even know
what day of the week that was, Carl.

286
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,499
It was a Tuesday.

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,401
Okay, if you say so.

288
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,502
I mean, I could look at my weekly planner,

289
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,973
see what I had on my
plate that particular day.

290
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,141
It was the day after Daniel
Holden got released from prison.

291
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,479
Now, I remember that
day... The day he got out...

292
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,282
But the day after was just...
Another day to me, Carl.

293
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,452
Sinclair cash and carry ring a bell?

294
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,954
I know the place. It don't ring no bell.

295
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,557
You bought gas there, paid cash.

296
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,125
Didn't happen.

297
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,327
Got a witness.

298
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,164
Now, who the hell's gonna
remember me coming into a place

299
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,166
on an exact day six or seven weeks ago?

300
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,969
Somebody who will swear to it.

301
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,436
Well, I'll swear I didn't.

302
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,217
When was the last time
you talked to Chris Nelms?

303
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,122
Couldn't tell you.

304
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,023
Last time you called him, then.

305
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,060
About the same time I was
shooting them squirrels.

306
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,562
He didn't answer.

307
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,432
You leave a message?

308
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,199
I might have.

309
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,269
Remember what it was about?

310
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,138
Couldn't tell you verbatim.

311
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,442
What if I could tell you verbatim?

312
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,916
I'd take your word for it.

313
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,555
Something bothering you, Trey?

314
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,492
That son of a bitch told me

315
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,494
he was gonna get me some kettle corn.

316
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,364
I forgot, Carl.

317
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,636
Could you still make good on it?

318
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,133
We ate the whole bag.

319
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,269
Is there any more in the pantry?

320
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,203
I'll check.

321
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:09,015
Be nice to stay in one place for a while.

322
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,350
Other than Paulie.

323
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,986
It'll be different.

324
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,488
Boston and Paulie? Really?

325
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,191
Boston has the Celtics.

326
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,692
Right.

327
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,494
But then, the skating rinks are nicer here.

328
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,329
Rink.

329
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:28,335
So, you're gonna carry on
with the thrifty town plan?

330
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,672
That's the plan for now.

331
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,276
You know, I never would have
thought in a million years

332
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,212
you'd be in this town if Daniel wasn't.

333
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,183
I never thought a lot of things, Jon.

334
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,761
Well...

335
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,629
I'm gonna go on with my life, too.

336
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,566
And that may lead me to something else.

337
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,070
I know.

338
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:06,173
Glad you know.

339
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,513
Well, I guess I'd better get going.

340
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,519
Thank you.

341
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,253
For all that you've done, Jon.

342
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,823
I didn't do anything worth thanking me for.

343
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,290
That's not true.

344
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,792
We both know he would've been better off

345
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,162
with somebody else.

346
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,663
Somebody less distracted.

347
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,255
Sometimes I...

348
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:33,594
Wanted to walk to the front
gate and ask them to...

349
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,329
Let me back in.

350
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,333
Back into my box.

351
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,503
My cocoon.

352
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:47,374
That's not right thinking, Mother.

353
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,543
You're not the first to romance the cocoon.

354
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,251
But not today.

355
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,418
Today, I want to go to the beach.

356
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,421
I want to feel the sand between my toes

357
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,423
and look up at that infinite sky.

358
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,761
As fate would have it, so do I.

359
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,598
And I want to tell you
about my friend Kerwin.

360
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,369
He was something special.

361
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,372
I'd love to hear about Kerwin.

362
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:21,708
And I want to drive.

363
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,710
I want to drive with the windows down,

364
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,678
even if it is raining.

365
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,482
At least 4 1/2 miles over the speed limit.

366
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,218
I will brace myself, then.

367
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,536
Chris Nelms said y'all raped Hanna.

368
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,204
He's lying.

369
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,374
Why would he lie about that?

370
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,878
Y'all didn't tell him it
was George's DNA, did you?

371
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:01,415
The single sample.

372
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,283
Chris still thinks it
might be his, doesn't he?

373
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:06,987
You know a lot about DNA
for an electrician, Trey.

374
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,855
Uh-huh. You made a deal with him.

375
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,424
You raped her, Trey.

376
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,425
It was consensual.

377
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,928
At least now you're admitting to
having sex with her that night.

378
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,762
That's a step in the right direction.

379
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,466
This is all messed up, Carl.

380
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,335
George was gonna spill
the beans, wasn't he?

381
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,337
You got it so wrong, man.

382
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,670
It ain't even funny.

383
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,241
So, let me get this straight.

384
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,409
The guy at Sinclair's is lying
about you being in his store

385
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,279
near the area of the flint river

386
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,580
where George's body was eventually found.

387
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,750
He could have floated for miles, Carl.

388
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,453
Putting you near there on the same day

389
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,488
George arrived in Paulie by greyhound bus.

390
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,992
And Chris Nelms is lying
that y'all raped Hanna,

391
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:48,895
which would give you motive to
keep George from ratting you out.

392
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,264
And then finally, Daniel Holden is lying

393
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:53,934
about you having possession
of George's wallet and phone,

394
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,469
which we know was in Paulie on the 23rd

395
00:23:56,502 --> 00:24:01,474
but somehow made their way back
to George's trailer in live oak

396
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,843
after George was dead.

397
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:06,780
Holden put 'em there. Not me.

398
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,016
Oh, and your own voicemail
to Chris Nelms is lying, too.

399
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,588
I never said anything specific

400
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,991
about anybody in that voicemail, Carl.

401
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,061
People can read between the lines, Trey.

402
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,367
You think the whole world's
full of idiots, don't you?

403
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:32,573
The world is full of idiots.

404
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,943
And I'm one of them.

405
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,411
It's over, Trey.

406
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,314
I don't even need a confession from you.

407
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:42,982
I'd suggest you just shut your mouth

408
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,018
and call a lawyer right now.

409
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,790
This is so crazy, Carl.
I... listen... all right.

410
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,096
I'm gonna tell you what really happened.

411
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,932
But you ain't gonna believe it.

412
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,701
I'm serious.

413
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,501
Give her a shot.

414
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,672
I didn't kill George. I swear to God.

415
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,873
Okay.

416
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,376
See? I knew you wouldn't believe me.

417
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,045
Who killed George, then, Trey?

418
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,380
Nobody.

419
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:15,566
Nobody?

420
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,717
I mean he did.

421
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,585
- George killed himself?
- Yes!

422
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,653
Bam!

423
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,391
See? I told you you wouldn't believe me.

424
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:34,634
I'd like to believe you,
Trey. I really would.

425
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,136
But there's just too many
things that don't add up.

426
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,505
Well, I can explain them to you.

427
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,643
Okay, Trey. Explain away.

428
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,751
I'm sorry Hoppy's is gone.

429
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,753
They razed it.

430
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,457
It was kind of ratty, even back then.

431
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,791
Heretic.

432
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:33,527
I'm just saying.

433
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,863
At least they kept the beach.

434
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,031
I think it was grandfathered in.

435
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,735
This is the perfect spot, Mother.

436
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,203
It sure is.

437
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,883
I read some more on the new
Canaan project last night.

438
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,785
Talked to Jon about it.

439
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,620
You did?

440
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,624
Yeah, thinking about the programs.

441
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,158
The possibilities, I guess.

442
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,662
They have a great success rate.

443
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:12,165
Maybe I can get...

444
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,867
More normal.

445
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,537
Run for dog catcher.

446
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,983
Is this your ball?

447
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,618
M-may I throw it to you?

448
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,821
Oh.

449
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,656
That was one of the best catches I've seen,

450
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,926
well, in all my years.

451
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,628
I catch it all the time.

452
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,631
I stand before you
astonished and astounded.

453
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,000
You can throw it again if you want.

454
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,703
I'd be honored, young sir.

455
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,641
Dare we hope for two?

456
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,848
Fantastical! Stupor-pendus!

457
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,850
Uh...

458
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,653
I kind of got to go now.

459
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,188
All good things.

460
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,665
You're good with kids.

461
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,232
Was that good?

462
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,135
I certainly think so.

463
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,038
Beginner's luck.

464
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,176
I must now go to the source.

465
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,680
Of course. Enjoy.

466
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,223
Make sure you come back.

467
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,021
What are you doing here?

468
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,790
I came to visit you, Daniel.

469
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,191
That's not possible.

470
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,194
I know.

471
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,898
You're not here, are you?

472
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,267
You're not here either, Daniel.

473
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,970
Well, where am I?

474
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,406
You're at the beach with your mama.

475
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,276
That's unimaginable.

476
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,310
But it's true.

477
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,816
And it's glorious. I know it is.

478
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,432
Where are you, Tawney?

479
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,001
I don't know.

480
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,871
You don't know?

481
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,242
I'm lost, Daniel.

482
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,313
And it's so lonely.

483
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,182
I'll come and find you.

484
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,452
You can't. I need to find me.

485
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,120
What about God?

486
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,756
God?

487
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,424
As your guide.

488
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:35,427
God doesn't exist.

489
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,963
Of course he exists.

490
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,865
Tell me the truth, Daniel.

491
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,203
This time, tell me the truth.

492
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,739
You know the truth, Tawney.

493
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,976
Then w-where is he? Where is God?

494
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,246
You know that, too.

495
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,517
I used to know. Before I met you.

496
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,453
But you still know.

497
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,057
In between the seconds?

498
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,425
Yes.

499
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,994
You told me too much, Daniel.

500
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,799
I was happy.

501
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,300
You remember.

502
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:20,006
God is in the flowers...

503
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,509
And in the rain...

504
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,476
And in your tears.

505
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,180
God is in my tears?

506
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:30,550
I've seen him there, lurking.

507
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:34,086
You're a false prophet.

508
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,889
I'm gonna tell you something, Tawney.

509
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:39,058
I won't believe you.

510
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,794
God is a rain frog.

511
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:49,301
As God is my witness. He's a rain frog.

512
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,271
May frog strike me down.

513
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:56,309
You're mad, Daniel.

514
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,111
And so must be God.

515
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,886
I'm gonna miss you.

516
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,822
The hardest part.

517
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,538
There's no glass.

518
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,439
Sometimes there is.

519
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:32,044
Sometimes there isn't.

520
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,852
I could kiss you right here.

521
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:44,523
I-I don't know, Daniel.

522
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:48,060
We're unguarded.

523
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,063
I'm afraid to.

524
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:54,233
This isn't even real, Tawney.

525
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,236
But won't it feel real?

526
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:59,505
God, I hope so.

527
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,976
You may kiss me, Daniel.

528
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:32,306
Sir? You have a visitor.

529
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:50,259
We just never know, do we?

530
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,563
I'm told you still have your
cognitive abilities, Senator.

531
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:59,935
That's something to be grateful for.

532
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,268
Or maybe that's more the burden now.

533
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:05,140
Anyway, I assume the
sheriff has kept you abreast

534
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:07,542
on the investigation of
the murder of George Melton.

535
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:11,546
Or maybe not.

536
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:14,548
Sheriff Daggett is preparing
to arrest Trey Willis

537
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:16,250
for Mr. Melton's murder.

538
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:21,622
What has me curious is, why?

539
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:25,360
Why would Trey Willis murder George Melton?

540
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:32,132
The obvious answer is
because they raped Hanna Dean.

541
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:34,268
And Trey was afraid
George would implicate him.

542
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,237
You're probably already ahead of me here,

543
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,202
but the flaw in that premise

544
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,812
is the statute of limitations
on the rape charge itself.

545
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:51,820
It's 15 years in Georgia...

546
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:55,858
Unless there is DNA tying
the suspect to the rape.

547
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:59,762
Would Trey not know that?

548
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,331
So, naturally, one has to wonder

549
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:06,301
if there wasn't a greater
crime George knew about...

550
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:09,704
A crime with no statute of limitations.

551
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:14,409
It's still a bit of a mystery,
but the one thing I'm sure of...

552
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,845
Is you are dirty here, Senator,

553
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:19,949
and I'm gonna find out how dirty.

554
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,382
And I'm going to expose that dirt,

555
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,318
and I am going to make it your legacy,

556
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:24,819
and then I'm going to get my client

557
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:27,923
once and for all exonerated
for the killing of Hanna Dean.

558
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:32,427
Does that compute, sir?

559
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:44,506
Over my...

560
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,512
Dead... body.

561
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:53,382
Whether you're dead or
alive as this moves forward

562
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:57,253
doesn't really concern me.

563
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:02,925
I would say at this point...
It's not even relevant.

564
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,233
I hope your house has termites.

565
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:17,705
Jared?

566
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,583
Hello?

567
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:29,985
Hello.

568
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,403
Who's in there?

569
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:32,788
Who's out there?

570
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,861
What the hell are you doing here?

571
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:42,764
Would you like me to be in your room?

572
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,768
You know, this was my room for a long time.

573
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:49,305
Oh, I remember, all right.
Question is, why are you back?

574
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:54,676
Tawney and I are separated.

575
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,545
She's staying at the house.

576
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,981
What are you doing here?

577
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:02,384
Mom wanted me to check in on Jared,

578
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,786
so I... I brought some
food for him and big Ted.

579
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,757
Oh, Dad's at Kiwanis.

580
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,558
And Jared's at Claire's, but, hey...

581
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:13,394
I'm hungry as a bear.

582
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,771
Well, there was no wait.

583
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:26,741
But it's not very seafoody-looking.

584
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:30,346
Of course it is. It's got the, um...

585
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:31,463
The...

586
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:32,547
Thatch?

587
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,950
The thatch and the big rope.

588
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,086
Where's the plastic lobster?

589
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,987
I don't think they do that so much anymore.

590
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,056
Good news and bad news.

591
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,523
We're out of grouper.

592
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,858
You're out of grouper?

593
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,560
I know... our specialty.

594
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:47,580
What's the good news?

595
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:49,565
Well, we have snapper.

596
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,116
Snapper?

597
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:52,634
It's not that popular.

598
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,971
Okay. Snapper it is.

599
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,572
Excellent choice.

600
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,775
We could go somewhere else.

601
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:04,646
I'd feel bad for the piano player.

602
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,586
Thank you for the money, Mother.

603
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:15,790
It's your money, Daniel. It always was.

604
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:18,827
I just hope I can manage things.

605
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,461
You'll have a support system there.

606
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:22,931
That's what they do... Help manage.

607
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:26,735
And I'm a phone call away, always.

608
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,137
And, speaking of money...

609
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,740
Here is your checkbook.

610
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,677
And... your ATM card.

611
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,514
Your code is Amantha's birthday.

612
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:47,054
I don't think anyone here
knows who Amantha is, Mother.

613
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,624
You remember?

614
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:50,659
08-11.

615
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:51,994
You do.

616
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,440
Would you care to dance?

617
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:07,610
I'd love to.

618
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:24,793
What does that mean?

619
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,695
He's on break.

620
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,500
I didn't know you
liked Chinese food, Teddy.

621
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,235
Got a taste for it in college.

622
00:40:33,268 --> 00:40:34,670
You?

623
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,672
Atlanta.

624
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:38,139
Chopsticks drive me crazy, though.

625
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:42,210
I used to practice
before going out with Jon.

626
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:43,679
I didn't want to look like a...

627
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:45,047
- A rube?
- Yeah.

628
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,650
Like you.

629
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:52,887
How are you guys doing, anyway?

630
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,689
You and old Johnny Stern?

631
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:58,893
We're not... doing.

632
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:02,264
Damn, is something in
the water around here?

633
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:05,467
Something in the something.

634
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:11,873
Um, you want the rest of the mu shu pork?

635
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,075
Yeah, if you don't.

636
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:14,242
No, go for it.

637
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,617
I'm really sorry about
you and Tawney, Teddy.

638
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,253
I really hope it works out.

639
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:25,653
How it's supposed to.

640
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,925
Maybe it already has.

641
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:35,129
Same for you, by the way.

642
00:41:35,163 --> 00:41:36,998
Maybe it already has.

643
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:42,538
What?

644
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,705
Nothing.

645
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:44,839
Say it.

646
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:46,141
- Nothing.
- Say... it.

647
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,210
Want to play Gin Rummy?

648
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,710
Really, Teddy?

649
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,313
Hey, if you're scared, you're scared.

650
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,981
It's fine.

651
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,334
I haven't played in over 10 years,

652
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,885
and I will still beat your redneck ass.

653
00:41:57,918 --> 00:42:00,321
Talk is cheap, wicked stepsister,

654
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,623
and old Teddy boy ain't a teenager anymore.

655
00:42:02,657 --> 00:42:04,793
Okay, Mr. third person.

656
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,961
You go get the cards,
and I'll be right back.

657
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:11,733
He bought a round-trip ticket?

658
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,101
Yep.

659
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:15,903
Damn, Carl. Uh, that don't make any sense.

660
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,772
I'm telling you, he offed himself.

661
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,977
It's late, Trey. Why don't
we pick this back up tomorrow.

662
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,713
Unless...

663
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,615
He was undecided when he took
the bus up here, you know?

664
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,083
Uh-huh.

665
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:30,586
You know, and then I didn't
tell him whatever it was

666
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:33,622
that he wanted to hear, and he did it.

667
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:35,257
Pulled the trigger.

668
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,058
And you came back a week later

669
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,660
and tossed his body in the river,

670
00:42:38,693 --> 00:42:40,128
took his wallet and phone?

671
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:41,896
Oh, don't forget the gun.

672
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,632
Then pretended like he was
alive for the next month or so.

673
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,668
Look, I panicked, Carl, okay?

674
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,936
I panicked. Pure Dee plain and simple.

675
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:50,972
I did some stupid, impulsive shit.

676
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,140
That's his gun, right?

677
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:53,274
That's your gun.

678
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:54,842
No, the other gun, lid... that one.

679
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:56,845
That's the one they found at his trailer.

680
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:57,980
Right, that's 'cause I put it there.

681
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,347
That gun right there,

682
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,382
that is the gun that I
found next to his body.

683
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:04,786
Why did you put it in the
trailer... to frame Holden?

684
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:08,690
To throw you off my trail.

685
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,293
I know. "What trail?"

686
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:14,896
I compounded my errors.

687
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,365
Look, I... I wish to God

688
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:18,900
that I'd just come clean
from the get-go, believe me.

689
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:20,668
Why don't you just come clean now?

690
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:22,871
Because there ain't
nothing to come clean about!

691
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,907
That's what I'm trying to say!

692
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:30,679
Look, all right,
there has got to be some way

693
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,179
that you can prove that this is the gun

694
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,182
that he killed himself with, right?

695
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:37,251
If we had a bullet, state
forensics might could prove

696
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,920
that that's the gun that killed him.

697
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,688
Carl, what, do you think
I took his own gun from him

698
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:41,990
and killed him with it?

699
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,743
I mean, I didn't even know he was carrying.

700
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:47,228
Okay, Trey, we'll go out there tomorrow,

701
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:48,864
and you can show me
where all this took place.

702
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,099
Bring a damn metal detector, too.

703
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:55,304
No problem.

704
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:59,340
So, what, do I just meet
y'all here in the morning?

705
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,175
Why don't we just keep you here tonight,

706
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,443
and it'll save you a trip?

707
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:10,652
You never even had any kettle corn.

708
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,735
Oh, I declare.

709
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,870
Hey, buddy.

710
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:31,039
Who's winning?

711
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:32,106
Don't ask.

712
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:36,978
Where has he been?

713
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,181
Well, your dad gave him to Daniel.

714
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,715
Daniel gave him to me.

715
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,817
And I'm giving him back to the store.

716
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,987
Where he belongs.

717
00:44:47,322 --> 00:44:49,825
I kind of miss the little fella.

718
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:51,060
Shut up and draw.

719
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:58,365
I'll deny I ever said this, but, uh...

720
00:44:58,398 --> 00:44:59,768
The kitchen looks pretty good.

721
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,206
Can I play?

722
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,523
No.

723
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:06,807
No.

724
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:28,996
I swear to God.

725
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,867
For the 10th time.

726
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,438
Just have them keep looking, Carl.

727
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:40,909
He can't get down there,
Trey. The river's too high.

728
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:42,844
I'm telling you,

729
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:47,449
that is where George was at...
Right there... and his gun.

730
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,788
We'll just have to wait till
the river goes down to come back.

731
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,356
Oh, that'll take a while.

732
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,826
Like finding a needle in a haystack anyhow.

733
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:08,836
Trey Willis, you're under arrest
for the murder of George Melton.

734
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,572
You have the right
to remain silent.

735
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,222
Jesus, Carl!

736
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,074
Anything you say can and
will be held against you...

737
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,108
Can't do this!

738
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:15,110
In a court of law.

739
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:16,378
I didn't kill George!

740
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:17,846
You have a right to speak to an attorney

741
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,914
and have him present during questioning.

742
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:52,314
Brave new world.

743
00:46:52,347 --> 00:46:53,915
It's only temporary, honey.

744
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:56,951
I've never had a roommate before.

745
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,422
I thought about that.

746
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:03,924
Get to practice my interpersonal skills.

747
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:06,427
It's a lifelong practice.
I'll tell you that.

748
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,500
1, 2, 3.

749
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,543
Fits like a glove.

750
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:23,878
It does.

751
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,217
Don't look bad, does it?

752
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,887
No, it doesn't.

753
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,710
Gonna need you a new refrigerator now.

754
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:47,635
I need to say something, son.

755
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:51,606
I don't want to talk about this, Dad.

756
00:47:57,144 --> 00:48:01,048
When Margaret... Your mother left...

757
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:04,286
I didn't say a lot about
it because I felt guilty.

758
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,188
I felt like I failed you.

759
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:11,525
Well, I felt like it was my
fault somehow... her leaving.

760
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,595
I see that now.

761
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:16,631
I mean, the whole time I've been married...

762
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:19,067
I've been afraid Tawney was
gonna do the same thing, Dad.

763
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:23,505
She did.

764
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:33,682
I should've told you this, but...

765
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:36,151
It wasn't all Margaret's fault.

766
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:40,288
I mean, she had her problems.

767
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,490
And we got more and more distant, but...

768
00:48:43,523 --> 00:48:45,393
But what, Dad?

769
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:49,730
I started leaning on somebody else.

770
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:51,066
Another woman.

771
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,737
Wasn't physical, just...
just talking and stuff,

772
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:58,673
but as soon as I opened that door...

773
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:04,479
I sure didn't do what I could
have to save the marriage.

774
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:08,516
I just let her go.

775
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,065
I just hope you do all
you can to save yours.

776
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:46,253
Well...

777
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:52,460
don't take this the
wrong way, Mother, but...

778
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:54,496
I'd like to do this part alone.

779
00:49:54,528 --> 00:49:58,500
Oh. Okay.

780
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:01,268
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

781
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:02,737
I know you will.

782
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,639
All I can do, right?

783
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:07,009
It's all anybody can do.

784
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,684
Can you do me a favor?

785
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:19,621
Of course.

786
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:23,824
Would you try and forgive yourself?

787
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:28,363
You did the best you could...

788
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:33,835
Out of the most unusual of circumstances.

789
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:39,708
I'll give it my best shot.

790
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:51,585
All we can do, right?

791
00:50:57,425 --> 00:51:00,428
See you in the funny papers.

792
00:51:18,628 --> 00:51:21,570

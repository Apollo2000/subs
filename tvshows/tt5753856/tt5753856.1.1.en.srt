THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

<i>We trust that time is linear.</i>

<i>Into infinity.</i>

00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:49,833
<i>But the distinction
between past, present</i>

<i>and future</i>

8
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,833
<i>is nothing but an illusion.</i>

<i>Yesterday, today and
tomorrow are not consecutive,</i>

10
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:09,125

a never-ending circle.</i>

Mom.

Mom!

20
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,125
You'd think by 16, they'd
know how to make toast.

Mom!

Mom!

24
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,375
Thanks for breakfast.

25
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,917
Coming to the meeting tonight?

26
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,833
I don't know.

27
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,917
- Katharina will be there.
- And I'll be there.

28
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,667
Yes, you'll be there.

29
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,208
That's right.

31
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,750
I love you.

How have you been these last two months?

37
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:29,917
You don't have to talk
about it if you don't want.

38
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,667
I read the notes from
your therapy sessions.

39
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,500
<i>You did pretty good, especially
in the group sessions<i>.

40
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,458
I still see him.

41
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,042
In your dreams?

42
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,875
Why do you think you see him?

43
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,958
As my therapist, shouldn't you tell me?

44
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,542
Are you taking your meds?

45
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,792
I think he's trying
to tell me something.

46
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,500
Or maybe I just want
him to tell me something.

47
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,292
What do you think that might be?

48
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,875
What do I think it might be?

49
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,708
Why?

50
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,833
Why he left?

51
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,083
Why like that?

52
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,167
Why he fucking hanged himself?

53
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,333
And why he didn't leave a word?

54
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,583
Nothing to explain this fucking crap!

Mikkel, you're not going
to school like that.

66
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,500
A good magician needs
a distinctive style.

67
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,583
Change your clothes. Thank you.

68
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,458
These are my work clothes.

69
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,500
And school sucks!

70
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,792
I'm sure the great
Hodini went to school.

71
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375
- Houdini! It's not that hard!
- Come have breakfast.

72
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,458
- The greatest magician ever.
- Are you sure he's not adopted?

73
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,333
- And his name is Houdini!
- Same crap every morning.

74
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,250
Mom, where's my black hoodie?

75
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,208
I don't know. Maybe with the jackets.

76
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,167
Magnus, stop trampling like that!

77
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,083
- Morning, Mikkel.
- Good morning.

78
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,333
Ulrich! Why did it take so long?

79
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,458
First day of school. A
huge line at the bakery.

80
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,333
The Apocalypse is upon
us. You coming to eat?

81
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,042
It's not with the jackets.

82
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,292
Ouch!

83
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,375
- Then maybe it's in your gym bag.
- What's going on here now? Magnus?

84
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,125
- Breakfast.
- Mom, I'm on hunger strike.

85
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,710
I won't stuff my face as long as

86
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,917
a child starves to
death every ten seconds.

87
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,167
I will.

88
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,750
The damn hoodie isn't in the bag.

89
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,542
- Did you steal my hoodie?
- No, I did not!

90
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,208
- Can't you stop arguing for once?
- Mom, I didn't do anything.

91
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,625
- Where can it be?
- Can I please have my lines back?

92
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,292
Magnus, maybe it's up in the laundry.

93
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,458
Martha, starving won't help anyone.

94
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:46,167
Mikkel, get changed now. Last warning!

95
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,667
- Or we'll be late.
- Whose idea was it to have kids?

96
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,500
- Can you please open this?
- You're in the way!

97
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,292
Did you understand me?

98
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,167
All right then, Houdini.

99
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,917
One last trick, then off to school.

100
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,583
Fine, then everyone can do as they wish.

101
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Found it!

102
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,042
Okay.

103
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,875
There...

104
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
and there.

105
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,667
Amazing! How did you do that?

106
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,083
Dad, the question isn't how,

107
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
<i>the question is when.</i>

108
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Hey!

109
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,667
Welcome back to the madhouse.

110
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,583
It was damn boring without you here.

111
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,000
- Hey, what the hell are you staring at?
- What a freak.

112
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,833
What idiots.

113
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you tell anyone?

114
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,833
I told everyone you were on a
two-month school exchange in France,

115
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,083
playing
hide-the-baguette.

116
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,167
Relax. Come on.

117
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,292
It'll be fine. Let's go.

118
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,208
Come on.

119
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,625
- What about here?
- You didn't miss much.

120
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,542
Except for the thing with Erik.

121
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,667
You don't give a shit!

122
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,042
Why is nobody doing anything?
Where is our son? Where is Erik?

123
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,792
Mr. Obendorf.

124
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,875
No one is unimportant to us
here. We've done 172 interviews.

125
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,500
We've questioned neighbors and
friends, combed the entire forest,

126
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,375
searched the houses and
basements of nearby residents.

127
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,583
23 officers and over 50 volunteers

128
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,625
have been searching
for your son for days.

129
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,792
We're doing our job. And we'll
do it better if you calm down.

130
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,167
- You're not doing shit!
- Hey!

131
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,292
Calm down! Stop. Calm down now.

132
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Hey! Come now.

133
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,792
Listen.

134
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,542
We can't rule out the possibility
that no crime has been committed.

135
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Maybe Erik left voluntarily.

136
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,250
He's done it before.

137
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,417
But when he ran away, he
always came back after two days.

138
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,000
- He'd sleep in the basement or wherever.
- It's been 13 days.

139
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,875
It's been 13 days now.

140
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,208
We'll find your son, I promise.

141
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,833
Now go home. Okay?

142
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,625
Go home.

143
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458
Franziska.

144
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,083
Magnus.

145
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,375
Shouldn't you be with the geeks?

146
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,542
Should the principal's son be
smoking a joint on school grounds?

147
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,083
Especially such bad weed.

148
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,750
Assemblies like this are for
idiots. They need to get rid of them.

149
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,292
Maybe you did miss something.

150
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,292
Hey.

151
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,208
Hey.

152
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,792
How was France?

153
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,208
French. How else?

154
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,917
What a nice welcome. Thank you.

155
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,375
The reason I've asked you
to assemble here before class

156
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,042
is because I wanted to talk to
you about something important.

157
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,917
About Erik Obendorf.

158
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,750
You all know Erik has been
missing for almost two weeks now.

159
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,583
I want to tell you that if
you need to talk to someone,

160
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,667
if you have questions or if you know
anything about Erik's disappearance,

161
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,417
you can come to us at any time.

162
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,375
Come to us, talk to us.

163
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,792
There can be no secrets in this matter.

164
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,875
Okay?

165
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,417
<i>No one saw him after practice.
Not a trace, nothing.</i>

166
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:45,167
<i>- As if he vanished into thin air.
- Maybe he just doesn't want to be found.</i>

167
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,303
<i>The money under the bed? His phone?</i>

168
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,625
<i>You'd take that if
you were running away.</i>

169
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,102
Sometimes people just want to get away.

170
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:58,417
49 tire tracks on the road between
the school and the residential area.

171
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,708
Two of them are from trucks.

172
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,875
There are 21,312 vehicles registered
in the district of Winden alone.

173
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,958
- That's all we have.
- So we've got nothing at all.

174
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,833
Erik's father drives a van.

175
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,125
You don't think he's involved.

176
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,083
Why are you so certain Erik ran away?

177
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,125
This is Winden.

178
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,792
- Nothing ever happens here.
- But that hasn't always been the case.

179
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,000
This has nothing to do with my brother.

180
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,333
Not a thing.

181
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,542
Oh, your mother called the
emergency number again this morning.

182
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,958
Maybe you should pay her a visit.

183
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,167
Do you ever wonder where
you took a wrong turn?

184
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,650
Where your life became
the exact opposite

185
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,625
of what you always wanted it to be?

186
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,792
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

187
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,917
Hotel Winden. Regina Tiedemann
speaking. How can I help you?

188
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,292
I see, but surely there's
something we can do.

189
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,250
Temporarily suspend the
loan repayments, for example.

190
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,814
Just a slight deferment of payments

191
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:59,875
until things have
calmed down again here.

192
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,917
I have not miscalculated.
Are you even listening to me?

193
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,792
Who wants to go on vacation in a
town where a child has disappeared?

194
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,375
Would you want that?

195
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,833
I have a family suite available.

196
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,083
A weekend with the little ones?
They'd love it, wouldn't they?

197
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,667
You bankers sit on your piles of
money and think you can bully people.

198
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,875
I've built up a business here.
By myself. Without any help.

199
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,667
My husband and I have been
customers of your bank for 20 years!

200
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,958
And now you're pulling
this? You stupid asshole!

201
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,125
I want to speak to your supervisor.

202
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,458
Hello?

203
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,583
Hello?

204
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,583
Shit, shit, shit!

205
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,875
A black hole forms

206
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,718
when the center of a star collapses

207
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,917
into itself after a supernova explosion.

208
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,792
Even new neutron matter
cannot prevent the collapse.

209
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,375
You know what I've
been wondering for days?

210
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,167
If the blackest hole of all is
parked in Franziska Doppler's ass.

211
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,125
But, seriously, what I
really wonder is this:

212
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,208
If Erik didn't run away, but got
snuffed out or something instead,

213
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:14,458
then all his dope is still in the caves.

214
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,833
He kept his entire stash there.

215
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,792
- So?
- Oh, man!

216
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,333
We go in there and... bingo!

217
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:28,042
- That's bullshit.
- It's awesome.

218
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,292
You haven't been here in a long time.

219
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,417
Where's Dad?

220
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,625
You could come by more often.

221
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,458
Mom, if you want me to stop by then
call me, not the emergency number.

222
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958
I saw something in the forest again.

223
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,000
This time very clearly.

224
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,000
A dark figure with a gigantic head.

225
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,833
Mom.

226
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,208
You don't believe me.

227
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,333
There are things out
there that our little minds

228
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,583
will never comprehend.

229
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,458
And I found this in the forest.

230
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,208
Mads loved those.

231
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,875
This business with that missing Erik...

232
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,958
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

233
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,042
... like with your brother, back then.

234
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750
Everything's repeating itself.

235
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,792
Everything is just like
it was 33 years ago.

236
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,792
REST HOME WINDEN

237
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,667
It's going to happen again.

238
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,000
It's going to happen again.

239
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,208
It's going to happen again.

240
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,833
Bullshit. Then you'll go
around selling it or what?

241
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,000
No, dude. We'll smoke
half of it ourselves.

242
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,333
And if there are capacities on
the market, you don't hesitate.

243
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:55,500
We'll go there and get the stuff.

244
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,042
Easy peasy.

245
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,042
Who's getting what stuff?

246
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,083
We're going to the caves tonight.

247
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,792
- You turning into boy scouts?
- Bartosz thinks Erik's dope is there.

248
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,125
Fanny told me they once found a
dead squirrel with five legs there.

249
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,042
You'll believe any old crap.

250
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,708
Just because you can't
see past your nose

251
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,667
doesn't mean there aren't
things going on out there

252
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,917
that the nuclear power mafia
keeps secret from the public.

253
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,625
Don't forget to breathe.

254
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
Franziska.

255
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,333
Magnus.

256
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,417
- You got a crush on her now or what?
- Shut up.

257
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,917
- Hey, idiot.
- Okay, what the hell.

258
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,792
- Let's go to the caves tonight and look.
- Yeah, dude!

259
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,708
Come on.

260
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,667
Can't even hold out half a day?

261
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,667
Impossible. I'm dying.

262
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,458
You coming later?

263
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,708
I don't know.

264
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,625
Everyone will be there.

265
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,125
<i>Gawking at me.</i>

266
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,958
I'll be in Frankfurt this weekend
for training, staying in a hotel.

267
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,625
<i>And... </i>

268
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,042
<i>- Um... Yeah, I thought... </i>
- You thought?

269
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,500
Don't think too long,

270
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,208
<i>I have various candidates.</i>

271
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,750
- See you later.
- <i>Maybe.</i>

272
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Yes, right there.

273
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,000
It's totally knotted up.

274
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,667
It's supposed to rain later.

275
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,000
Scars sense that.

276
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,625
They can see into the
future, so to speak.

277
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,042
The tissue hardens

278
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,292
and cramps up.

279
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,833
Thanks.

280
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,875
Maybe the whole thing is getting
to me more than I thought.

281
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:01,250
In a year, everything here
is meant to come to an end.

282
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,833
Nearly 33 years ago to the
day when I came to Winden.

283
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,708
I never thought it would end like this.

284
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,333
But there's a time for everything.

285
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,917
Yes.

286
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,292
There's a time for everything.

287
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,625
I'm sorry. About the thing with Michael.

288
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,167
How are you doing? How's Jonas?

289
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,042
Good.

290
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,500
We're good.

291
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,583
<i>It's Hannah here. The power's out again.</i>

292
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,083
<i>I mean, if you want us out of
the house, then just say so.</i>

293
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,375
<i>Your grandson hasn't seen
you in over three months.</i>

294
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,083
<i>Do you think Michael wanted that?</i>

295
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,542
<i>That's sick.</i>

296
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,042
<i>You're sick.</i>

297
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:24,083
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE
NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

298
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,417
Hannah!

299
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
How nice.

300
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,042
We haven't seen each other for ages.

301
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,875
How are you?

302
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,500
Okay.

303
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,333
Yeah, well, you know... I'm okay.

304
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,667
Good.

305
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,375
Go inside. I'll be right in, okay?

306
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,333
Hi.

307
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,083
Hi.

308
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,500
Where are Bartosz and the others?

309
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,625
Late. As always.

310
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:27,875
- The thing with Bartosz...
- It's okay. You don't need to explain.

311
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,875
But I want to.

312
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,083
I wrote you a text while you were away.

313
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,667
Not just one.

314
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,250
But I never sent them.

315
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,000
It all sounded wrong somehow.

316
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,000
What happened between us last summer...

317
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,167
- I...
- It's really okay.

318
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:53,917
Something up?

319
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,917
I think I'm having déjÃ  vu.

320
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,167
The light, the forest.

321
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,500
As if all of this has
already happened before.

322
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,000
A glitch in the matrix.

323
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,500
What?

324
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:15,083
If the world is a simulation,
déjÃ  vu is a glitch in the matrix.

325
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,792
Or a message from the other side.

326
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,958
I read that somewhere.

327
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,083
I'm glad you're back.

328
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,667
- Hey, what the hell?
- Parents' meeting.

329
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,292
Heide's got a stomach
bug. I'm stuck with him.

330
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,458
Hi, Jonas. Ultimate fist bump?

331
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,292
Take him back now.

332
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,250
- You take him back.
- Relax, guys.

333
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm not a baby anymore.

334
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,750
What's the idiot doing here?

335
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,917
Only I can do that, okay?

336
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,875
Ouch!

337
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,250
Well, let's go!

338
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,375
It's going to happen again.

339
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,375
It's going to happen again.

340
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,333
It's going to happen again.

341
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,792
You all know that Erik has
been missing for 14 days now.

342
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,250
At this point, we have
no new findings to report.

343
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,333
We're also considering that
he may have simply run away.

344
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:38,458
If any of your children say
anything about Erik or know anything,

345
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:40,833
please inform us.

346
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,333
- Thank you, Charlotte.
- How long do you want to wait?

347
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:46,292
I'd like to talk about
how we interact at school.

348
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,042
And about which measures we
can take to boost security.

349
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,042
What kind of measures?

350
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,042
You heard her say it's not clear
that anything even happened.

351
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,333
But we can't rule anything out,
including that Erik didn't run away.

352
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,083
WILL BE OUTSIDE IN 5 MINUTES

353
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,917
This alarmist talk is absurd.

354
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:05,500
Charlotte, correct me if
I'm wrong, but in the region,

355
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,167
Winden has the lowest crime rate.

356
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,583
There are no murderers
running around here.

357
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:14,375
- Statistics only give...
- But we can't just sit and do nothing.

358
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,667
And just wait around until
Erik is found dead somewhere.

359
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,583
What do you guys think happened to Erik?

360
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,750
Kids in our class are
saying someone kidnapped him,

361
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,250
and has him locked up in a basement.

362
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,208
Oh, shut up. He just ran away.

363
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:40,042
But it could be that he's locked
up somewhere and can't get out.

364
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,833
Why would someone do
that? Lock someone else up?

365
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:46,208
It's like the witch
in Hansel and Gretel.

366
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,500
When she gets hungry,
she has something to eat.

367
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:53,750
No. Even if Mom and Dad tell
you that most people are nice,

368
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,667
there are people out there
who are anything but nice.

369
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,000
- Like your sister.
- You idiot.

370
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,833
My father said good and evil
are a question of perspective.

371
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,375
Dead father, bad topic?

372
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,292
And if Erik is no longer alive?

373
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,792
If he's lying dead somewhere
and no one finds him?

374
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,042
That would be the worst.

375
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,542
Even if you're dead,
you want to be found.

376
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,417
No one is dead, and no
one won't be found, okay?

377
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,542
Can we please change the topic now?

378
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,875
The most important thing
is that we stick together.

379
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,542
That we pull together.

380
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,542
The most important thing is not
to blow this out of proportion,

381
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,958
or we'll have the press
in town in a few days.

382
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:37,083
We know that doesn't quite
fit in with your plans, Regina.

383
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,583
If you mean my hotel, this
isn't about that at all.

384
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,667
- No? What is it about then?
- It's about our town.

385
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,750
Wrong. This is about a missing child.

386
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,917
Who probably just ran away.
You just heard it yourself.

387
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,792
Maybe you should just worry
about your own problems.

388
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,500
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

389
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,583
It's going to happen again.

390
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,958
Helge!

391
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,708
- What are you doing here?
- Is it already too late?

392
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,083
Helge.

393
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,750
It's me, Charlotte.

394
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,167
I'll take you back now, okay?

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,833
It's going to happen again!

396
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,250
I'm bored.

397
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,542
- Can we please go home now?
- Nonsense, we're nearly there.

398
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,167
Jonas!

399
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,292
Come on!

400
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
ATTENTION!

401
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,792
Over there.

402
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,458
In the armchair.

403
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,583
- And?
- Fuck, dude.

404
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,792
- It was here!
- Looking for this?

405
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,792
- What's she doing here?
- That's mine.

406
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,750
The definition of ownership says

407
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:02,208
that possession is nine-tenths
of the law, so it's mine for now.

408
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,458
But I'm selling. What'll
you give me for it?

409
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,542
A kick in the ass.

410
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
What's in here is easily worth 500.

411
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,625
It's yours for 200.
Daddy's got plenty of money.

412
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,500
Stop the bullshit.

413
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,000
Just give it to me.

414
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,458
Jackpot!

415
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,417
What's that?

416
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,458
Someone's there.

417
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh, shit!

418
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,417
Holy shit!

419
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,625
Shit.

420
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,958
- Damn flashlight!
- What is this?

421
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,250
What's that?

422
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,625
- Run!
- Move!

423
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,375
- Run!
- Go!

424
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,583
Come on.

425
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,417
Mikkel?

426
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,542
Mikkel!

427
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,417
Jonas.

428
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,667
What the fuck, man! What was that?

429
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,625
No idea. Shit!

430
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,917
Man, what was that?

431
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,792
Where are Jonas and Mikkel?

432
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,208
Where is Mikkel?

433
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,458
Where is Mikkel?

434
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,792
Why isn't he with you?

435
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,417
He was with you!

436
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,750
Shit! Mikkel!

437
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,250
Mikkel!

438
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,542
Too late.

439
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,208
We're too late.

440
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,125
Mikkel!

441
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,500
Mikkel!

442
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,292
Mikkel!

443
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,292
Mikkel!

444
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,625
Mikkel!

445
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,042
Mikkel?

446
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:02,875
Mikkel!

447
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,833
Mikkel!

448
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,458
Do you have anything?

449
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:18,917
Okay.

450
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,875
Yes?

451
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,292
- Have you found him? <i>
- Nothing.</i>

452
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,917
<i>No trace of Mikkel.</i>

453
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,417
- How's Franziska? <i>
- Sleeping.</i>

454
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,042
Charlotte, I...

455
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,917
<i>Can we... </i>

456
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,125
I have to tell you...

457
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,625
Charlotte?

458
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,833
I have to go.

459
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,458
Okay.

460
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,333
Okay.

461
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:04,167
God grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,

462
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,486
the courage to change the things I can,

463
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,292
and the wisdom to know the difference.

464
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,000
God grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,

465
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,515
the courage to change the things I can,

466
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:16,042
and the wisdom to know the difference.

467

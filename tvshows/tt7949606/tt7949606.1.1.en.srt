[Mr. Gilliard]
<i>The past... it is a dangerous place.</i>

<i>So many decisions that can't be undone.</i>

4
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:40,925
<i>So many ghosts.</i>

5

with the Romanovs,</i>

<i>Russia's royal family.</i>

7
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,925

8
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>The palaces, the balls,</i>

9
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:57,205

10

<i>And then I saw the madness.</i>

11
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,685
<i>The revolution.</i>

12
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,565

[doctor] I understand
they want you to identify her.

26

I worked in the family for 13 years.

She has retrograde amnesia.

Her memories are confused.

33
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,565
It's a common symptom.

You can't silence this, sweetheart,

Are you all right?

The wedding, on top of all this.

[Dr de Orellana] The young Nicholas II
is quiet, indecisive,

00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,365
and very much living in the shadow

63
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,245
of his great, imposing Grand Duke
Uncle Sergei.

64
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,245
To be czar is to be...

field martial, emperor,

66
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:39,845

[Dr de Orellana]
<i>This is like a medieval monarchy</i>

over everything.</i>

70

<i>And what man in the world is qualified
for such a post?</i>

What am I going to do, Sandro?

74
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,165
I'm not ready to be czar.

75
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,245
You were born for this.

76
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,125
I can't run a country.

77
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,005
I have so much more to learn.

78
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,285
And who will teach me now?

79
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,725
You don't need a teacher.

80
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,085
Trust yourself. God chose you.

81
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,605

[sniffs]

83
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,405
[Dr Hetherington] The Russian Empire
that Nicholas II inherits

84
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,165
is one of the largest empires
the world has ever seen.

85
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:49,165
[Montefiore] It was colossal,
it was a sixth of the world's surface.

86
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:53,165
There were over 146 nationalities,
many languages.

87
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:56,485
And the Romanovs have ruled Russia
for almost 300 years.

88
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,165
Their wealth is beyond computation.

89
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,245
An embarrassment of riches.

90
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:07,205
Land, gold mines, diamond mines,

91
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:08,925
the famous Fabergé eggs.

92
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,325
There are palaces everywhere.

Marrying into this world

94

a shy, religious girl

95
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,925
brought up in a tiny German principality.

96
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,045
Ow.

97
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:30,245
[sister] If Catherine the Great wore them,
so can you.

98

Smile, Sunny.

101
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:53,005
Mother and father would have been
so proud of you.

102
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,165
It's all right.

103
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,565
It's been a hell of a few weeks.

104
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,605
Are you sure it's not bad luck?

105
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,805
Having the wedding
while we're all still mourning?

106
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,005
The people say I come to them
behind a coffin.

107
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:10,365
Well, that's not true.

108
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,005
I don't know the customs of this country.

109
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,645
I can't even speak Russian.

110
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,725
[sister, laughing] I can help with that.

111
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,645
I feel such an outsider.

112
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,925
I was a foreign princess once.

113
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,405
[mother] Head up.

114
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,485
Neck straight.

115
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,165
Carry the weight, proudly.

116
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:43,405
Welcome.

117
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:48,485
Czarina, and Empress of all Russia.

118

[Dr de Orellana] Alexandra of Hesse
is a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.

121
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,565
She is deeply religious,
and this obsession with religion

122
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,845
plays a key role
in her marriage to Nicholas

123
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,525
and in her role as Czarina of Russia.

[Dr Hetherington] <i>This marriage is unusual
as a Romanov marriage,</i>

125
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,445
<i>and for a royal marriage in general
in this time period.</i>

126
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:37,045
<i>And that's because
it's very much a love match.</i>

You know, my father was a great leader.

136
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,005
The people adored him.

137
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,925
It's not the people I worry about.

[Alix thinks]<i> It's your family.</i>

[people shouting]

166
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:48,405
[Dr de Orellana] His parents were farmers
and church elders.

167
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:51,605
He was one of eight or nine siblings,

168
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,405
but it would seem that all of them died
in his childhood.

- [people shouting]
- [thumps]

170
00:13:56,925 --> 00:14:00,125
[Montefiore] Rasputin, he drinks,
he fights with his father.

171
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,925
He chases girls.

172
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,765
But, above all...

173
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,605
he's ungovernable. He's fearless.

174

[people shouting]

175
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,325

[Rasputin pants]

179
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,085
Back in his stable.

180
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,645
I only borrowed it.

181
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,405
You stole it!

182
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,085
Thieves must be punished.

183
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,325
[many] Banish him!

184
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,805
I don't want to be a thief.

185
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,005
But we got to eat. Huh?

186
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,645
You've got to eat. You need to eat.

187
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,205
I did a bad thing.

188
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:48,525
But I did it...

189
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:50,725
for my wife...

190
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:51,805
Mm?

191
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,525
[kissing child] and my son.

192
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,365
What do you want to do with him?

193
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,205
[woman yelling] Banish him!

194
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,045
- [woman] Punish him!
- What about my family?

195
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,445
You can't do this.

196
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,565
Give me a chance, hm?

197
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:09,965
Give me a chance.

[laughs]

199
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,045
Send me on a pilgrimage, hm?

200
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:24,725
Come on.

201
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,165
[man] This is my judgment:

202
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:30,165
go on a pilgrimage, turn to God,

203
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:32,965
but leave the village, now.

204
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,485
Will you really go to the monastery?

205
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,325
I don't know.

206
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,365
I won't let you down. Promise.

207
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:52,045

[door rattles]

209
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:58,485
I love you.

210
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,005
[kisses]

211
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:17,285
Rasputin's wife, Praskovya,
is a very long-suffering figure.

212
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,725
It's hard to say
if Praskovya loves Rasputin or not.

213
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:23,685
But she's a constant figure,
a supportive figure.

214
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:34,205
[Smith] When Rasputin picks up
and leaves home as a pilgrim in 1897...

215
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:37,245
he enters what might be considered
his university.

216
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:41,365
He sleeps out of doors,

217
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:47,205
he becomes infinitely aware
of the beauty of the Russian landscape,

218
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:50,805
of Russian life, of folk ways.

219

[roar of thunder]

221
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,165
[Montefiore]
He walked through all weathers,

222
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,405
being soaked, being frozen,
being sunburnt.

223
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,485
It was a really hard,
strange, lonely life.

224
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,885
But one that got him closer to God.

225
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,285
[Dr de Orellana]
Away from the Siberian plains,

226
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,045
Russia is changing ever faster.

227
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,165
[sound of a crowd]

228
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,445
[clink of tools]

229
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,405
[Montefiore]
The telephone replaces the telegram,

230
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,885
cars replace carriages,

231
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,645
electric lights replace lamps.

232
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,725
Nicholas becomes Czar
at the dawn of the modern age.

233
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:41,485
[Dr de Orellana] Russia is industrializing
at breakneck speed,

234
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,925
hundreds of thousands of workers
flock to the big cities,

235
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,045
creating huge social change.

236
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,045
[Montefiore] They're building railways,
building factories.

237
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,045
Conditions there are appalling,

238
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,685
workers' rights are nonexistent.

239
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,925
So there was a great hunger
for new political institutions.

240
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:04,725
[applause]

241
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,725
Nicholas' first speech as Czar

242
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:10,885
is a great opportunity for him to show
what kind of ruler he wants to be.

243
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:13,525
[Montefiore]
In the early part of his reign,

244
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:16,885
Uncle Sergei is probably
Nicky's most important advisor.

245
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,045
He's very dogmatic, extremely right wing.

246
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,805
He's highly religious.

247
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,885
He's the ultimate Romanov hardliner.

248
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:30,605
[Dr de Orellana]
What Nicky is about to say is critical.

249
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:34,245
He can either embrace democracy
and modernity like Western Europe,

250
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:38,165
or he can choose to remain
an absolute monarch.

251
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,925
[Nicky] I'm aware...

252
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,565
that recently in some <i>zemstvos...</i>

253
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:50,645
the people have been
carried away with senseless dreams

254
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:53,125
of taking part
in the business of government.

255
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:55,685
Let everyone know...

256
00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:00,565
that I will retain the principles
of autocracy...

257
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,085
as firmly...

258
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,325
and unbendingly...

259
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,965
as my unforgettable late father.

260
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,965
[applause]

261
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,565
[Montefiore] It's Sergei who tells him
to give the speech,

262
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:23,605
and he encourages Nicholas
to embrace sacred autocracy

263
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,805
as the only way to rule Russia.

264
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,405
Good speech.

265
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:32,605
It's a terrible mistake.
He stamps out any possibility of reform.

266
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,725
[Dr Hetherington]
By showing he has no intention

267
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,565
of sharing power democratically,

268
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,485
Nicholas lays the foundations
of his own demise.

269
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,925
[applause]

270
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,765
[Smith]
Rasputin visits various monasteries,

271
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:59,325
including Verkhoturye, which is
one of the great monasteries of Russia.

272
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:03,485
And he meets with the monks,

273
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,525
and he learns the gospels
practically by heart.

274
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,725
And he becomes steeped
in Russian Orthodoxy.

275
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,605
But there's too much control,

276
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:19,165
there's too much order, there's too much
discipline, there's too much routine.

277
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,445
I can't find God here.

278
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,005
Come with me.

279
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:32,525
[Montefiore] Rasputin is a free spirit,
and he seeks out some of the cults

280
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,205
who have a different
and much more instinctive,

281
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:38,365
and much more passionate
approach to religion.

[gasping and moaning continues]

300
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:59,805
The Khlysty,
which means "whips" in English,

301
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,125
are one of the most notorious
of all Russian sects.

302
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,525
They're illegal, they operate in secret,

303
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:10,845
and they engage in all sorts
of wild orgiastic rites and rituals.

304
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,725
[moaning]

305
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:16,565
There's even talk
that they cut off the breast of a virgin

306
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,805
and eat it at the end of their rites.

307
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,485
But there is a logic under lies it all.

308
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,205
If one does not sin, one cannot repent.

309
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,245
And without repenting,
one cannot be saved.

310
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,485
And this suits Rasputin
right down to the ground.

311
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:38,405
He's a man of enormous sexual appetite,
he's a heavy drinker,

312
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,645
he loves women, and he adopts this idea

313
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:47,205
of sin leading to redemption
as the essence of his own faith.

314
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:51,045
[Smith]
Rasputin has a true religious experience.

315
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,565
And this launches him
into becoming a holy pilgrim,

316
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:57,845
a new man imbued with religious fervor,

317

of the empire for many years.

[Dr de Orellana] For Nicky's coronation

00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:44,525
from the Czar to his people.

326
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,965
[Dr Alexandrova] The gifts include
a kerchief, a commemorative mug,

327
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:54,045
sausage, gingerbread, so it sounds
wonderful to a regular Russian peasant.

328
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,725
They flocked to the field even before dawn

329
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:02,405
and some even walked on foot from Siberia
in their Bass shoes.

330
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,125
[knocking]

331
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:22,725
That's fine, I'm done.

332
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,445
Looking good.

333
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:27,525
Feeling shit.

334
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,525
Couldn't sleep.

335
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,085
You know, you're lucky, you'll never know
responsibility like mine.

336
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:36,285
I'll never know money like yours either.

337
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,725
Or power.

338
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:39,845
Are you ready?

339
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:42,125
[sighing] As I'll ever be.

340
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:46,805
- Are you?
- [Uncle] You wanted to see me?

341
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,245
How are the plans for Khodynka?

342
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,165
A fucking nightmare.

343
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:56,645
Too many peasants in one place,
all wanting free food and drink.

344
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,845
You should send more Cossacks
for crowd control.

345
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:03,205
I don't want to waste time and money
on Cossacks.

346
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:05,965
It will be fine.

347
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,165
Do you want me to go after him?

348
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:13,885
You'll only aggravate him.

349
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,245
Isn't that the point?

350
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,165
[laughs]

351
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,165
Today is about us.

352
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,005
[hubbub continues]

353
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,405
[Monetfiore] Uncle Sergei is in charge
of the public event

354
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:39,765
and he really is expecting
2- 300,000 peasants.

355
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:45,565
In fact, 800,000 peasants turn up.

356
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:52,845
The problem is that this feast has been
very badly organized by Uncle Sergei.

357
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,285
The field has been torn apart
by military exercises,

358
00:25:56,365 --> 00:26:00,005
and only a few planks have been put down
to cover deep trenches.

359
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,765
There are very few policemen
to keep security.

360
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:07,845
[Dr Alexandrova]
The people in the stalls start panicking.

361
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:11,725
They start hurling
those packages into the crowd.

362
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:15,565
[hubbub escalates]

363
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:19,805
Everyone starts to rush towards where
they believe the presents are being given.

364
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:21,765
[shouting]

365
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,885
[Dr Alexandrova]
People start falling to the ground,

366
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:26,925
human dominos,
other people trample upon them.

367
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:28,925
This scene is horrible carnage.

368
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:38,205
[choir singing]

369
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:49,445
[Montefiore] The coronation
of a Russian Czar was magnificent,

370
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:54,325
majestic, jewel-infested, exquisite,
the cost was extraordinary.

371
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,365
The rituals were complex and ancient.

372
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:04,685
Everything was designed to project wealth,

373
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:08,005
power and the glory of the dynasty.

374
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,085
The coronation really defines the emperor

375
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,645
as a ruler whose power comes from God.

376
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,725
And Nicholas completely believes this
and embraces it.

377
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:27,805
[choir singing]

378
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:28,885

[hushed murmurs]

380
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,125
[whispers] It doesn't mean anything.

381
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,565
Oh, Lord, God of our fathers.

382
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:07,205
[Nicholas] You have chosen me
as sovereign and judge over your people.

383
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:12,765
I confess to your inscrutable providence
in selecting me.

384
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,285
Inspire and enlighten my path,

385
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:21,405
and direct my actions
in this awe-inspiring mission.

386
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:28,725
May the wisdom that descends always
from your throne...

387
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,845
abide with me.

388
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:06,685
[applause]

389
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,005
How many dead?

390
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:24,725
[Uncle] It is yet to be confirmed.

391
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,525
A hundred?

392
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:36,165
- More?
- As I say, it is yet to be confirmed.

393
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:41,605
- How many hundred?
- Unfortunately, we are talking thousands...

394
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:42,565
Thousands?

395
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:46,085
It is yet to be confirmed.

396
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:50,885
- We must cancel the celebrations.
- I would advise against that.

397
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:54,085
But surely
we must acknowledge the tragedy.

398
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,205
It is only a tragedy...

399
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,365
if you make it one.

400
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:07,365
Where you lead, others follow.

401
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:13,845
[footsteps fade]

402
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:25,205
[Montefiore] 2000, 3000 bodies of peasants

403
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:30,085
lie on this coronation field,
where soon there are to be festivities,

404
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:33,445
the Czar, the Grand Duke,
the Royal Family are to arrive.

405
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:39,045
[cheering from the crowd]

406
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:44,645
[cheering continues]

407
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:48,605
And some of the bodies,
they just pile into carts.

408
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:52,205
So that as the royal family
are going out to the Khodynka field,

409
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,285
they pass carriages where they think
the people are waving at them

410
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:57,885
and suddenly, as they get close,
they realize

411
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:00,965
that these are all dead people,
crushed to death.

412
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:06,045
Nicky should have done
what a modern politician would do,

413
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,805
go to all the hospitals, and be seen...

414
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:11,885
to be visiting and showing love
for his people.

415
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:17,765
[chamber music plays]

416
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:22,525
What he, in fact, does is to make
a decision against his better judgment,

417
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:26,805
to go to the party of the Marquis
de Montebello, the French ambassador.

418
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:02,205
[Alix] I can't. It's not right.

419
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,805
Just this one,
then we'll have done our duty.

420
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:13,405
[playing "Symphonie Fantastique"]

421
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,365
This will come back to haunt us.

422
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:32,005
There's no room for sentimentality
in politics.

423
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:35,405
You should have sent more Cossacks
to manage the crowds.

424
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:38,285
The people won't forgive him.

425
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,325
Grow up.

426
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:45,605
This blood will stain his reign.

[Dr de Orellana]
In the first day of his reign,

430
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:57,885
the Czar and his German wife

431
00:32:57,965 --> 00:32:59,685
were dancing and drinking,

432
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:02,845
even as hundreds and thousands
of Muscovites had been killed.

433

[Montefiore] And from this point onwards,
he is known as Nicholas the Bloody.

434
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:11,165
It's a disastrous beginning
to Nicholas' reign.

He has a feral charisma.

00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:26,805
[shouts]

486
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,485
- [doctor] Push! Push it!
- [shouts]

487
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:31,565
[screams]

488
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:37,325
- [gasping]
- [baby crying]

489
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:41,885
- [Alix gasps]
- [baby cries]

490
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:44,485
Tell me.
[panting]

491
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,005
We have a beautiful, healthy baby.

492
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,725
[gasps] I'm sorry.

493
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,885
- [baby cries]
- [Alix] Oh.

494
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:59,645
A son would belong to the people.

495
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,405
This little girl is ours.

496
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,805
Hello, Anastasia.

497
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:12,485
[male narrator] <i>In Greek,</i>

498
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:17,165
<i>the name Anastasia means,
"the one who is reborn."</i>

499
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:24,685
<i>Now I had to ask
if she truly had been resurrected.</i>

500
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,085
The eyes are the same.

501
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,325
But not the face.

502
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:33,925
There may be good reasons for that.

503
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:35,965
Her jaw's been broken.

504
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,685
She has missing teeth.

505
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:42,685
She's been through serious emotional
and physical trauma.

506
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:47,525
I don't know if anyone
could have survived that massacre.

507
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:55,205
[clock ticks]

508
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:56,365
[faint screams]

509
00:39:56,445 --> 00:39:57,445
[bang]

510
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,045
[baby crying]

511
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:05,365
[Mr. Gilliard] <i>One thing that is certain,</i>

512
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:10,165
<i>is that the birth of Anastasia
was both a blessing and a curse.</i>

513
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:16,565
<i>More than ever, Nicholas and Alexandra
needed a son and heir.</i>

514
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:20,605
[whispers] Come back to bed.

515
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:25,445
We need help.

516
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,605
[narrator]
<i>And their desperation would open a door...</i>

517
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:31,005
[Alix] There must be something we can do.

518
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:34,605
[narrator] <i>...to a darkness
that would destroy their world.</i>

519
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,685
There must be someone.

520
00:40:37,305 --> 00:41:37,603

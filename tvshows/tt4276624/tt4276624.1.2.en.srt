1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,600
Val of House El!

2
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,802
You are hereby sentenced to death.

3
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,648
Your family will now be
considered Rankless,

4
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:09,128
without name, without honor.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,330
No! Grandpa!

6
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:14,266
- He's got a bomb!
- Death to the Voice of Rao!

7
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>You did a brave thing.</i>

8
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:17,970
You are to be assigned a new surname.

9
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:20,638
My name. Vex.

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,474
We never ask for mercy.

11
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,144
Do you understand, Lyta-Zod?

12
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:27,745
Yes, mother.

13
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:29,647
What the hell were you thinking, Seg?

14
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:31,615
You gonna un-cuff me or what?

15
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:33,985
Nyssa here has yet
to be paired with someone.

16
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:35,219
As my youngest daughter,

17
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:36,487
you will be Binding with her.

18
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:37,854
I'm happy for you.

19
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:40,246
- It's not like I want to be a Vex.
- What's not to want?

20
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:42,392
<i>You've got better food, better air.</i>

21
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,641
- You're gonna be one of them again.
- But not as an El.

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,496
- Mom?
- It's time you learned the truth.

23
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,046
Your grandfather was no traitor.
He was a hero.

24
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:51,921
My son didn't steal the skimmer. I did!

25
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:53,905
Who was your accomplice, Charys?

26
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:54,891
It was me!

27
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:55,993
No!

28
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,326
No!

29
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:58,995
<i>My name is Adam Strange.</i>

30
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,497
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

31
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,768
This belongs to your grandson, Kal-El.

32
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:05,401
Once this cape is gone, our time's up.

33
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,836
<i>This thing that's coming...</i>

34
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,470
<i>It's known as The Collector of Worlds,</i>

35
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,606
<i>but its true name is Brainiac,</i>

36
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,700
<i>and it seems your parents
gave their lives</i>

37
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:14,740
<i>because they knew this threat
needed to be stopped,</i>

38
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:17,918
and they believed
that you could stop it.

39
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:34,815
Does this really belong to my grandson?

40
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:36,183
Yeah.

41
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,685
Then why isn't he here?

42
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,054
Why you?

43
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,857
Uh, he sent me in his place.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,859
Kind of a big deal where I'm from.

45
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,661
Lot of reasons, but mainly because

46
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,129
I can teleport across light-years

47
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,231
using a little something
called a Zeta Beam.

48
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,568
I know. It's a cool name, huh?

49
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,638
Came up with it myself.

50
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,640
Only problem is, uh,

51
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,209
one passenger per ride, me,

52
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,579
and... it's a little temperamental.

53
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,848
You don't believe me.

54
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,751
How do you think
that I got to this fortress?

55
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:15,120
Do you...

56
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,689
You think that I power-walked
across the ice to get here?

57
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:22,360
Everything that I am
telling you is true.

58
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,029
Trust me.

59
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,726
Even if I did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

60
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,236
Can't help you.

61
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,537
What is the matter with you?

62
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,984
Look, I don't know
what you expect of me,

63
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,784
but I don't understand a thing
about all this.

64
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,786
My parents died before
they could explain it to me.

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,576
Great, then we can
figure this out together.

66
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:41,922
I don't have time to argue this.

67
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,846
I have to get back to Kandor.

68
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,015
Time?

69
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,816
We don't have any. Brainiac is coming,

70
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,229
and he ain't waiting for you
to square away

71
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,020
whatever it is you think needs doing.

72
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:52,855
Now, I am talking about
millions of lives,

73
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,724
so get your head out of your
ass and into the game.

74
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,659
I don't care what a big deal
you might be

75
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,860
on the planet Detroit.

76
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,463
This is Krypton.

77
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:04,066
I gave you my answer.

78
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:06,568
Guess I had the wrong guy.

79
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,113
And it's Earth.

80
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:13,931
Sorry?

81
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,195
I'm a big deal on Earth,

82
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,430
not planet Detroit.

83
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,965
Well, I suggest

84
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,545
you get on your beam and get back there.

85
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,536
There's someone I need to deal with.

86
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,037
Wait!

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,773
Do you think that I could just

88
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,599
get a ride back to the city?

89
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,943
<i>So this guy you're so eager to see...</i>

90
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,693
<i>- Daron-Vex.
- Yeah, him.</i>

91
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,417
<i>You say he's the chief what now?</i>

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,521
- City's chief magistrate.
- Chief magistrate, huh?

93
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,799
Guy like that probably has

94
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,182
a bunch of valuable information

95
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,757
right at his fingertips.

96
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,709
Strange, just don't.

97
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,935
I'm just saying, if you were curious,

98
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:52,317
you could probably use this guy,

99
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,638
gain access to the city's
deep space sensors,

100
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,918
which I promise you, will show you

101
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,542
a big, ugly, organic life form

102
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,144
headed this way.

103
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,179
If you want to honor
what your parents died for,

104
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,313
- at least...
- Don't

105
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:04,614
talk to me about my parents.

106
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,950
I know exactly how
I'm going to honor them.

107
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,219
I just need to get close to him,

108
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,488
and not get arrested the moment
I set foot up there.

109
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,656
If you're thinking about revenge,

110
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,992
which you obviously are, don't.

111
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:19,061
At least look into
what I'm saying first,

112
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:21,297
and if I'm wrong, hey, man, have at it.

113
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,731
Get your revenge on.

114
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,333
But if I'm right,

115
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:26,135
work with me.

116
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:28,170
When we're done putting
the foot to alien ass,

117
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:31,207
I will help you murk
this son of a bitch myself.

118
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,575
Deal?

119
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,643
You know, you really
stand out, wearing this.

120
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,611
Go find Kem at the tavern.
Tell him I sent you.

121
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:38,646
He'll, uh, hook you up
with a change of clothes.

122
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,486
Seriously?

123
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,226
Hello, Seg.

124
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,493
We've been looking for you.

125
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,994
Yeah, what's new?

126
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:23,863
Rankless amateur.

127
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,695
Come on. March!

128
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,974
I hope you didn't break him.

129
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,309
No, just a little love-tap.

130
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,545
He'll be all right.

131
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,513
He better be.

132
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,148
You can leave now.

133
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,559
What's going on?

134
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,796
My father is waiting for you,

135
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,598
along with His Reverence.

136
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,370
I suggest you clean yourself up
and get changed.

137
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:18,307
You really don't want to
keep them waiting much longer.

138
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,474
Trust me.

139
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,277
You bear the sigil
of House Vex from now on.

140
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:36,430

141
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,100
We have been expecting you...

142
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:47,801
For some time.

143
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:49,136
Apologies, Father.

144
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,908
Entirely my fault.

145
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,744
Now, Seg.

146
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,814
Oh.

147
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,217
You are interested in the mask?

148
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,818
Course, it would be the first time

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,287
you've seen the many faces up close.

150
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,459
A face to symbolize
each of our old gods.

151
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,296
Cythonna,

152
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,197
Telle,

153
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,999
Lorra,

154
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,735
Mordo,

155
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:26,070
Yuda,

156
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,539
and finally, the one true god,

157
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:31,409
our supreme deity, Rao.

158
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,211
He who kindled the sun.

159
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,616
We used to worship all of the gods,

160
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:41,653
but now, only one.

161
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,622
Do you know why?

162
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,025
At the time of creation,

163
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,927
Rao looked out at the chaos

164
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,996
and saw wasted potential,

165
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,200
and so he formed the stars and planets,

166
00:07:57,303 --> 00:08:00,845
the most perfect of which
became Krypton.

167
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,008
You see,

168
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,477
our very planet is a symbol of

169
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,579
fully realized potential, Seg.

170
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:14,550
It is also harsh and inhospitable.

171
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,787
The only thing protecting us
is the force dome,

172
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,756
and the only thing
protecting the dome is...

173
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,494
Order.

174
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:31,199
Sadly, your parents chose chaos.

175
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,134
I need to know if you intend

176
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:35,902
to follow in their footsteps.

177
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,606
I don't.

178
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,380
The Investiture Ceremony
will be held tomorrow night,

179
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:49,683
and then you officially become a Vex.

180
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:50,850
Don't be late.

181
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,721
You are dismissed.

182
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:05,654
Come on, guys. Line up.

183
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,951
Come and get your brand-new,
state-of-the-art firepower.

184
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,896
All new blasters.

185
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,840
Blow your whole chest cavity out.

186
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,249
Feel the weight of it, much lighter

187
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,419
and much quicker.

188
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,654
You look after that.

189
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,546
Commander?

190
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,949
What is all this?

191
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,418
Mommy didn't tell you?

192
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,254
New offensive.

193
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,600
We're going down to the Rankless

194
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:27,855
to smoke out Black Zero.

195
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:31,025
This looks like we're going to war.

196
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,394
Well, shit yeah, we're going to war.

197
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,429
The Rankless are not our enemy.

198
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,564
Black Zero is.

199
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,399
Well, who can be bothered

200
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,234
sorting out your actual terrorists

201
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,236
from your regular, everyday,

202
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:45,405
Rankless shitheads?

203
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:48,542
All right, boys. Who's ready to crack
some Rankless skulls?

204
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,648
Quex is right.

205
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:57,417
You know the El name
was already synonymous

206
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,419
with resistance amongst the Rankless.

207
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,620
Val-El's execution made sure of it.

208
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,722
Now with Ter and Charys,

209
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,225
Black Zero have new martyrs
for their rallying cry.

210
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,526
They weren't terrorists.

211
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,027
They confessed to it,

212
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:10,496
and I bet my life

213
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:11,897
their son is, too,

214
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,031
and now he gets to

215
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,866
walk amongst us up here in the guilds.

216
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:16,095
It's not right.

217
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,603
You know what Quex is like.

218
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:20,004
If he leads this thing,
it will be a bloodbath.

219
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,106
Innocent lives will be...

220
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,675
You know, I never really
cared about the scars.

221
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,444
Sometimes, I even forget
I still have them.

222
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,986
- Dev...
- Or the ache in my shoulder

223
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:31,349
that wakes me up every single day.

224
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,750
I can live with that too.

225
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:34,652
What I can't live with

226
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,486
is knowing the people responsible

227
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,654
were never found.

228
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,155
They get to live free somewhere,

229
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:41,157
while my family...

230
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,994
Maybe...

231
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:48,332
not all Rankless are Black Zero,

232
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,934
but they provide cover for them,

233
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:52,668
so please don't talk to me again

234
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,437
about innocent lives.

235
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,082
Primus Zod, a word, please.

236
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:08,384
Quickly.

237
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,452
This new offensive.

238
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:11,964
The Rankless Initiative. What about it?

239
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,789
It's only going to breed
more resentment.

240
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,692
Our people are divided enough
without this.

241
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:21,529
Black Zero almost
assassinated the Voice of Rao.

242
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,198
Until he was saved by a Rankless.

243
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:27,701
I can't see them putting
their lives on the line for him

244
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:31,037
after we destroy what little
they have down there,

245
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,887
or after you've gunned down
two of their own

246
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,142
in the Tribunal.

247
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,833
I executed two self-confessed terrorists

248
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,581
who pulled weapons
on the chief magistrate,

249
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,650
as is my duty.

250
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,885
You had best be very careful

251
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,655
of what comes out of
your mouth next, Lyta.

252
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,055
Or perhaps you'd care to explain

253
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:51,758
what compels you to defend the Rankless

254
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,526
at every chance you get?

255
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,161
I just...

256
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,364
I have to believe there's another way.

257
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,232
You have neither the right

258
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:02,734
nor the rank to question this.

259
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,969
And given your recent
training performances,

260
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,539
your focus should be on staying alive.

261
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,240
Nothing more,

262
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,677
nothing less.

263
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,512
Is that clear enough for you?

264
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:16,481
Loud and clear, Primus.

265
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:36,733
I got your message.

266
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,501
You okay?

267
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:52,514
What happened to my parents...

268
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,217
I know it had nothing to do with you...

269
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,085
really, I do...

270
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,817
but at the same time, I can't forget

271
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:00,463
what your mother did.

272
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:07,095
I understand.

273
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:09,230
I just don't know
what I'm meant to do now.

274
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,602
There are so many things
in our lives we can't control.

275
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,203
Only you know

276
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:18,172
what's inside you,

277
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,241
what you're capable of.

278
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,145
You just need to be true to yourself.

279
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,713
We both do.

280
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,295
Seg?

281
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:47,065
You look troubled.

282
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,101
Is something on your mind?

283
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,837
I wanted to ask you about my parents.

284
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,307
I'd like to perform
traditional funeral rights.

285
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,577
It's out of the question, I'm afraid.

286
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,578
Your parents died as

287
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,281
enemies of the state.

288
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,949
I'm sorry, Seg.

289
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,752
I lost my parents when I was, uh...

290
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:09,921
a few years younger than you are now.

291
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,457
I thought I'd never recover,

292
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,825
but I did,

293
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:17,728
and you will too.

294
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,996
You remind me of him, you know.

295
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,532
Your grandfather, that is.

296
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:26,870
You're going to be a Vex soon.

297
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,639
Maybe it's time we talked about

298
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,731
the history between our two houses.

299
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,844
Maybe I can help you understand

300
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,613
what happened all those years ago.

301
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,451
With your grandfather.

302
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,285
What people fail to realize is

303
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,354
how much I admired Val.

304
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,926
We were so close, once.

305
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,730
But what Val was doing...

306
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,599
It threatened our whole way of life.

307
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,039
He developed a highly advanced
computer system,

308
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:08,542
but of course, he refused
to reveal its location.

309
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,447
Through this technology,
he claimed to have

310
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,816
detected a... presence,

311
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,886
many millions of light-years away.

312
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:23,624
He said it was collecting worlds, and...

313
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:27,393
eventually, it would come for Krypton.

314
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,563
And you didn't believe him?

315
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,832
Of course not.

316
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,801
You see, Seg...

317
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,974
Even great men can lose their way,

318
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,041
and that's the tragedy here.

319
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,309
If not for this obsession,

320
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,655
Val could have gone on to achieve

321
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,012
so much more for our people.

322
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,514
His legacy could've

323
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:49,948
lived on forever.

324
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,851
He could've been immortalized.

325
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,953
Maybe his legacy can live on.

326
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,923
If you admired him
as much as you say, then...

327
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,527
Let me continue his work

328
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,328
His earlier work,

329
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,663
with the Science Guild.

330
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,599
Let me serve Kandor the way he did.

331
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,575
Wow, you look...

332
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,443
You look. Are you sure

333
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,546
Seg is gonna pay for those?

334
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,047
Absolutely.

335
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,182
And you know, I'm offended.

336
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,685
He was very clear. Change of clothes,

337
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,953
no expense spared.

338
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,121
Oh, clearly.

339
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,255
And, uh,

340
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:36,792
he also said something
to quench my thirst.

341
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:38,493
Extremely clear about that one.

342
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,128
Did he? Okay.

343
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,564
Well, enjoy.

344
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,938
Well, this looks positively intriguing,

345
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,940
and I am dying to hear all about it,

346
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,074
but can we just have a...

347
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,909
a little word in private first?

348
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:57,879
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

349
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,513
- Yeah.
- It's not about you.

350
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,248
Just...

351
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,550
Okay.

352
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,888
What in the name of Rao is going on?

353
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,790
Firstly, you disappear without a trace,

354
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:11,135
and then you show up, looking like this,

355
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,059
then this guy shows up,

356
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,526
says that you sent him,

357
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,006
and starts telling
crazy stories about...

358
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,897
I know, I know, I know, they...

359
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,865
- They sound crazy.
- Yeah.

360
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,567
They might...

361
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,502
actually be true.

362
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,205
Seg, listen.

363
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:27,851
I know you've been going
through a lot lately.

364
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,809
I'm fine.

365
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:30,911
Trust me.

366
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,279
Okay, okay.

367
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:37,382
You know, I like Candy Crush
as much as the next guy,

368
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:40,885
- but this is...
- Shut up and listen, Earth man.

369
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,954
I took your advice earlier,

370
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,656
so now I'm a member
of the Science Guild.

371
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:46,057
They gave me that

372
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,493
and unlimited access
to their data banks.

373
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,035
Ah, see, I told you that that was...

374
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,562
I'm not finished.

375
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:52,831
You said you could find proof

376
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,966
to back up your claims about Brainiac.

377
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,434
Here's your chance.

378
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:58,736
But I'm not going to let you
string me along forever.

379
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,638
You have two hours.

380
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,973
If you don't come up with
anything by then,

381
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:05,342
I'm going to finish
what I went up there to do.

382
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:19,932
Commander,

383
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,441
do you have a moment?

384
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:26,042
I've already been informed
of your complaints.

385
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:27,443
Concerns, not complaints.

386
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:30,312
You should've come to me first.

387
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:31,880
You made me look like a punk.

388
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:34,417
You don't need my help with that.

389
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,152
What did you just say?

390
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:39,354
Commander Quex-Ul.

391
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:40,922
I, Lyta-Zod,

392
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,691
hereby invoke the spirit of Jo-Mon,

393
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,056
and our ancient traditions,

394
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,829
in challenging you to a Kandorian duel.

395
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,364
- Lyta...
- You silly girl.

396
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,765
Of which the victor

397
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:53,468
will assume command of this division

398
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,037
and the right for their voice
to be heard

399
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,304
above all others.

400
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,041
Lyta, please.

401
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,609
Don't do this.

402
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,778
If you go through with it,
there's nothing I can do.

403
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,580
Quex is bound by Kandorian rite

404
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:09,216
to show no mercy.
That means to the death.

405
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:10,438
You think I don't know that?

406
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,252
Then please explain this to me.

407
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,320
- Tell me why.
- Sagitari Zod,

408
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:15,955
inside.

409
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,457
Now.

410
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,303
What is the meaning of this?

411
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,670
I challenged my commander

412
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,084
for the right to lead our division.

413
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:37,342
I am not required to give a reason.

414
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,478
I'm asking for one.

415
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,114
As my superior?

416
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,281
As your mother.

417
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,184
My mother who doesn't believe her child

418
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,519
is capable of being a warrior.

419
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,854
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

420
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,090
I see it in your eyes, Mother.

421
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,758
I always have.

422
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,727
You try to hide it, but you don't think

423
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,363
I will ever be worthy of the Zod name.

424
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,532
- That's not true.
- It is.

425
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,535
And it's fine.

426
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,104
But it's not going to stop me.

427
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,532
You and I both know

428
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,845
there's no turning back from this.

429
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,950
May Rao's grace be your shield.

430
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,197
Nothing on the satellite array.

431
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,800
Nothing on the deep space sensors.

432
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,262
It's not just Kandor City, either.

433
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,936
This is connected to

434
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,605
the Guild's planet-wide network.

435
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,108
There's nothing out there.

436
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,546
No, that can't be right.

437
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,314
It's a mistake. Check that again.

438
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,251
Seg...

439
00:20:58,353 --> 00:20:59,631
- Well, that's it, then.
- Seg...

440
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,687
Seg, hey, come on...

441
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,855
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

442
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,558
Just wait.

443
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Give us a second.

444
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,168
Seg, please think about
what you are doing.

445
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,270
Okay? Forget this idiot.

446
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:18,537
Let's just you and I

447
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:19,871
sit down and talk it over.

448
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:22,575
All I've done is think about this,

449
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,210
and I'm done talking.

450
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:25,678
If you do this,

451
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,279
you are throwing away everything.

452
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:30,381
There's nothing left to throw away.

453
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:39,624
You look me in the eye

454
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,593
and you tell me

455
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:43,361
that what you've been saying is true.

456
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:47,531
I swear to God.

457
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,966
Well, then, we'd better
find another way to prove it,

458
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,854
or else our boy
is gonna get himself killed.

459
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,701
You're a quick learner.

460
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:28,150
You've hardly been up here,

461
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:30,541
and you already look sure of yourself.

462
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,351
About my father,

463
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,672
he's...

464
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,918
always had a flair
for the dramatic, but...

465
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:43,757
You said your father
only thinks that he chose me.

466
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:46,460
If this really was your choice,

467
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:47,961
then maybe you can tell me why.

468
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,699
First, I want to show you something.

469
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,577
It's my parents ashes.

470
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,282
But you could be arrested for this.

471
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,185
I know.

472
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:15,020
Then why?

473
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:18,323
Everyone deserves a chance

474
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:20,125
to say good-bye to the ones they love.

475
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:23,962
No matter the circumstances.

476
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,136
Nyssa.

477
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,874
Thank you.

478
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:43,337
Climatology reports,
atmospheric physics,

479
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:46,039
- meteorological phenomena...
- Bam! That's it!

480
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:47,142
Check for anomalies.

481
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:48,609
Uh, anomalies. Okay.

482
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,744
Um... Hm.

483
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:52,656
Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

484
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
The meteor shower reported
in the Outlands.

485
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,215
Is it recent?

486
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:58,451
Yeah, three days ago.

487
00:24:58,553 --> 00:24:59,818
Okay, we gotta check that out.

488
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Well, okay, but, I mean,

489
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:04,357
I guess we can tag along
with a salvage crew,

490
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,525
but it's illegal,

491
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:06,903
so we're gonna have to bribe them.

492
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:09,327
Great. Let's go.

493
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,795
What?

494
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:11,996
Hm?

495
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,309
Why are you looking at me like that?

496
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,033
Well, I'm not exactly flush,

497
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:17,235
but there might be another way.

498
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:19,871
It may just cost you that head cover.

499
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:21,373
My...

500
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,988
No more hiding.

501
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,256
- What?
- All your life,

502
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,524
you've hidden your truth,

503
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,793
like it's something to be ashamed of.

504
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,561
I've always seen it,

505
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:47,263
when nobody else has, even your mother.

506
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:52,034
You are not Sagitari.

507
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:57,307
You are Lyta of House Zod.

508
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:58,874
You are a warrior...

509
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:01,443
And you always have been.

510
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:30,738
Rhom, Ona.

511
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,106
I'm...

512
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,007
I'm sorry. I... I, um...

513
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,676
- I wasn't expecting you.
- We just wanted to stop by

514
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:38,044
and pay our respects.

515
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:40,913
Your mom and dad...

516
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:44,226
They were always willing
to look after Ona

517
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,852
when I worked nights.

518
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,521
Never asked for anything in return.

519
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,629
I hope you know
how much they meant to us.

520
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,140
Thank you.

521
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:13,378
Thank you both.

522
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,727
A thousand cycles ago,

523
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,976
the ancient warrior Jo-Mon

524
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:20,061
faced a challenge

525
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:23,780
that would change Krypton forever.

526
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,986
Jo-Mon invited his detractors

527
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:28,307
to the highest peak

528
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,643
of the Jewel Mountains

529
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:32,645
and challenged them,

530
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,380
one by one,

531
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:36,382
to a duel to the death.

532
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:39,050
His victory

533
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:39,984
ushered in

534
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,820
the first golden age of peace

535
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,390
in Krypton's history.

536
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:46,891
If one believes

537
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,827
they are worthy of true leadership,

538
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,530
it is not only their right,

539
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:55,614
but their obligation to act on it.

540
00:27:57,102 --> 00:28:00,036
Fight with honor.

541
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,141
Fight with pride,

542
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:08,478
and fight without mercy.

543
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:10,647
Begin.

544
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:39,330
"The blood of House El
will forever bind us."

545
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,299
The blood of House El.

546
00:30:27,878 --> 00:30:29,410
Hello, Seg.

547
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,895
Grandpa, you...

548
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,364
You're not...

549
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:51,565
I'm afraid not, Seg.

550
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,335
I'm a projection.

551
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,337
A copy of Val-El.

552
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,374
I share his thoughts
and memories, but...

553
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:02,441
in essence,

554
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:05,310
I'm a computer program.

555
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:06,945
You knew they were coming for you.

556
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:09,448
I suspected it.

557
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,852
But I knew I had
a responsibility to you, Seg.

558
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:15,454
That's why I created this program.

559
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:17,322
To guide you.

560
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,858
To educate you

561
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,892
when the time came.

562
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:23,461
Well, there's a chance
that time has arrived.

563
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:27,399
Well, then, we better get started.

564
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,394
Seems to love that arm clock.

565
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,855
Oh, yeah, he really loves it.

566
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:41,211
Ooh, yeah, he's... he's tough.

567
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,380
Used to wrestle.

568
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,283
But, um, there it is.

569
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:49,686
We're good, yeah?

570
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:50,687
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

571
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,156
Mm.

572
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,824
- I... I told you.
- Come...

573
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,058
I told you.

574
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,605
You said we had to get to the Outlands.

575
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:00,496
This is the price we pay, okay?

576
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:02,298
Good deal.

577
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
It's weird, anyway.

578
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:05,100
It's like your forehead's got a beak.

579
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,869
Just...

580
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,574
Oh. Oh.

581
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:15,310
Mwa! Beautiful!

582
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,503
This way.

583
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,274
We're in.

584
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:23,919
He's not even a fan.

585
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,155
And Tharb-El,

586
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,223
also a member of the Science Guild,

587
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:32,292
discovered a cure for the Green Death,

588
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:35,930
which almost drove our planet
to extinction.

589
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,665
Seg, it would take millennia

590
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:40,067
for me to detail
the achievements of our house.

591
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:43,337
The important thing to remember is

592
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,346
their greatness

593
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,973
lives on in you.

594
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,176
The blood of House El.

595
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,813
You are the torchbearer
for our legacy now.

596
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,015
You must keep that flame alive,

597
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:59,151
pass it on to the next generation.

598
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:00,987
If you believe in yourself,

599
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:02,754
the way I always have,

600
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,400
your accomplishments
will stand alongside

601
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:07,192
all those who came before you,

602
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:10,261
and will forever inspire
those that follow.

603
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,599
Then tell me about Brainiac.

604
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,767
Help me find a way to stop him.

605
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,369
Well, there's not much to tell.

606
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:20,137
Once the Council moved to silence me,

607
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,640
I continued my work here,

608
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:26,911
where I created
the most incredible technology

609
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,913
that allowed me to enter

610
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,748
the interdimensional realm

611
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,216
which lay beyond

612
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:34,819
the normal space-time continuum.

613
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:37,020
I called it the "Phantom Zone."

614
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,023
You have a better name?

615
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,725
Eh...

616
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,427
No, no, it's a cool n...
It's a cool name. It's catchy.

617
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,330
It was only a prototype,
and I knew it was dangerous.

618
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:50,099
I used it to travel throughout space,

619
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:52,068
where I found entire galaxies,

620
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,803
swarming with intelligent life,

621
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:57,573
all under threat...

622
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:59,341
by a barbarous creature

623
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:01,109
moving unchecked

624
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:03,178
throughout the universe,

625
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,782
devouring these civilizations
one by one.

626
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:08,150
I hurried back,

627
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:10,184
somehow made it out of the Phantom Zone,

628
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,820
tried to warn the Council.

629
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:14,321
Then...

630
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:18,125
Well, you know how that ended.

631
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,528
It's not over yet, Grandpa.

632
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,864
We're gonna finish what you started.

633
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:24,098
I promise.

634
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,800
I like the sound of that.

635
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,099
But you better do something

636
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,071
about this house of Vex situation first.

637
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,623
Mercy!

638
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,970
We never ask for mercy.

639
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,986
Well, Seg, this is impressive.

640
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,710
You're early.

641
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,795
Investiture Ceremony isn't
for another hour.

642
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,923
There's not gonna be a ceremony.

643
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:40,294
I'm sorry?

644
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:41,662
You want me to be Ranked again?

645
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,530
Join the Science Guild,

646
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:48,301
Bind with your daughter, okay?

647
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:49,636
Even if I never get to bear

648
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:51,638
the sigil of my own house,

649
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,981
I will not wear yours.

650
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:07,987
I'd rather die Rankless.

651
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:09,855
Now, you listen to me.

652
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,690
And you listen well, th...

653
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,935
This is acceptable.

654
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:27,789
You will wear the sigil
of the Science Guild.

655
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:32,181
- Why, Your Eminence...
- Leave us now, Seg.

656
00:37:32,237 --> 00:37:34,536
May Rao's light

657
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,103
forever guide your way.

658
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:42,176
You too.

659
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,198
Please.

660
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:58,254
Help me understand.

661
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,817
You want to control him.

662
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,985
This is how.

663
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,693
We've been at this for hours!

664
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:32,694
What?

665
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm sorry, but I think
we need to call it!

666
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,374
You know what the first rule
of archaeology is?

667
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:49,443
- I have no idea!
- And neither do I.

668
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:51,279
I dropped out the first year of college,

669
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:55,616
but I think it's something
like "never stop searching."

670
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:57,485
That's a wonderful story,

671
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:58,886
but we need to go,

672
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,521
or else we're gonna die!

673
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:02,956
Hold on.

674
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,687
I found something!

675
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:10,964
Oh, yeah, we call those rocks.

676
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,933
It's not just any rock.

677
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:26,412
See the markings?

678
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,680
Yeah.

679
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,481
Scorch marks

680
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,150
from something crashing here.

681
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:32,317
Over there.

682
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:57,974
The sigil on the urn was a nice touch.

683
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:02,246
Not that it mattered.

684
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:08,351
I'm voicing my displeasure here,

685
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:09,552
in case you couldn't tell.

686
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,087
What do you want me to say?

687
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:14,657
Evidently, he didn't
get the closure we expected.

688
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:16,893
You expected.

689
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,462
It was your suggestion.

690
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,698
And now I have another one.

691
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,534
Be patient.

692
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:28,237
He trusts me now.

693
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,938
That alone made this worthwhile.

694
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:48,189
I hope it was worth it.

695
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,924
I tried talking to you.

696
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:51,926
I don't know why you're protecting Seg,

697
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,662
but if you want to risk
your life for him, so be it.

698
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,163
But not even Rao will help you

699
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,994
if you risk those of your squads.

700
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:07,274
Lyta-Zod,

701
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:08,841
I hereby appoint you

702
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:11,511
Commander of Fourth Squad, Sagitari.

703
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:15,114
You are obliged to bear
true allegiance and faith

704
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:16,882
to the Military Guild of Kandor City

705
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:18,817
against all enemies

706
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,388
and to defend and support
the Supreme Council,

707
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:25,291
in loyal service of His Reverence,

708
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:27,626
the Voice of Rao.

709
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:29,694
May Rao's grace

710
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,462
be your shield.

711
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:40,334
It only gets harder from here.

712
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:44,775
Dismissed, Commander.

713
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,861
This better be
something real, Earth man.

714
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:55,085
I'm getting tired of being...

715
00:41:58,023 --> 00:41:59,023
What is that?

716
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:03,425
Not sure what you call it.

717
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,162
Brainiac sends them out to any planet

718
00:42:06,264 --> 00:42:08,464
that he deems worthy of conquest

719
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:09,798
as a forward scout.

720
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:14,870
Brainiac isn't on his way.

721
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:16,805
He's already here.

722
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:32,172

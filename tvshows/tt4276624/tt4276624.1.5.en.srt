1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,557
This initiative is about
targeting Black Zero.

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:06,635
Nobody fires unless
I give the order.

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,172
Let him go.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,341
What happened here?

5
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,034
Kol-Da,
you are under arrest.

6
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,729
Lyta, thank you.

7
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:15,682
I need someone
to take responsibility

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,461
for the Rankless
initiative's failures.

9
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,338
Commander Zod,
it's by Rao's word

10
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:21,354
that you are hereby
charged with treason.

11
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,534
What's gonna happen to her?

12
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:25,352
She'll be executed just like
your grandfather was.

13
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,938
Why do you want
to save Lyta-Zod?

14
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:28,047
Because I love her.

15
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,135
Will you help her?

16
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:30,213
She's innocent.

17
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,252
The moment Lyta dies,
so does our chance

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,668
to overthrow
the Voice of Rao.

19
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,284
I have come
to make you an offer

20
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,945
that could
save Lyta's life.

21
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:38,238
For the cost of what?

22
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,487
Pledge your support
for my father.

23
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:42,109
Thanks for always
having my back.

24
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:43,351
It's more than loyalty.

25
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,812
Val, I'm headed your way.

26
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,429
Do you read?

27
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,814
Tell me what you know about Brainiac.

28
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:52,640
Together we can protect
the future of Krypton.

29
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,009
Seg-El is somewhere
in the complex.

30
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:02,141
Find him.

31
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,135
You're my daughter,
and Zods are not traitors.

32
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,419
I think you're here
protecting Seg.

33
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:10,208
If you want to help me,
then for once in your life

34
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:14,100
trust me.
Trust runs both ways, Lyta.

35
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,091
What makes a Zod?

36
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:22,997
Is it blood?

37
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,497
Jayna.

38
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,310
Vidar.

39
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:38,841
You were born
into a great House.

40
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:43,216
A House of Warriors.

41
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:49,661
Warriors whose
courage, honor...

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,372
..and loyalty to the State
are without equal.

43
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,443
And without question.

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,435
You hold back because
she is your sister.

45
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,279
Your unwillingness
to land the blow ensures

46
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:21,907
that she will remain
vulnerable to such an attack

47
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:23,604
from a future opponent,

48
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:26,607
one not blinded
by sentiment as you are.

49
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:29,521
Is that honorable?

50
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,788
To earn the name Zod,
you must place honor above all.

51
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,982
Above love.

52
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:48,263
Above life.

53
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:53,820
Even above family.

54
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,094
<font color=#FF00FF>*KRYPTON*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01   Episode 05</font>

55
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,633
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"House of Zod"</font>

56
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:27,552
There.
Blood.

57
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,216
He won't last long out here.

58
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,728
Especially with
the ice storm coming.

59
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,465
We better find him
before it hits.

60
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:10,813
Okay.

61
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay.

62
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,885
Okay, okay, okay.

63
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:33,739
Ah, come on, come on.

64
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:37,467
Hello.

65
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,001
Hello, ca...

66
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,059
Can any...

67
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,426
Shit.

68
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,715
Ah.

69
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,937
Help me.

70
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:48,137
Please.
They'll be back soon.

71
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:54,410
I know a way to safety.
Huh?

72
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,687
Far from these people.

73
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,104
Deactivate the barrier.

74
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:23,931
- Dev.
- You're a Zod.

75
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,543
Wouldn't run
even if I begged you.

76
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,926
Do it and go.

77
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,457
I'll be responsible.

78
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:44,293
I should've come sooner.

79
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,153
You shouldn't
have come at all.

80
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:49,035
You really expect me
to believe that all this time

81
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,699
you've been
a Black Zero operative?

82
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,830
Clearly some do.

83
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,934
I was thinking about
the first night we met.

84
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,677
The Nova Cycle
First Night Dinner.

85
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,663
Was that really 18 cycles ago?

86
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:10,059
I couldn't believe my family
got seated with House Zod.

87
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,928
When I saw the Fire of Rao,

88
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,973
I knew I'd never see
anything as beautiful.

89
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,801
And then I saw you.

90
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,199
I paid that Rankless

91
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:30,182
to spread spark snow
in the Fire.

92
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,309
Only you would try
to improve the Ceremonial Fire.

93
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,754
I had no idea it would...

94
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,270
Set fire
to the Surrus blossoms.

95
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,043
I didn't ask you
to take the blame for me.

96
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:44,426
You didn't have to.

97
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,832
I was already in love with you.

98
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:56,067
Look, I know you don't
feel the same way

99
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,207
I feel about you, but...

100
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:10,543
I do love you.

101
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,764
He's nowhere to be found and
he's not picking up his comm.

102
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,881
I'm telling you, something
is seriously wrong.

103
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,022
Yes, Lyta has been
scheduled for execution.

104
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,155
It does not get
more wrong for Seg.

105
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,691
He will show up eventually.

106
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,819
Great, so until then I'm just
supposed to sit around

107
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,379
with my thumb up my ass?

108
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,866
Yeah, if... if you think
that's gonna help.

109
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,035
Be my guest.

110
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:43,684
It'll probably be a lot
more help than you've been.

111
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,817
Why would you put
your thumb...

112
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,746
Uh.

113
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:54,081
You know yet,
we getting close?

114
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:56,129
How much further?

115
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,160
Hey, come on, stay with me.

116
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,949
I need you to tell me
how to get us out of here.

117
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,356
Straight, we go straight.

118
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,623
Straight?

119
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,085
You said that
three straights ago.

120
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,004
How can you even tell?
It looks all the same.

121
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,585
Co... come on, come on.

122
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:11,999
You gotta stay with me.

123
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,324
Come on, keep talking.

124
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:15,181
What's your name?
Tell me your name.

125
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:18,098
What's your name?
Raika.

126
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:20,262
I am Raika.
Raika.

127
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,332
Great.
I'm Seg.

128
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,778
Those people back there,

129
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,293
what do they want from you?

130
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,262
Why were they torturing you?

131
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,946
I could not let them find it.

132
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:34,543
Find what?

133
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:37,265
That which we protect.

134
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:39,106
Protect?
What do you mean "protect"?

135
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:40,918
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

136
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,715
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

137
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,753
Whoa, hey, friends, friends,
friend of Raika's.

138
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,973
She's hurt.
I tried to help her.

139
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,793
Ha neh fra bor.

140
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:23,997
Jayta fesu henni Raika.

141
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,137
Yek un gas ka-ta meh hann.

142
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,106
Yeah, well, that...
looks bad.

143
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,493
Um, that probably doesn't help,

144
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,434
but I used those to pry open
Raika's shackles

145
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,062
when I rescued her.

146
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,566
Heroically.

147
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,660
El?

148
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,644
Yeah, El.

149
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,860
- Seg-El.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,514
Very good.

151
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,723
Oh, shit.

152
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,026
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

153
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,158
I'm trying
to salvage this mess.

154
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,932
By going behind my back?

155
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,336
To the Primus of the Sagitari?

156
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:12,697
What makes you think Jayna
is ready to join us

157
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:15,557
and go against everything
House Zod stands for?

158
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,369
The fact that most parents
love their children.

159
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,807
And if she does love
her daughter that much,

160
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,179
what's to stop her going
to the Voice of Rao himself

161
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,017
and bargaining
for a better deal?

162
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,854
You have risked everything,
Nyssa.

163
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:31,883
We need the Sagitari.

164
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,502
She's a Zod.

165
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:35,651
If we don't stop
Lyta's execution,

166
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,151
we lose Jayna.

167
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,698
And then we lose the chance
to make a better Kandor.

168
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,580
A better Kandor?

169
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:47,323
There's something else
clouding your judgment.

170
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,369
Or someone else.

171
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,868
Seg, perhaps?

172
00:11:57,428 --> 00:12:01,084
I did what I did
so we can prevail against a tyrant.

173
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,999
A tyrant with power
and a temper.

174
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,877
If Jayna agrees,

175
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,682
and joins us to spare her
beloved daughter,

176
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,526
how do I explain to the Voice

177
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,791
that he won't get
the blood he's asked for?

178
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,063
And if she refuses,

179
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,520
and tells the Voice
of our plans

180
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,346
before we can put them
in motion,

181
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:19,450
then the blood he asks for

182
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,526
will be ours.

183
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,521
How do you all
survive down here?

184
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,607
Cythonna.

185
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,209
With her love and blessing,

186
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,894
all things are possible.

187
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:28,878
Cythonna?
The Ice Goddess?

188
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,699
The true Mother of Krypton.

189
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,097
You're Cythonnites?

190
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,300
This is a sacred place.

191
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,761
You do not belong here.

192
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,175
Why have you come, El?

193
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:49,842
Raika brought me here
after I rescued her

194
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,951
from some
very bad people.

195
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,769
Your people.

196
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:56,480
If they were my people,
would they have done this to me?

197
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,168
But hey,

198
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,257
you don't want me here,
I don't particularly want to be here,

199
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:02,797
so point me
in the direction of Kandor

200
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,825
and I'll gladly
be on my way.

201
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:10,200
You have shown one
of our own a kindness.

202
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:13,677
Allow us to return it
by healing your wounds.

203
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:15,083
___

204
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,489
___

205
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,341
___

206
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,587
___
___

207
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,411
___

208
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,223
___

209
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,919
___

210
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:31,950
___

211
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,466
___

212
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:07,005
I testified exactly
as you told me to.

213
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,097
Why am I still here?

214
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,974
Procedural delay.

215
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,482
Nothing more.

216
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,763
Stymied by bureaucracy?

217
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,505
Most powerful man in Kandor.

218
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,372
Second most.

219
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,536
You will be out soon.

220
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:28,700
And we will be
sipping drinks by nightfall.

221
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:32,286
Good.

222
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:29,361
Every moment
of your life is a test.

223
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,990
One that reveals who you are.

224
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:35,533
And if you truly are worthy
of the name Zod.

225
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,100
Today is your trial by ice.

226
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:43,994
You will make your way
to the Jewel Mountains.

227
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,270
You will follow in the
footsteps of those

228
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,761
who have
come before you.

229
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,384
Or you will die trying.

230
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:08,478
At the southern base
is the Sword of Jo-Mon,

231
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:12,759
the fiercest of all
Kryptonian warriors.

232
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:24,220
There you will find the oxygen
that will ease your return.

233
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,455
There's only one respirator.

234
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,729
We made it all
this way without one.

235
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:36,408
- And we almost died.
- But we didn't.

236
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,892
We can do this.

237
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:40,791
We're too far out.

238
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,353
We share the respirator.

239
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,744
We each use half.

240
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,088
It took all we had
to get here.

241
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,181
- We have to try.
- No!

242
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,197
Don't you see?
This is the test.

243
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,147
We're wasting
breath arguing.

244
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,919
We can both do this.

245
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,715
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,325
Vidar, don't.

247
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,410
Better than letting you
freeze out here.

248
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,254
I'll make it quick.

249
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:18,067
Don't.

250
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,910
Don't leave me here.

251
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,343
Jayna!

252
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:30,588
Jayna!

253
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,703
Jayna!

254
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:38,244
You have to make a decision.

255
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:50,151
You're sacrificing your
daughter for honor?

256
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,299
You dare speak
to me of honor?

257
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,385
Tell me, Primus.

258
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,908
What makes you any different
from those who blindly follow

259
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,674
the Voice of Rao?

260
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:06,572
You'll say anything
to achieve your desires.

261
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:08,783
That's your code.

262
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,665
Duty is action.

263
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,785
Duty is thought.

264
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,126
What about
your duty to Lyta?

265
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:21,360
One word from you
and she is saved.

266
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,712
Her rank, her honor restored.

267
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:28,383
You serve an oppressive ruler
without question.

268
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,126
Why not serve my father

269
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,782
who wants to truly lead?

270
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,219
You aspire to lead,

271
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:39,344
yet know nothing
about being a leader.

272
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:46,352
Is that a yes or a no?

273
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,456
That actually
feels a lot better.

274
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,844
What is this stuff?

275
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,149
Okay, well, not bad for
something that clearly came out

276
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:09,899
of some creature's ass.

277
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,813
Thank you.

278
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,266
I'm glad you pulled through.

279
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,829
Yes,
thanks to you.

280
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,837
What are they saying?

281
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,501
I know it's about me.

282
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,122
Come on, Raika.

283
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,883
Talk to me.

284
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:44,658
They're trying to figure out
what to do with you.

285
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:47,740
What's to figure out?

286
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,813
Unless they have
no intention of...

287
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:52,048
letting me leave.

288
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,409
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,143
If I had known you were an El,

290
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:58,290
I would never have
brought you to this place.

291
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,415
Well, that seems
a little judgy.

292
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,762
You barely know me,
except for the fact that I saved you.

293
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,017
Do you remember that?

294
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,638
You are an El.

295
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,719
You have the power
to destroy everything.

296
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,930
What do you mean?

297
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,510
I've said too much.

298
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,648
Too much?
You haven't told me shit.

299
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,944
Why would you think
that I could ever do that?

300
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:21,001
Because the House of El
has done it before.

301
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,063
I can't say any more
about this.

302
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,313
What exactly
did my family do?

303
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,087
I'm sorry,

304
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,948
but all I can say is our duty
to protect this place

305
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,894
from your family
has been passed

306
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,472
from generation
to generation.

307
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,415
Well, all I can say is that
my family means you no harm.

308
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,612
And I'm leaving.

309
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,688
They will never let you
out of here alive.

310
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:44,798
Then help me.

311
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:46,487
Help me, like I helped you.

312
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,723
No.

313
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:50,633
You will tell others
about this place.

314
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:53,923
You're worried about others?

315
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,771
Do you know what happens

316
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,930
when I don't go home?

317
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:01,282
Others come looking for me.

318
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:03,313
Els.

319
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,698
That's right, yeah.

320
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:09,331
All my brothers, and all my cousins,
and all my uncles.

321
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,151
Pretty soon this place is
gonna be crawling with Els.

322
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:14,854
And think about
the destruction they could do.

323
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,948
But you can make sure
that none of that happens.

324
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,893
All I need

325
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:24,026
is a respirator
and a way out of here.

326
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,399
I should've asked

327
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:42,681
for more than just
a respirator.

328
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:48,436
Warning.
Oxygen level near depletion.

329
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:53,222
Warning. Replenish oxygen
supply immediately.

330
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,378
Warning...

331
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,636
It's not too late
to stop this.

332
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:15,347
Jayna!

333
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:24,177
- Vidar, he's still out there...
- Do not think of your brother.

334
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:26,654
He no longer
has a place among us.

335
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:35,098
My mother gave this to me.

336
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,729
As her father gave it to her.

337
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,105
As you know, it has
never been apart from me.

338
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:44,672
It is indestructible.

339
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,761
As is your spirit, Jayna.

340
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:50,276
I saw that from the start.

341
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,255
Your purpose is fulfilled.

342
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:55,104
And your destiny clear.

343
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:58,200
You take your place
in the House of Zod,

344
00:24:58,268 --> 00:24:59,958
protector of Krypton.

345
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:01,901
With you serving it,

346
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:05,987
our people's future is
as bright as Rao's light.

347
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,253
You are a Zod.

348
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:30,034
As such, you kneel to no one.

349
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,604
Stop.

350
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,370
Lyta-Zod,

351
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,409
the witness against you
has recanted.

352
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:43,745
All testimony is
hereby rescinded.

353
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,066
And all charges of treason
are dropped.

354
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,276
You are to be reinstated
immediately to full rank.

355
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,964
The Council...

356
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,128
apologizes.

357
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,291
Mother, I...

358
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,658
I don't understand this.
I...

359
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,783
I don't know
how this happened.

360
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,259
I guess I have Nyssa-Vex
to thank.

361
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,145
She'll be expecting

362
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,259
- something in return...
- You owe her nothing.

363
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,916
Do you understand?

364
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:04,986
Nothing.

365
00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:07,689
It was you.

366
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,650
You saved me.

367
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,134
I thought I was going to die.

368
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:24,644
I just... I can't believe it,
how?

369
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:26,189
What did you do?

370
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:33,286
I know you've truly never
understood this, Lyta.

371
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,418
But you've always been
my greatest love.

372
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,697
And now my greatest shame.

373
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,767
Mother?

374
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,923
Mother.

375
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,626
Why am I still here?

376
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,751
I demand to see
the Chief Magistrate.

377
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,720
What is going on?

378
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,798
Where's Daron-Vex?

379
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,603
End program.

380
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,970
I want a full investigation.

381
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:01,041
I will find out

382
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,166
how a prisoner of the Sagitari
was able to get a weapon

383
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,822
into her cell.

384
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:11,056
Go!

385
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:19,423
I must say,
you nearly had me fooled.

386
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:24,314
Well, let's hope the Voice
of Rao will be as well.

387
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:27,470
No, I meant
your feelings for Kol-Da.

388
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:30,189
You did care for her.

389
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,314
Yes, I did.

390
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,291
Very much.

391
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,431
She was a fierce warrior.

392
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:48,205
And loyal to our cause.

393
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,892
And yet...

394
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:54,720
And yet,

395
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:58,181
you left me with little choice.

396
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,541
A sacrifice...
had to be made.

397
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:20,494
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

398
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:23,541
Yeah.
Painfully aware of that.

399
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:27,077
<i>Please replenish
oxygen supply.</i>

400
00:31:27,194 --> 00:31:28,564
Can't do that.

401
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,385
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level critical.</i>

402
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:34,587
- I heard you!
- <i>Alert. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

403
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,228
Fine.

404
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:38,462
Maybe you'll shut up.

405
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:01,589
Alert. Oxygen now depleted.

406
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,842
That's enough out of you.

407
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,356
Okay.

408
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,509
Okay.

409
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,556
Come on.
Come on, baby.

410
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:32,561
Come on now.

411
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,928
Yes!
Yes.

412
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,775
Adam! Adam, come in.

413
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,759
Shit.
No, come on.

414
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,393
This has to work.

415
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:46,319
Adam, it's Seg.
Do you hear me?

416
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:51,513
He's about yea high,
dreamy eyes, legs for days.

417
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,183
- Adam, Adam, do you read? It's Seg.
- Uh, Seg, Seg, yeah.

418
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,396
- Adam, can you hear me?
- Yeah, Seg, I got you.

419
00:32:56,464 --> 00:33:00,517
Adam, there's......ference...

420
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:01,813
I can hear you.

421
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,651
Uh...

422
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:05,322
Can you hear me now?

423
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,689
Seg, can you hear me now?

424
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:12,603
Adam, listen.

425
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,548
I don't know how much time
I have.

426
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,658
I'm in the Outlands,
and I'm stuck.

427
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:19,423
I need help.

428
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:21,869
But if things go badly,

429
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,009
there's something I need you
to do for me.

430
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:31,033
I got your message.

431
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:38,932
How is it
I'm standing here?

432
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,499
Rao works in mysterious ways.

433
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:42,072
Clearly, so do you.

434
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,702
What is going on between
you and my mother

435
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,931
and where is Seg?

436
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,804
- Nobody's seen him.
- Commander Zod.

437
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:53,798
Commander, this man claims
to have information for you.

438
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,361
What do I do with him?

439
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,869
I'll deal with him.
Dismissed.

440
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,072
You remember me?

441
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,844
Seg's friend.

442
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:08,431
The alien.

443
00:34:08,665 --> 00:34:11,564
- What is it?
- I've got a message from him.

444
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,663
In my hand.

445
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:26,929
Lyta, if you're hearing this,

446
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:28,921
you know what happened.

447
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,593
I'm so sorry.

448
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,131
I wish I knew you were okay.

449
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,166
You've always been
the strongest,

450
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,187
bravest person I know.

451
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:44,218
Ugh, it's cold as shit
out here.

452
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,359
I bet you'd survive it,
though.

453
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,241
You will survive.

454
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,319
I know you.

455
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,937
Do you remember
our first kiss?

456
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:01,819
I'd give anything to kiss you
one more time.

457
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:08,646
You are everything good

458
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,631
in me.

459
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,170
And...

460
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,256
I love you.

461
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,551
I...

462
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,217
Follow me.

463
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,337
There's still a chance.

464
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:35,618
That's why
I'm coming with you.

465
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,191
I've got a general area
where he's at.

466
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,173
I hope you got some tech
that can narrow that down

467
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:40,607
- a little bit.
- Whoa.

468
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:43,232
Lieutenant Tai,
you're with me.

469
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,191
S&R Ops.
Outlands.

470
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:48,222
Suit up.
I'll brief you on the way.

471
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,076
Put that on.

472
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,721
Lyta, if you need another man,
I'll get suited up.

473
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:58,068
No, it's...
classified.

474
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:01,115
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

475
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,177
Let's move.

476
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,254
Rough.

477
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,741
Seg-El was captured
by a faction of Black Zero.

478
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:17,971
He escaped.
He's in the Outlands.

479
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,745
There's a Level 6 ice storm
in that sector.

480
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:21,076
No way he survives that.

481
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,141
Hate to be the one
to break bad news to Nyssa-Vex.

482
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,490
Secure that shit, Lieutenant.

483
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:27,720
We bring him back alive.

484
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,756
- Clear?
- Solid copy, Commander.

485
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,481
We're gonna find him.

486
00:37:31,603 --> 00:37:33,568
Seg.

487
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,518
Lyta.

488
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,446
We're close!

489
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,811
We're not gonna
stop looking.

490
00:38:12,786 --> 00:38:15,397
There's skimmer dust-off
markings back there.

491
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,677
Looks fresh.

492
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,990
Scan for a heat signature.

493
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,326
This will revive him.

494
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:34,912
We need you alive,

495
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:38,139
so you can tell us where
you took that Cythonnite woman.

496
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,717
You have no idea
how important she is.

497
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:51,373
She holds the key
to stopping Brainiac.

498
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:55,037
Tell us where she is.

499
00:38:57,778 --> 00:39:00,045
We don't have much time.

500
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,068
Are you okay?

501
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:11,616
Yeah, I'm fine.

502
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,428
Sweep the place.

503
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:19,562
Stay here.

504
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:24,506
Uh.

505
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,693
- How you doing?
- Ah.

506
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:30,749
A little tender.

507
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:32,030
Sorry.

508
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,857
It's you.

509
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,510
What's so funny?

510
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,178
Who gave you that?

511
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:33,967
You did.

512
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,459
I'm your son.

513
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:41,586

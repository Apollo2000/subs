<i>Kal-El.</i>

00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,636
<i>My future grandson.</i>

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:10,140
<i>This is the story of the House of El.</i>

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,446
<i>Our ending has yet to be written.</i>

5
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:19,649
<i>But this is how we began.</i>

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:22,819
<i>Ours is a story of sacrifice</i>

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,121
<i>and triumph.</i>

8
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:26,890
<i>How the House of El</i>

9
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:30,560
<i>led a revolution against tyranny.</i>

10
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:34,631
<i>The story of your family
isn't how we died.</i>

11
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,610
<i>But how we lived.</i>

<i>Two hundred years before your birth,</i>

14
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,673
<i>the House of El almost ended.</i>

15
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,843
<i>And I was almost the last of our line.</i>

16
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,215
<i>It began the day my grandfather</i>

17

18
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:16,752

21
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:27,430
Val of House El.

22
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,765
I offer you a final chance

23
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:33,001
to pledge your loyalty to His Eminence,

24
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,438
the Voice of Rao.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,706
Don't hold your breath.

26
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,077
Listen to me.

27
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:43,646
The old counsel is no more.

28
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:46,348
They've already sworn their allegiance.

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,883
All but you.

30
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:52,520
You're our greatest
scientific mind, Val.

31
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,323
Think of all you've accomplished.

32
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,058
Are you willing to throw it all away?

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,961
I've taken measures
to safeguard my work.

34
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,362
I had to.

35
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,730
You can deny it all you like.

36
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,231
But the truth is,

37
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,042
we are not alone in the universe.

38
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:09,871
Krypton is vulnerable.

39
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:14,375
And praying to him won't be
enough to save it.

40
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,083
Val of House El.

41
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,052
For rebelling against the
lawful authority of the state,

42
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:29,256
you leave me no choice but
to find you guilty of sedition.

43
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,993
You are hereby sentenced to death.

44
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:40,266
The name El will be struck from
the Registry of Citizens.

45
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,871
Your family will be stripped
of all rights and privileges.

46
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,807
You are now to be considered Rankless.

47
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:51,844
Without guild.

48
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,014
Without name.

49
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,350
Without honor.

50
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,861
You chose the wrong side.

51
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,530
Remember, Seg.

52
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:49,200
Keep believing in a better tomorrow.

53
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:51,736
Grandpa!

54
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,371
I love you!

55
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,928
No! No!

56
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,362
Grandpa!

57
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,765
Grandpa!

58
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,469
Shh.

59
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,589
Where's the money, Seg?

60
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:55,999
Fifty thousand Solars. Remember?

61
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,004
What're you waiting for?

62
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,673
I vaguely recall 30.

63
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,414
Come on now. Up you go.

64
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:14,683
Thank you. Thanks.

65
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,086
All right.

66
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,688
50 it is.

67
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,691
Only 'cause you seem like nice guys.

68
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,595
Why so surprised?

69
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,531
- Didn't think we'd find you?
- Honestly?

70
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,511
You look like you'd have
trouble finding your own ass

71
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:32,846
with both hands tied behind your back.

72
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,270
And my guess is you're the smart one.

73
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:43,645
Oh, that was fair.

74
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,682
And I deserved that.

75
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,651
So I should apologize.

76
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,853
Please tell your wife and your sister

77
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,521
I'm gonna be late tonight.

78
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:10,036
If that's the best you got...

79
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,240
maybe I won't be as late as I thought.

80
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:16,042
Always got something clever
to say, haven't you?

81
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:19,112
Well, if you're so clever, tell me this.

82
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:22,349
How come you're on the stupid
end of this blaster?

83
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,484
Easy, mate.

84
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,220
My stupid end's bigger.

85
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:28,955
Seg, you'd better pay them now.

86
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,558
Just pay them.

87
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:36,696
Ah, easy. Easy.

88
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,807
Bye-bye, now.

89
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,343
Bye.

90
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,813
Yeah, all right. Calm down, calm down.

91
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,583
For all you degenerate gamblers
who bet our boy

92
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:01,153
could last more
than one minute and 37 seconds,

93
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,520
a hearty congratulations.

94
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,322
The rest of you, pay up.

95
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,792
Come on, it's pay day. Let's go.

96
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,712
One minute, 37 seconds.

97
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,368
- That was impressive.
- Mmm.

98
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,969
That didn't go through. Come on.

99
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,673
Could you remind me why
I'm the one who has to go

100
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,973
and provoke the very large,

101
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,975
very corrupt government officials?

102
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,317
I guess that's just the way
that this one goes, isn't it?

103
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,613
- Mmm-hmm.
- Plus you've got

104
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,145
superior stamina and,
uh, a very punchable face.

105
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,662
Mmm, well, yours
is looking more punchable

106
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,420
- by the minute, mate.
- Wow.

107
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,822
How'd we do?

108
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,591
Uh, 218 minus 50 for damages.

109
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,131
Yeah, not a bad night's work.

110
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,032
And good clean fun.

111
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:21,468
Maybe it's good clean fun for you.

112
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,371
Yeah, I think I'm gonna bounce, mate.

113
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,340
Uh, can I use the, uh, back way?

114
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,576
- Uh, any particular reason?
- Nope.

115
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,304
Other than the friendly
government officials

116
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,675
that just went out front.

117
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,983
Free drinks for the next hour!

118
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,451
Sorry, mate.

119
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:39,763
It's just the way
this one works, I guess.

120
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,154
But Seg... Hey, Seg...

121
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,855
No, Seg, you can't leave.

122
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,924
This is com... this is coming
out of your share!

123
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,519
Seg, where've you been?

124
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,786
Hi, Dad.

125
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,421
Whoa, hey, wait. What happened?

126
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:17,524
You okay?

127
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,558
Yeah, had a great night.

128
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,459
Look, 150 in profit.

129
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,993
Pretty good, right?

130
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,395
Please tell me you and Kem

131
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,597
didn't pull that scam again last night.

132
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,365
All right, fine. I won't.

133
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,634
If you keep carrying on like this,

134
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,280
Dad, we can talk about this
in the morning, please.

135
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,371
It is morning, Seg.

136
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,488
You can't keep doing this.

137
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,190
If you're caught after curfew...

138
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,803
They'll put me in the lunar
work camps, I know, I know.

139
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:40,860
Look, we need that money.

140
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:42,227
Well, I can take extra shift.

141
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,429
- At the Guild?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,796
Great.

143
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:46,498
The same people who executed Grandpa.

144
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,799
Forced us to live down here.

145
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,334
Sounds like a plan.

146
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,539
Well, I should get going.

147
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:07,619
- Seg...
- I know.

148
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,622
I'm sorry. It was stupid.

149
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,959
- Does that hurt?
- Mmm.

150
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:15,694
Yeah, a lot.

151
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,161
Good, maybe it'll remind you

152
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,730
to start using that brain of yours.

153
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,365
There's always a chance.

154
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,004
Oh, your dad's forgotten his meds.

155
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,387
Mom, don't worry. I'll get them.

156
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,608
- Don't worry.
- No, you're still drunk.

157
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,042
That's how I do my best work.

158
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,912
You look terrible,
and you smell even worse.

159
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,581
Fine, I'll get cleaned up first.

160
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:39,984
Wouldn't want to put more shame
on the family, would I?

161
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:16,660
_

162
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:43,078
Do not mistake passion for strength.

163
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:47,348
The ability to divorce oneself
of emotion during battle

164
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,687
is what separates the living
from the dead.

165
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:54,189
Sagittari Zod.

166
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:57,058
Weapons or hand-to-hand?

167
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,461
Dev-Em, choose for your intended.

168
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,733
Hand-to-hand.

169
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:42,569
Ask for mercy.

170
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,705
No.

171
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,407
Ask for mercy!

172
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,675
No!

173
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,082
Mercy!

174
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:58,084
Black Zero!

175
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:00,253
Beasts of the Outlands.

176
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:03,188
Factions within other city-states.

177
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,426
All of them seek to annihilate us.

178
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,295
We are Sagittari.

179
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,965
The tip of the spear
that guards this city.

180
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,935
We never ask for mercy.

181
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:20,305
And we never give it!

182
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,709
Do you understand, Lyta-Zod?

183
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,380
Yes, Mother.

184
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,064
_

185
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,356
You call yourselves freedom fighters,

186
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,926
but you wage war on the people
of Kandor City.

187
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,495
You claim to fight for equality,

188
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:46,230
but bring only bloodshed and chaos.

189
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,300
That ends today.

190
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,435
You have all been found guilty
of high treason

191
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,304
for aiding and abetting

192
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,240
the terrorist organization Black Zero.

193
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,109
Seg, we should not be here.

194
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,155
I know, but he needs the optics,
and he's in chambers.

195
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,216
- What do you want me to do?
- Just hurry up.

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,294
Hey, there's no Rankless in this sector.

197
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,727
No, I understand. I just need to
pass something onto my father.

198
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:07,396
- Leave now or be arrested.
- Okay, we are leaving.

199
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,897
Excellent job manning
your post, by the way.

200
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,688
Your Reverence.

201
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,425
If you would give the condemned
their final benediction.

202
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,298
He's got a bomb!

203
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,634
Death to the Voice of Rao!

204
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,771
- Seg!
- Behind me, Your Magistrate!

205
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:32,944
Damn filth!

206
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,451
You did a brave thing, Seg.

207
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,453
We are in your debt.

208
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,664
You hate me.

209
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,167
I took the life of a man you loved,

210
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,602
took your family's rank,

211
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,805
erased its future...

212
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,241
Before it could even be written.

213
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,950
You turn 23 soon, don't you?

214
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,619
If you were Ranked,

215
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,742
you'd become a Guildsman.

216
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:27,602
Perhaps even granted permission
to Bind with someone.

217
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:30,238
But I'm not Ranked, sir.

218
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,074
Not yet.

219
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,077
Under certain circumstances,

220
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:37,245
the Council can re-instate family Rank.

221
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:38,480
What?

222
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:41,783
I have conferred with a genetic council.

223
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:45,186
They have deemed you best suited
to join the Science Guild.

224
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:49,757
You are to be assigned a new surname.

225
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,393
My name.

226
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,361
Vex.

227
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,666
Nyssa here has yet
to be paired with someone.

228
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:04,638
As my youngest daughter,
you'll be Binding with her.

229
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,778
He's a wonderful choice, father.

230
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:15,281
Welcome to the family, Seg.

231
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,447
Well, that's not how
I thought today would go.

232
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,151
Really? No, I was pretty sure

233
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,228
that you'd get a Guild rank
and a wife before lunch.

234
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:24,353
Don't forget foiling a terrorist,
'cause I did that, too.

235
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,426
We, yes, we did do that.
But you know what?

236
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,006
I'm gonna let you take
the credit on that one.

237
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,394
It's not like I wanna be a Vex.

238
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:30,697
What's not to want?

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,265
You've got better food, better air,

240
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,567
better ice.

241
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,136
- You're gonna be one of them again.
- But not as an El.

242
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:37,849
And you've as much of a right
to be Ranked as me.

243
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,640
Oh, shut up, Seg.

244
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,809
Look, once you get Vexxed up,

245
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:45,345
if I ever, ever see you down here again,

246
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:48,315
I'm gonna shred you myself.

247
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,052
On your knees!

248
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,020
Why's he down here?

249
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,324
Clear the sector, citizen.

250
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,960
I said move along.

251
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:00,961
- Leave it, Seg.
- Hey!

252
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,127
Seg!

253
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,563
- Seg, just leave it.
- Hey!

254
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,505
He worked the Outlands
for more than 50 cycles.

255
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,166
His mind's not right anymore.

256
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,735
Clear the sector, Rankless.

257
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,204
You and the burnout.

258
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,014
You wanna explain this, Saj-Atara?

259
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:25,451
I was clearing the sector
of potential threat

260
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:26,729
when this piece of shit attacked me.

261
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,053
Threat? He's an old man.

262
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,632
- Now, now, just a simple...
- Get back!

263
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:31,223
- Understanding.
- I've got this, Dev.

264
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,325
Face down, Rankless.
Hands behind your back.

265
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:44,335
I'll book him.
You handle the other moron.

266
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,475
What the hell were you thinking, Seg?

267
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:52,910
Are you gonna uncuff me or what?

268
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,413
I like you this way.

269
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:00,518
The whole city's on alert,

270
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,786
and you mix it up with
a Voice security detail.

271
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,955
More like an out of control goon squad.

272
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:06,702
What happened to your people
having some discipline?

273
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:09,326
They were handpicked
by the Voice himself,

274
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,910
chosen for their devotion.

275
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,520
Great, people are crazy
on both sides now.

276
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:14,939
Turn around.

277
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,907
What's that supposed to mean?

278
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,778
Um... I'll tell you later.

279
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,346
What happened to your hand?

280
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,581
Mother and I spent some quality time

281
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,683
in the training room.

282
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,286
Tomorrow night. Don't be late.

283
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,473
Don't even think about it.

284
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:52,942
Okay, I don't wanna fight.

285
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:56,245
Who are you? And what are you wearing?

286
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,491
Is that a guild? Is that a guild?

287
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:58,681
No, it's not a guild.

288
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,115
This is the Detroit Tigers, man.

289
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,685
Just... Would you just shut up
and listen to me?

290
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,431
Okay, I've traveled across
a lot of time and space

291
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:05,888
to come find you.

292
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,491
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound, um...

293
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,660
Uh... Completely insane.

294
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,595
But, um, please, just go with it.

295
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,330
Yeah? Okay.

296
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:18,333
My name is Adam Strange, and...

297
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,702
Will you just let me finish?

298
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:21,336
I come from a planet called Earth.

299
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:22,771
A time centuries from now.

300
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:24,406
And I've come here to warn you.

301
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,942
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

302
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:29,511
- Okay, right.
- Whoa!

303
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,246
Why? Why would they do that?

304
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,914
Because where I'm from, your grandson

305
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,183
becomes the greatest hero
in the universe.

306
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:36,851
Like, ever.

307
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:38,631
Unless somebody changes things
to make sure

308
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,223
that he's never born...

309
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:43,725
You all right?

310
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm running out of time.

311
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:48,129
Take this.

312
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,934
You have to find the fortress.

313
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:55,803
You have to save Superman.

314
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,043
Where did...

315
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,853
Well, it's a... it's a variation,

316
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,317
but it's definitely
our family glyph all right.

317
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,912
What exactly did
this Strange guy say again?

318
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,267
Something about my future grandson.

319
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,668
Another planet.

320
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,204
Detroit, I think he called it.

321
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,340
And...

322
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,375
Something about a fortress.

323
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:40,216
Well, I shall take care of this for you.

324
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:41,551
Why?

325
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,454
What's the big deal with it?

326
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:45,789
Well, the symbol, it's, uh...

327
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,057
It's outlawed. You know that.

328
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,261
It's much too dangerous
for you to be carrying around.

329
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,898
Especially now that you're
going to be Ranked.

330
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,134
You mean we.

331
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:00,669
We're about to be Ranked.

332
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:02,271
No, son, this is not how it works.

333
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,007
No, the offer is for you only.

334
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,608
We... We won't be joining you.

335
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,054
You think I'm gonna go live up there

336
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:08,311
and leave you down here?

337
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:09,912
I... I'm sorry, that's not happening.

338
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,016
Seg, this is a chance at a new life.

339
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,785
Come on, you should probably go.

340
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:19,121
You're due in the Genesis Chamber soon.

341
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:20,589
Fine.

342
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:24,426
All right, but we're not
done discussing this.

343
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:36,771
Love you.

344
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:38,206
Bye.

345
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,350
We have to tell him.

346
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:50,852
No, he's not ready.

347
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,987
If Val was right,

348
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,057
it doesn't matter if he's ready or not.

349
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,938
_

350
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,514
Strange to think our
ancestors used to carry

351
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:24,417
children in their wombs.

352
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,088
Just seems so inefficient.

353
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,456
After you.

354
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:44,604
<i>The Oracle foresees
the product of your union.</i>

355
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:47,373
<i>The child will be male.</i>

356
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:50,843
<i>His name: Cor-Vex.</i>

357
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:54,747
<i>He will be of sound health
and good character.</i>

358
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:57,883
<i>Bio-scans designate
he will be best suited</i>

359
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,619
<i>for the Lawmakers Guild.</i>

360
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:02,088
<i>He will live 173 cycles</i>

361
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,991
<i>in noble servitude to His Reverence.</i>

362
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:10,295
Such a rush of maternal warmth.

363
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:14,500
Cor-Vex.

364
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,237
He seemed handsome enough.
There's that at least.

365
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,472
Doesn't it bother you?

366
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:24,809
Knowing exactly how his life's
gonna play out?

367
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,911
I'm the fifth of five daughters, Seg.

368
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,654
It's a miracle the Council
are allowing me

369
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:30,515
to bind with anyone.

370
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,050
I'll take what I can get.

371
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,753
Even a Rankless boy
with a chip on his shoulder.

372
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,022
Your father chooses me,
and you accept without a word.

373
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,691
Please tell me you aren't that naive.

374
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,060
You are the grandson of a traitor.

375
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,330
If my father binds you to us,
he is taming you.

376
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,133
Proving that even a dreaded El
can be co-opted

377
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:51,313
- and brought into the fold.
- I'm just a game piece.

378
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:54,405
Everyone in Kandor
is a game piece to my father.

379
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,073
Including me.

380
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:03,947
Besides, you're not
completely repellent.

381
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:08,585
There's a lot I could teach
you about life up here.

382
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:13,323
My father only thinks

383
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,858
he was the one who chose you.

384
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,968
So, what's she like?

385
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,537
Nyssa-Vex.

386
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:30,006
She's interesting.

387
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:33,142
She's funnier than you'd think,
once she loosens up.

388
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:37,780
I'm happy for you.

389
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:43,219
Council's scheduled my Binding to Dev.

390
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,089
Two weeks from now.

391
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:48,990
Before the Council
controlled everything,

392
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,626
the binding ritual was a choice.

393
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,394
Shut up.

394
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:01,604
I just want this.

395
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,306
You.

396
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:07,275
Right now.

397
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:27,928
<i>Curfew is in effect.</i>

398
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,065
Oi, Rankless!

399
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,607
What are you doing out after curfew?

400
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,335
Uh, hey, guys.

401
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:35,536
Look, I was working late.

402
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,837
Um, I lost track of time.

403
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,050
I'm headed home right now, so...

404
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,606
We're on a terror alert.

405
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,908
You lose track of that, too?

406
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,476
Uh, mate, look, it's not a big deal.

407
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,658
- Against the wall.
- Can we just... Do we have to...

408
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,683
What's this?

409
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:14,874
Where is he?

410
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,543
He's not down here!

411
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,313
He must have gone the other way!

412
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,522
- Seg, get in!
- Mom?

413
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,256
Come on, let's go! Get in!

414
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,851
Mom, what's going on?

415
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,352
Don't start.

416
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,754
You're playing a dangerous game
with Lyta-Zod.

417
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:04,522
If her mother finds out...

418
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,957
You've been following me.

419
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,693
You were told to leave
that Sunstone behind.

420
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,729
You do know what this is.

421
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,765
Yes. And I'm sorry.

422
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,567
That's why I'm here.

423
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,001
It's time you learned the truth.

424
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,736
And you had to steal a skimmer for that?

425
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,872
I prefer borrowed.

426
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,140
We need it to get where we're going.

427
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,609
Welcome to your grandfather's
Fortress of Solitude.

428
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:26,832
Go on. Try it.

429
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:04,998
He was right.

430
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:09,274
The guy who gave me the Sunstone.

431
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:13,545
Adam, he... This place is real.

432
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:16,715
I don't know how he knew
about it, but...

433
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:19,151
Yes, it's real all right.

434
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:25,391
Why'd you never tell me
about this place before?

435
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,126
To protect you.

436
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,796
If your father had his way,
you still wouldn't know.

437
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:34,766
But I figured it was time
you learned the truth.

438
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:41,372
This fortress.

439
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:43,975
It's why they killed
grandfather, isn't it?

440
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,309
Val was determined to prove

441
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,678
we weren't alone in the universe.

442
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,414
After the council shut down his work,

443
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:51,749
he would come here
to continue in secret.

444
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:58,089
He found something
he wasn't supposed to.

445
00:29:58,191 --> 00:29:59,690
Some kind of alien presence

446
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,525
he believed was consuming other worlds

447
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:03,794
and would someday come for Krypton.

448
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:06,797
He tried to warn the Council,
and they silenced him for it.

449
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,834
Your father and I believed him.
There was nothing we could do.

450
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:12,603
With Val dead, we didn't even know

451
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,971
how to get into this place.

452
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,607
Your grandfather was no traitor.

453
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,175
He was a hero.

454
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,677
He was trying to protect Krypton.

455
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,914
He believed in it so much,
he was willing to die for it.

456
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:27,617
We have to finish his work.

457
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,019
Together.

458
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,990
Military scout ships.

459
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,235
They must have tracked the skimmer.

460
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,707
Come on, let's go.

461
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,248
I wiped the skimmer's nav-data

462
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,329
so at least they won't be able
to find the Fortress.

463
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:53,518
True, but sooner or later,

464
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,153
they're gonna figure out who took it.

465
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,155
Looks like sooner.

466
00:30:57,257 --> 00:31:00,525
Seg, we've gotta go. Come on, quick.

467
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,198
You can't let the Sunstone
fall into the wrong hands.

468
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,934
- Keep it safe.
- Mom, I'm not leaving you.

469
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,669
You'll need it to finish Val's work.

470
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,605
That's all that matters now.

471
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,873
Do you hear?

472
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,608
Now, go.

473
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:20,912
Now you. Get in.

474
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,551
- Mom.
- I'm not coming.

475
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,326
- <i>Surround it! Around the back!</i>
- Mom, stop.

476
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,483
No, Mom!

477
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,912
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

478
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,583
<i>Let's go! Clear that corner.</i>

479
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,090
<i>Keep your hands where I can see them.</i>

480
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,262
Take the entire place apart.

481
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,599
A skimmer was stolen last night.

482
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,835
Your son was seen
within the same proximity.

483
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,770
We need to speak with him.

484
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,438
If he ever comes home again,

485
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,908
I'll be sure to tell him you stopped by.

486
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,745
You understand we don't need
to take you in alive.

487
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,013
Right?

488
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,382
Tell me where he is.

489
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,017
You're wasting your time.

490
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,386
My son didn't steal the skimmer.

491
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,887
I did.

492
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,990
- I serve Black Zero.
- Take her!

493
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,917
Seg, you shouldn't be here.

494
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,063
Let's just tell them the truth

495
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,243
and give them the Sunstone.

496
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:26,654
Maybe they'll spare you.

497
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,030
This is bigger than me.

498
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:32,269
This is about our entire civilization.

499
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:46,883
Get him out.

500
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:49,285
He was never here. Understood?

501
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,466
Tell me he played no part
in this treachery.

502
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,970
You know our children love
each other, don't you?

503
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,140
That's why you're protecting him.

504
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,740
I will not allow my daughter's life

505
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:15,874
to be ruined by your son's mistakes.

506
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:21,248
Death is not the only thing the
Council can threaten you with.

507
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:24,752
And certainly not the worst.

508
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,554
I know what they can do.

509
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:29,757
Then tell them everything you
know about Black Zero.

510
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,559
Seg will live.

511
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:35,372
And I promise you a good death.

512
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:39,557
Like the one they gave Val?

513
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:51,120
Primus Zod,

514
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:54,857
the accused claims she acted alone.

515
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,525
Would you enlighten us?

516
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:58,560
Our scanners clearly registered

517
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,764
two bio-signatures
in the stolen skimmer.

518
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:05,968
Your scanners are wrong.

519
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,503
Yet upon your capture,

520
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:10,205
you claimed allegiance to Black Zero.

521
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,508
I told them what they wanted to hear.

522
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,011
To get in front of the people of Kandor.

523
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:17,646
To tell them the truth.

524
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,816
We are not alone!
Don't believe their lies!

525
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,552
- Val-El was right!
- Enough!

526
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,822
The only one who lies here today is you.

527
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:30,558
14 cycles ago,
we condemned your father-in-law

528
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,027
to the ice.

529
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:35,396
And now you maintain his claims!

530
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,565
Tell the truth.

531
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,302
You stole that skimmer
in an effort to locate

532
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:43,037
Val-El's hidden fortress.

533
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,806
Did you not?

534
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:49,009
Did you not?

535
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,546
Hmm.

536
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,216
Well, did you find it?

537
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:57,417
Who was with you in that skimmer?

538
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,987
Who was your accomplice, Charys?

539
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:01,788
Dad.

540
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,490
Tell me the truth!

541
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:05,103
- I have to stop this.
- No, son, you cannot...

542
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:07,228
- I have to stop this.
- You cannot do this.

543
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,129
The punishment for high treason

544
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:14,033
is unequivocal for the sake of
your husband and for your son.

545
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:15,769
I love you. It was me!

546
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:16,936
No, Ter!

547
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:19,305
I was Charys' accomplice!

548
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,141
Take him!

549
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:26,913
Dad!

550
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:28,382
No!

551
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:40,727
No. Please, no.

552
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,095
Please, no! Please!

553
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:43,796
Mother, no!

554
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:50,669
No!

555
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:58,132
I don't care what it takes.

556
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:59,984
- Find it.
- If this fortress does exist,

557
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,125
- what makes it so important?
- Weapons, technology.

558
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,711
I will not allow Val-El's legacy

559
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,376
to fall into the hands of Black Zero.

560
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,897
Black Zero? Please.

561
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:11,984
Ter was covering for his son.

562
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,886
Charys confessed for the same reason.

563
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:15,465
We could have questioned them further

564
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:16,922
if they'd been taken alive.

565
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,024
I upheld the law.

566
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,725
There were other options.

567
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:22,094
But like a blunt instrument,

568
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:24,063
you chose to terminate them both.

569
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,731
If I didn't know you better, Jayna,

570
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,032
I'd think it was an act of mercy.

571
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,670
They knew exactly what you'd do to them

572
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:30,897
if they surrendered.

573
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:33,438
Or did you forget
the resolve of House El?

574
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,840
You should have considered that

575
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:37,476
before offering him to your daughter.

576
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:40,779
You gave Seg a Rank
in the Science Guild.

577
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:44,610
And you believe you can control him?

578
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:49,907
I'm just a blunt instrument, Daron...

579
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,399
But I'd rethink it.

580
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,409
Your Reverence.

581
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,778
I didn't see you there.

582
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,276
I'm so sorry.

583
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:53,049
If I could undo what my mother did...

584
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:17,305
She killed my parents, Lyta.

585
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,040
They were all I had.

586
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,183
You still got me, Seg.

587
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,353
Well, you said it yourself.

588
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,256
This had to end.

589
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,793
We were never gonna find a way
to be together.

590
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,862
Especially now.

591
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,665
Where are you going?

592
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:56,042
- Thank you.
- No worries.

593
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:03,016
Where have you been? I didn't know...

594
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,651
Kem, I have to get out of here, mate.

595
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,286
I need to be alone.

596
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:08,888
Can you help me?

597
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,425
What do you need?

598
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,976
Thank God, it worked.

599
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,810
Sunstone opened this place up.

600
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:33,913
What are you doing here?

601
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:35,339
Well, I was looking for you.

602
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,378
Wasn't sure if you found this
place or not, but...

603
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,785
You got my parents killed.

604
00:39:40,887 --> 00:39:42,954
What are you talking about?

605
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,389
You gave me that Sunstone.

606
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:46,858
You told me to find this place,
and I did.

607
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,493
And now my parents are dead!

608
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,361
They died to protect me!

609
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,702
They died to protect
whatever all of this is.

610
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,705
And it doesn't matter.

611
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:02,807
Does it?

612
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:05,043
If you really believe that,

613
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,545
then why are you here?

614
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:08,979
Huh?

615
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:17,721
I don't know why I'm here.

616
00:40:17,823 --> 00:40:20,424
I thought that maybe if I could
finish my grandfather's work

617
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:24,260
then maybe my parents
didn't die for nothing.

618
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:29,600
But what I do know for sure
is that because of you...

619
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,770
My entire family's gone.

620
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,174
You only think that you're
the end of the line.

621
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:48,446
This belongs to your grandson.

622
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:49,881
Kal-El.

623
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,286
Emphasis on the El.

624
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,959
Why's it doing that?

625
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,462
It's like an hourglass.

626
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,364
Once this cape is gone, our time's up.

627
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,334
And Superman will have been
wiped from existence.

628
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:17,107
This isn't just about
your grandson, Seg.

629
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:20,177
This thing that's coming.

630
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:23,713
It's not just gonna stop at Krypton.

631
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,216
It is coming for everything.

632
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,951
What are you talking about?

633
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,621
It moves...

634
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,624
from planet to planet

635
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,327
<i>conquering civilizations.</i>

636
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,565
<i>Destroying billions of lives.</i>

637
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:46,336
<i>It's known as the Collector of Worlds.</i>

638
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,638
<i>But it's true name...</i>

639
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,043
<i>Is Brainiac.</i>

640
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,780
Now, I'm sorry about your folks, Seg.

641
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,349
I really am.

642
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,350
And it seems your parents
gave their lives

643
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,319
because they knew this threat
needed to be stopped.

644
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,957
And they believed
that you could stop it.

645
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,596
Now, maybe you're up for it,

646
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,097
maybe you're not.

647
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,899
But the only question that matters is:

648
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,933
Are you willing to try?

649
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:38,344

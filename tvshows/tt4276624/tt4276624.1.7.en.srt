1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:03,140
<i>General Zod is Superman's
greatest enemy.</i>

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,953
<i>Has traveled back through
time to get here.</i>

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:06,164
I'm your son.

4
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:09,600
<i>Brainiac takes Kandor City
causing the planet to explode.</i>

5
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,428
Your friend here didn't mention that.

6
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,666
This whole time you knew,
and you said nothing!

7
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,768
Seg, you cannot trust this man!

8
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,129
I know I should've told you before,

9
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:18,679
but, I mean, what was I supposed to say?

10
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,303
"By the way, your world's
gonna explode."

11
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,404
<i>I've learned of a hidden
weapon that would give</i>

12
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,707
<i>even Brainiac pause.</i>
It's called Doomsday.

13
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>The Cythonnites... this Doomsday</i>

14
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:28,031
<i>is what they're sworn to protect.</i>

15
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:31,959
Find your Zeta-Beam gadget
and ride it back

16
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,049
to wherever you came from
and never come back!

17
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:35,818
Why do you want to save Lyta Zod?

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,253
Because I love her. Will you help her?

19
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:39,501
<i>She's a traitor.</i>

20
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,938
<i>If we don't stop Lyta's
execution, we lose Jayna.</i>

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,559
Pledge your support to my father.

22
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,328
Help us overthrow the Voice of Rao.

23
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,464
<i>One word from you, and she is saved.</i>

24
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,233
This world will only improve...

25
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:52,534
Under your leadership?

26
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,568
It is time to look to the future.

27
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,148
There's only one left
to complete the team,

28
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,387
<i>Commander Dev-Em.</i>

29
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:01,208
Perhaps it's time you saw
who it is you vowed to serve.

30
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:19,593
Primus! Please, Primus, help!

31
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,195
Help!

32
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:29,836
<i>You are being given a precious gift.</i>

33
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,708
Freedom from your concerns
and attachments.

34
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:45,751
You have now glimpsed
the infinite intelligence

35
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:49,689
and seen the deliverance that I bring.

36
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:56,462
Are you ready to serve?

37
00:01:56,565 --> 00:02:01,200
Are you ready to be
the instruments of my will?

38
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:16,100

39
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:30,195
We found him in a skimmer
heading for Argo City.

40
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,231
Praise be to Rao that you are unharmed.

41
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,166
Leave us.

42
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:39,871
I will personally see to it
that the savages

43
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,540
that perpetrated this attack
are dealt with swiftly.

44
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:43,975
No mercy shall be shown.

45
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,744
We will make Black Zero bleed for...

46
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,413
I find it curious that
the Chief Magistrate

47
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,883
would be out of the city as a
coup attempt was taking place.

48
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,152
You can't possibly believe
that I had anything

49
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,520
to do with this.

50
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,955
I was on a diplomatic mission.

51
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,957
There was nothing nefarious
about my absence.

52
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,426
- It was merely...
- Coincidence?

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,595
Your Eminence, please. I would...

54
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:07,664
You are lying.

55
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:11,434
So easy to tell with your species.

56
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:15,739
Intensified breathing,

57
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,174
elevated heart rate,

58
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,977
the pheromones you generate,

59
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,213
all are windows into
your limited nature.

60
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:28,485
There is nothing you can hide from me.

61
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,186
I had no part in this.

62
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:34,658
My allegiance belongs to you.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,225
Look at me.

64
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,895
None are worthy to look
upon the Voice of Rao's face.

65
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:50,439
There is no Voice of Rao.

66
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:56,779
Only the agent of Brainiac.

67
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:09,057
Checking the rear perimeter now.

68
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:15,096
I'm getting a very
bad feeling about this.

69
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,480
That's the third patrol we've
seen in the last two blocks.

70
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,847
It's the last day of Nova Cycle.

71
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,902
Why is there no one drunk
and running naked

72
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:22,304
through the streets?

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
How are you holding up?

74
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:27,508
I just need to catch my breath.

75
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,611
Something must have happened
to warrant the extra security.

76
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,990
We gotta get him to
a Guild hospital right now.

77
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:37,785
He is a wanted terrorist.

78
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:40,054
We won't get past the checkpoint.

79
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,857
Oh, shit.

80
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,932
Morning. Hi.

81
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,533
He... don't worry about him.

82
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,870
He's just another casualty
of the Nova celebrations,

83
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,537
if you know what I mean.

84
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,805
I'm gonna take him home.

85
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,741
S-home... that way.

86
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,809
I'll handle it myself. It's all good.

87
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,748
You have 20 minutes
before the curfew begins.

88
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,486
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for keeping us safe.

89
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,254
You guys have a good one, now.

90
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:23,662
- Come on, we're moving.
- Where are we taking him?

91
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:24,964
Only place we can.

92
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,734
Are you here to destroy us?

93
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,004
Don't be foolish.

94
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:33,973
I'm here to save you.

95
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,975
- From what?
- Entropy.

96
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:42,581
I will lead this city
into a glorious new future.

97
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:47,720
Your way of life preserved
for all eternity.

98
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,724
Then you and I share the same goals...

99
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:54,559
the same vision.

100
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:56,161
Let me serve you.

101
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,530
An interesting offer.

102
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:02,534
Let's put your newfound loyalty
to the test.

103
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:06,104
If I detect deception,

104
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,872
you die.

105
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,775
Who was behind this coup attempt?

106
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:15,780
I was, it...

107
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:19,150
Along with Primus Zod.

108
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,987
We also had the support of five
members of the Supreme Council.

109
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,258
Why did you wish your leader dead?

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,494
He was an ignorant zealot
who peddled false hopes

111
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,229
in a nonexistent god.

112
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:36,133
You don't believe
in this sun god of yours.

113
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,701
Why?

114
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:44,775
My parents...

115
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,311
worshiped the goddess of ice,

116
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,713
Cythonna.

117
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:52,583
After the Cataclysm,
all religions except Raoism

118
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:56,252
were banned but unofficially tolerated.

119
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,521
When the Voice of Rao was anointed,

120
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:02,425
he initiated the Great Purge,
and those who did not convert

121
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:06,429
were killed and disappeared.

122
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,764
And my parents refused.

123
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,537
And I never saw them again.

124
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,109
All I know is...

125
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,546
their god couldn't save them
any more than Rao could save

126
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,047
his prophet from you.

127
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,852
What's the point of believing
in something that has no power?

128
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,655
So what do you believe in?

129
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,324
Myself.

130
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,926
I took action because I could
see that I was the only one

131
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,662
in this city with the vision
and strength to lead.

132
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:44,966
And do you still hold to that belief?

133
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:51,205
No.

134
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:54,009
Perhaps you may be useful after all.

135
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,247
Tell me...

136
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,651
how would you deal with these traitors?

137
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,358
They must be publicly executed.

138
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,027
All of them. A message must be sent.

139
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,129
The people will expect it.

140
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,398
Let it be done.

141
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,469
I do have one more question.

142
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:26,607
Have you given me the names
of all the conspirators?

143
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,714
Nyssa-Vex,

144
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,816
my daughter...

145
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,388
She was also involved.

146
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,424
Then she must be executed too.

147
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:45,992
Correct?

148
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,800
I ask you to allow me to...

149
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,871
Handle this matter.

150
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,107
Very well.

151
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,759
- What's going on?
- Nyssa-Vex,

152
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,506
you've been placed
under arrest and confined

153
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,730
- to your quarters.
- Under whose authority?

154
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,532
Chief Magistrate Daron-Vex.

155
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:35,774
And that is why you can't see
a Rondor Beast's testicles

156
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,275
when it walks.

157
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,077
- I mean...
- Kem!

158
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,815
Seg, where have you been,
and who is this guy?

159
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,818
Get everyone out of here. Now.

160
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,889
- Now!
- Okay.

161
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,326
All right, everybody out!
Finish your drinks!

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,695
We're closed! Let's go!

163
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,930
Now.

164
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,932
Come on, let's go. Come on.

165
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,868
Go home to your families. They miss you.

166
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,102
- Hey.
- Closing time.

167
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,704
Leave your drinks. Pay me tomorrow.

168
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,873
You know, it's customary
to bring drunk people

169
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,676
out of the bar.

170
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,012
Yeah, bring him to the store room.

171
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,982
Come on, I'll get some fresh towels.

172
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,884
Come here.

173
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,228
He's getting worse. He needs a medic.

174
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,563
- Okay, I'm on it.
- Hey, wh-what are you doing?

175
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,431
All communications are being monitored.

176
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,834
- You should know that.
- Why?

177
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,069
What do you mean?

178
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,105
Seriously, you don't know?

179
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:45,408
There was a failed coup attempt.

180
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,688
They're looking for the conspirators.

181
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,777
The whole city's on lockdown.

182
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,753
See?

183
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:03,892
They're saying that she
orchestrated the whole thing.

184
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,399
It's a lie.

185
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,102
My mother would never betray the state.

186
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,403
I'm just telling you what
the official line is, okay?

187
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,385
They've rounded up everyone
else except for her,

188
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,942
and I think they're looking for you too.

189
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,878
And there is one more thing.

190
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,180
The lovely man that you
made me boot out of here,

191
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:29,718
well, he works as a clerk
in the Tower of Justice.

192
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,288
Apparently Nyssa-Vex has been arrested.

193
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,591
She's accused of being part of the coup.

194
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:39,293
Seg, they're gonna execute her.

195
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,203
Sorry.

196
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,139
Hello, Adam.

197
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,801
Is there something I can help you with?

198
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,837
Jesus H. Christ.

199
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:09,961
Well, you can start by not
scaring the shit out of me

200
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:13,251
- every time you enter the room.
- My apologies.

201
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:16,156
That's the mechanism
that brought you here.

202
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:18,459
Yeah, I need your help to fix it.

203
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,493
- It's urgent.
- Very well.

204
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,895
I'll need to run a structural analysis.

205
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,480
Ah!

206
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:30,568
Hmm, you seem quite proficient

207
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,271
with the operating systems.

208
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,473
Well, I haven't unlocked
the adult movies yet,

209
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:38,277
so your fortress
still holds some secrets.

210
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,814
Where's Seg?

211
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,318
No idea.

212
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:02,166
Oh, I'd... I'd offer you a drink,
but what'd be the point?

213
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:04,035
You're not a real boy.

214
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,539
I appreciate the tactful reminder.

215
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,341
You seem quite distressed.

216
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:12,410
Is there anything I can assist you with?

217
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:14,312
Oh, can you shoot lasers from your eyes

218
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,279
and bench press the Sun?

219
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,183
I'm afraid that's beyond
my capabilities.

220
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,054
Then just get that damn thing working.

221
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,961
Why is it so important?

222
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,637
Because I gotta get the hell
out of here, all right?

223
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,166
And where are you going?

224
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,909
Home.

225
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,347
The tissue's badly damaged.

226
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:53,148
His cells may not be able to regenerate,

227
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,952
but I'll do what I can.

228
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:59,822
This will stabilize him
during the procedure.

229
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,761
We need to find my mother.

230
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,930
I'll get you a change of clothes.

231
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,165
Ven.

232
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:25,079
What is it?

233
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,414
Nyssa.

234
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,616
They're gonna kill her.

235
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,318
She's not your responsibility.

236
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,120
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

237
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:33,555
If you go up to the Guilds,

238
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,468
you're putting your life
in unnecessary danger.

239
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,703
So I'm supposed to let her die?

240
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,292
A Vex murdered your grandfather.

241
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,029
And a Zod murdered my parents.

242
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:56,911
Just tell me why you would
risk your life to save her.

243
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,513
Because when I asked,

244
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,382
she was willing to save yours.

245
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,757
Just be careful.

246
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,326
If I find my mother, we meet back here.

247
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,418
Your mother's favorite song.

248
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,889
She always played it when you
had trouble getting to sleep.

249
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:46,492
I always admired your courage, Nyssa.

250
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:49,095
As a child,

251
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:53,899
nothing frightened you except failure.

252
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:57,703
That's why you are my favorite.

253
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:01,740
Please understand
I tried to protect you.

254
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:08,046
But there is no other way.

255
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,686
Call for help, and you die.

256
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:18,490
<i>A curfew's in effect for this sector.</i>

257
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,825
<i>All unauthorized citizens must return</i>

258
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,329
<i>to their residences immediately.</i>

259
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,031
One by one, search 'em out.

260
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,439
It's me.

261
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,243
Dev.

262
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,348
What is going on?

263
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,916
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

264
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,885
What happened?

265
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:51,155
Did my mother really try
to kill the Voice of Rao?

266
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,057
Yes.

267
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,630
- And I stood with her.
- Why?

268
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:02,199
Because I've always trusted her.

269
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:07,003
- But something happened.
- What?

270
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:11,908
We went to kill a man
and found a monster.

271
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,044
An alien. I-I don't know.

272
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,980
Blasters were useless.
We didn't have a chance.

273
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,514
Brainiac.

274
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,888
You know who this creature is?

275
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,490
Yes.

276
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,795
Has my mother tried to contact you?

277
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,530
I've been trying to find her.

278
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,802
Come with me.

279
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,670
I might have an idea where she is.

280
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,589
Tell anyone about this, and you'll wish

281
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,817
the Genesis Chamber never spat you out.

282
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:06,438
These should do the trick
for where we're going.

283
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,891
Thanks.

284
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,280
I'm glad you're with me.

285
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:21,948
What's wrong?

286
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,932
When I visited you in your cell...

287
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:27,869
you said you loved me.

288
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,735
Do you really mean it?

289
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:33,348
We've known each other
since we were children.

290
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:35,840
- Of course I love you.
- That's not what I meant.

291
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:43,224
I thought I was going to die.

292
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,084
You were there for me.

293
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,320
You've always been there for me. I...

294
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:55,848
I just wanted you to know
how much that means to me.

295
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,310
Thank you.

296
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,404
For what?

297
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:10,573
Caring enough to lie.

298
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,544
Come on.

299
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,863
Up until the moment
you pulled the trigger,

300
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,231
I didn't really think you would do it.

301
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,833
- Nyssa, please, I... I can...
- Shut up!

302
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:27,423
You don't get to talk.

303
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:34,997
All my life, I have watched
you betray and destroy

304
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,666
everyone around you.

305
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:39,101
But I always held up hope
that I was different.

306
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:41,270
- You are.
- I actually fooled myself

307
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:44,573
into believing that in your own
way you might actually love me.

308
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:45,908
I do. I do love you, Nyssa.

309
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,878
I gave up everything to please you.

310
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,114
I sacrificed my friendships,

311
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,883
my morality, even my own ambition!

312
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,453
You molded me to be your
perfect political ally.

313
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:00,789
I taught you the skills
you needed to survive in th...

314
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:02,190
No!

315
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:05,159
You taught me how to manipulate people,

316
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:08,630
then discard them when they've
outlived their usefulness.

317
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,867
I learned that lesson well.

318
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:14,635
It doesn't matter if she's under arrest.

319
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:16,857
As her intended, I have
every right to speak with her.

320
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,908
Take it up with the Lawmakers Guild.

321
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,311
If you touch me with
that thing one more time,

322
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:25,046
I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass,

323
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:28,348
you're gonna taste it.

324
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:35,556
Yes, Magistrate?

325
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,224
You can go in.

326
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,028
You killed my grandfather
when he tried to warn you

327
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,296
about Brainiac.

328
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:44,998
And now you are working for him.

329
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,801
- I had no choice.
- There's always a choice.

330
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,023
You just made the wrong one.

331
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,071
How's he gonna take the city?

332
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,733
I don't know what you're talking about.

333
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:57,911
Your new master is going
to rip Kandor from the ground

334
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,612
and enslave all of us.

335
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:02,949
I need to know how he's going
to do it so I can stop him.

336
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:06,252
I have no idea.

337
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:08,120
And even if it were true,

338
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:10,000
you're deluding yourself
if you think you have the power

339
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,390
to stop him.

340
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,960
Better to live under his rule
than to die.

341
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:16,128
Coward. You won't live to see it.

342
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,497
Killing me won't get you
past the guards.

343
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,766
- I can help you.
- We'll take our chances.

344
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,133
Think this through, Nyssa!

345
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,513
Even if somehow you leave
this room alive,

346
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:25,504
you won't get out of the Guilded Area.

347
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:27,372
The Sagitari know you're a traitor.

348
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:29,341
You won't even make it down the hallway.

349
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:32,143
- You need me.
- Not anymore.

350
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:34,746
Wait. I want him dead

351
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:37,949
just as much as you do.

352
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,317
But he's right.

353
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,819
We're gonna need him to get out of here.

354
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,199
If those guards hear blaster fire,

355
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:45,490
they're gonna be all over us.

356
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,592
Trust me.

357
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:49,861
His time will come.

358
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,736
Thank you.

359
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,173
Guards, guards, come quick...

360
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:51,737
I was an idiot
to think I could save him.

361
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,433
- Who?
- Big blue, the Boy Scout,

362
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:56,942
the Man of Steel.

363
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:00,267
God, he's got a lot of nicknames.

364
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,600
You know why?

365
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,449
He's a hero.

366
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,850
Heroes get nicknames.

367
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,716
What was your nickname?

368
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:13,611
I don't have one.

369
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:17,016
You said you're a great
hero of your planet.

370
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,820
I lied.

371
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,156
Apparently, that's
my superpower... lying.

372
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,088
No, I'm a wannabe. D-lister.

373
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,047
Can't fly, have no super strength,

374
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,324
no power ring.

375
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,837
No, the only thing I had going for me

376
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:35,493
was that Zeta-Beam device,
and now that's broken.

377
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,675
God, I suck.

378
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,071
So you making any progress
on this thing or what?

379
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,639
I gotta get out of here.

380
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,475
Why are you in such a hurry?

381
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:50,244
You know, you ask a lot of questions.

382
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,445
You sure you're not a cop?

383
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,383
No, your grandson doesn't
want me here anymore.

384
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:03,523
But you came here to help us
save our world.

385
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:08,028
- Why would Seg...
- Because I... screwed up.

386
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,763
Again.

387
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,100
So I'm going back to Earth to...

388
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:19,038
Send someone with a goddamn nickname.

389
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:31,151
Black Zero. They're in there.

390
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,584
Search the room!

391
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,392
Hey, you can get us out of here, right?

392
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:42,594
This way.

393
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:11,489
She was definitely here!

394
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:36,814
It's good to see you, Dev.

395
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,184
I feared I was the only one to escape.

396
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,152
You were, Primus.

397
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:52,462
But I'm here to correct that mistake.

398
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:53,897
What has he done to you?

399
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,966
He showed me the wonders
of the universe,

400
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,502
knowledge I never knew existed,

401
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:01,705
things you can't even imagine.

402
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:04,608
He's made me better, given me purpose.

403
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,243
And what is that?

404
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:10,179
To serve something greater
than weak and flawed leaders.

405
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:13,515
I serve a being who
has power over death.

406
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:16,352
With him, there will be no more pain,

407
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:18,020
no more suffering.

408
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:22,725
Imagine never having
to lose anyone ever again.

409
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:24,961
Come with me back to Kandor.

410
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,896
He will show you.

411
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:30,266
He will open your minds
the way he has mine.

412
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,100
And if we don't?

413
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:39,141
Then you will die here!

414
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:03,164
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

415
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:12,540
You did what had to be done.

416
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,451
You've failed.

417
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:28,355
How... unsurprising.

418
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:30,291
I swear...

419
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:34,060
I had every intention
of carrying out your orders.

420
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:36,229
I know you did.

421
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:40,434
If I sensed even for a moment
that you were lying,

422
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,537
you'd already be dead.

423
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:47,808
You may keep your life...

424
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:48,909
for now.

425
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,053
Your Eminence...

426
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:04,589
there is one other matter
I would like to address.

427
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:07,192
The end of the Nova Cycle celebration.

428
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,426
What of it?

429
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,229
If appearances are to be maintained,

430
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:13,698
you must extinguish
the Flame of Rebirth tonight.

431
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,834
The people will expect it,

432
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,802
along with the customary benediction.

433
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,339
Failure to do so
would only raise questions.

434
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:22,707
Very well.

435
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,678
I will double your security detail.

436
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,145
There's no need.

437
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,699
The Red Shard. My new guardians.

438
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,636
And loyal only to me.

439
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,043
You and Seg knew about this
creature all along?

440
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:02,023
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have done something.

441
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,981
Because talk of aliens
condemned you to the ice.

442
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,051
And would you have
believed me even if I did?

443
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,319
No.

444
00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:13,656
I'm sorry, Lyta.

445
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:19,495
I should have had more faith in you.

446
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:24,366
Yes, you should have.

447
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:26,502
There's one thing I need to understand.

448
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:29,739
If you didn't know Brainiac
had corrupted the Voice of Rao,

449
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,642
then why even attempt a coup?

450
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:35,477
It betrays everything
you have taught me...

451
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,281
every single principle
House Zod stands for.

452
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:50,926
Because Daron-Vex and his daughter...

453
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:55,597
offered to spare your life
in exchange for my help.

454
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,703
It was a choice between
my honor and my only child.

455
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,207
I chose you.

456
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,514
And I would do it again.

457
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:19,487
But all that matters now

458
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:22,123
is that we stop this creature.

459
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:25,359
We need to mount a resistance.

460
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:27,895
We need warriors.

461
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,233
There's someone I need you to meet.

462
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,078
Um...

463
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,182
Sorry, you are gonna pay
for his services, right?

464
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:52,119
We'll talk about it later.

465
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,526
Your resiliency is impressive.

466
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:01,394
I come from good stock.

467
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:05,097
Okay.

468
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,938
Who's your father?

469
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,346
Are you sure you want to know?

470
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,720
I never knew him.

471
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:30,489
Just that he was a soldier

472
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,592
and he was killed in
the battle for Kandor.

473
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,896
Mother, we need to find Seg.

474
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,702
Let's go.

475
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,243
So far so good.

476
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,755
We just need to get back to the tavern.

477
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,510
Next time we steal uniforms
off of dead guys,

478
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:56,307
could you please make sure
I go for the larger one?

479
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,995
- Why?
- Those trousers are so tight,

480
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,902
I nearly castrated myself.

481
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,534
Rao forbid.

482
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:04,837
By the way, where'd you
learn to fight like that?

483
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:08,360
A lover in the Military Guild.

484
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:09,864
Combat instructor.

485
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,700
She wasn't so faithful,
but she did teach me

486
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,130
how to defend myself.

487
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,601
Okay, we should get moving.

488
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,573
What is it?

489
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,776
Uh...

490
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,459
I'm not very good at this.

491
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:35,784
Thank you for putting
your life on the line for me.

492
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:38,186
- It was stupid, but...
- Wow, you're really not very

493
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,655
good at this, are you?

494
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,490
It's just not something
I expect for anyone

495
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:43,892
to do for me.

496
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:47,628
And it's not something
I think I deserve...

497
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,597
especially from you.

498
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:54,702
You really need to lighten up.

499
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,906
Maybe you can teach me.

500
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,549
It's them! Take them!

501
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:11,885
- Run!
- Go, go, go!

502
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,826
<i>Sector has curfew in effect.</i>

503
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:23,129
<i>Unless authorized, please
return to your residence.</i>

504
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,510
Why align yourself with Black Zero?

505
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:41,047
Why not come straight to us?

506
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,182
I needed access to weapons
and a fighting force.

507
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,751
It was the most efficient way.

508
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:47,686
Besides, I don't think you
would have exactly

509
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,588
welcomed me with open arms.

510
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,998
As Zods, we swear an oath
to protect our people.

511
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,334
You took actions that
resulted in the deaths

512
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:03,669
of innocent Kandorians.

513
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,071
I regret all lives lost.

514
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,274
But it was necessary
to maintain my cover.

515
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,108
I fight for more than just a city.

516
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,542
I fight for all of Krypton.

517
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,445
And the lives of a few
is a small price to pay

518
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,748
to save an entire world.

519
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,351
As a Zod, you should understand that.

520
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:26,524
Nyssa, no, no, no, no, no, wait!

521
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:28,025
Come on, come on, come on.

522
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,527
Shit.

523
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,795
Get on your knees.

524
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:32,397
Hands behind your head now.

525
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,665
I'm the one you want, okay?

526
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,333
He's done nothing wrong. Let him go.

527
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:36,668
No one's going anywhere.

528
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,869
On authority of the Voice of Rao...

529
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,006
Why are you smiling?

530
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:44,308
'Cause you're about to get
punched in the face.

531
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,947
You'll never be more attractive to me

532
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,316
than you are in this moment.

533
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:55,185
We need to move.

534
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,053
Yeah.

535
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,658
- She doesn't belong here.
- Lyta's right.

536
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,961
She's an opportunist,
just like her father.

537
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:07,062
She'll betray us at the first
chance she gets.

538
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,698
You're wrong. We can trust her.

539
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,065
Why should we trust her?

540
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,235
Because none of our hands are clean!

541
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:22,744
And we are going to need each other

542
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,646
if we're gonna defeat Brainiac.

543
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,615
If you can't trust her...

544
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:31,086
Then trust me.

545
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:36,892
So, what are we going to do?

546
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:38,493
We need to raise an army.

547
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,730
We can go to Kryptonopolis,
establish a base there,

548
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:45,333
reach out to other city-states,
and return in force.

549
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,001
My sisters live there.

550
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,914
They can provide us with those
resources and connections

551
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,739
- we need.
- There's no time.

552
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:53,174
Brainiac's gonna take the city
in a matter of weeks.

553
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,309
We must stay and fight!

554
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:57,578
We will not stand a chance.

555
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
He controls the Sagitari.

556
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:01,482
If we attempt this ourselves,
we'll be slaughtered.

557
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:02,884
Then so be it.

558
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,718
If we are going to die, then at least...

559
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,719
I'm just gonna stop you there.

560
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:09,090
Um, I don't wanna die, so...

561
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:11,492
There's another way.

562
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:12,893
The Nova Cycle celebration.

563
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,862
That's how we get our army.

564
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,298
Not with that. Our weapons have no

565
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,044
- effect on him.
- They might not harm him,

566
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,869
but they will piss him off...

567
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,104
when everyone was gonna be watching.

568
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:27,674
If we can provoke him into
revealing his true nature,

569
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:31,411
if we can show the people
that the Voice of Rao

570
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:33,213
is an alien creature,

571
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:35,615
the entire city will rise

572
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,483
and stand against him.

573
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:40,020
We will have our army.

574
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:44,064
Well, I believe I found the problem.

575
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,569
You're shitting me.

576
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:48,340
That's repulsive,
and I most certainly am not.

577
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:52,275
No, the device's photonic
discharge cells were damaged.

578
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:54,229
Well, can you fix it?

579
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,830
I already have.

580
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,534
So...

581
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,639
- I can leave?
- If that's your choice.

582
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,944
But tell me something first.

583
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:14,849
If you're not a real hero,
as you claim to be,

584
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:17,584
Why'd you come here in the first place?

585
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,820
Because I thought I could become one.

586
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:23,157
I thought that if I could
just save Superman,

587
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:25,003
then the Justice League
would have to notice me

588
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,693
and maybe even people
would look up to me.

589
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:29,929
And maybe, just maybe,
when I look in that mirror,

590
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:33,133
I wouldn't see a loser
staring back at me.

591
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:35,135
That's all gone now.

592
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:40,273
Whatever happened between you
and Seg can be fixed.

593
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,775
He may be stubborn,

594
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:46,445
but he knows a true friend
when he finds one.

595
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:49,115
Ah, there's no fixing this.

596
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:51,017
Adam, Adam.

597
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,487
No matter what you think about yourself,

598
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,456
being a hero is not about...

599
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,492
It's not about strength or having

600
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,794
extraordinary capabilities.

601
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:07,233
It's about making the decision
to help others.

602
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,868
Now, regardless of the reason,

603
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,171
you chose to come here.

604
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:14,873
You can still set things right.

605
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,009
Hmm?

606
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,646
- You're right.
- Mm.

607
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,816
I can.

608
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,920
There's something here
I still need to do.

609
00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:30,355
And what's that?

610
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,558
Kill General Zod and prevent
Seg from saving Kandor.

611
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,026
I don't understand.

612
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:36,461
You won't have to.

613
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:38,463
- What are you doing?
- Erasing all record

614
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:39,531
of this conversation.

615
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,870
Hello, Adam.

616
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:48,672
Is there something I can help you with?

617
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:50,908
Piss off, ghost.

618
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,576
Adam.

619
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,982
We receive the gift of light.

620
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:00,984
From Rao, all blessings flow.

621
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:03,287
We receive the gift of light.

622
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:05,589
His radiance gives us life.

623
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,891
We receive the gift of light.

624
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:10,461
His magnificence fills our...

625
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:32,548
His Eminence will now
conclude the proceedings.

626
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,599
On a three count.

627
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:55,971
It is through fire that we are reborn.

628
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,542
It cleanses and purifies.

629
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:04,446
- One...
- Taking away all misdeeds.

630
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:07,215
- Two...
- Making us worthy

631
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,119
of the mercy that Rao
has bestowed upon us.

632
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,621
This creature...

633
00:40:12,723 --> 00:40:14,189
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

634
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,990
- Is deceiving you!
- This is heresy!

635
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:18,126
This thing is not a prophet of Rao.

636
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:21,463
- Remove her!
- He's not even a man!

637
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:25,200
No. Let her be.

638
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:27,001
She's right.

639
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:32,841
I have transcended into something more.

640
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,231
Your faith has been rewarded.

641
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,367
I have come to lift you out of despair

642
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:03,236
and make your city whole.

643
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,971
From this moment forward,

644
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:07,473
the divide between Guilded and Rankless

645
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,275
will be no more.

646
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:13,045
All will prosper and thrive.

647
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:17,216
And because of your devotion,
I will lead you to a place

648
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,418
of eternal life.

649
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,187
You will become immortal.

650
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:24,456
Now speak with one voice.

651
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:27,426
Who wants to live forever?

652
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:45,172

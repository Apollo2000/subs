1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,289
<i>Every moment of your life is a test,</i>

2
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:04,718
<i>one that reveals who you are.</i>

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,873
<i>And if you truly
are worthy of the name Zod,</i>

4
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>you will follow
in the footsteps of those</i>

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,543
<i>who have come before you.</i>

6
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,146
<i>Or you will die trying.</i>

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,448
If you didn't know
Brainiac had corrupted

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,217
<i>the Voice of Rao,
then why even attempt a coup?</i>

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
<i>Because Daron-Vex
offered to spare your life</i>

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,089
<i>in exchange for my help.</i>

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,925
- Stop!
- And I would do it again.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,426
Hello, Father.

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,095
I came to tell you...

14
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,931
<i>that I forgive you</i>

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,868
for what you tried to do to me.

16
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,236
Black Zero is in.

17
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,638
They want something in return.

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,575
There he is. My old friend, Daron-Vex.

19
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,944
We have a lot of catching up to do.

20
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,448
Ona!

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,683
What's wrong?

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,901
Through fire, we are reborn.

23
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,564
<i>I learned of a pre-cataclysm instrument</i>

24
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,800
<i>of violence so powerful</i>

25
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:13,102
<i>it would give even Brainiac pause.</i>

26
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,448
That thing in there,

27
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:15,745
they told me it's called Doomsday.

28
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:17,222
If you let that thing loose

29
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,490
it will kill everything
that it comes across.

30
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:20,791
It's true.

31
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:22,385
That's why we have given over our lives

32
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,829
to protecting the universe
from Doomsday.

33
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,025
What does this alien want?

34
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:58,128
To rip this city right from the ground

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,396
and add it to his collection.

36
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:00,764
You didn't really think

37
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,766
the Voice of Rao was a god, did you?

38
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,669
Why kill the chancellor? And the others?

39
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,872
All I can say is there's going to be

40
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:12,236
a lot more bodies if we don't find him.

41
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:13,777
Look...

42
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,877
I can't risk being up here any longer.

43
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,080
Just have you Sagitari...

44
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,615
You mean what's left of the Sagitari?

45
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,284
They're already spread too thin.

46
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:24,253
The remains of the Council
are either dead or in hiding.

47
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,921
The Primus has turned traitor.

48
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:29,124
Black Zero is openly
walking the streets.

49
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:31,627
I can't help you.

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,406
Do us a favor and go back inside.

51
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,906
It's not safe out here. Go on! Move!

52
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,518
Whoa.

53
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,511
It's chaos out there.

54
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:01,651
I know. And it's getting worse.

55
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,024
Pretty soon people
are going to figure out

56
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,284
that no one's in charge.

57
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,093
Then the whole city is going
to descend into anarchy.

58
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,562
Making it even harder to find the Voice.

59
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,597
Three days of searching and nothing.

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,900
Nyssa said they found a trail
of mangled bodies

61
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,902
leading out of the Tower of Justice.

62
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:16,971
She's there now.
She's trying to find out more.

63
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,387
Brave of her.

64
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,441
We need to find him, Lyta.
We need to find him

65
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,243
and stop him
from bringing Brainiac here.

66
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:23,577
We will.

67
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,213
And we'll make him pay
for what he's done.

68
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,084
How's Dev?

69
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,286
I-I managed to get him in a med bay.

70
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,788
He's recovering.

71
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,271
Itching to get back in the fight.

72
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,083
Good.

73
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:42,729
We're going to need him.

74
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,234
And a whole lot more just like him.

75
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,570
Seg...

76
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,307
I know losing Ona was hard for Kem,

77
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,009
but sending him to Kryptonopolis...

78
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,213
Was that to help him or to help you?

79
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,286
I'm worried you're starting to think

80
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,023
this fight we're in,
that maybe we can't win it.

81
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,937
Is that what you think?

82
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,394
Everything that Adam said...

83
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,349
about my grandson, about the Els,

84
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,605
about who we are...

85
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,440
who we're meant to be.

86
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:48,726
He believed that
I could save the universe.

87
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:53,998
I couldn't even save him.

88
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:59,404
I've lost too many people already, Lyta.

89
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,006
I can't lose anyone else.

90
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,648
You're not going to lose me.

91
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:40,471

92
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,144
<i>You cannot stop me.</i>

93
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:14,933
<i>I am coming for you and your world.</i>

94
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,852
That's a lot of hardware.

95
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:00,387
The Voice of Rao is wounded.

96
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,688
And like all wounded animals,

97
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,223
this is when they are most dangerous.

98
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,059
No one's seen him. He's in hiding.

99
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,294
It's not him we're going after.

100
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:10,330
The fall in the Genesis Chamber
didn't kill the Voice.

101
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,732
The only way to fight something
that cannot be killed

102
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,835
is with a weapon that is unkillable.

103
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:24,377
We're going to get Doomsday?

104
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:42,161
Look how far you've fallen, old friend.

105
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,166
The same could be said for you,

106
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,434
Sela-Sonn.

107
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,806
How does one transition...

108
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,407
from one of the most respected

109
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,276
and highly regarded members
of the Science Guild,

110
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,580
protégé of the great Val-El, no less,

111
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,448
to leader of an insurgency

112
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,819
whose only currency
is death and destruction?

113
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,489
It started with a betrayal.

114
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,129
From someone I trusted.

115
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,534
You think I didn't know?

116
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,770
That you'd covered your tracks so well

117
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,472
I wouldn't follow them back to you.

118
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,880
That's no excuse.

119
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,950
You dedicated your life to saving lives.

120
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,319
Not destroying them.

121
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,924
That was a long time ago.

122
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,961
And all my work trying
to ease people's suffering

123
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,831
gave me keen insight
into how to inflict it.

124
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,869
I have a lot of questions
for you, Daron,

125
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,038
and I intend to get answers.

126
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,046
And my name is Jax-Ur now.

127
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,532
Lyta's disappeared.

128
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,034
So has Zod.

129
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,037
With far more firepower
than one man can handle

130
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,774
and with one of Black Zero's skimmers.

131
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:41,343
They're going for Doomsday.

132
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,079
To think you were all expecting me

133
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,880
to screw you guys over.

134
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,726
I realize this wasn't easy for you.

135
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:00,494
Going against Seg.

136
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:05,233
And I understand
why you admire his idealism.

137
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:08,069
But ideals are no good to the dead.

138
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,571
It was sheer luck that he survived

139
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:11,940
that blast in the tavern.

140
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,205
Get to the point.

141
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:16,083
It's up to us to save him
and everyone else.

142
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:19,832
And the only way we can do that
is by making the hard choices.

143
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:24,184
Even ones as extreme
as unleashing Doomsday.

144
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,756
But how can we be sure?

145
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:31,058
You said Doomsday
is a genetically engineered

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,893
killing machine
that can't be controlled.

147
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,195
He functions like any apex predator.

148
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:37,652
Focusing on the most
formidable opponent first.

149
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:39,867
- That's Brainiac.
- Great.

150
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:41,434
And after that, he'll work his way

151
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:42,836
down the food chain.

152
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:43,937
That's us.

153
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,939
Before that happens,

154
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,075
we return him to stasis.

155
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,644
We're risking a lot on
being able to pull that off.

156
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:52,812
That's Seg talking.

157
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:55,448
Don't think of this as a betrayal.

158
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,016
You and I, we're Zods.

159
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:58,920
Duty-bound to protect our people

160
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,679
by any means necessary.

161
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:01,954
Seg's an El.

162
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,423
He will never understand that.

163
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:07,326
But at least he'll be alive
to forgive you.

164
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:40,058
So how are you planning
on getting inside?

165
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,759
I'd like to know that, too.

166
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,196
'Cause all that firepower isn't
going to get you in there.

167
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:47,933
You need a Zod and an El.

168
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,667
And I won't do it.

169
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,037
I don't need you to.

170
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,613
Lyta, you once asked

171
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,368
if I knew who my father was.

172
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,196
At the time, I didn't.

173
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:09,931
But I do now.

174
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,886
House of Zod...

175
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,941
House of El.

176
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:22,430
You're both. You're my son.

177
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:48,930
Where is it?

178
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:53,988
Seg, if you know something...

179
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:56,338
Doomsday is already
far beyond your reach.

180
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:59,206
I've made sure of that.

181
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,642
You knew.

182
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:05,045
It was your mother who convinced me.

183
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,749
She knew that Zod would come for it.

184
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,117
I just never thought
that you'd help him do it.

185
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,864
You couldn't have moved it far.

186
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,540
- I will find it.
- You like to believe

187
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,234
you're a few steps ahead, General.

188
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,669
But it turns out I know these
tunnels better than you do.

189
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,971
How else do you think we beat you here,

190
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:24,741
when you snuck away
in the middle of the night?

191
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,245
Then you have sealed Krypton's fate.

192
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,222
Careful.

193
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,753
<i>Seg, come in.</i>

194
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,199
Go ahead.

195
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,853
<i>We have a problem.</i>

196
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,993
Admit it, Daron.

197
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:48,828
Admit what you did
and this pain will end.

198
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:50,663
I didn't do anything.

199
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,402
Exactly.

200
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:57,470
I trusted you.

201
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,840
I told you of my fears
and you did nothing.

202
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,545
You were the one who
restored the Codex technology.

203
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,429
What did you think was going to happen?

204
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,201
Without my work on the Codex,
the Genesis Chamber

205
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,012
would have become unsustainable

206
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,162
and we would have lost
our only means of reproduction.

207
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,075
Well, if your intentions
were so noble...

208
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,935
why is you work shrouded
in such secrecy?

209
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:30,737
Because I knew

210
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,774
that in the wrong hands it could be used

211
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,777
to purify the Guilded bloodlines.

212
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,581
Weed out those viewed as weaker.

213
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,483
Just never could have imagined

214
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:43,685
you would be the one to betray me.

215
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:50,526
Back then, the only people I
trusted were you and Val-El.

216
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,995
<i>And when you sentenced him to death...</i>

217
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:56,297
<i>I knew I was next.</i>

218
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:01,602
That's not the worst
of it, is it, Daron?

219
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:05,173
You had to take it one step further.

220
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:08,576
Yes, I know about the Vara Protocol.

221
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:15,349
And now you are going
to tell me how to access it.

222
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:28,895
Why have we stopped?

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,832
What's happening?

224
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,837
Raika, what's going on?

225
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,441
The containment field.

226
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,875
It is failing.

227
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,376
What do you mean, failing?

228
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,216
He thinks we damaged it
when we moved it.

229
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,986
This is all that keeps the beast inside.

230
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,921
How long do we have?

231
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:56,307
It is ancient technology.

232
00:15:56,385 --> 00:16:00,151
It could be days or weeks.

233
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,996
Or maybe hours.

234
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:05,331
One thing is certain,

235
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,568
the beast will break free of his tomb.

236
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:20,054
Now I know why, growing up,

237
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,168
my mother never spoke of her mother.

238
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,504
The shame she must have felt.

239
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:28,006
Your willingness to betray everything

240
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,809
the House of Zod stands for.

241
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:33,446
I'm fighting for a better Kandor.

242
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,982
You and I can restore order to Kandor.

243
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,752
I reclaim my role
as Primus of the Sagitari,

244
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:42,520
and with you by my side

245
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,313
we can rebuild our city.

246
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,391
Return it to what it once was.

247
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,060
Not the Kandor he wants to create,

248
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,628
a place ruled by fear!

249
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:54,132
How can you say that?

250
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,534
All my life all you have done

251
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:58,970
is make me afraid.

252
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,638
Afraid that I wasn't good enough.

253
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,874
That I wasn't strong enough.

254
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,177
That I wasn't worthy of the Zod name.

255
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,646
I have failed you

256
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:11,248
in so many ways, Lyta.

257
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:15,119
I tried to mold you
into a hardened warrior.

258
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:18,022
Tried to drive out your love for Seg.

259
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:22,026
Your refusal to follow orders
you disagreed with.

260
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:26,197
I saw your constant questioning
as a weakness.

261
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:30,567
And now I see
it's your greatest strength.

262
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,104
Don't lose it now when you need it most.

263
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:38,274
Because you're going
to have to make a choice.

264
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,816
Grandpa, come in. Do you read me?

265
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,817
Yes. What's wrong?

266
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,021
You weren't by any chance programmed by

267
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,588
real Grandpa with a working knowledge

268
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,257
of ancient Kryptonian
technology, were you?

269
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,459
Like, say, how to repair

270
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,194
the containment field
on a capsule designed

271
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:00,518
to hold a genetic experiment
gone horribly wrong?

272
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,899
No, but I'd be willing to try.

273
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:07,629
Well, that's confidence-inspiring.

274
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,471
Would you like me to divert my efforts

275
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,630
from determining the proximity
of Brainiac's ship?

276
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,646
Has it arrived in our system yet?

277
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:17,183
No, but it's only a matter of time.

278
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:18,388
Then let's concentrate

279
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:20,616
on problems closer to home first.

280
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:25,357
Thank you, old friend.

281
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:28,477
You've been very helpful.

282
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,394
Wait!

283
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,986
There's one more secret

284
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:41,756
I didn't divulge to your leader.

285
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,892
And what would that be?

286
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:46,427
One that could make you

287
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,597
one of the richest men in Kandor.

288
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:52,299
The location of the Voice of Rao's cache

289
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:55,069
of untraceable solars.

290
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,371
You can't buy me.

291
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:01,275
Perhaps you just haven't
been offered the right price.

292
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:03,810
Think of your family.

293
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:06,647
All that you could do for them.

294
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:09,049
I have no family.

295
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,585
They died in the Xarxas outbreak.

296
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:14,610
All the medication
was rationed to the Guilded.

297
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,546
It was not a quick death.

298
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,862
So unless you can bring them back,

299
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:24,655
you have nothing I could want.

300
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,623
Please. Please.

301
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:28,292
You have to help me.

302
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,094
Look into your heart. I'm begging you.

303
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,428
You can't let me die here.

304
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,496
No, please!

305
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,031
I'll do anything. Anything!

306
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,899
Just please, please, let me g...

307
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:43,540
Please! Please!

308
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,710
Please, you can't leave me in here!

309
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,345
Please!

310
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,182
Please, help me.

311
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,257
I can't die here in this place.

312
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:15,584
Talk to Raika about
the fastest way to the surface.

313
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,173
I'm going to go get the skimmer.

314
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,144
Or we could not do that.

315
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,256
What are you doing?

316
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,225
It is time for my people

317
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,627
to rid themself of this burden.

318
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,629
We will take the creature to your city.

319
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,132
And risk the lives
of everyone in Kandor?

320
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,768
You can't be serious.

321
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,236
Look, you'll never get it
through the Outlands.

322
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,472
These catacombs contain many secrets.

323
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,408
Even a tunnel to your city.

324
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,479
And when the Collector
of Worlds comes for Kandor,

325
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:00,347
he will take Doomsday along with it.

326
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,517
And my people will be free
of their duty.

327
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,719
And Krypton will be free of the threat

328
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:06,887
from that vile creature.

329
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:09,123
That's not going to happen.

330
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:11,225
We're going to stop Brainiac.

331
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,993
You cannot even stop your own people

332
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,562
from trying to take the beast.

333
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:18,665
How will you defeat an alien conqueror?

334
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,701
You will fail, Seg-El.

335
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:22,302
Listen to me.

336
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:24,838
If Brainiac is allowed to take Kandor,

337
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,269
then eventually all of Krypton
will be destroyed as a result.

338
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,610
Eventually.

339
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,012
We're guaranteed destruction far sooner

340
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:35,616
if we do not rid ourself
of this scourge.

341
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:52,298
You saved my life once.

342
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,133
And for that, I will allow both of you

343
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,168
to leave this place alive.

344
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,402
But try to stop us,

345
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,804
and you will die where you stand.

346
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:14,208
I'm done wasting time.

347
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,174
Are you really going to shoot me?

348
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:19,669
Take one step further and find out.

349
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:21,095
Then do it.

350
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:23,597
Better that than
stand here doing nothing

351
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,766
with our planet facing destruction.

352
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:29,836
Mother stop, please don't do this.

353
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,974
No!

354
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,810
Very well.

355
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:42,949
You say you intend to restore Kandor

356
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:47,287
and reclaim your position
as Primus of the Sagitari.

357
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:50,691
Well, so do I.

358
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,531
Jayna-Zod, I, Dru-Zod,

359
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,866
hereby invoke the spirit of Jo-Mon

360
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,369
and our ancient traditions
in challenging you

361
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:06,573
to a Kandorian Duel.

362
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:10,976
For the loser, no mercy will be shown.

363
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:19,518
I accept.

364
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,654
Mother...

365
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,467
Are you being quiet because
you're coming up with a plan?

366
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:38,937
The Voice of Rao
is still helping Brainiac

367
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,093
get here to take Kandor...

368
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,405
which now

369
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:44,149
has a genetically-engineered
killing machine

370
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:45,444
ready to break free of its cage

371
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:47,712
somewhere underneath it.

372
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:49,380
You know,

373
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:51,582
we could take a skimmer,

374
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:53,584
make a break for Argo City.

375
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,620
If you're planning on joining
the rapidly swelling ranks

376
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:57,388
of people screwing me over,

377
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,291
I'd appreciate it
if you just got it over with.

378
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:05,062
I'm not Lyta.

379
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:07,030
I believe in you.

380
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,006
Maybe you shouldn't.

381
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:07,562
You sell skimmers, right?

382
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:11,026
I want the fastest one you have.

383
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,762
One that won't be picked up
by any of the city scanners.

384
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:17,681
One that I am prepared
to pay a great deal for.

385
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,368
In fact...

386
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,505
I could make you one
of the richest men in Kandor.

387
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,839
Adam should have given
this to someone else.

388
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:01,008
Instead of giving his life for mine.

389
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,743
But he chose you.

390
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,075
Yeah, well, you met Adam.

391
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,782
Not to speak ill of the dead, but...

392
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,952
he wasn't exactly
the brightest star in the sky.

393
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,696
He picked a guy...

394
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:17,219
whose only accomplishment

395
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,922
is having a grandson,
who I'll never meet...

396
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,237
Who does something great one day.

397
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,495
Becomes a hero.

398
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:31,807
Becomes this...

399
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,456
Superman.

400
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:41,214
Do you know the origins of the El sigil?

401
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,185
It comes from
an ancient Kryptonian word.

402
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,401
That means hope.

403
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:53,002
Our house wasn't just given that symbol.

404
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:56,429
Our ancestors chose it.

405
00:26:56,864 --> 00:27:00,445
And the generations
to follow defined it.

406
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,773
Not through words...

407
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,752
but through action.

408
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,650
As long as there is an El on Krypton,

409
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:14,142
there will be hope.

410
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,194
And hope...

411
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:21,218
can be a powerful weapon.

412
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,207
Get away from me.

413
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:31,182
- How dare you.
- What?

414
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:33,116
Intervening in a Kandorian Duel.

415
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,843
I saved you.

416
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:36,339
You stole my honor.

417
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,488
Oh, would you like to be buried with it?

418
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,057
You talk about making hard choices.

419
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,992
Well, I have made one.

420
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,867
Forget her.

421
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:54,404
We have to go.

422
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,411
What is it?

423
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,080
Daron-Vex escaped.

424
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,648
Fled in a skimmer.

425
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,651
He could be halfway through
Outlands by now.

426
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,221
Ever the survivor.

427
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:40,215
Still can't reach Jayna.

428
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:41,983
We need to get through to her.

429
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:43,584
She's the one best suited
to tracking down

430
00:29:43,686 --> 00:29:45,186
the Cythonnites and Doomsday.

431
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,821
And the other problem?

432
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,990
Been thinking about that too.

433
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:50,541
We never knew why the Voice

434
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:52,284
was draining power
from the Genesis Chamber.

435
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:54,896
But I think I know now, and if I'm right

436
00:29:54,998 --> 00:29:57,965
Brainiac will be here sooner
than we thought.

437
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:02,436
What if he needs it
to power Brainiac's ship?

438
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:04,171
Bring it here.

439
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,206
He's probably looking
for another source.

440
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,277
But where else would he
get that kind of power?

441
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:11,078
Grandpa?

442
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,946
There's only one option.

443
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:16,116
The generator that powers
the city's protective dome.

444
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:19,352
Then that's where we make our stand.

445
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:22,156
But we're going to need help.

446
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,244
This could be our last chance
to save Kandor.

447
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:25,926
You want me to commit
the few remaining Sagitari

448
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:28,561
we have left to work
alongside terrorists?

449
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,697
Never! They have hunted us,

450
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,454
executed us, forced us underground,

451
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,303
and now you want us to turn
to our oppressors for help,

452
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,402
at the very moment
when we've gained a foothold?

453
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:41,207
That foothold's about
to be ripped from under you.

454
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,509
And it will happen.

455
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,019
Brainiac is coming
and he will take Kandor.

456
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,313
Unless we declare a truce.

457
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,714
And combine our forces

458
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:51,818
to put an end
to this threat to our world.

459
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,453
All right, but when this is over

460
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,989
we will round up Black Zero

461
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,324
and take back the city.

462
00:30:58,426 --> 00:30:59,826
<i>We will shatter the Guilds,</i>

463
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,427
strip the ranked of their power,

464
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,662
and we will return Kandor to its people.

465
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:05,063
Or maybe, instead of both sides

466
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,366
killing each other
we can use this as a chance

467
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:10,110
to build a better tomorrow.

468
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:13,805
You sound like your grandfather.

469
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:17,813
Don't forget which side
had him executed.

470
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:27,865
Jayna. Jayna!

471
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,582
Daron-Vex, manual override.

472
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:13,553
Passcode: Hantha, Flame-bird, Rokan,

473
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:18,654
Oregus, two, nine, seven, one, eight.

474
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:21,663
<i>Passcode accepted.</i>

475
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:24,295
Initiate Vara Protocol.

476
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,051
What are they?

477
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:47,030
Clones.

478
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,757
Of the most elite ranked houses.

479
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:53,293
For what?

480
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,107
So that the people who have everything

481
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,701
can hold onto it.

482
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,065
Forever.

483
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:12,014
With our combined forces
we can defeat him,

484
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,091
but it will come at a cost.

485
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:22,737
I know that we all
have our differences here.

486
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,246
But we only have one city

487
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:30,863
and a common enemy
who wants to take it from us.

488
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,065
So let's work together.

489
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:36,502
Let's hit the Voice of Rao
with everything that we've got.

490
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,137
I don't take orders from you.

491
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,473
I don't take orders
from you either, or you.

492
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,855
It wasn't so much an order
as a common sense suggestion.

493
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:49,121
Now you do what you have to do.

494
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,246
But I'm going.

495
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:03,628
Look, if this goes badly...

496
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,343
and there's every indication
that it will...

497
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,067
I want you to take this.

498
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,835
You go to the fortress, you tell Val

499
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:13,071
to shut everything down,
and you take that skimmer

500
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:14,672
to Argo City.

501
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:16,807
Sure you wouldn't
rather me take a blaster?

502
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,056
I need you to do this.

503
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,705
You're the only one that I can trust.

504
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,161
<i>Unit 1, in position.</i>

505
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:04,253
<i>Unit 2, in position.</i>

506
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,710
Unit 3, in position.

507
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,926
<i>Let's go.</i>

508
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:32,381
Fascinating.

509
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,837
Opposing forces with nothing in common

510
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,765
but their obsession with power.

511
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,068
One hoping to cling to it,

512
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,804
the other to seize it.

513
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:46,740
Now united...

514
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:48,919
against me.

515
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:56,516
But tell me:

516
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:58,184
does you fear of me

517
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:02,021
outweigh your fear of each other?

518
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,866
- What are you doing?
- It's not me!

519
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,571
I swear!

520
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:19,005
Whoa! whoa!

521
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:21,741
Guns down! Guns down! Guns down!

522
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,442
Such weak minds.

523
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:27,801
Polluted by fear and hatred.

524
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,208
So easily manipulated.

525
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:33,551
Go on.

526
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,158
You know you want to.

527
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,354
You did what you had to do.

528
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:57,756
If we don't find Doomsday,

529
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,523
this will all have been for nothing.

530
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:00,630
Maybe not.

531
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,591
Doomsday was the only way I could see

532
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:04,158
to destroy Brainiac, but there may be

533
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,430
someone who has another way.

534
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,294
Who?

535
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:11,045
Val-El.

536
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:14,104
Val-El died 14 cycles ago.

537
00:38:14,206 --> 00:38:16,473
No, he didn't.

538
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:31,021
You think I'm responsible for this?

539
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,260
All I did was offer an opportunity

540
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:39,529
for them to express their truth.

541
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:42,899
So easy when desire is so strong.

542
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:46,303
Now come closer.

543
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:04,820
Interesting...

544
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:09,224
that you, a being
of no apparent significance,

545
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,487
are the cause of so much trouble.

546
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:13,696
A shame.

547
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:17,098
You would have been quite the prize.

548
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:06,747
If I'm being 100% honest,

549
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:09,263
I really didn't expect that to happen.

550
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,880
You all right?

551
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,988
Shouldn't you be on
that skimmer to Argo City?

552
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,339
We have to go.

553
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:59,498
We have to go.

554
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,552
Krypton.

555
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:35,021
Your world

556
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:38,331
is mine.

557
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,800

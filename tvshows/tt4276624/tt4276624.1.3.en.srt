1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,006
Previously on Krypton...

2
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,280
Val of House El,

3
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,504
you are hereby sentenced to death.

4
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,002
No!

5
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:09,080
Seg, someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

6
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,450
Take this. You have to find the fortress.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,818
Grandfather was no traitor.

8
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:15,287
He was a hero.

9
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,857
Welcome to your grandfather's
Fortress of Solitude.

10
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:20,760
Val was determined to prove that
we weren't alone in the universe.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,661
We have to finish his work.

12
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,830
Who's your accomplice, Charys?!

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,131
I love you. It was me!

14
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,833
No, Val!

15
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,902
No!

16
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,837
- Please, no, please!
- No!

17
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:35,040
Your parents chose chaos.

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,177
I need to know if you intend
to follow in their footsteps.

19
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:39,378
I don't.

20
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,081
The blood of House El
will forever bind us.

21
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:45,751
Hello, Seg.

22
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,019
Grandfather.

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm a projection of Val-El.

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,256
You've still got me, Seg.

25
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,424
We were never gonna find
a way to be together.

26
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,560
You want me to bind with your daughter?

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,507
Okay.

28
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:58,322
Even if I never get to bear
the sigil of my own house,

29
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,666
I will not wear yours.

30
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:02,268
Commander? What is all this?

31
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:04,336
The Rankless initiative.

32
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:07,039
We're going down to the
Rankless to crack some skulls.

33
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:10,876
You are Lyta of House Zod.
You are a warrior.

34
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:12,278
Commander Quex-Ul.

35
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,614
I challenge you to a Kandorian duel.

36
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:19,117
No mercy will be shown.

37
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,467
Lyta-Zod.

38
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:25,057
I hereby appoint you Commander
of Fourth Squad, Sagitari.

39
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:26,859
Here's something you don't see every day.

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,594
The meteor shower
reported in the Outlands.

41
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:29,595
We're gonna check that out.

42
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:31,015
Something crashed here.

43
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:33,356
This better be something real, Earth man.

44
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,566
I'm getting tired of being...

45
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,515
Val!

46
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:42,817
Grandfather!

47
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:48,789
Hello, Seg.

48
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,593
You look super realistic for a...

49
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,594
Val, Adam.

50
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:55,496
Adam, Val.

51
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,698
This was found in the Outlands.

52
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,101
- We think it's a...
- I know what it is.

53
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,836
It's one of Braniac's probes.

54
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,771
He sends these things
out into the universe.

55
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,506
It's how he determines if a
civilization's worthy of collection.

56
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,423
Exactly.

57
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,143
We need you to run some analysis on this.

58
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:10,845
See what we can find out.

59
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,446
Well, let's take a look.

60
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,667
Put it there.

61
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:31,365
The techno-organic
material of this device

62
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,334
is of unknown origin.

63
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:36,303
But this is only a casing
for another device.

64
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,305
- It's a shell?
- Precisely.

65
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,242
This is used to contain a Sentry.

66
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:43,077
Once the shell is opened,

67
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:45,312
the Sentry's exposed.

68
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,848
But right now...

69
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:52,153
we can extrapolate from the
interior structure of the shell

70
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:56,257
the approximate size and
shape of the Sentry.

71
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:57,691
Right, I get what it looks like.

72
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,926
But what exactly is it?

73
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,928
It's parasitic.

74
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:03,731
Once the Sentry is out of the shell,

75
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:05,866
it seeks a host.

76
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,102
It takes over the host's body.

77
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,438
It then uses that host
to gather information

78
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,406
about whatever planet it's on.

79
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:15,943
Defense systems, population,
vulnerabilities, etcetera.

80
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,012
Once it's gathered all the
information required,

81
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:20,614
it uploads it to Braniac,

82
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:24,585
and leaves the host body for dead.

83
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,887
So we need to extract this
little bastard from its shell

84
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:28,856
and then deactivate it before
it goes to work, right?

85
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,758
Easier said than done.

86
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,549
Remember,

87
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,061
once we open the probe shell,

88
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,864
the Sentry will activate

89
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,433
and do what parasites do:

90
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,068
seek out a host body.

91
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:55,749
You do realize I'm a hologram, don't you?

92
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,751
Do it, Grandpa.

93
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,738
Shit.

94
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:19,607
It's not in there, is it?

95
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:20,975
I'm afraid not.

96
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:25,212
It appears the Sentry has
already been released.

97
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:32,175
3 DAYS EARLIER

98
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,066
Oh, Mighty Rao, before your grace,

99
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,702
we wandered lost in the darkness.

100
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:24,872
Until you appeared and
led us into the light.

101
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,241
Beautifully said, Ona.

102
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,977
Thanks, uncle Kem.

103
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:32,046
My pleasure.

104
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:34,815
You'd better hurry up and eat
that before it eats you.

105
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:39,920
- Do you want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

106
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,156
What? Well.

107
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,592
That is unfortunate, because
it would be a shame

108
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,661
for this to go to waste.

109
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,030
Rhom, don't worry, okay?

110
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,832
I know things are tough for everybody,

111
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:55,903
but there will always be a
meal here for you and Ona.

112
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,705
I'll pay you back soon.

113
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,373
I...

114
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,709
I'm starting a glamorous new job tonight.

115
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,694
Rhom, isn't it?

116
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,663
You having trouble with the scanner?

117
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,131
Yeah, a little.

118
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:33,107
Thank you.

119
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:34,908
No problem.

120
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,878
Your first time working salvage?

121
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:38,912
Yeah.

122
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,648
Got any advice?

123
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:45,419
Just remember, it's up to you
to report what you find.

124
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,988
Some things are worth
more on the black market

125
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,758
than in the hands of the guilds.

126
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:51,651
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

127
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,288
Okay.

128
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,656
Let's think this through.

129
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,358
If the Sentry isn't here,

130
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,126
it means it's found its host, right?

131
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,527
I believe so.

132
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,197
And whoever that host is,

133
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,699
I'm afraid they're in mortal danger now.

134
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,068
You said the Sentry's a parasite.

135
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,404
Maybe it takes time to infect its host.

136
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,040
Maybe we can find the
person before that happens.

137
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,875
- Deactivate it.
- Perhaps.

138
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,978
But honestly, Seg, I...
I just don't know.

139
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,614
My research was interrupted too soon.

140
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,049
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,852
Okay, well, we at least
have to try, right?

142
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,387
Let's go back to the beginning.

143
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,021
Okay, we found this
thing in the Outlands.

144
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,389
So, who else goes out there?

145
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,924
Salvage crews.

146
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,560
So, let's say that some
poor chump found the shell

147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,229
and somehow got a hold of the Sentry.

148
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:36,764
What happens then?

149
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:40,100
Well, if he reports it,
it goes up to the guild.

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,770
And if he doesn't?

151
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,904
Might try and sell it.

152
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,473
Keep it for himself.

153
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,346
Look, if we're gonna find this thing
before it completely takes over its host,

154
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,710
then we gotta start working fast.

155
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:51,745
You find Kem.

156
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,580
Head over to the Labor Index.

157
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,682
Find out if anyone in those
salvage crews saw anything.

158
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,352
I'm gonna head up the Guilds, find Lyta.

159
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,587
See if anyone turned it in.

160
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,489
Sounds good to me.

161
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,391
Let's go.

162
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,460
Seg, wait up.

163
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,728
I can't. I'm in a hurry.

164
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:09,263
Well, I'm sure I can keep up.

165
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,265
Nice to see you walking
amongst the Guilded.

166
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,967
Didn't even have to send a
Sagitari to retrieve you.

167
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,470
Some would call that progress.

168
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,838
One of these days, we'll work
up to a family dinner.

169
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,440
I'd like that.

170
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,209
I really need to teach
you how to lie, Seg.

171
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,611
I'm better with the truth.

172
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,214
It means a lot what you
did for me, Nyssa.

173
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:30,050
Allowing me the chance to give
my parents an honorable burial.

174
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,091
Urgent military business?

175
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,260
I just need to get my security
clearance reinstated.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,562
Better.

177
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:44,064
That was almost believable.

178
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,336
Have your secrets, Seg.

179
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:52,506
I most certainly have mine.

180
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,741
Be sure to give my
congratulations to Lyta

181
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,710
on her new promotion.

182
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,517
You could have been killed.

183
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,652
I know, but I wasn't.

184
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,820
I don't get it.

185
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,955
Was this to earn your mother's respect,

186
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:10,157
to... to somehow prove that you belong?

187
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,625
- No.
- Then why?

188
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,794
Why would you risk your life like that?

189
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,095
I don't have time for this.

190
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,190
And you shouldn't even be here.

191
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,765
Lyta.

192
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,667
You killed someone.

193
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:25,138
I challenged Quex to change things.

194
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,808
To change the way the
Sagitari treat the Rankless.

195
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,779
Then I guess I should be thanking you.

196
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:36,650
I appreciate you checking in on me.

197
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:39,486
If I'm being honest,

198
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,145
it's not the only reason I'm here.

199
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,890
I need your help tracking
down any reports

200
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,477
of anything unusual

201
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,395
or suspicious being
turned in to the Guild.

202
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,464
There's something we need to find.

203
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,569
What is it?

204
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:58,305
I found it in the Outlands.

205
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,342
Never seen anything like it before.

206
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,144
Give you 200 solars.

207
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:05,946
200? No.

208
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:08,382
It must be worth more than that.

209
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:10,183
Not to me.

210
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,059
Oh, fine.

211
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,176
Deal.

212
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,032
Pleasure doing business.

213
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,366
Let's go.

214
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:41,346
Black Zero has already made
one attempt on my life.

215
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:46,147
Can you assure me this Rankless
Initiative will mean it's the last?

216
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,251
When the sun rises tomorrow,

217
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,520
Black Zero and their sympathizers

218
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,622
shall be brought to justice.

219
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:53,923
I hope so,

220
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,163
because if this initiative fails

221
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:58,168
and they are not made to suffer

222
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,011
the consequences of their actions,

223
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:03,599
then perhaps you should be.

224
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,703
Keep me apprised of the progress.

225
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,406
Of course, Your Eminence.

226
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:22,351
The Sagitari will be comforted to know

227
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,254
the Voice has taken such
interest in the operation.

228
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:28,024
I do not care for their comfort.

229
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:29,759
Only that they succeed.

230
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,372
Black Zero's leadership hierarchy.

231
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,975
We still don't have any
substantiated images

232
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,411
of Jax-Ur, but you should all be familiar

233
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,746
with most of these other faces by now.

234
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:51,948
Not this one.

235
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:54,250
- Who's he?
- Unknown.

236
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,719
Intelligence suggests he's
a relatively new player.

237
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,822
Seems to be rising up through
the ranks very quickly.

238
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,924
We've detected a high concentration

239
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:05,027
of Black Zero activity which
suggests they have a stronghold

240
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,096
somewhere in this area.

241
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,965
Sector 19.

242
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,740
The council have authorized us
to seal off the entire area,

243
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,144
to go street by street and
root out their operatives.

244
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:24,747
Their leaders are our primary targets.

245
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,315
Brief your squads.

246
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:29,118
We are a go at 4300 hours.

247
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,734
There are thousands of innocent
citizens in this sector.

248
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,798
If they give refuge to enemies of Kandor,

249
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,526
how innocent can they be?

250
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:41,179
They know more about the area
than our satellites ever will.

251
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,699
If we take our time to
get to know these people

252
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,135
rather than uprooting
them from their homes,

253
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:49,364
they will be more willing to give
us information about Black Zero.

254
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:52,693
If the Rankless choose not to
divulge what they know about these...

255
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:53,709
terrorists,

256
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,345
then they will pay a
price for their silence.

257
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,948
Now, if there are no more questions....

258
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,133
Nothing unusual reported to the Guilds.

259
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,035
Any luck with the salvagers?

260
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,637
Do you know how hard it is to
ask someone if they've found

261
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,706
any alien technology without
actually asking them,

262
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,509
"Hey, have you found
any alien technology?"

263
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,711
I'm sure you found a way.

264
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,979
They're the only ones out there.

265
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,314
They had to have seen something.

266
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,149
Sure... rusted-out skimmers,

267
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,217
a half-eaten ice wraith,

268
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:38,020
the carcass of the much
bigger, much scarier thing

269
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,576
that ate the ice wraith.

270
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,657
But listen, don't worry.
I'm sure that our friend

271
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,061
from a distant galaxy has
got it all figured out.

272
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,530
Kem.

273
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,665
Lyta.

274
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,030
You just couldn't keep your mouth shut.

275
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:55,538
I killed a man for the right to open it.

276
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:56,706
I deserve to be heard.

277
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,075
You know what I mean.

278
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,744
We both know who lives in Sector 19.

279
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,413
Seg's not Black Zero, and
neither were his parents.

280
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:07,450
Their actions at the
Tribunal suggest otherwise.

281
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,852
And I'm sure they had
friends who were Black Zero

282
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,855
who are still among the Rankless.

283
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:18,033
Any forewarning puts every
Sagitari in danger.

284
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,797
Your squad needs to know
they can trust you.

285
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,536
Remember,

286
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,471
the higher you rise,

287
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:28,637
the more eyes are eager
to watch you fall.

288
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,363
This is your locker now.

289
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,905
Dev, I know how much
you cared about Quex.

290
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,903
I care about you, too.

291
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,673
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:07,910
Look, you did what you had to do.

293
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,645
I keep telling myself that.

294
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:16,367
It's natural to have doubts, Lyta.

295
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,654
About what you've done,
what you're about to do.

296
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:21,457
But if you let your squad see them,

297
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,826
they'll begin to have doubts about you.

298
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:27,997
If we go through with this,

299
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,866
I believe we will create more
terrorists than we'll stop.

300
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,369
What do you mean, "if"
we go through with it?

301
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,262
We have our orders.

302
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,109
But we can't...

303
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,342
We don't choose which orders we follow.

304
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,978
I shouldn't have to
tell a Commander that.

305
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,065
- All right.
- Hey... I'm...

306
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,001
I'm looking for something...

307
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,871
a little unusual.

308
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,172
Just...

309
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,540
H'Rakan egg sac.

310
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,375
Very unusual.

311
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,111
And delicious.

312
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,346
No, I think maybe something
a little less unusual.

313
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:21,317
Maybe something... more shiny.

314
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:25,688
I recently acquired a
Daxamite hunting blade.

315
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:28,057
No.

316
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,493
What about...

317
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,894
Mithenite gemstones?

318
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:35,764
No, I'm looking for something...

319
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:44,573
Maybe... that. Right there, yeah.

320
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,015
Yeah, how much?

321
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,450
One of the few remaining relics

322
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,960
of the legendary Tenth City?

323
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:59,288
Listen, from one bullshitter to another,

324
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,456
we both know that's not true.

325
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,458
20,000 solars.

326
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,960
Come on, man.

327
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,396
Look, the guy over there
sells them for half that.

328
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:10,321
I didn't wanna say it, but...

329
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,434
he says yours are fake.

330
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,277
Attention!

331
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:28,083
Listen up, because I'm only
going to say this once.

332
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:31,186
The Rankless are not our enemy.

333
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:34,390
This Initiative is about
targeting Black Zero

334
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,159
and Black Zero only.

335
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,463
They have killed citizens
of Kandor, the Guilded,

336
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,133
and Rankless alike.

337
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:48,771
It is our job to stop
them from killing more.

338
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:54,243
And it will be done
with honor and respect.

339
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,613
And without a single shot fired

340
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:00,616
on innocent people.

341
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,085
Mark my words.

342
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:07,975
There will be no cracking of
heads or thinning the herd.

343
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:11,923
Nobody fires unless I give the order.

344
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:12,494
Understood?

345
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,930
Yes, Commander.

346
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:24,640
The ability to divorce
oneself from emotion

347
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,627
is what separates a successful
mission from failure.

348
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,980
And we do not fail.

349
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:35,517
May Rao's grace be your shield.

350
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:39,588
And light the way to victory.

351
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,412
What are you doing?

352
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:54,470
Did you... did he just shush me?

353
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,638
In your own tavern.

354
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,740
Did anyone follow me in here?

355
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,744
I don't see anyone, no. Why?

356
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:02,811
What did you do?

357
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,050
What superheroes do.

358
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:16,191
Is this what I think it is?

359
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,994
Well, it ain't a hot dog.

360
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,564
Yes, it's the Sentry.

361
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,867
And it looks to me like
it hasn't activated yet.

362
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,436
Fist bump.

363
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,838
No? Is that a thing here?

364
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,142
Look, will you just get
out from behind my bar?

365
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:34,376
And you're paying for
that drink, by the way.

366
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,378
Hey, focus. Fate of the world.

367
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:37,513
Let's get this thing back to the Fortress

368
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,282
and make sure it never finds a host.

369
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:43,452
I don't understand you!

370
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:45,567
And you owe me for that drink!

371
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:46,955
Idiot.

372
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:50,669
So, we get Val to make absolutely certain
that it hasn't been activated.

373
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,369
Then, all we have to do

374
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,364
is figure out how to destroy that thing.

375
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,099
Well, maybe there's a way
to reverse engineer it.

376
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,935
We can figure out how
far away Braniac is.

377
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:02,137
- You can do that?
- Maybe.

378
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,704
With Val's help.

379
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,977
Attention, Rankless citizens.

380
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:11,347
This quadrant is being evacuated.

381
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:14,283
Sector 19 residents are hereby evicted.

382
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,786
Prepare to be scanned and processed.

383
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,861
Attention, Rankless citizens.

384
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,863
This quadrant is being evacuated.

385
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,133
Sector 19 residents are hereby evicted.

386
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:34,136
Prepare to be scanned and processed.

387
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:39,641
On the ground!

388
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,276
Sect off the perimeter.

389
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,545
Attention, Rankless citizens...

390
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,115
Hurry it up.

391
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,453
Prepare to be scanned and processed.

392
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:59,303
Attention, Rankless citizens...

393
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,991
This quadrant is being evacuated.

394
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:04,633
Sector 19 residents are hereby evicted.

395
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,803
Prepare to be scanned and processed.

396
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,673
Back up!

397
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,677
Attention, Rankless citizens.

398
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:18,323
This quadrant is being evacuated.

399
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:21,283
Sector 19 residents are hereby evicted.

400
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,053
You, over here!

401
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,866
All adults older than 15 cycles...

402
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,224
- Come here right now.
- Stop!

403
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,860
Another one.

404
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,080
Turn your face toward the scanner.

405
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,468
No sudden movements!

406
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:47,437
All Rankless citizens will
evacuate their homes.

407
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:49,806
This one's fine. Move to sector three.

408
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,688
Hey, let's get out of here. Let's go.

409
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,590
Listen to me. Take this.

410
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,526
We can't risk it falling into
Sagitari hands, all right?

411
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,995
Get it back to the Fortress
and start working with Val.

412
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:59,096
How am I supposed to do that?

413
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,063
Look around you, Seg.

414
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,999
I don't know. Find a way.

415
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,233
No, hey, hey!

416
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,301
Where do you think you're going?

417
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,435
To talk to Lyta.

418
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:06,442
Adam.

419
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:06,964
Go!

420
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,907
Please remain calm!

421
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:12,109
I want squads three and
eight to secure this area.

422
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,912
Once that's done, move onto the next one.

423
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,980
Is this your idea of changing things?

424
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:22,286
I am trying, but we cannot
ignore the intelligence

425
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,988
that Black Zero's operated
out of this area.

426
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:27,124
Do they look like Black Zero to you?!

427
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:29,493
This was going to happen
with or without me.

428
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:33,430
I am doing my best to make
it as safe as possible.

429
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,999
How long have you known about this?

430
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:37,701
You chose not to tell me.

431
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:38,936
You didn't trust me.

432
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:40,337
I can't talk to you right now.

433
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,906
Get out of here, Seg.

434
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,841
Go.

435
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:47,444
Report to the southern checkpoint.

436
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:57,354
Come on, I'm dying here, man.

437
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:59,756
How long does it take to figure
out if it infected anyone?

438
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,391
Well, if you believe there's
a more efficient method,

439
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,427
you're welcome to try.

440
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,996
No, all good here.

441
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,098
But when you're done there,
I got something else

442
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,866
for you to look at.

443
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:12,002
It's called a Zeta-Beam Device.

444
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,138
I know, came up with it myself.

445
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,642
Anyway, it's kind of the
horse I rode in on.

446
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,043
Only she won't giddy up anymore,

447
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:21,712
and she's my return trip home.

448
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,213
So, I'd kinda like to get...

449
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,516
That's not good, is it?

450
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,520
Who else has the Sentry
been in contact with?

451
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:37,027
Kem? Kem, are you here?

452
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,695
Seg, we kinda got a big problem here.

453
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:40,230
What is it?

454
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,232
I'll let Val explain.

455
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,170
An analysis in the Sentry
shows it to be inactive.

456
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,239
Great, why is that a problem?

457
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,242
Because it means the Sentry's
already found a host.

458
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:58,749
- Let's go.
- Hey... pig.

459
00:24:58,849 --> 00:24:59,916
Rhom?

460
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,019
Rhom, Ona?

461
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,720
Why are they doing this?

462
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,422
I don't know, but just
come with me, all right?

463
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,258
- Everything hurts.
- Yeah, everything will be fine.

464
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:09,593
Just trust me.

465
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:13,030
Mama...

466
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,066
Did the Sagitari hurt her?

467
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,035
No, she's been sick all day.

468
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:27,819
What?

469
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,614
Mama, are you okay?

470
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,716
We're scanning this area. Get out.

471
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,818
No, she needs a doctor.
She needs a doctor.

472
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:35,819
Children to the southeastern sector.

473
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,201
She needs a doctor!

474
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,623
Ona. No, don't touch her!

475
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:40,424
Please, don't hurt her!

476
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,260
- Ona!
- I want my mom!

477
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,895
Where are you taking me?!

478
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:46,129
Get to the checkpoint.

479
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:47,564
Move, now.

480
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:50,300
Okay.

481
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,352
Up, Rankless.

482
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,104
We're evacuating this entire area.

483
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,872
We need you out.

484
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:01,193
Hey!

485
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,479
Hey!

486
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,461
We need to go.

487
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,144
We need to go, come on.

488
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,385
Ona, come on. Let's go, let's go.

489
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,148
Hey, hey, hey...

490
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:25,525
Don't do this!

491
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,557
Over here, Rankless.

492
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:27,124
Over here.

493
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,254
What are you doing?

494
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,454
Leave us alone!

495
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:30,655
Let me go!

496
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,251
In here. In here.

497
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,602
Seg's on his way.

498
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:41,778
We'll figure this out.

499
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,014
You're safe in here, okay? Don't worry.

500
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:44,515
I don't understand.

501
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:45,583
What's happening?

502
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:46,917
Why did my mom do that?

503
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:55,293
Are you guys all right?

504
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,009
Yeah, we're fine.

505
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,904
But Rhom.

506
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:01,231
She hurt those men.

507
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:03,801
I think... I think she...

508
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,337
It's not her fault. It's not her fault.

509
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:07,738
She's sick.

510
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,874
Whatever she did, whatever happened,

511
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:11,542
it's because of the sickness.

512
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:13,010
Understand?

513
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,512
It's not her fault.

514
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,113
It's not her.

515
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:20,117
You can help her though, right?

516
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,959
Why don't you tuck into these,

517
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,897
and we're gonna figure it out, okay?

518
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:34,732
Please help her.

519
00:27:34,832 --> 00:27:36,734
We're gonna do everything we can.

520
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:48,979
I thought we'd found the Sentry in time.

521
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,414
What happened?

522
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:52,316
We were too late.

523
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,419
It was dormant because it
had already found its host.

524
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,154
In Rhom.

525
00:27:57,254 --> 00:27:58,456
I knew she was doing it tough,

526
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:01,625
but I... I had no idea that
she was working salvage

527
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:03,861
in the Outlands.

528
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:06,063
I just don't understand
why she didn't tell us.

529
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,898
We could have helped.

530
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,101
She was probably too embarrassed.

531
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:17,575
Do you...

532
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:20,411
do you think we can save her?

533
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:22,446
I dunno.

534
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:26,250
But if there's a way, I'm gonna find it.

535
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,085
Did you see which way she went?

536
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:29,720
Towards the market, I think.

537
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,356
I don't know. It all happened so quickly.

538
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:33,357
Okay.

539
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:36,026
Hey, hey.

540
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:37,461
Be careful.

541
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:41,465
Seg, you... you haven't
seen what she can do.

542
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:43,401
Just take care of the kid.

543
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:52,643
All squads, lock down your sectors

544
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,044
and form your lines.

545
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,546
All squads, lock down your sectors

546
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:59,149
and form your lines. Now.

547
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:03,087
Do you think we're going
to let this go unpunished?

548
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:08,426
You think we can't make you talk?

549
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:13,130
You think you can protect
the bastards that did this?

550
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:28,112
Tell us where Black Zero's hiding.

551
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:30,114
I don't know.

552
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,082
I didn't see anything.

553
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:37,621
How about now?

554
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:38,756
This jog your memory?

555
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,991
I can't breathe.

556
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,194
If you can talk, you can breathe.

557
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:44,695
Got no right to be here.
You've got no right!

558
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:46,330
He's not Black Zero.

559
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,865
Now tell me where Black Zero is.

560
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:49,700
Let him go!

561
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,969
Shut your mouth, Rankless!

562
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:53,037
Let him go!

563
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,618
Back off!

564
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,522
You murderer!

565
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:17,761
Quadrants one, two, and
three have been swept,

566
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,940
cleared, and secured.

567
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:20,931
And?

568
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:23,667
And we've yet to locate the
Black Zero stronghold,

569
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,903
but there's only one
quadrant left to lock down.

570
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:28,138
Why the delay?

571
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:31,675
There's been a situation
with the Rankless.

572
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:36,680
Move! Back up!

573
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,648
Killers!

574
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,316
Step back!

575
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,755
Weapons down!

576
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:47,091
Weapons down, now!

577
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:48,993
That is an order!

578
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:53,797
What happened here?

579
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:54,798
She killed an innocent man!

580
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:55,833
She murdered him.

581
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,368
It was self defense.

582
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,536
I had no choice.

583
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:01,750
So you, a Sagitari,

584
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,376
felt threatened

585
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:05,209
by an unarmed man in shackles?

586
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:07,845
He was coming to the aid of
a Black Zero sympathizer.

587
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,413
- That's not possible.
- That's a lie.

588
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:10,714
She's lying.

589
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:11,849
Probably one himself.

590
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:13,117
Probably?

591
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:15,052
So you admit you weren't sure?

592
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:18,889
Kol-Da.

593
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,358
You are under arrest
for the unlawful death

594
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,893
of a Rankless citizen.

595
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:26,130
For defending myself against a terrorist?

596
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,332
You will get your chance
to plead your innocence

597
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:30,200
before the Tribunal.

598
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,237
A chance you denied this man.

599
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:36,974
- Justice!
- Calm down.

600
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:40,578
And unless you would
all like to join her,

601
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:43,147
I suggest you disperse and proceed

602
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:46,116
to the nearest checkpoint now!

603
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:53,824
I can't find any sign of Rhom.

604
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,626
Do you have any idea where
she would have been headed?

605
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:59,119
Wherever will allow it to upload
information on Kandor to Braniac.

606
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:02,833
Might try a communications center.

607
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,969
Listen, you have to destroy
that thing before...

608
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:07,171
It's not a thing or an
it we're dealing with.

609
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:09,840
Rhom's my friend.

610
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,442
Not anymore.

611
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,410
She's been taken over by
Braniac's technology.

612
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,945
What if we can find a way to disable it?

613
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:16,412
Even if we could,

614
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:19,916
how would you get close enough
and not end up like those soldiers?

615
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,152
I know you wanna save your friend, Seg.

616
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:24,688
But there's a lot more lives at stake.

617
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:25,990
You heard what Val said.

618
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:35,699
Braniac's Sentry has one
goal and one goal only.

619
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,701
To gather all the
information Braniac needs

620
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,970
to lay this planet to waste.

621
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,774
I want you to think about that.

622
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,976
Anyone that you have ever known or loved.

623
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:50,311
Whoever she once was to you is gone.

624
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:52,182
She's Braniac's agent now.

625
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,755
I can't sneak away for long, Seg.

626
00:33:01,756 --> 00:33:03,105
What is it?

627
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,092
You owe me.

628
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,231
I need an electrostatic
discharge grenade.

629
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,650
But it only works on electronics, right?

630
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:08,428
It's not gonna kill anyone?

631
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,966
Well, what do you want it for?

632
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,269
What's really going on?

633
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,038
Three of my squad are dead,

634
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:18,973
and now there are reports of
a communications hub breach,

635
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,742
and you come asking for an ESD,

636
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,600
and I'm not supposed to
think that's connected?

637
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,680
If you are covering for Black Zero...

638
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:26,281
Not Black Zero.

639
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,782
Then who is it?

640
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,051
Some pissed off Rankless out for revenge?

641
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:32,754
It's a friend!

642
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:34,489
It's a friend.

643
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:36,291
Okay? And she's not herself.

644
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,893
But I can stop her. That's
why I need the ESD.

645
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,997
You are asking me to hand
over military ordinance.

646
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:45,099
I'm gonna need a little more than that.

647
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,668
If I thought there was any
other way to do this,

648
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:47,802
I wouldn't be here.

649
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,405
But I have nowhere else to go.

650
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:52,640
I am asking you, Lyta,

651
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,309
to trust me this time.

652
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,611
I have dead Sagitari.

653
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:57,929
And you're gonna have a lot more

654
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,915
if you send them inside
that communications hub.

655
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:03,918
Do you trust me?

656
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,025
Yes.

657
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,538
Be careful.

658
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:26,949
Commander Zod, we have
possible Black Zero activity

659
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,176
in the communications hub.

660
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,311
Why is your squad holding their position?

661
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:33,014
We're still assessing the
nature of the threat, Primus.

662
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,849
It's not your job to assess, Commander.

663
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,850
It's to neutralize.

664
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,118
I understand that.

665
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:40,388
Then order your squad to move in at once.

666
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:44,025
Negative, Primus.

667
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,361
Not until I can ensure
the safety of my troops.

668
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:51,032
Lyta, you are disobeying a direct order.

669
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,641
I hope you know what you're doing, Seg.

670
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,590
Rhom?

671
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,904
Rhom, it's me, Seg.

672
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,775
I can help you.

673
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,777
There is no Rhom.

674
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,721
Rhom has been collected.

675
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:49,691
Krypton is worthy of collection.

676
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:55,063
You will be collected.

677
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,266
I am transcendent.

678
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,536
Free of the material
universe and the limitations

679
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,938
of physical existence.

680
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:07,408
Rhom... it's me.

681
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,911
I'm your friend.

682
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:12,213
I know you're in there somewhere.

683
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:14,882
There is nothing to fight.

684
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,718
This is a gift.

685
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,753
My faculties of cognition are beyond

686
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:21,422
any living being's comprehension.

687
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:25,827
Fight it, Rhom.

688
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:27,762
Fight for your daughter.

689
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,133
Fight for Ona.

690
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:43,611
Ona loves you.

691
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,449
And there isn't anything
you wouldn't do for her.

692
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,319
I need you to come back for her.

693
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,789
Fight this, Rhom.

694
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,525
I need you to help me.

695
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,143
Primus, we're breaching the hub.

696
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,017
Clear left.

697
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:35,254
Clear right.

698
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:38,057
Commander Em, situation report.

699
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:39,937
Primus, it looks like they tried to hack

700
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:41,927
into the electro-communications grid.

701
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:45,965
No Black Zero operatives in sight.

702
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:48,868
But no sign of any Black Zero operatives.

703
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,829
What happened to her?

704
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,964
Is she still alive?

705
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,267
Barely.

706
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,935
Seg, what's going on?

707
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:28,741
My grandfather was right.

708
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:30,976
We're not alone in the universe.

709
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,913
There's something out there.

710
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:35,567
It found her,

711
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,244
and it's coming for us.

712
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,688
It's okay.

713
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:46,191
He's... an acquaintance.

714
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,003
The skimmer's close, but we should
hustle before these lights turn back on.

715
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,735
Seg, if what you're saying is true,

716
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,338
then the Council need to see her.

717
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,706
We can make them believe.

718
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,041
I can't.

719
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,945
I have to save her.

720
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,448
Lyta,

721
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,861
thank you for trusting me.

722
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,715
Yes.

723
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:45,484
The only arrest made in
the Rankless Initiative.

724
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,486
One of our own Sagitari.

725
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,124
Father?

726
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,560
What are you going to
tell the Voice of Rao?

727
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:59,354
The only thing I can.

728
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,313
The truth.

729
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,935
Are you sure the truth is
the best option right now?

730
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:05,170
What's the alternative?

731
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,406
Black Zero continue to exist unabated,

732
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:08,641
and now...

733
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,844
The mission is a failure.

734
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:39,138
Is she going to live?

735
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:41,440
It's difficult to say.

736
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,009
Whatever Braniac did,

737
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,879
it appears to be keeping her alive.

738
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,088
My concern is that,

739
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,215
in trying to reverse it,

740
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,385
we risk losing her.

741
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,154
Well, at least you stopped her
before she got to a transmitter

742
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:58,157
and uploaded whatever info she accessed.

743
00:40:58,257 --> 00:41:00,830
I don't believe that was her intention.

744
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:02,968
What do you mean?

745
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,803
I believe she is the transmitter.

746
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:08,867
We gotta stop her before she
sends a signal to Brainiac.

747
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,569
It's too late.

748
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,072
It's already been sent.

749
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,339
Krypton,

750
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,727
your world is at an end.

751
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:40,914

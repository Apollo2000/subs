1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,872
If you didn't know

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:03,265
Brainiac corrupted
the Voice of Rao,

3
00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:05,049
then why even attempt a coup?

4
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:07,225
Because Daron-Vex
offered to spare your life

5
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,314
in exchange for my help.

6
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:11,229
- Stop.
- My new guardians.

7
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:14,319
The Red Shard, loyal only to me.

8
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:15,973
Let me serve you.

9
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,410
Let's put your
newfound loyalty to the test.

10
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,325
I didn't really think
you would do it.

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,284
The Oracle foresees
the product of your union.

12
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,633
The child will be male.

13
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,156
When I visited you in your cell

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,810
you said you loved me.
Do you really mean it?

15
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,812
I feared I was
the only one to escape.

16
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,161
You were. I serve a being

17
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,076
who has power over death.

18
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,512
The Voice is controlling you!

19
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:34,644
You will die here.

20
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,169
We got to stop her
before she sends

21
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,041
the signal to Brainiac.
It's too late.

22
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,868
She's been taken over
by Brainiac's technology.

23
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,306
My mama's not coming home,
is she?

24
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:45,872
I'm going to look after you.

25
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,179
She will be given rank
and serve as a novice.

26
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:49,528
Sevi, what's wrong?

27
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,661
This creature is deceiving you!

28
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,184
Remove her!

29
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:55,708
I will lead you
to a place of eternal life.

30
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:57,884
This son of a bitch
is Superman's greatest enemy.

31
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:00,496
History tells us Brainiac
takes Kandor City,

32
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,541
causing the planet to explode
in 200 years.

33
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,543
This whole time you knew
and you said nothing!

34
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:06,545
Seg, you cannot trust this man!

35
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,895
Find your Zeta-Beam gadget
and never come back!

36
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,375
There's something here
I still need to do.

37
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:11,855
And what's that?

38
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:13,552
Kill General Zod and prevent Seg

39
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,076
from saving Kandor.

40
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,393
My name is Adam Strange,
and I've come here to warn you.

41
00:01:28,437 --> 00:01:30,917
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton

42
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,354
because where I'm from,
your grandson

43
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,312
becomes the greatest hero
in the universe.

44
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:38,316
I'm running out of time.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,317
Take this.

46
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:46,237
You have to save Superman.

47
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:48,587
Where did...

48
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:55,638
Oh, you assholes.

49
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,162
Oh, you tightwad assholes.

50
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,295
Assholes, seriously?

51
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:03,080
You steal our technology,
disappear with it for years,

52
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,256
and we're the assholes?

53
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,084
First of all...

54
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,479
It's called
a Zeta-Beam device now.

55
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,655
Came up with that myself.
No, you didn't.

56
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,178
You're welcome.

57
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:17,181
And secondly...

58
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,791
I didn't steal it.

59
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:20,619
I borrowed it.

60
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:22,317
That device has the potential

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,580
to tear apart
the fabric of space and time,

62
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:28,801
destroying everything
that ever was and will be.

63
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:31,152
I was gonna bring it right back.

64
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,023
But that's the thing
with time travel;

65
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,330
It's difficult to keep
track of time.

66
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,027
That's your explanation?

67
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,507
The long and short of it is,

68
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,857
on account of being a superhero,

69
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,598
I caught wind
of this shithead alien

70
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,034
trying to change history

71
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,167
and stop Superman
from being born.

72
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,995
- Superman?
- Yeah, him.

73
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,476
You know, and I was in the
middle of warning his pop-pops

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,826
when you jackasses
yanked me here.

75
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,786
So if we're done here,

76
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,527
I'd like to get back to work.

77
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,006
Cool?

78
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:03,706
If what you say is true,
somebody better qualified

79
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:04,881
will take care of the matter.

80
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,665
Really?

81
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,667
'Cause I didn't happen
upon anyone else,

82
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,017
qualified or not,

83
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,628
traveling through space and time

84
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,065
to save the freaking universe.

85
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:18,547
So you like it or not, Sardath,
I'm the best hope there is.

86
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:22,115
I was meant to have
that Zeta-Beam device.

87
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,729
I was meant to be a hero.

88
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:29,775
I was meant to save Superman.

89
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,083
And I will not let anyone

90
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,216
stand in the way of my destiny.

91
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,704
Shh, shh!

92
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:47,706
What are you doing?
You scared the life out of me.

93
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,273
I'm sorry, okay?

94
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,753
Why are you still here?

95
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,841
You know why I'm here.
I have to preserve

96
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,538
the timeline Superman...

97
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,323
Please stop, stop, all right,
I'm not interested

98
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,020
in hearing all about that again.

99
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,892
Whatever you think
your mission was, it is over.

100
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,547
If you only knew him...

101
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,247
Seg's grandson,
th... there's no one like him

102
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,944
in the universe.

103
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,859
He could have been a god.

104
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:12,949
And he chose humanity.

105
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,299
Guy's the best of our worlds.

106
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,128
You've said that speech before,

107
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:19,390
haven't you?

108
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,262
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:22,785
Hey, what do you think...

110
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,222
Listen, Adam.
Even you have to understand

111
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,356
that Seg is not going
to sacrifice his world

112
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,532
any more than Superman
would sacrifice yours.

113
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,317
I know. Relax.

114
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,971
I'm not after Seg.

115
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,582
Zod?

116
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,410
Have you met Zod?

117
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:41,717
He doesn't strike me
as the kind of person

118
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,979
that scares easily.

119
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:44,328
Well, that's good...

120
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,112
'cause I'm not planning
on scaring him.

121
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,376
Yeah, well, I got that, yeah.
That was my polite way

122
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,160
of saying that if you go near
the gigantic man,

123
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,422
he's gonna kill you to death.

124
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,771
I'm not gonna talk to you

125
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:53,990
if you're just gonna be
negative.

126
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,644
You promise?

127
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,733
Fine.

128
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,170
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

129
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,911
Wait.

130
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:04,174
All right, I'll do you a deal.

131
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,089
Okay, if you can control
your killer instinct,

132
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:09,310
I will get Seg to come
and meet with you, all right?

133
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,268
I can't promise that he's
gonna change his mind,

134
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,401
but I'm pretty sure
I can convince him

135
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,750
to at least hear you out.

136
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,317
How soon can you get him here?

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,189
How soon do
a wrangled beast's testicles

138
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,322
go up into its cervix
when she's...

139
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,540
- Kem.
- Oh right, I'm going.

140
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,938
We're running low on supplies.

141
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,376
We're going to
have to make them stretch.

142
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:37,425
Kem says the streets are
still crawling with Sagitari.

143
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:46,651
We may have to lie low
for a while longer.

144
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,153
Hello?

145
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,158
Hello?

146
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,558
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

147
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:27,475
Sevi? Isn't it?

148
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,782
It's me, Kem, remember?

149
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,742
I was the one who was
looking after Ona.

150
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,570
Yes, I remember.

151
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:37,876
Where is she?

152
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,139
I know about the Voice.

153
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:44,056
I know that he is not
the person he says he is,

154
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,626
but I need to know
that Ona is safe.

155
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,977
She's safe. He likes her.

156
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:55,328
Well, then, what is going on?
Why are you here?

157
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:02,423
Anda and I found out
about the Voice's change.

158
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:05,730
He tried to make us believe
he'd been reborn.

159
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,471
But then I saw
what was happening

160
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,038
in the Genesis Chamber.

161
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:16,480
And now every night
he plugs himself into it.

162
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,830
When he does...

163
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,659
It's like he's in
some kind of deep trance.

164
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:28,666
I think... I think
he's sucking its energy dry,

165
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,190
using the embryos as batteries,

166
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,976
getting stronger by
draining the life from them.

167

168
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:53,996
What could Brainiac
possibly want

169
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,824
with the Genesis Chamber?

170
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:56,912
Everything.

171
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:02,395
At our essence,
we are all just pure energy.

172
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,485
All those cells, all those atoms

173
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,225
that make up our body...

174
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:07,705
When you break it all down,

175
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,794
it's just electricity.

176
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,709
And Brainiac's Sentry
has now tapped into

177
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:13,885
the greatest source
of electricity in Kandor,

178
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,408
the Genesis Chamber.

179
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:18,237
But they're not batteries,
they're embryos.

180
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,457
What happens to them?

181
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,897
What happens to our child?

182
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:28,987
He'll be lost.

183
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,424
Along with the rest
of our civilization.

184
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,558
The only way our species
reproduces now

185
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,995
is via the Genesis Chamber.

186
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,563
Without it...

187
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,043
we have no future.

188
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,317
Your Eminence.

189
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:00,279
You look...
Physical appearance...

190
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:03,326
is of no concern to me.

191
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,502
But, in the minds
of your people,

192
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,287
I have been reborn.

193
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,507
Indeed.

194
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,031
And you look, um...

195
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:16,687
Magnificent.

196
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,653
Look at you.

197
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:29,657
Face to face
with a true superior.

198
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,572
And you still lust for power.

199
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,231
And you shall have it.

200
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:45,020
When my work here is complete,
I shall leave Kandor.

201
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:49,677
And you will again
have the control

202
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,028
you so viciously desire.

203
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,645
Now, according to Sevi,
every time he does

204
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,995
whatever it is
that he does in the Chamber,

205
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,868
the Voice of Rao goes into
some sort of a weird trance.

206
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,478
Well, that's how we stop him.

207
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,219
When he's at
his most vulnerable.

208
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:12,482
Don't forget he still has
the Red Shard.

209
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,050
We have to get past them
to get to him.

210
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,357
True, but remember
he controls them with his mind.

211
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,837
My guess is,
while he's in that trance,

212
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,710
while he's absorbing energy,

213
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:25,582
his connection to them
would probably be limited.

214
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,323
So what are you thinking?

215
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,673
We know that Rhom
communicated with Brainiac

216
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,067
using some sort
of neural network.

217
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,243
If we can sever the connection
between the Voice of Rao

218
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:36,593
and the Red Shard
and then we take him out

219
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,421
while he's in that trance.

220
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,031
But to do that, we need
to find a way into the network.

221
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,554
I know a way in.

222
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,429
Dev.

223
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,431
We can use his connection
to the Voice.

224
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,128
His body is still
in the Outlands.

225
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:54,263
There's a lot of ifs
in that scenario.

226
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,700
We need backup as an insurance.

227
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,267
I'll recruit manpower
from Black Zero.

228
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,703
Whoa... whoa, hang on,
we didn't agree to that.

229
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:00,965
I'm not asking.

230
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:03,968
Okay.

231
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,233
We'll get Dev.

232
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:09,452
You meet us here later.

233
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,493
You stay there!

234
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,539
Move!

235
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:29,024
Even now, your honor
is incorruptible.

236
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,243
If there were any truth in that,

237
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:33,246
I wouldn't be a fugitive.

238
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,436
Why are you a fugitive, Jayna?

239
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,786
I betrayed our oath.

240
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,267
I put my daughter above honor.

241
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,182
You chose family over duty?

242
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,316
You did the right thing.

243
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,581
A Zod swears an oath
to protect Kandor,

244
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,235
but only if its leaders
are worth protecting.

245
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,759
If they are not,
then they must be replaced

246
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:10,631
by those who are.

247
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,982
Besides,
if you had chosen differently,

248
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,766
I never would have been born.

249
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,650
Ah, hey, Seg.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,045
Do you mind
if I sit this one out?

251
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,699
Yeah, what's the matter?

252
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,701
When Rhom died, I promised Ona

253
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,050
I would look after her.

254
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,965
- Go. Go.
- Thank you.

255
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,358
Do what you can for her.

256
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,318
We'll take Nyssa.

257
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,058
No, we won't.

258
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:48,799
Her father works
for the Voice of Rao.

259
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,236
What if she relays our plans?

260
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,325
I'm not having
this argument again.

261
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,543
She can be trusted.

262
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,937
She's also right here.

263
00:12:57,504 --> 00:13:00,724
You know, if I were you,
I'd want to have me close,

264
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,248
keep your eyes on me.

265
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:06,687
But if you'd rather have me
running around wild and free...

266
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,041
I'm driving.

267
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,056
Sorry.

268
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,104
Brings back memories.

269
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:35,106
Crammed in a skimmer,

270
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,284
on the way to some crazy
Artisan's Guild party.

271
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:40,416
Maybe we should go some time?

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,026
You know,
after all this is over.

273
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,419
If there even is
an Artisan's Guild

274
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:44,420
after all this is over.

275
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:45,769
- Lyta.
- What?

276
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:47,510
You've seen what
it's like out there.

277
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,729
Guilds don't matter anymore.

278
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:51,297
Neither do Bindings.

279
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,781
Anyone know how to get
a bit more, um,

280
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,305
air out of these things?

281
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,785
How did you expect
your little coup to end up?

282
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:04,092
With you and your father
shining atop a hill?

283
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,616
Bringing Kandor
into a new golden age?

284
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,270
No.

285
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,491
I expected it to be me and Seg.

286
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,931
But things never really
turn out the way you expect,

287
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,454
do they?

288
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:32,947
This is it. We're here.

289
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,177
Are you out of your mind?

290
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,179
If Jax-Ur doesn't like
what she has to say,

291
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,180
she's all yours.

292
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,815
Couldn't have asked
for better weather.

293
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,382
We're almost there.

294
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,732
Try to keep up, princess.

295
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,213
I think she means me.

296
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:23,867
Obviously.

297
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,400
Dev?

298
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,359
Dev!

299
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,111
Don't move or I'll shoot.

300
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:56,030
Dev, it's me. Don't do this.

301
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:01,557
Help me.

302
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:04,430
Dev. Dev!

303
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:05,648
Talk to me!

304
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,261
Is he still alive?

305
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,959
Yes!
But I don't know how long for.

306
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,351
Then we'd better hurry.

307
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,880
Come on, big guy.

308
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,791
What am I looking at?

309
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,663
Jax-Ur,
this is Jayna-Zod, primary...

310
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,882
I know who it is.

311
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,584
She's an even bigger fugitive
than me right now.

312
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:14,369
Isn't that right?

313
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,545
How does it feel
to spend your whole life

314
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,025
serving the state,
only to have it

315
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:20,767
chew you up and spit you out?

316
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,119
Pretty shit, actually.

317
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,864
It didn't have to be
that way, you know.

318
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,869
Kandor could have been
a bastion of equality...

319
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:40,134
no guilds, no Rankless,
a city for the people

320
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:41,701
by the people.

321
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,224
And soon it will be.

322
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,881
When we begin again at zero.

323
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,840
That's exactly why we're here...

324
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:52,929
Do not speak!

325
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,586
You think I don't know
about your recent behavior?

326
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,328
You can't just come and go
as you please.

327
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,243
Nobody passes through
Black Zero.

328
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:06,595
You are either in
or you're the enemy.

329
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:10,686
You have no idea
who the real enemy is.

330
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,306
So let me tell you
about Brainiac.

331
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,817
He's stabilized.

332
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:48,648
But I had to numb
his motor functions.

333
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,437
So when he wakes up,
he'll only be semi-conscious.

334
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,613
But that's still him, right?

335
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:59,616
Under all that.

336
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:01,966
Well, at the moment,
it's impossible to know,

337
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,490
I'm afraid.

338
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:12,977
I can't believe this place
actually exists.

339
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,894
All those years my father
spent searching for this...

340
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,984
I started to wonder
if it was even real.

341
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,947
I have a hard time
believing any of this is real.

342
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:31,082
Not so long ago, I was just
a Rankless street rat,

343
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:33,040
hustling drunk guildsmen
for money.

344
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,219
Now, I'm...

345
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,483
Trying to save the world.

346
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,834
Yeah.

347
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,578
I'm not doing
that great a job of it so far.

348
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,799
You saved my life,

349
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,193
and if this idea
of yours works...

350
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,153
You may even save the life
of our child.

351
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,726
What the hell...

352
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,555
Hey!

353
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,340
- Where's Seg?
- Yeah, not now.

354
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,560
You said that you
would bring Seg.

355
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,040
And all a man has is his word.

356
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,216
Oh, would you shut up
for once in your life!

357
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,482
What?

358
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,006
Not everything is about
your mission

359
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,054
to save some unborn, imaginary
child from the future.

360
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,099
There are real people,
in real danger

361
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,492
right now.
What are you talking about?

362
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:36,234
I'm talking about Ona,
all right?

363
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,367
She may not have
the blood of Els

364
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,414
running through her veins,
but she means the world to me

365
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,286
and I have to find her,
all right?

366
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,639
All right, let's go.

367
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:53,947
Come on!

368
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,298
But... I shouted a lot then.

369
00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:00,345
So that's what Val-El
warned us about

370
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,738
all those cycles ago.

371
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,783
Nobody believed him at the time,

372
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,395
but he was right...
I believed him.

373
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:09,049
Wish I'd listened to him more.

374
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,964
Black Zero will aid you
in your resistance,

375
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,706
but I want something in return.

376
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,622
Your old master, Daron-Vex.

377
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,798
The man who stole everything
from me and robbed this city

378
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,800
of everything
it could have been.

379
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:24,804
If you help us,
Daron-Vex is all yours.

380
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,821
Black Zero is in.

381
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,084
They'll help us
take the Genesis Chamber.

382
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,782
They want something in return.

383
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:48,045
- What?
- Daron-Vex.

384
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,004
Why him?

385
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,571
Long story for another time.

386
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,661
I assume we have a deal?

387
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,664
It's not my decision to make.

388
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,322
Do it.

389
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,019
If Black Zero
are going to help us

390
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:09,327
defeat Brainiac,
then they can have my father.

391
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,807
Good.

392
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:29,956
Through fire, we are reborn.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,871
Through fire, we are reborn.

394
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,399
Through fire, we are reborn.

395
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,620
Through fire, we are reborn.

396
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,580
Uncle Kem!

397
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,498
What's wrong?

398
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,022
I need to talk to you
about the Voice, Ona.

399
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,635
He's not who you think he is.

400
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,245
Is... this a test?

401
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,074
No. No, sweetheart,
it's not safe here.

402
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,033
Okay? You need to come with us.

403
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:08,299
It's natural to fear Rao,
but you must love him too.

404
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,867
And in loving him,
I now have back

405
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,608
what I lost with Mother.

406
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,436
Thank you, Uncle Kem.

407
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,959
Taking me to him
was the greatest thing

408
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:16,960
you could have done.

409
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,614
Psst!

410
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:20,659
We got to go, right now.

411
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:25,098
Come on, Kem!

412
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,408
Just know, Ona,
that whatever happens, okay,

413
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,714
you're always welcome back.

414
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,803
Got to go.

415
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,979
Right up ahead.

416
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,809
All right, you know where
to find me, okay?

417
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,468
You tried.
Can't do much more than that.

418
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:49,166
Yeah, well, I can rest easy
now knowing that I tried.

419
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,733
You know what,
you should just go.

420
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,430
Seg is not interested in
hearing anything

421
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,476
you've got to say and you're
not gonna get close to Zod,

422
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,999
so you might as well just go
back to where you came from

423
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,914
because you are not
helping here.

424
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,481
But you know what?

425
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:01,961
Least you tried, huh?

426
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,842
Seriously, you're not even
going to give me a chance?

427
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,367
Come on, man, I...
you got to at least

428
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:18,369
let me try.

429
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,981
This... this is Superman
we're talking about.

430
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:24,027
There's no one like him
in the universe.

431
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,682
Have you ever committed
to anything in your life?

432
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,205
I know you, Adam.

433
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:29,685
As soon as things get hard,

434
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:31,861
you'll be out of there
in a flash.

435
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,037
Please, Sardath...

436
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,953
You're right about who I was.

437
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:40,217
Now give me a chance
to be who I should be.

438
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,827
Alana?

439
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:45,657
Can he do it? I don't think so.

440
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:48,878
But I've never seen him care
about anything so much before.

441
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:52,534
Certainly not me.
I saw we let him at least try.

442
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:55,101
Yes! Thank you.

443
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,888
I promise I won't let you down.

444
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,020
It's way too late
for that, Adam.

445
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,631
Alana...

446
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,565
Who is this?

447
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:29,266
I'm your savior.

448
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,269
Take him away. Wait! Wait! Hey!

449
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:34,706
I know that you're a smart guy
full of smart plans.

450
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,361
But, buddy, you are dumber
than a box of dumb things

451
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,754
if you think
that you can outsmart

452
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,277
that creature you serve!

453
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,758
Stop!

454
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:43,802
Uncuff him.

455
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,765
And leave.

456
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,773
That's right.

457
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,297
I know exactly who you work for.

458
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,085
In fact, I know a lot more
about him than you do.

459
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,870
And if you think
that you're gonna get yourself

460
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:09,915
out of this mess...

461
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,439
Forget it.

462
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,790
You're in way over your head.

463
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,226
Unless you listen to me.

464
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:22,858
That thing that used to be
the Voice of Rao is a Sentry,

465
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:24,860
and however scared you were
of him,

466
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:27,384
multiply that by a gajillion
and double it,

467
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,820
and now you're getting close

468
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:30,691
to how scared you should be
of his boss,

469
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:33,129
Brainiac.

470
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:34,739
Now, I'm gonna guess

471
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,828
that he hasn't filled you in yet

472
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:40,353
on his intentions, so allow me.

473
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,749
Look out there.

474
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:47,534
He's gonna rip that entire city

475
00:26:47,578 --> 00:26:50,581
out of the ground
and add it to his collection.

476
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:52,365
Oh, but it gets better.

477
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,934
Brainiac doesn't want
his collection to change, ever.

478
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:59,416
Each day, same as the last...

479
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,244
for all of eternity.

480
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,811
At least I'd be alive.

481
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:06,118
Hey.

482
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:08,773
If that's your idea of life,
have at it.

483
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:09,948
I'm not gonna get in your way.

484
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:11,254
I want to help Brainiac.

485
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,908
Don't want to stop him.

486
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:14,735
I don't understand.

487
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,827
Then listen,
because I have information.

488
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,741
Information on
the only other people

489
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:23,135
that really know the truth
of what's going on.

490
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:25,355
And who you're really serving.

491
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:29,750
People who are hell-bent
on stopping Brainiac,

492
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:34,233
and well, you already know
my stance on that.

493
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,150
I assume you want something

494
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:42,807
in exchange
for this information.

495
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,856
I want Seg-El delivered
to me safe and sound first.

496
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,076
I need to ensure
that he's out of Kandor

497
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,991
- before it's taken.
- Seg-El?

498
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:55,428
What does he
have to do with this?

499
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:58,170
Well, Daron, I'd tell you,

500
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:00,999
but I don't want to.

501
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:04,046
It's "Dare-on."

502
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:15,318
Dev. Don't be scared.

503
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,972
You're not paralyzed.

504
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,104
We just need to keep you
in this state to make sure

505
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:21,541
the Voice doesn't
try and control you again.

506
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,500
Blink if you understand.

507
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:28,853
Good.

508
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,294
We might have a way to free you.

509
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,818
But the procedure...

510
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:40,909
it might kill you, Dev.

511
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:44,042
But if it doesn't,
you will be free.

512
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,739
And you will have given us
the key

513
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:48,742
to stopping the Voice
and saving Kandor.

514
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,744
If you don't want to do it,
we can find another way,

515
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:53,008
but we are running out of time.

516
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:03,801
Blink once for yes.
Twice for no.

517
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:14,986
Thank you, Dev.

518
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,514
Do you always drink
before battle?

519
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,299
Only on Krypton.

520
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:27,999
Back on Earth you can't even
get a buzz going.

521
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:32,395
But, there are other benefits.

522
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,790
Kal-El, the Superman
you keep hearing about.

523
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:40,055
He was no different
to any other Kryptonian.

524
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:42,057
He just happened
to make it off our planet

525
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,102
before it was destroyed.

526
00:29:44,146 --> 00:29:46,757
Then landed on a planet
with a yellow sun.

527
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,978
That's what makes him super.

528
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,458
Radiation.

529
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:54,504
That and dumb luck.

530
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:00,640
But if Krypton
never was destroyed,

531
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,991
we all could have
the powers he has.

532
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,864
Imagine the good
that could do the universe.

533
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,872
How did you survive
Krypton's destruction?

534
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:22,358
I wasn't on Krypton
when it exploded.

535
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,142
Where were you?

536
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:29,713
The Phantom Zone.

537
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:31,671
It's...

538
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:36,198
sort of an extra dimension
or... abyss.

539
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:39,679
Defying the laws
of space or time.

540
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,552
Turns out it's perfect
for housing criminals.

541
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:45,642
You were imprisoned?

542
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:47,426
What did you do?

543
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:53,128
I attempted a coup.

544
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,695
Guess it runs in the family.

545
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:58,350
I grew up in Kryptonopolis,
and the council there

546
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:01,962
was as inept
as yours here in Kandor.

547
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,749
There was one person
on the council

548
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,099
that I truly respected.

549
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:12,669
Of course, he was the one
who foiled my plans

550
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:14,932
and sent me away.

551
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:20,285
His name was Jor-El.

552
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:27,945
Seg, what's your status?
We got Dev.

553
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,555
So now Val's hacking
into the network

554
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,948
between the Voice
and the Red Shard.

555
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:32,515
I'm on my way.

556
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,864
We'll get the team together
and meet you

557
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:35,605
at the Genesis Chamber.

558
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:41,611
May Rao's grace be your shield.

559
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,793
They're being led by Jayna-Zod,

560
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,274
but we have the forces ready
to snuff them out

561
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,623
once and for all.

562
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:57,148
Say the word
and it will be done.

563
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,977
Your Eminence,
my information is reliable.

564
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,110
I assure you,
we can crush this rebellion

565
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,590
before it even begins.

566
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:07,115
Are you even listening?

567
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,639
What was that?

568
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:11,902
Move, move, move! Go! Go! Go!

569
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:15,297
Take cover!
Take cover! Get down!

570
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,994
You two go on ahead.

571
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:19,083
We'll keep them busy down here,
give you a chance

572
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,259
to get to the Voice!

573
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:23,435
Why are you still here? Go!

574
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,808
I'm tired of running.

575
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:51,823
- What's happening?
- His body is going into shock!

576
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,128
Hacking into this neural network

577
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,782
is not as easy as it sounds.

578
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,523
What, you mean you can't do it?

579
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:58,351
I didn't say that.

580
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,700
Your Eminence.

581
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:03,835
We need to stop this
immediately.

582
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,619
Seems like your plan
hasn't worked.

583
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,012
Please, listen to me!

584
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:08,317
The connection between the Voice

585
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,145
and his guards is still active.

586
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,712
Give 'em time.

587
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,540
Hurry, Val,
they're all counting on you!

588
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,977
Thank you,
I am very well aware of that.

589
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,370
Good, because whatever it takes,

590
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,677
you need to find a way!
Understood?

591
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,505
I'm an El. We always find a way.

592
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,117
They've had long enough.
We need to do this now.

593
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,902
I'll concentrate on the guards;
You take the Voice.

594
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,044
Told you.

595
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,578
I've been waiting
14 cycles for that.

596
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,706
Looking for this?

597
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:38,930
You're free, Dev.

598
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:43,673
The Voice of Rao, is he dead?

599
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:45,414
We don't know yet,

600
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,329
but what we do know
is your bravery

601
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:50,724
has helped save the lives
of Kandor's next generation.

602
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:56,774
Thank you, Dev.

603
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:16,837
Hello, Father.

604
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,361
How's your nose?

605
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:21,015
Seen better days.

606
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:25,411
Haven't we all?

607
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:30,895
You going to do it this time?

608
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,943
Kill you?

609
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:38,380
Of course not.

610
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:41,427
You haven't outlived
your usefulness.

611
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:45,213
Then what?

612
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,521
Why are you here?

613
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:57,051
I came to tell you

614
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,575
that I forgive you.

615
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,056
For what you did to...

616
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,452
for what you tried to do to me.

617
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:12,414
You're a survivor, Father.

618
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,243
It's all you've ever known.

619
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:18,377
All you ever taught me.

620
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,119
But I want to do more
than survive.

621
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,254
I want to be more
than just a survivor.

622
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:30,476
So did I.

623
00:36:51,323 --> 00:36:52,541
Good-bye, Father.

624
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:03,901
Good-bye, Nyssa.

625
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:14,607
There he is,

626
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,262
my old friend Daron-Vex.

627
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:24,008
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

628
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,881
Take him.

629
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,970
We're not done yet.

630
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,885
The Voice of Rao
still hasn't been found.

631
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,365
That's because
he's in a thousand pieces

632
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,019
at the bottom
of the Genesis Chamber.

633
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:36,368
Nobody could survive that.

634
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:38,109
The deal was the Voice of Rao

635
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:39,545
in exchange for Daron.

636
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:42,026
I only see one of them here.

637
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:46,508
Fine. You have Black Zero
until the body is found.

638
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:48,554
Then you and I
need to have a talk.

639
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:51,644
About who's going to fill
this sudden power vacuum

640
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,298
now that the mask
and the magistrate

641
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:55,996
are out of business.

642
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:00,740
I look forward to it.

643
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,060
Areas 11 and 28, clear.

644
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:06,191
Copy that.

645
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,065
Just a kid here, no Sagitari.

646
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:12,981
Report back to Jax
with the status.

647
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,069
Copy that.

648
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,343
Do not be alarmed.

649
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:30,520
I am in no pain...

650
00:38:30,564 --> 00:38:33,480
as I am not of this body.

651
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,747
I wear it merely
for appearances.

652
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,271
Will you be okay?

653
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:44,534
Of course.

654
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:48,799
This... is only temporary.

655
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,543
Everything is,

656
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:55,676
except me.

657
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:58,287
Shh, shh, shh.

658
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,725
There is nothing
to be afraid of, Ona.

659
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:06,121
Through fire, we are reborn.

660
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:14,390
Come on, where the hell
are they?

661
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,611
- Move!
- Copy that.

662
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:22,267
That can't be good.

663
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,578
- Through fire, we are reborn.
- Ona.

664
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,319
Ona, wait!
Through fire, we are reborn.

665
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:32,321
Through fire, we are reborn.

666
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:34,279
Through fire, we are reborn.

667
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:36,194
Through fire, we are reborn.

668
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:45,203
- Want a drink?
- No.

669
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,033
I need to speak to you
about Dru-Zod.

670
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,515
He survived
Krypton's destruction

671
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,519
because he wasn't actually
on Krypton when it happened.

672
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,652
He was in an off-planet prison

673
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:01,306
for trying to overthrow
the government.

674
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,746
Apparently, it was an El
that put him there.

675
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:10,315
I don't think he's come back
to save Krypton, Seg.

676
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:12,100
I think he's come back
to rule it.

677
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,060
Ona.

678
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,370
Ona!

679
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:26,549
Oh, I'm so glad
that you decided to come back.

680
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:29,552
What's wrong?

681
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:34,339
Through fire, we are reborn.

682
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,646
No.

683
00:42:35,504 --> 00:42:36,592
What the...

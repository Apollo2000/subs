1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,561
You again? Really?

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,561
What? What could you
possibly have been doing

3
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,853
more important than
watching the show last week?

4
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,686
Here's what you missed.

5
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,811
Come on, Toto.

6
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:19,853
Stop following me.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,394
We have the God-given right

8
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,060
to be who we are,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,894
'cause God hates haters.

10
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:30,144
My friend found you a place.
It's a family shelter.

11
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:32,769
They'll have a room
for you in two days.

12
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:35,978
They can take us in two days?

13
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,811
Oh, we've got the tarp
if it rains again.

14
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,561
Why don't you just stay here
for two nights?

15
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,436
Fiona, thank you.

16
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,310
The dude that
fell off your roof?

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,728
He's suing you?

18
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:45,978
"Plaintiff demands judgment
against defendants

19
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,394
in the sum of $6 million"?

20
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:50,894
Motherfucker.

21
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:52,602
He murdered my mother.

22
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,936
They let my father out,
I'm moving to Mexico.

23
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:57,227
It's too bad you are still...

24
00:00:57,227 --> 00:01:01,144
bitter prostitute slave
working for poor people.

25
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,728
If you weren't
such a cunt, madam,

26
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,394
you might be able
to marry well too.

27
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,269
Debbie!

28
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,352
Did you just get
this pic from Kassidi?

29
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:11,185
I think they got hitched.

I wanna have 100 baby Carls.

I should finish school.

Kass.

Hey, how long
you been out here?

52
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,185
A while.

53
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,227
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to bother you.

54
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:33,060
Sierra, wh-what is it?
What's going on?

55
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,894

00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:13,936
Hey, it's all right, okay?

62
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,769
It's all right.

63
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:33,811
Mommy.

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,394
Morning.

65
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:04,477
- How's Debbie?
- Says she's all right.

66
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,310
I'm gonna go pick her up
at the hospital.

67
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,894
- That your lawsuit?
- Yeah. Fuckers.

68
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,602
Morning, Liam.

69
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,477
Liam, you okay?

70
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:17,310
Well, Carl and Kassidi
were banging all night,

71
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,019
so we didn't get any sleep.

72
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,686
Can't stop love.

73
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,644
Proud of my Carl for
putting a ring on that one.

74
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:24,519
Little minx is loaded.

75
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,436
Morning.

76
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:28,728
- Morning.
- Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,644
Lucas.

78
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,853
My mom is Sierra.

79
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:35,602
- What are you doing here?
- My mom and me slept here.

80
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,853
What is that, Frank?

81
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:46,019
The final piece
of my retirement plan.

82
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,644
Chicken livers?

83
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:52,185
And...my Social Security
benefit package.

84
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,310
Mr., um...

85
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,602
Jerome Wessels
is retiring today.

86
00:05:58,602 --> 00:05:59,477
Who?

87
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,853
Uh, a guy that sat

88
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,269
next to me on the bus
six years ago.

89
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,644
Between my T-shirt business

90
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,352
and a few monthly checks
from Uncle Sam,

91
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,978
I should have a nice retirement,

92
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,060
so long as I get to live with

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,519
one of my loving children.

94
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,519
No.

95
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,060
I'd pitch in.

96
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,394
Laundry, general housekeeping,

97
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,060
like having a live-in maid
who speaks English.

98
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,644
You should just
die now, Frank,

99
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:27,686
save everyone
a lot of trouble.

100
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:28,310
Mr. Wessels

101
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,728
will kick in his share.

102
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:32,436
So will, uh,

103
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:34,310
Jamie Ramirez

104
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,728
and Mr. Mark Wilcox.

105
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,477
Not a chance.

106
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,602
Seriously? I give you life

107
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:43,352
and you turn your back on me
in my old age?

108
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,185
You're breaking
the social contract,

109
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,310
the very purpose of family.

110
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,477
In Asian cultures,

111
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,394
the elders are revered.

112
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:54,227
That's a great idea.
Move to Asia.

113
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:57,728
You're really
stealing Social Security cards?

114
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,436
No, I just happened
to find these

115
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:02,310
in a bag of liver
in our freezer.

116
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,769
You really got married?

117
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:07,310
Well, she was freaking out
about me going back to school.

118
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,769
So your solution
was to marry her?

119
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,227
Things just kinda happened.

120
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,561
Morning, fam.

121
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,394
You're both idiots.

122
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,144
Fiona, can I get
a ride to the church?

123
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:20,811
Sorry, Ian, I gotta go
to the ER and pick up Debbie,

124
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,769
and then I gotta try to talk
some sense into this asshole

125
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,728
in my apartment who's suing me.

126
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,853
Hey, what happened
to Debbie?

127
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,102
She hurt her foot
last night at work.

128
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,769
Says it's no big deal.

129
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,102
Good luck.

130
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:38,644
Gracias, Señor Ramirez.

131
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,686
The trauma doc
stabilized your toes,

132
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,686
but there's a good chance
you're gonna lose them.

133
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,310
It's critical that you
see a surgeon today.

134
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,019
Here's your referral.

135
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,102
They said they can
squeeze you in this afternoon.

136
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,936
Sign here and here.

137
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,060
You'll need these when
the local anesthetic wears off.

138
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,227
Twice a day as needed
for pain.

139
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,310
And here, oh.

140
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,269
I stole this from
the lost and found.

141
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:07,978
One?

142
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:11,019
You want two, the hospital
will charge you 120 bucks.

143
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:13,269
Thanks.

144
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,269
Hi.

145
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,811
- Hey.
- You okay?

146
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,060
Yeah, sure.

147
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,185
This thing fell on my foot.

148
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,769
Does it hurt?

149
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,352
A little. Still pretty numb.

150
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,185
- Thanks for picking me up.
- Yeah.

151
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,060
- Hey, good morning.
- Yeah, morning.

152
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,436
Hey, you guys get
something to eat?

153
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,602
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

154
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,227
- Coffee.
- Right.

155
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,644
Go get your stuff, okay?

156
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,352
Gotta drop you at day camp
before work.

157
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,686
Okay.

158
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,185
I'm sorry for freaking out.

159
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,269
No, don't be.

160
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,811
You can always call me.

161
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,102
When I heard he got paroled,
I...

162
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:04,144
I couldn't think straight.

163
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,728
I've never been able to get
that night out of my mind.

164
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,769
Yeah, you, uh...

165
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,269
never really told me
what happened.

166
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:29,728
He came home...

167
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,936
wasted almost every day.

168
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,728
That night, he found
a towel on the bathroom floor

169
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:38,686
and started slapping her around.

170
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,477
Mom was screaming.

171
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,894
He told her to shut up, but...

172
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,436
she didn't.

173
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,394
So he punched her...

174
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,936
...and kept punching her...

175
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:00,602
...until her face just...

176
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,436
...blood and bones and hair.

177
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,894
You were there?

178
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:18,477
Me and Neil, yeah.

179
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,269
Told us if we ever said a word
to anybody about it,

180
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,102
he'd fucking kill us both.

181
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:31,352
Took a blanket
from Neil's bed...

182
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,352
...wrapped Mom up...

183
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,978
...and threw her
in a dumpster.

184
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,310
Policewoman gave us Cokes.

185
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,144
We never got Cokes.

186
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,978
How old were you?

187
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,394
Ten.

188
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,978
We testified against him,

189
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:04,602
both of us.

190
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,352
And they just let him out.

191
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:17,394
Can you go to my apartment
with me later

192
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,019
to pick up a few things?

193
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,477
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

194
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,185
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:31,185
Dude, it's really him.

196
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,811
Hi.

197
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:35,686
Hey, Ian.
Thank you so much.

198
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:38,519
This is Bic.
He wants to help.

199
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,686
Hey.

200
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:41,060
What the hell is this?

201
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,019
Your life
is no longer your own.

202
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,686
Please, my dad's
trying to kidnap me!

203
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,686
He hired men to take me.
Please!

204
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,894
Please, my dad's trying
to kidnap me!

205
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,310
Be patient!
We'll be opening soon!

206
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,269
Hello? Rodney? It's Fiona.

207
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,060
I know you're in there.

208
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,019
Rodney, Trina?

209
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,394
Let's just talk, please,
like adults.

210
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,686
Open the door, please.
I need to get my dog.

211
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:23,686
This is stupid.
I was fair to you.

212
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,894
I let you stay in my apartment
and you sue me?

213
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:27,227
Why am I the bad guy?

214
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,102
Hey. Rusty?

215
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:31,686
Have you guys been feeding him?
Is there water in his bowl?

216
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,978
I will kill you
with my bare fucking hands.

217
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:36,936
Okay. That's fair warning.

218
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:38,310
I am the owner. I have a right
to enter these premises.

219
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,436
I'm coming in.

220
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,394
Are the locks changed?

221
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,227
This is my apartment.
Hello!

222
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,227
Did you change the locks
on my apartment?

223
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,102
What?

224
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,352
Oh. Sorry. Sure.

225
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,436
I'm coming right out.

226
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:05,602
There had better be water
in his bowl.

227
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,602
- Hmm.
- Is that bad?

228
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,686
I mean, they're roofers,
right?

229
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,019
You would think the one thing
they'd know how to do

230
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,019
is not fall off.

231
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,477
- I am covered, right?
- Uh-huh.

232
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,310
Minimum liability
up to half a million.

233
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,686
Half a million?

234
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,811
They're suing me
for six million.

235
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:40,853
People rarely get
what they're asking for.

236
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,477
We settle almost all of these.

237
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,144
- Well, that's good, then.
- Could be.

238
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,102
In any case, your contractor's
on the hook for it.

239
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,019
We're gonna go after
his insurance company.

240
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:50,728
You got the contractor's info?

241
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,978
Uh, yeah, cell phone number.

242
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,686
That's all you've got?

243
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,519
Yeah. Why?

244
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:05,394
I don't think there's
any skin left on my dick.

245
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,894
I just can't get enough
of my husband.

246
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:13,185
I need more Carl.

247
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,227
I wanna know
everything about you.

248
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,436
Remember when you said
that you and Ian--

249
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:21,728
you guys ran away
from that foster home

250
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,686
and lived under the bridge?

251
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:26,102
Did that really happen?

252
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:26,686
Yeah.

253
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,686
- Show me.
- What?

254
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:31,352
Your life.

255
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,769
Uh, where...where you lived
under the bridge,

256
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,936
where you sold your drugs,

257
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,894
where that guy chased you
with a hatchet.

258
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,436
I wanna see it all.

259
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:40,978
I mean, I am
Mrs. Carl Gallagher now.

260
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:43,144
I need to know
the life you lived.

261
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:48,853
Come on. I'll rub lotion
on your dick and we'll go.

262
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:52,060
We can't just keep attacking
people doing these conversions.

263
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,853
We need to bring Ian's message
directly to the disenfranchised,

264
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,686
wherever they are.

265
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,144
Oh, you're saying we should
preach in gay nightclubs?

266
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,102
Why not, hmm?
Nightclubs, street corners.

267
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:02,561
Ian, two big dudes
just showed up.

268
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,728
They're trying to take
one of the kids.

269
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:16,060
Hey! Hey!

270
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,894
Wait! Wait!

271
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,269
Stop!

272
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:27,060
What are you doing?

273
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,227
Look out!

274
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,227
- Now what?
- Get down.

275
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,978
Everyone down.

276
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,185
He's out!

277
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,853
Hey, morning.

278
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:46,185
Hey, uh, why don't you
go grab a broom?

279
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,561
- Morning.
- Morning.

280
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,811
Um...

281
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,060
hey, any sign of Xan's mom?

282
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,519
I'm giving my shit-bag
half sister two more days.

283
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,144
Well, she seems like
a really good kid.

284
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,477
There's nothing wrong
with the kid.

285
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:08,728
Just didn't sign up
for one, you know?

286
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,269
Right.

287
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,811
Hey, um, Brad's delivering
that Fatboy,

288
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,019
and, uh, I gotta run out
somewhere at lunch.

289
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,102
- Can you cover?
- You doing a meeting?

290
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,978
No. That, uh, friend of mine,
you know, Sierra?

291
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,561
Well, her old man
just got out of prison.

292
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,894
Her and her kid, they've been
staying with me for a few days.

293
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:31,394
Told her I'd go by her place,

294
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:32,894
help her pick up a few things.

295
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:37,352
You and the fucking drama.

296
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,060
You gotta be kidding me, right?

297
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,561
So you think you can get
your roof fixed for $500

298
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,644
from a guy that's got insurance?

299
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:45,894
- Come on.
- You don't have insurance?

300
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:48,269
Hey, I do honest work,

301
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,936
and I pay my men exactly
what I say I'm gonna pay 'em.

302
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,561
There's always some asshole

303
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:56,352
gaming the system,
saying, "Oh, I'm hurt."

304
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,853
He's got pins in his ankle.

305
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,894
I think it's fair to say
that he's hurt.

306
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:01,728
He fell.
Whose fault is that?

307
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,811
Fuck him. Let him sue me.

308
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,269
The only thing I own
in this world is that truck.

309
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,769
He'll have to kill me to get it.

310
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:15,060
Wow.

311
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,853
This fucking place, huh?

312
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,394
I found it on
Belarusian whore website.

313
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,769
More billionaires stay here
than any other hotel in Chicago.

314
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,102
What are you doing?

315
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,602
Comparing my skills
to those of Freelania.

316
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:31,769
These are my skills on this
napkin, and these are hers.

317
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,936
There's nothing
on that napkin.

318
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:33,936
Hmm, precisely.

319
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,811
She is sub-mental.

320
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,144
Not as attractive,
not as charming.

321
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,978
Look at my ass.
It's perfect.

322
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,102
I would fuck
my own ass.

323
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:44,269
She has flat ass
of Filipino boy.

324
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:49,352
$28 for a vodka tonic?

325
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:50,978
$18 for a beer.

326
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:51,811
You'd have to be a billionaire
to catch a buzz.

327
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:57,477
Hey...

328
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:58,978
I think that guy at the end
of the bar wants to talk.

329
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,728
Bring him over.

330
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,561
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

331
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:11,352
We are having
a little party upstairs.

332
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,227
Great, I'm Kevin Ball--

333
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:14,978
We-we just need
the chocolate one.

334
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,686
A thousand for the hour.

335
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,936
The chocolate...

336
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,644
V? That's my wife.

337
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,269
Fifteen hundred.
Two thousand if it runs over.

338
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:29,144
Look, pal, my wife isn't--
$2,000?

339
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:33,436
Three thousand.

340
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:35,144
I mean, look, she's worth it,

341
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:35,811
but you should really
meet the other one.

342
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:38,436
Crazy in bed, and...

343
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,060
she knows accounting.

344
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,310
Let me invite her over.

345
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,102
Hey, we're not hiring
a bookkeeper.

346
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,853
Four grand for the black one.
Final offer.

347
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:00,185
So? Did you get her a date?
Why didn't you invite him over?

348
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:01,936
They prefer you.

349
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,602
You explained we're married
and Svet's single?

350
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,561
The guy offered me $4,000
for an hour with you.

351
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,769
Hmm.

352
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:09,644
- He thinks I'm a whore?
- Of course.

353
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,644
No, it-it's just
a misunderstanding, V.

354
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,686
- That's all.
- Oh.

355
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,227
$4,000?

356
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,436
V...

357
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,102
No--
Look, I'm sorry,

358
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,978
but damn,
that's a lot of money.

359
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:24,728
And it's not like
the guy is ugly.

360
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,269
- V!
- Good afternoon.

361
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,394
Oh, good afternoon.

362
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,227
- I am Aviv Ben Yellin.
- I am Svetlana Yevgenivna.

363
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:34,102
These are my friends
Veronica and Kevin Von Ball.

364
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:36,853
- Please, join us.
- Thank you.

365
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,060
Regrettably, I can't
accept your invitation.

366
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,394
I'm director of hotel security,

367
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:44,436
and it is my unfortunate duty
to inform you

368
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:48,561
that the hotel has a strict
"no prostitution" policy.

369
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,060
We're not prostitutes.

370
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,894
No, no, no, they are,
those whores at the bar.

371
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:55,185
Like you don't know.
Please.

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,686
Let's go to the Ritz.

373
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:01,352
No.

374
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:04,728
No more.
I think I know what to do.

375
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,602
I need to go humble myself
before that slut Freelania

376
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,602
and see how she managed
such a miracle.

377
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,811
- Four thousand?
- Dollars.

378
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,686
I can't believe
that you lived down here.

379
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,102
It's like freakin' Mad Max.

380
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:24,894
Yeah, I remember
this one time,

381
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,561
a guy tried to steal
Ian's coat.

382
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,019
We beat him with a can of tuna
wrapped in a tube sock.

383
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,310
That's so hot.

384
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,728
Think it's over here.

385
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,853
Oh, my God,
you lived there?

386
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,978
- Yeah.
- I have to see it.

387
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:44,561
Hey! You okay?

388
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,978
Oh, hey, man.
Sorry, didn't realize

389
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:48,477
someone was sleeping here.

390
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,310
Hello?

391
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,602
Is he dead?
Is that a dead body?

392
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,102
Hey, come on,
let's just get out of here.

393
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,019
I've gotta Snapchat this.

394
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,853
Uh, it's just a dead guy.
Let's go.

395
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,310
- Roll him over.
- What?

396
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,269
So I can see
the face of death.

397
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:04,978
Oh, Kassidi, come on.

398
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:08,019
Carl, roll him over.

399
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,853

Hi.

418
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:00,310
I'm retiring.

419
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,519
I'd like to start receiving
my Social Security benefits.

420
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,394
Hmm.

421
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:11,019
I'm sorry, Mr. Wessels.

422
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,394
It says here you're already
collecting your benefit.

423
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,728
What? How can that be?

424
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,602
Are you suggesting someone
has stolen my identity,

425
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:20,894
committing fraud?

426
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,728
It's a possibility, yes.

427
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:25,060
Oh, my God.

428
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,519
I'm number nine. Sorry.

429
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,894
I was in the bathroom.

430
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,728
Prostate, you know.

431
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,853
Size of a basketball.

432
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,728
Hi. I'd like to start
my benefits.

433
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,686
Um...Mr. Ramirez?

434
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:46,978
It says here you're dead.

435
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:53,853
Uh, I'm-I'm number nine.

436
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:55,769
Hi.

437
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,436
Can you...

438
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,269
tell me what my
benefits would be

439
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:02,019
if I were to retire right now?

440
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:03,269
Of course.

441
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,686
Um, Mr. Gallagher,
it says here

442
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:15,853
you only worked six weeks
your entire life.

443
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:16,769
Well...

444
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,269
if you mean a "formal job,"
yes, but I...

445
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:22,144
I've had various enterprises

446
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:25,394
that contributed significantly
to the economy.

447
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,644
Mm-hmm.

448
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,436
Well, as it stands,

449
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:31,519
this will be your
monthly benefit.

450
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,144
Three dollars and 42 cents?

451
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,519
Gee. That's not a lot, is it?

452
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,811
- Sorry.
- A guy works his whole life.

453
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:47,519
♪ No, there ain't no doubt
I was born for this ♪

454
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,978
How's the pain?

455
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:50,602
It's starting to hurt a little.

456
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,144
The trauma doc was inclined
to amputate,

457
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,310
which may have been warranted.

458
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,019
All three toes
are severely damaged,

459
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,019
crushed, for lack
of a better word.

460
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:58,811
There's not enough
blood circulating

461
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:01,060
to ensure
they won't go necrotic.

462
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,853
- W-what does that mean?
- Die.

463
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:04,728
And if your toes die,
then you're talking gangrene,

464
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,185
and next thing you know,
you lose your leg.

465
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:08,853
But you can fix 'em, right?

466
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:09,686
Surgery's only
part of the process.

467
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,769
You'll be off your feet
for months,

468
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,477
and then at least year
of physical therapy.

469
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,019
A year?

470
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,477
I-I can't--

471
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:18,352
Well, what would
the surgery cost?

472
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,269
It'll run you
at least $50,000.

473
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,853
Holy shit.

474
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,894
For three toes?

475
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:26,352
W-what happens
if I can't afford the surgery?

476
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,728
- I just die?
- No. We remove the toes,

477
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:30,769
and then you're back on
your feet in a couple of days.

478
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:31,811
Costs $6,000, $7,000.

479
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:35,978
You'll be a little wobbly
at first.

480
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:37,561
Need a special shoe.

481
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,060
Let me know what you decide.

482
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,978
Well, why is it
so important for you to know

483
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:47,894
what it's like
to live on the street?

484
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,561
'Cause you grew up free.
I grew up trapped

485
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:54,394
in an 8,000-square-foot
suburban prison.

486
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,728
Cable fucking TV,

487
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:56,602
cheerleading camp,
cross country,

488
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,561
and Mom always
ragging on me to study.

489
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,436
And for what?
So I could end up like them?

490
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:03,519
I mean, they're miserable.
Please.

491
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:06,728
Well, this is it.

492
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:09,769
This is where my first shop was.

493
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,436
Selling crack?
That is so cool.

494
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,811
Yo, you gotta buy or walk.

495
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,394
This is my corner.

496
00:26:15,394 --> 00:26:17,060
I used to work this corner.

497
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,561
Where's G-Dog?

498
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,686
That's his brains
right there...

499
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:23,227
...that dark spot.

500
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:27,769
Damn!

501
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,060
Shooter! Down!

502
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,853
Get down!

503
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,936
Oh, my God!

504
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,477
They shot at us!

505
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:41,477
This is epic!

506
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:47,477
- Hey. Ready?
- Hey.

507
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:49,894
Yeah. I'm going on my break.

508
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:52,853
Thanks for coming with me.
I-I know it's stupid,

509
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:55,310
but I keep thinking
he could be trying to find me.

510
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,227
Right.

511
00:26:56,227 --> 00:27:00,644
Um...

512
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:02,728
...why don't you tell me what
you need from the apartment?

513
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:04,894
I'll just go get it.

514
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:05,853
No, I can't let you do that.

515
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:09,060
Look, nothing's gonna
happen, all right?

516
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,019
It's not a big deal.

517
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,978
Look, y-you got
a picture of him?

518
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,728
You know, if I see him
hanging around your place,

519
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:16,269
we'll go to the cops

520
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,894
and get a restraining
order or something.

521
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:23,310
Only photo I have
is pretty old.

522
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,811
Okay.

523
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:30,686
Hey, they tell you
where they paroled him to?

524
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:33,519
Some halfway house
over on Seventh.

525
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,185
Okay.

526
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,519
I'll make a list of stuff
that I need from the apartment.

527
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,644
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, cool.

528
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,144
Hey. What are you doing?

529
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:53,477
Googling St. Croix.

530
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,561
- What's that?
- Some island.

531
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:00,144
I'm gonna go yachting there.

532
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,019
Right.

533
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,019
Hey, Google something
for me, will ya?

534
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,102
Sure.

535
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,352
Google "do you need your toes?"

536
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,519
Please.

537
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:12,978
What do you plan
to do with him?

538
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:15,269
We'll find
someplace for him.

539
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,686
The father has a legal right
to take his son.

540
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:18,185
- Uh--
- The kid's still a minor.

541
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:19,019
Just 'cause it's legal
doesn't make it right.

542
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:20,686
Ian, I feel like
part of my role here

543
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:23,060
is to make sure you understand

544
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,644
the realities of what
we're getting into.

545
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:27,019
You--we are harboring

546
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,310
a runaway 14-year-old.

547
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,477
Legally, you have no standing
as his protector or guardian.

548
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,894
Then who will protect him?

549
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,227
Are you saying
we shouldn't be helping people

550
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,728
just 'cause
it could be dangerous?

551
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,686
'Cause if so,
what the hell are we doing here?

552
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:40,394
It's not your place--

553
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,811
Blake's old man is here.

554
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:43,728
He wants to talk to you.

555
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,019
You think we're horrible for
trying to kidnap our own child.

556
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,102
But we will do
anything to save him.

557
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:55,728
So please, give him back to us
so we can get him help.

558
00:28:57,477 --> 00:29:00,060
We're not bigots.

559
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,811
We love our son.

560
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:04,060
We don't think Blake
needs to be heterosexual

561
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,644
to be a good person.

562
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,185
But he's living on the streets,
he's using drugs,

563
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,561
and I know that he's...

564
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,519
prostituting himself.

565
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,144
He's out of control.

566
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,769
We think--

567
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:19,227
we believe he may be
mentally ill.

568
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:26,769
So you let them stay
in your apartment?

569
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,227
- Well, yeah.
- You shouldn't have done that.

570
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,811
Why?

571
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,352
Because that's an admission
of responsibility.

572
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,811
But I-I didn't
do anything wrong.

573
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:36,102
Your contractor
had no insurance.

574
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:38,978
You only have a half a million
in liability.

575
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,436
S-so what's the worst case?

576
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:43,811
You lose in court

577
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,602
and your insurance
pays out 500,000.

578
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:49,769
That leaves you
owing 5.5 million.

579
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,352
Other assets?
Well, you sell your building.

580
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:54,310
You got about 50 grand
in equity there.

581
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,310
And, uh--and your
family home is worth,

582
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,811
um, I don't know, maybe 62?

583
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,853
So that leaves you only
owing this Rodney asshole

584
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:06,060
$5,388,000...

585
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,352
forever.

586
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,102
The jury's gonna take
one look at that man

587
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,728
and his starving family

588
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:11,894
and the slumlord bitch
that ruined their lives

589
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,019
by hiring
an unlicensed contractor,

590
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,602
and you're gonna be lucky
if they don't put you in jail.

591
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:26,019
He spoils me,

592
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,144
but I deserve it.

593
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,978
He likes his little penis
rubbed, and honestly,

594
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:33,019
all he really cares about
are my feet.

595
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,519
He can't stop buying me shoes.

596
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,310
Such a simple man.

597
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,436
Oh. Vera made this for me.

598
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:41,936
Mazel tov.

599
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:44,686
I must admit,

600
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,978
the greater part
of the joy I feel

601
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,519
is knowing how devastated
you must be.

602
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,686
Humiliated.

603
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:54,352
I had imagined you
humbled like this

604
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,519
so many times.

605
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,686
I was worried it would be
anticlimactic.

606
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:02,102
- It's not.
- Freelania...

607
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,728
...you have everything
we have ever dreamed of.

608
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:10,144
After all the tubs
of hand lotion

609
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:12,019
and stained sheets,

610
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,394
thousands of Handi Wipes,

611
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,811
I am truly humbled
by your success,

612
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:18,728
so I ask you to pity me
and tell me how.

613
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:21,561
How did you make
this all happen?

614
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:25,060
You mean how did
these shoes happen?

615
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,102
Yes.

616
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:27,728
How did this Gaultier gown,

617
00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:30,060
which I have never worn,
happen?

618
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,352
Uh-huh.

619
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:44,978
I would give it to you
now that it's soiled, but...

620
00:31:44,978 --> 00:31:47,519
you're too fat
to fit into it,

621
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,477
so I will
throw it away instead.

622
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,894
Svetlana Yevgenivna,

623
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,894
you were born a whore.

624
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,894
You will die a whore.

625
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,936
Mm. My caterer.

626
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,936
Excuse me.

627
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:07,686
Alain...

628
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:10,352
Bonjour, Mon amour.

629
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,728
Ublyudok.

630
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,602
Hello, hello.

631
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,728
Hello, sweetie.

632
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,269
Don't you look lovely...

633
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:22,769
today?

634
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,602
I'm headed for the club.

635
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:26,769
Don't forget
dinner at The Grill.

636
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:29,811
I wanna show off
my beautiful bride-to-be.

637
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:31,185
Hmm.

638
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,227
Toodle-oo.

639
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:37,227
I'm going up the chimney.

640
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,811
I have investigated

641
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:47,477
every possible
retirement scenario,

642
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,936
and they all lead
to homelessness,

643
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:51,561
hunger,

644
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,561
despair, and decrepitude.

645
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:56,269
How's that any different than
how you live right now, Frank?

646
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,227
It's as if we think

647
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:01,728
the elderly are
irrelevant, disposable.

648
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,436
My own children have said

649
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:05,686
they won't care for me
in old age.

650
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,019
What does tell you
about the decline

651
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,686
of Western civilization?

652
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,227
That you didn't raise
any fools.

653
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,936
I believe that Alzheimer's

654
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:19,144
is an evolutionary advantage
that we've developed

655
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:22,769
so we won't have to be aware
of the depth of misery

656
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,978
we face in our dotage.

657
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:26,936
And yet...

658
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:30,227
here I am...

659
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:32,019
...as loose as the day
I was born.

660
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:35,019
Retirement
is for rich people.

661
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:38,602
My old man was at GM
for 40 years.

662
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,352
Six months short
of retirement,

663
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,060
the pension fund
went tits up.

664
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,144
Forty years
and dick to show for it.

665
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:47,269
- But he got lucky.
- How's that?

666
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:49,019
Well, he died on the line.

667
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,019
Keeled over into
the stamping machine.

668
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,894
Got pressed into a rear fender
for a Buick Skylark.

669
00:33:53,894 --> 00:33:56,811
Never even stopped the line.

670
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,686
How's that lucky?

671
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:01,686
Well, he didn't have
to worry about retiring.

672
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:03,561
Ah...

673
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:07,310
Fucking A,
this one's to the workingman.

674
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,936
Fucking A to the workingman.

675
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:14,894
♪ slow, grungy music ♪

676
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,936
Talked to your dad.

677
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,728
Says you're using.

678
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,686
Sometimes.

679
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:30,728
You're selling yourself?

680
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:36,602
You can't be living
on the street.

681
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,269
It's dangerous.

682
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:40,060
I can't go home.

683
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,602
When I came out,
they lost it.

684
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:45,728
He says that they're okay
with you being gay.

685
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,936
That's bullshit.

686
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,978
They put me into therapy,

687
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,728
three days a week.

688
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:52,644
Started going to a church

689
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:55,144
where this asshole
was always talking about

690
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,477
sodomy and God's will.

691
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,185
They wanna lock me up
with other kids

692
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,436
whose parents don't wanna deal
with who their kids really are.

693
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:10,811
He says your therapist thinks
you may be mentally ill.

694
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,436
They put me on these drugs,

695
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:16,227
knocked me on my ass.

696
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,602
I couldn't even get out of bed.

697
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,269
I couldn't get an erection.

698
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:26,561
That's what they really want,

699
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:30,686
so that I can't have sex
with another boy, you know?

700
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:31,644
Ever.

701
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,436
Well...

702
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,227
you can't stay here.

703
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:41,310
We have to find someplace

704
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,936
where you can be safe,
where you can be yourself.

705
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,644
So you'll help me?

706
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:56,102
This is it, first group home.

707
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:57,728
John McKimmey chased me
around the basement

708
00:35:57,728 --> 00:35:59,769
with a hatchet
on his birthday.

709
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,227
Carl?

710
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:06,477
Benson?
Hey, man.

711
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,811
Hey.

712
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,728
This is my wife, Kassidi.
This is Benson.

713
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:12,060
- We used to live here together.
- Well, I still do.

714
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,769
Oh, no shit.

715
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:14,894
Yeah, nobody ever claimed me.

716
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:17,769
Oh, wow, I'm sorry, man.

717
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:19,227
How long have you
lived here for?

718
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:20,936
My whole life.

719
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:22,477
My mom left me in a dumpster
behind the Save-A-Lot

720
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:24,102
when I was a baby.

721
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,019
Heard you were in the army
or some shit.

722
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,853
Yeah, I'm a cadet corporal

723
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:30,853
over at Millberry
Military Academy.

724
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:33,602
That's dope. Wow.

725
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:34,894
What are you doing back here?

726
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:38,769
I came home for the summer.

727
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,352
I go back in a week.

728
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:42,269
Man, you got
it all figured out.

729
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,394
Well, I gotta get back
before they put lunch away.

730
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:45,769
Snackables today.

731
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,686
I love those little
cheese wedges.

732
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:48,894
- Well, later.
- All right.

733
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:51,769
Hey, baby, wait!

734
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:52,936
- Kassidi!
- I'm sick of all your shit!

735
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:55,602
Kassidi, wait up!

736
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,644
Frank, can I please
go yachting

737
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:06,561
in the Caribbean
with Dylan's family?

738
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:08,060
Son...

739
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,894
now is not the time
to badger your father.

740
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,602
I'm a little preoccupied with

741
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:15,019
coming up with several
hundred thousand dollars

742
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,894
so that my retirement

743
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:19,060
can have a modicum of--

744
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:21,894
Yachting?

745
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,477
I've always wanted
to ride a Jet Ski.

746
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:30,561
Dylan said I could use
the yellow one.

747
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:31,102
Did he?

748
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,436
Well, look at that.

749
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:36,477
You know, the Caribbean's
far from here,

750
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:39,060
past Florida,
way down there.

751
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,394
They have their own jet,

752
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:44,185
so we can fly there
and then yacht around.

753
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,853
Wow, that's impressive.

754
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:48,436
What does Dylan's father do

755
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:50,936
that he has a yacht
and a private plane?

756
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,144
Finance. Dylan said
I could do it someday

757
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,310
because I'm good at math.

758
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,728
So you'd be gone, what,

759
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:00,269
- a couple weeks?
- Yeah. Can I go?

760
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:03,227
Yes, well...

761
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,352
uh, fun or no fun,
I am your father,

762
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:07,602
and I am responsible
for your safety.

763
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,269
I gotta meet his parents

764
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:11,477
before I'm going
to give my permission.

765
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:13,936
I'm not just gonna
turn you over to a stranger.

766
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,728
I mean, he could be a...

767
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,394
drug lord...

768
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:19,102
or a congressman.

769
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:21,519
I'll text him right now.

770
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,477
Kassidi, don't!

771
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:30,769
Kassidi, I love you! Come on!

772
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,144
Just forget about it, Carl!

773
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,644
Forget about me.
Forget about us.

774
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,269
I'm going home.
We'll just--we'll get a divorce.

775
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:40,352
I mean, what do you care?
You're leaving me anyway.

776
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,310
Leave or die, fucker!
Come on!

777
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,644
I thought you would
be okay with me

778
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:47,310
going back to school now
'cause we're married!

779
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,811
I will never be okay
with being away from you, bae!

780
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:50,728
Never!

781
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,561
Okay.

782
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,144
Okay.

783
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:57,060
I won't go.

784
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,019
I won't ever go back to school.
I'll stay here with you.

785
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:04,019
No one is ever gonna love you
as hard as I do, Carl Gallagher.

786
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,686
Remember that.

787
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:07,519
No one.

788
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,019
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

789
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,352
Frank, listen, I get it.

790
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,936
I was raised in Camden.

791
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,352
My old man taught junior high.

792
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,853
We ate SpaghettiOs
out of a can.

793
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,436
Only way to eat SpaghettiOs!

794
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:25,519
I didn't have a TV in my room
until I was 12.

795
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,561
So when Dylan told me
he wanted to invite

796
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,436
one of the less fortunate
kids from school,

797
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,436
I told Carrie,
"Hey, why not?"

798
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,019
You'd be a great role model
for him, Andrew.

799
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,060
Well, thanks, Frank.

800
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,144
And I'm sure
you're a terrific dad.

801
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,477
Well...

802
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:45,060
Honestly, I'm surprised
you wanted to meet.

803
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Most of these parents,
they would've just

804
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
shipped their kid off
without a phone call.

805
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,561
Doesn't sound
very responsible,

806
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,269
if you ask me.

807
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:54,602
That's a nice sword.

808
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:57,060
Harumaki, early Edo.

809
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,769
Paid nearly half a million
for that outfit.

810
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,060
Those Samurai,

811
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,769
tiny dudes.

812
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,352
That helmet?
Couldn't even fit on my dick.

813
00:40:08,477 --> 00:40:13,644
Andrew, I-I truly appreciate
your generosity.

814
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,728
Well, Frank,
being poor isn't a sin.

815
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:17,394
It just sucks, am I right?

816
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:20,394
Suck it does.

817
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:23,811
That's a pretty cool cowboy.

818
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:24,978
Looks so real.

819
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,602
Remington.

820
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:29,978
That son of a bitch ran me
a million and a half.

821
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,936
Stop.

822
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:33,894
But you know what?
Worth it.

823
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,519
That bastard's running
all out.

824
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,936
I like it.

825
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,144
I like to think
of myself that way.

826
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,936
Instead of a pony,
I ride the market, balls out.

827
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:46,477
- Nobody's gonna give it to ya.
- No, they will not.

828
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,310
You gotta reach out
and take it.

829
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,728
No truer words
were ever spoken.

830
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,853
Yippee-ki-yay.

831
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:59,436
You're doing the right thing
trying to suggest a compromise.

832
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,811
It's gonna be my final offer,
I swear to God.

833
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:03,644
You could pump
just enough carbon monoxide

834
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:05,477
into the apartment
to give 'em all brain damage.

835
00:41:05,477 --> 00:41:06,477
What'll you do
if they don't go for it?

836
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:09,144
I'll settle it,
with a shotgun.

837
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:09,978
You don't wanna act in anger.

838
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:11,978
'Cause if you gas 'em
just right,

839
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,561
then they'd all wander
around like zombies

840
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,936
and probably never even
remember to go to court.

841
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:17,602
- Not helpful.
- Christ, you're boring.

842
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:18,728
I hope our kid
isn't as boring as you.

843
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:24,310
Hi.

844
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,602
Trina, let's talk.

845
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:32,811
- Really?
- Easy.

846
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:35,686
Don't let her get
under your skin.

847
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:37,185
Come on, let's handle this
like adults.

848
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:38,811
Drop the suit,

849
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,894
and you can live here
rent-free for a year.

850
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:43,811
I'll even pay your
hospital expenses.

851
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:46,060
That way, Rodney will have time
to get back on his feet

852
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,644
and get a job.

853
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:49,936
That's fair, right?
That's more than fair.

854
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:52,561
I haven't done anything wrong.

855
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,686
I'll even buy you groceries.

856
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:58,352
Hey.

857
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,853
Down!

858
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,436
Rusty?

859
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:06,269
Hey! Fuck all of you!

860
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:08,519
Give me my goddamn dog!

861
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,853
Rusty!

862
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,686
They are going down.

863
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:14,352
Fuck!

864
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,394
Hey, what's going on, man?

865
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:39,728
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Can I help you?

866
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:41,728
Yeah, you, uh--you got a square?

867
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,102
- Yeah.
- Oh, thanks.

868
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,477
Mm-hmm.

869
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:46,686
Oh, perfect.

870
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:48,185
A light?

871
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,561
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

872
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:54,436
Hey, you, um...

873
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,394
you're Norman, right?

874
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Do I know you?

875
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,144
No, I'm a friend of the family.

876
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:03,269
Fuck off.

877
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:07,769
Hey, um...

878
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,853
but is it--is it true
that you like to beat women?

879
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:16,936
You know,
'cause where I'm from,

880
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:18,811
guys that beat woman,

881
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:20,269
well, they're bitches, right,

882
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:21,310
so I guess what I'm asking is,

883
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,436
I mean, is that true?

884
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,352
Are you a little bitch?

885
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:29,686
No, I mean, are you
a little bitch woman beater--

886
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,352
Fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

887
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,352
Ah!

888
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,102
You're a dead man, motherfucker!

889
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,602
Let go!

890
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:50,394
You're fucking dead!

891
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,477
I'll fucking kill you,
you motherfucker! You hear me?

892
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:54,602
You're a dead man, motherfucker!

893
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:56,310
A fucking dead man!

894
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:20,644
- How'd we do?
- He swung first.

895
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:21,769
Oh, yeah? Let me see.

896
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:28,185
All right. That's excellent.
That's excellent, all right?

897
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:36,060
Uh, yeah, I'd like
to report an assault.

898
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:39,936
You hear that?

899
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:42,644
Drop the lawsuit,
I'll let you out.

900
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:45,811
Or starve. Your choice.

or "Yellow Brick Road."

905

Hey.

999
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,728
What? What is it?

1000
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:22,310
What? Mm.

1001
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,561
- He's back in jail.
- What?

1002
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:27,269
He got into a fight.
They revoked his probation.

1003
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:28,853
Wow.

1004
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:33,853
What's that?

1005
00:50:33,853 --> 00:50:36,519
Uh, it's, uh, nothing.

1006
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:39,561
A wrench slipped at work.

1007
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,561
Oh, baby...

1008
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:45,060
A wrench, huh?

1009
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,769
Yeah, a wrench.

1010
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:15,102
Jesus, it looks like somebody
sawed them off with a hacksaw.

1011
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:16,728
Work accident.

1012
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:19,227
A pipe fell down
and cut 'em right off.

1013
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:20,686
Did the pipe cauterize them too?

1014
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,561
Could you please just
stitch 'em up for me?

1015
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,936
I got welding school next week.

1016
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:52,978
Son, please.

1017
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:55,310
Blake, I'm only
trying to help you.

1018
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,477
I love you, son.

1019
00:51:57,477 --> 00:51:59,352
I'm-I'm doing this
for your own good.

1020
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:01,436
My God's a faggot!

1021
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:04,769
My God's a dyke.

1022

My God is trans,

1023
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:09,978
a junkie, a whore!

1024
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:19,019
We will not be victims.

1025
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:44,602
Jesus.

1026
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:46,602
What do you got in there,
a dead body?

1027
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:48,728
I do not believe she's dead yet.

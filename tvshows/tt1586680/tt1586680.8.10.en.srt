1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,220
You missed it, didn't ya?

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,680
You don't know
what happened last week.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,810
You want me to tell you?
Give me 100 bucks.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,560
Come on, 100 bucks,
I'll tell you what ha--

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,470
Okay, 50 bucks!
You make a good living!

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,020
Give me some fucking money!

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,390
You want to know
what happened or not?

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,890
Well then, fuck you.
I'm not telling you.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,520
It's my goal to get you all

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,560
safely across the border
into Canada.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,520
- Do you see anybody?
- No, I don't see--

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,350
Hello. Wrong side
of the border, boys, eh?

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,020
You can find your own
rich dude to control.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,060
I am past
my prime whoring years.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,310
Top ten places
to look for rich dudes.

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,310
High-end pubs.

17
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,100
We're taking you
sugar-daddy shopping.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,890
I saw you took
the "For Rent" sign down.

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,430
It's about time I got

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,980
something of my own
for a change.

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,850
You're pretty damn intriguing.

22
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,140
How intriguing?

23
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,770
There was, uh, an accident
at my building,

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,850
one of the roofer guys
fell off the roof.

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,180
- Is he okay?
- I think he broke his ankle.

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,600
If there's anything that
I can do to help.

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,390
Thank you.

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,680
What, Youens still?

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,180
I can't stop picturing him
in an orange jumpsuit

30
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,220
for the rest of his life.

31
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,270
You're a good fucking friend,

32
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,930
but you can't fix everything.

33
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,390
You still on that Bible shit?

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,680
Yeah, I'm proving to
my online haters

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,020
that Jesus is a fag hag.

36
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,890
Another gaycorcism's going down.

37
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,140
Gotta gather the kids.

38
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,890
- Who are you?
- I'm his girlfriend.

39
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,060
- Check this out.
- Wow.

40
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,560
You're
yelling at me right now!

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,730
Because you're being crazy!

42
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,640
Yes, I'll marry you!

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,310
Fucking hell yes!

44
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,310

Ah, you're, uh,
still at it.

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,930
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out

63
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,390
where all the
gay-hating churches are.

64
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,350
There's like one
in every neighborhood.

65
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,850
Homophobia's back in style.

66
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,520
Not for long.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,310
I've got more kids coming
for a meeting tonight.

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,930
- Youens still in jail?
- Yeah.

69
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,730
Yeah, I'm actually gonna
go check on him later today.

70
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,470
Oh.

71
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,730
Hey, they've got
a retirement calculator.

72
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,520
I fucking love the internet.

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,140
I'll roll over my 401K
from Lumber Lawn and Lighting.

74
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,890
And then I add
my estimated yearly earnings.

75
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,980
What are you doing, Frank?

76
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,310
Planning my retirement.

77
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,520
Time to reflect on
my accomplishments

78
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,520
and to bask in the spoils
of a life well-lived.

79
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,930
You mean leech off your kids

80
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,810
and drink booze
out of a backpack?

81
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,680
You guys, Farhad found me

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,270
a temp job that
pays 40 bucks an hour!

83
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,060
- Oh, yeah?
- Some nighttime welding gig.

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,520
I don't know, nighttime welding?
Sounds kind of sketchy, Debs.

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,980
Took me two weeks to make
300 bucks walking dogs.

86
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,560
I can handle sketchy.

87
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Expenses? Alcohol and drugs
is non-negotiable.

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,100
Clothing? Yes,
the occasional golf shirt

89
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,310
or swimwear for leisurely
retirement pursuits.

90
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,350
Hola, hola, good morning.

91
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,730
No mortgage...

92
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,810
Hola, mi cielito.
Como estás?

93
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,560
No rent...

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,270
Are you ready to have a nice day
with your abuelita?

95
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,060
I'll change you.

96
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,180
- Good morning, boo.
- Did you make all this?

97
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,220
Yes.
For you, bae.

98
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
I am going to cook for you
every day,

99
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,470
and dinner too,
and then blow jobs for dessert.

100
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm going to be
the best fucking wife.

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,430
The age
I'd like to retire,

102
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,600
based on my current age?

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,180
Well... they're identical, so.

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,140
I--

105
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,470
W--this makes no sense.

106
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,680
Let me see.

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,890
Come on.

108
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,270
All right, you need...
23 grand annually to retire.

109
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,980
And you are short by about...

110
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,680
22 grand.

111
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,930
Sounds right to me.

112
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,640
Oh, fuck that.

113
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,020
I've got engagement presents!

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,890
The vibrations
will lift up your follicles

115
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,310
so that the blades cut
below your skin.

116
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,810
Thank you.

117
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,810
And a Nintendo 3DS
for Liam.

118
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,140
Dope.

119
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,640
And a Zen garden

120
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,220
with a tiny, little sand rake
for you.

121
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,520
And, um, a Fitbit for Ian.

122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,890
Sweet.

123
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,600
And... hot rollers for you.

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,270
Cool.

125
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,930
And for you, my sweet,
hot bitch...

126
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,470
I found it.

127
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,560
What is it?

128
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,310
Is that blood?

129
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,430
Is that your blood?

130
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,980
Yeah.
It's your blood now.

131
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,890
You possess me,
and vice versa.

132
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,310
Here.
Come here.

133
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,020
I'll try not to nick an artery.

134
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,350
Gross.

135
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,850
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,810
Nice color.

137
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,310
It's called "Dangerous Robot."

138
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm doing the bathroom
in Liquid Kitty.

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,770
What happened to just "blue"?

140
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,680
Blue... is not badass.

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,180
Well, neither is Liquid Kitty;
it sounds like a dyke bar.

142
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,890
Why don't you just paint it
"Wet Pussy"?

143
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,310
Benjamin Moore
didn't have that one.

144
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,180
It took me forever to choose.

145
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,430
What is my taste, even?

146
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,850
Ghetto chic.

147
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,600
That's by necessity, not choice.

148
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,180
Well, you're asking
the wrong gal.

149
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,350
Mel handles this shit.

150
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,140
And her style's like...

151
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,680
resort meets brothel.

152
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,220
That's perfect for a nursery.

153
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,180
You guys start
picking out cribs?

154
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,470
Crib, singular.

155
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,220
We're down a fetus.
I miscarried.

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,470
Oh, shit.

157
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,770
It's okay.

158
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,470
I mean, yeah, it sucks, but

159
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,470
we hadn't figured
we'd both get pregnant.

160
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,100
Least now I can drink.
Got any beer?

161
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,520
Yeah, go help yourself.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,060
Well, how's Mel taking it?

163
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,390
I haven't told her yet.

164
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,390
Maybe I'll eat smoked salmon
and raw eggs in front of her,

165
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,890
and see if she notices.

166
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,730
"Hey, stranger.

167
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,350
Picking up some chairs
for a client.

168
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,730
Wanna join and grab
some furniture for your flat?"

169
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,270
- Is that Ford?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,180
Say yes.
He's like a furniture savant.

171
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,390
So the last time I saw him,

172
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,600
we kissed,
and then he threw me out.

173
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,270
Well, said he had to work.

174
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,350
I have never waited this long
for someone to bang me.

175
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,430
It's kind of fun, weirdly.

176
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,600
For now.

177
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,640
Guy better be an animal in bed.

178
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,140
I wouldn't know.

179
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,350
I closed my eyes and
pictured Scarlett Johansson.

180
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,980
But I've heard
glowing accounts.

181
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,100
Well, if I find out
before I'm 40,

182
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,060
I'll let you know.

183
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,560
Any bites yet?

184
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,430
Maybe we should change
her profile description.

185
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,810
What does it say now?

186
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,770
"Sassy Russian ex-prostitute

187
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,730
seeks single geriatric male

188
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,560
with piles of money
and a terminal illness."

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,890
Subtle.

190
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,140
Guy named Gerald
seems interested.

191
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,350
Luxury cigar importer.

192
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,470
Hey, guess what we're doing.

193
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,390
I can find my own rich husband.

194
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,930
We know that you can,
but if a wealthy cigar importer

195
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,770
comes into The Alibi tonight,
it won't kill you

196
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,390
to smile and have a drink.

197
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,310
What is the point of smiling?

198
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,220
Make other people feel good.

199
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,270
I make people feel good
other ways.

200
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,980
Yes, you do.

201
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,640
But there are some situations

202
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,430
where hand jobs
are not appropriate.

203
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,890
American mid-century modern.

204
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,810
Mm.

205
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,600
That's cool.

206
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,220
Reference to the Danish
design movement of the 1950s.

207
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,020
Try it.

208
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,680
- It's comfy.
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,850
- Not sure it's me though.
- Says who?

210
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,810
You get to choose that.
That's what design is for.

211
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,520
Decide who you want to be.

212
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,640
speaking Greek

213
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,930
- speaking Greek
- speaking Greek

214
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,980
speaks Greek

215
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,850
Thank you.

216
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,100
- What the fuck was that?
- Uh, Greek.

217
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,520
I lived in a monastery
in Macedonia for a while.

218
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,980
Of course you did.

219
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,770
And I just scored you
a $2,000 chair for 450,

220
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,730
which is insane.

221
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm not gonna spend
$450 on a chair.

222
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
It's not a chair.

223
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,220
It's an investment
in your future self.

224
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,640
How much
that building cost you?

225
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,390
It was a lot more than I had.

226
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,310
Why'd you buy it then?

227
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,770
You're good.

228
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,770
- Hi.
- Hi. Inmate's name?

229
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,560
It's, uh, Clyde Youens.

230
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,310
Y-O-U-E-N-S.

231
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm sorry, he's deceased.

232
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,770
What?

233
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,890
There was an incident.
He didn't survive.

234
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,640
W--when?

235
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,100
Tuesday.

236
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,270
Next of kin was contacted
and the body was claimed.

237
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,270
Next.

238
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,600
- Hi.
- Hey.

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,350
Here for Paddy, 4629...

240
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,850
They're kicking him out
of the hospital in the morning.

241
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,180
And how is
this my problem, huh?

242
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,350
He fell.
I didn't push him.

243
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,430
He worked six hours;
he'll get his 150 bucks

244
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,020
when the job is done
and I get paid.

245
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,470
That's how this works.

246
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,680
We're not leaving this spot

247
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
until we get out our money.

248
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Whatever!

249
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,930
Sorry to bother you.

250
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,810
Do you mind if my kids
use your bathroom?

251
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,430
Sure.

252
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,930
We love you, Ian!

253
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,930
There he is.
Look, it's Ian.

254
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,810
- Ian! Ian!
- Can you come to our...

255
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,520
- What's up, guys?
- My boyfriend is gonna flip.

256
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,770
He can't stop talking about you.

257
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,850
Could you, uh,
record a message for him?

258
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,220
His name's Nico James.

259
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,140
Mr. Gallagher,
hi, I'm Reverend Murphy.

260
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,020
I'm a pastor at
Trinity and Life Evangelical--

261
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,140
Oh, we don't need
any more ministers,

262
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,470
but if you want to give money,
that'd be cool--

263
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,930
I'm not here for me.

264
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,390
Some folks from my church
wanted to meet you.

265
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,020
This is Alice.

266
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,470
Her parents put her through
conversion therapy twice.

267
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,930
She has something for you.

268
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,930
Go on, honey.

269
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,640
Wow.

270
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,020
That, uh, tha--

271
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,220
you drew this?
Thank you.

272
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,350
Can you, like, heal people?

273
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,100
I'm a paramedic, so...

274
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,930
Well, when are you gonna
perform your next miracle?

275
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,810
Oh, no, I don't
perform miracles.

276
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,020
Do you--I'm sorry,
I only saw the one video.

277
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,060
- What is your ministry, again?
- I don't have one.

278
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,810
I just kind of show up

279
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,680
to these conversion things
and argue with assholes.

280
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,770
I... lead meetings at this
youth center if you guys want--

281
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,140
My boyfriend needs help.

282
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,310
Could you talk to him?

283
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,600
Oh, well, lookee here,
Mr. Popularity.

284
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,470
- Mr. Viral Sensation.
- Okay.

285
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,600
Mr. King of the Queens.

286
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Kind of hoping
they'll lose interest.

287
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,220
Yeah, well, there's more
and more of them every day.

288
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,100
They're blocking
the garage door.

289
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm gonna have to
park the ambulance

290
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,930
outside by the curb
so I don't accidentally

291
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,980
run somebody over.

292
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,810
What do they even want?

293
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,850
Uh--

294
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,560
Guess they just want
to be seen by...

295
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,430
someone who sees 'em back.

296
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,470
Oh, please.

297
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,930
Looks to me like they want to
douse you in syrup

298
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,520
and slurp you up with a spoon.

299
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,140
Could be down for that.

300
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,140
That chair suits you.

301
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,810
Might be the first time
I bought something

302
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,850
I didn't actually need.

303
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,680
Beautiful, functional
everyday objects

304
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,100
should be affordable.

305
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,020
My idea of affordable is
looting the house

306
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,930
of the neighbor who just OD'd
so I don't gotta buy new shit.

307
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,180
I've got an old coffee maker
that needs a loving home.

308
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,810
Ooh.
Now you're talking.

309
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,100
Maybe I'll come by
your place later?

310
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,930
- Pick it up?
- I got plans tonight.

311
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,220
I'll drop it off tomorrow.

312
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,850
How long have they
been in there?

313
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,270
About 20 minutes.

314
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,850
Are they bathing?

315
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,680
I think they might be.

316
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,890
Why would they do that?

317
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,020
You think they're homeless?

318
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,270
Jesus, you startled me.

319
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,680
I didn't think
anybody else had keys.

320
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,060
I'm sorry, who are you?

321
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,770
Oh, I'm Lip.
Um.

322
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,140
Phillip Gallagher.

323
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,180
Who are you?

324
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,730
I'm--I'm Tabitha, his daughter.

325
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,850
I--um, are you a student?

326
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,220
No, I was.

327
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,060
I was helping him
after the accident.

328
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,770
Accident? I thought
he was arrested for a DUI.

329
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,100
You know what?
It's okay.

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,560
I don't even want to know.

331
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,020
Jesus Christ, this week.

332
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,470
You--you do know he's dead,
right?

333
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,730
What happened?

334
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,850
He had, uh, a seizure.

335
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,890
Alcohol withdrawal.
Hit his head.

336
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,270
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

337
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,520
There's a memorial service
tomorrow,

338
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,020
and the students are welcome
to say a few words if you like.

339
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,850
Oh, no one told me.

340
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,100
The school said
they sent out an email.

341
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,220
I-I-I'm sorry,
who are you again?

342
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,680
I picked up your dad...
from jail,

343
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,220
after the DUI.

344
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,520
I bought him groceries.
I--

345
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,270
Did he pay you?

346
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,020
No, he didn't pay me.

347
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,890
He...
covered the cost of my rehab.

348
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,310
And he got me an internship.

349
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,350
He-he tried to
convince the school

350
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,640
to revoke my expulsion.

351
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,270
He listened to me.
He...

352
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,140
listened to me about everything.

353
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,850
Well, glad you were
so well-parented by my dad.

354
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,100
Look, I-I have this covered.

355
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,810
You can leave your key
on the way out.

356
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,520
Thanks.

357
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,930
Sure.

358
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,520
Here you are, sir.

359
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,560
On the house.

360
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,640
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

361
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,810
Our elders are
a precious resource.

362
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,430
Thanks for staying alive.

363
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,180
I'll drink to that.

364

368
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,850
Wow.
What a knockout.

369
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,430
Good evening, ma'am.

370
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,730
May I procure you a cocktail?

371
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,980
Vodka.

372
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,180
Your profile was, uh,

373
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
quite provocative.

374
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,520
You were an escort
for a time, weren't you?

375
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,930
Hand whore.

376
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,680
Occasional
cocksucking and fucking.

377
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,850
What is your name?

378
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,520
- Gerald.
- "Gerald."

379
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,020
Sounds like bald man
drowning in hot soup.

380
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,180
Huh?

381
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,980
There you are, m'lady.

382
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,350
What would it run me if, uh,

383
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,220
you and I were to take
a walk out to my vehicle

384
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,680
and you were to
keep me company for 30 minutes?

385
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,680
$900,000.

386
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,390
Forty bucks.

387
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,810
And you take off your shoes
so I don't get any...

388
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,220
dirt on my seat.

389
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,140

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,770

392
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,890
Could've gone worse.

393
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,430
Don't know how.

394
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,810
It sucks when people use God as
an excuse for their own hatred,

395
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,890
and when it's your family,
it's the worst.

396
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,100
Look,

397
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,810
I know you don't
want to hurt your parents,

398
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,220
but sometimes they forget.

399
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,930
God creates us all
in his own image.

400
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,770
We gotta jog their memory.

401
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,180
If they believe that God hates
the same people as they do,

402
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,470
well, they're creating God
in their image.

403
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,270
That's right. That's right.

404
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,520
We all have a Holy Spirit.

405
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,180
We're all holy.

406
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,270
We're all divine...

407
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,600
Jesus, listen to that.

408
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,100
Oh, I know.
He's like a prophet.

409
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,520
And he's super hot too.

410
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,810
Like hot gay Jesus.

411
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,100
"Hot gay Jesus."

412
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,430
Bet we can make money
off of that.

413
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,770
How?

414
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,060
Ring the right bell
for the right causes,

415
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,020
the guilt-ridden
pry open their wallets.

416
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
It's Pavlovian.

417
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,140
Righteousness
is very marketable.

418
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,270
What's that all about?

419
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,640
Uh, just a queer
religious rebellion

420
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,310
led by your gay brother.
No biggie.

421
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,810
We all have
the Trinity inside of us.

422
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,470
I'd like to read a passage
from Romans now.

423
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,060
- Who are we hiding from?
- The union workers.

424
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,220
We gotta wait till
they leave for the night.

425
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,100
- How do we get paid?
- Cash.

426
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,850
We meet tomorrow, location TBA,

427
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,640
and they'll text the address.

428
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,730
My God.
This is so exciting.

429
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,930
Everybody, let's go, let's go.

430
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
OMG.
That was amazing.

431
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,930
Your brother is,
like, everything.

432
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,520
And they all ate my popovers.

433
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
God, I am really fucking happy.

434
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,350
- Are you?
- Yeah.

435
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,180
But are you, like,
really fucking happy

436
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,350
or are you just, like, meh?

437
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,020
I'm really fuckin' happy.

438
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,430
Yay.

439
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,640
- Hey, what you writing?
- A list.

440
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,770
"Swiss Army knife, stun gun,

441
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,180
retractable night stick,"
what-what is this shit?

442
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,430
List for school.
Give it back.

443
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,520
Wait, military school?

444
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,270
You said that
you weren't going back.

445
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,850
We're engaged!

446
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,680
I never said
I wasn't going back.

447
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,100
I've been packing my duffel bag
all week.

448
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,640
I guess I've been just too busy

450
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,520
buying your fuckin' family shit

451
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,850
and-and making
a fucking life for us.

452
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,310
Meanwhile, you've just
been shitting all over it.

453
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,770
Why did we even bother
getting engaged?

454
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,470
Why did I fucking
cut myself for you?

455
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,520
We'll
make it work; you'll come visit.

456
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,930
- We'll scout motels.
- Motels?

457
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,390
What am I, a prostitute?

458
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,270
No, I never said that!

459
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,560
You are so
full of shit, Carl!

460
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,020
- You don't even love me!
- Of course I love you!

461
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,390
Well,
you don't love me enough!

462
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,220
Then how do I
prove it to you?

463
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,980
Um, you're not supposed to ask

464
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,470
how you prove to love somebody,
you should just prove it.

465
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,520
Well, obviously
it's not fuckin' enough.

466
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,680
Uh, yeah,
because your real goal is

467
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,810
to go back to military school.

468
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,930
Of course that doesn't
make me think that you love me!

469
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,520
I want you to stay here

470
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,020
and be my husband!

471
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,640
Reverend Murph,

472
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,270
this is my sister Fiona.

473
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,470
- Pleasure.
- Hi.

474
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,770
I'm super impressed, dude.

475
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,680
The only way I can
get that many people

476
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,520
is if I offer free pizza.

477
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,600
No, it's just
'cause of that video.

478
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,220
No.
You got something, man.

479
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,770
Bunch of folks
who couldn't make it

480
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,350
already messaged me
about the next one.

481
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,220
Oh, I definitely can't
fit more people in here

482
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,730
than I did tonight.

483
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,770
Would you feel weird
about using our parish hall?

484
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,980
No pressure.

485
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,020
Just shoot me a text
when you decide,

486
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,770
I'll send you the address.

487
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,390
Thanks for the beer.

488
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,350
How's the new place?

489
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,140
Small.
Quiet.

490
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,810
- I bought a chair.
- Oh.

491
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,730
Your, uh, fellowship thing

492
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,560
seems to be doing well.

493
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,600
First Gallagher
to become famous for something

494
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,470
other than larceny or assault.

495
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,770
Ha, yeah.

496
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,140
It's, uh...

497
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,430
it's getting pretty out of hand.

498
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,310
I got people showing up
at my home,

499
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,390
church place, work.

500
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,560
I had to shut down
my Facebook page.

501
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,930
So why not quit
if you hate it so much?

502
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,020
I don't.

503
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,520
Just...trying to manage it.

504
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,930
She's back to flipping
out again about military school.

505
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,770
Says I can't go
'cause we're engaged.

506
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,850
Wait, you're actually engaged?

507
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,180
- I thought that was a joke.
- Don't marry her.

508
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,680
I can't lose her.

509
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,020
She's fun, hot,

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,350
rich, hot.

511
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,680
She loves me.

512
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,020
No one's ever
loved me this hard.

513
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,770
Do not marry her, okay?

514
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,850
She is a fucking psycho.

515
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,140
Marry her.

516
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,470
Hear me and heed me.

517
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,350
Do not let that frothing piece
of lady meat out of your sight.

518
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,100
She has a trust fund.

519
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,640
Get joint checking.

520
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,770
And whatever you do,
do not sign a prenup.

521
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,850
Hey.

522
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,770
It's Gay Jesus.

523
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,310
Can I have this?

524
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Hey!
Scabs!

525
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,060
- Go, go!
- Fuckin' run!

526
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,640
- Oh, fuck!
- Get back here!

527
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,770
Debbie!
Debbie, run!

528
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,060
Come here, you motherfucker!

529
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,350
Hey!

530
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,930
How ya feeling?

531
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,060
Like shit.

532
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,810
Sorry to hear that.

533
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,560
Your boss emailed me.

534
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,020
He finished the job,
sent me an invoice.

535
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,470
Probably want to track
him down so you can get paid.

536
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,430
Thanks for the heads up.

537
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,810
Okay.
You did really well last night.

538
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,930
However, we need
to tone down the rage a little.

539
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,850
You're not gonna get anywhere
if your date thinks

540
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,310
you want to murder him
the second he ties the knot.

541
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,180
- What if I do?
- Great question.

542
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,310
Which brings us to Part A
of our plan: etiquette.

543
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,470
Rich guys are old school.

544
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,850
They want a lady to be a lady.

545
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,100
A man wants to feel powerful.

546
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,470
Really powerful.

547
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,390
So let him dominate
the conversation.

548
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,730
Act like he's
totally fascinating.

549
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,180
I cannot do this.

550
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
Okay, this brings us
to Part B of our plan.

551
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,180
This is a tiny microphone.
Attach it to your shirt.

552
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,100
This is a tiny earpiece.
Put this in your ear.

553
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,390
Oh, come on, Svet.
You're Russian.

554
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,560
This is spy shit.
It's in your DNA.

555
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,890
Testing, testing.
Can you hear me?

556
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,180
You are right there.

557
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,930
I meant in the thingy.

558
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,140
Can you hear me?

559
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes.

560
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,220
Okay.
Do everything I say.

561
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,980
Scratch your nose.

562
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,730
Tuck your hair behind your ear.

563
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,770
Excellent.

564
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,180
Say, "Kevin Ball
has a sexy voice."

565
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,220
Why should I lie?

566
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,980
Say it.

567
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,430
Kevin Ball has a sexy voice.

568
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,890
Mmm.

569
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,980
What the fuck was that
last night?

570
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,060
I never said it was risk-free.

571
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,520
You also never said

572
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,310
we'd be running for our lives.

573
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,220
Why'd they hire us instead
of hiring their own guys?

574
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,600
Scabs are non-union.

575
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,680
Union guys get overtime,
pension, health.

576
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,770
So we're screwing over a union
we want to join someday?

577
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,600
If we don't take the work,
someone else will.

578
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,020
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

579
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,640
I'm never being a scab again.

580
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,180
Hey, just got a tip
for another gig.

581
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,270
Pays even more.

582
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,680
Five hundred.

583
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,810
I'm in.

584
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,100
Hi.

585
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,640
What you got there?

586
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,980
Free appliance.

587
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Works great if you're patient.

588
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,020
Is that a shitty,
old percolator?

589
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,060
It's Italian.
It's art.

590
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,930
Hey.

591
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,980
What are you guys
still doing here?

592
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,890
We can't leave.

593
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,430
Rodney won't
fit in the car with his leg.

594
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,470
Plus, our AC is busted.

595
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,180
You know anybody with an SUV?

596
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,850
Or I can take you somewhere.
Where you headed?

597
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,270
Is there, uh, some family
you can stay with

598
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,350
or maybe an old neighbor?

599
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,680
Oh, we've been looking
into some charity housing,

600
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,980
but they all have a wait list.

601
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,100
I know someone
who works with local shelters.

602
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,680
I can ask him if he maybe knows
a place that could take you.

603
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,310
- Wow, you'd do that?
- Sure.

604
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,020
Hey.

605
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,350
What the fuck?

606
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,020
Hey, baby.

607
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,890
You cut up all my uniforms?

608
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,810
Well, I weighed out
the pros and cons,

609
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,470
and I made a decision
for our family.

610
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,270
I think that it's
better for everyone

611
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,600
that you don't
go back to school.

612
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,560
We have a wedding to plan.

613
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,060
Kassidi.

614
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,730
Don't say my name like that.

615
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,560
- Kassidi--
- Do not

616
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,470
say my name like that,
I mean it, Carl.

617
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,850
Kassidi, this is not a joke!

618
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,890
I am going back
to military school.

619
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,430
I hate you!

620
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,470
Hey!

621
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,020
Fuck. Wait!

622
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
You can't leave me! I'll die!

623
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,640
Hey, what the fuck!
You're not gonna die!

624
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,220
We're gonna see each other
like once a week!

625
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,390
- I can't!
- Open up the door!

626
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,680
- I need you!
- What the fuck? You kidding me?

627
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,100
This engagement
is bullshit!

628
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,890
What?
What the fuck?

629
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,350
I paid like 100 bucks for that!

630
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,140
- Fuck you!
- Come on!

631
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,850
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

632
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,770
Oh, my God!
What do you want me to do?

633
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,930
Marry me before you leave,
dumbass.

634
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,310
You love me, right?

635
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,930
Then what's
the point in waiting?

636
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,180
Okay, fine.

637
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
- Today?
- Yeah, sure.

638

645
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,270
Where's Ian?

646
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,980
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

647
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,640
Fuck.

648
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,140
He was supposed to be here
like an hour ago to help set up.

649
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,390
Doing this thing about
careers in emergency services

650
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,430
for our Life Skills program.

651
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,810
Shit-ton of people signed
because of him, but...

652
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,310
whatever.

653
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,600
What's up?

654
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,140
Uh, one of the guys

655
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,180
who was working on my roof
got hurt.

656
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,890
He's gonna be out of work
for a few months,

657
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,140
and his family's
living out of a car.

658
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,980
I was wondering if you might
know any

659
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,810
family shelters
that could take him?

660
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,310
Um, I might, actually.
Follow me.

661
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,100
So, uh, what's your take
on this whole, uh,

662
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,850
Ian ambushing
all those ministers?

663
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,470
Uh,

664
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,100
not really sure
what to make of it.

665
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Ah, yeah.

666
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,560
I mean, part of me is psyched

667
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,310
that he's helping people, but

668
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,520
another part is, I don't know,

669
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,850
kind of bummed that I have to
crowbar my way into his life

670
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,930
if I want to see him.

671
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,850
Oh.

672
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,730
This place is decent.

673
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,470
I'll call over and
get everything squared away

674
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,470
and let you know.

675
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,680
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

676
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,520
And, hey, if you see Ian,
please...

677
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,430
- Yes.
- Thank you.

678
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,470
Will do.

679
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,390
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

680
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,680
The fuck is this, Frank?

681
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,180
Son, I don't think
I've articulated

682
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,100
how impressed I am
with your recent endeavors.

683
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,180
I knew you were talented,
but, uh...

684
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,100
"The Church of Gay Jesus."
Is this a jumbo shirt?

685
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,560
To reach the masses,

686
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,850
you've got to
embrace merchandising

687
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,220
to take your brand
to the next level.

688
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,060
Uh, how about T-shirts
proudly displaying your message?

689
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,560
Well, I-I don't have a church.

690
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,890
And I'm not fuckin' Jesus.

691
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,980
Tongue in cheek, son.

692
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,350
When you repurpose
a-an iconic logo

693
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,560
for the-the sake of kitsch,

694
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,390
you present an ironic critique
of American consumerism.

695
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,310
And if that logo

696
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,560
just happens to resemble a...

697
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,470
giant, throbbing penis,

698
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,180
what could be
more counterculture?

699
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,140
It looks like a hot dog.
And the lettering sucks.

700
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,060
Revolutions don't come
wrapped in a cute ribbon.

701
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,850
You want to bring down
power structures?

702
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,890
You want to get
in the face of people

703
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,140
who are peddling
corroded ideals?

704
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,600
You need a uniform
that screams authenticity.

705
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,100
We didn't pay
Chinese factory orphans

706
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,770
three cents an hour
to make these.

707
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,270
No, this is our living room.

708
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,100
Our hands.
Our sweat.

709
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,770
Talk about grassroots.

710
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,930
I have a meeting tonight at
Trinity and Life Evangelical.

711
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,430
You can hawk
your shit there, but

712
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,100
everything you make
has to go to Trevor's kids.

713
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,140
Oh, come on!
This is my retirement fund.

714
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,930
Twenty percent.

715
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,890
Thirty?

716
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,180
Okay, 95 percent,
and we appreciate your business.

717
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,140
And this has been
a rough few years.

718
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,810
Needless to say,
it hasn't been that easy

719
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,980
being around my dad.

720
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,730
But my favorite memory of him

721
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,390
is this thing that he would do.

722
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,100
So he would be in his office,

723
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,270
hunched over paperwork,
and I'd knock.

724
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,310
And he'd look up, confused.

725
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,980
And then, boom.

726
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,430
It's the--the biggest,
warmest smile.

727
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,140
That is the version of my dad
that I'm going to remember.

728
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,350
And I'm grateful
for every moment

729
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,350
that I had with him

730
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,100
when he was just him.

731
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,390
You hear about these professors
who go the extra mile

732
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,060
to help a student.

733
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,520
But what Youens did for me
went above and beyond that.

734
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,100
Got me my first real job.

735
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,850
Listened to me
bitch about my family.

736
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,930
He was there for me.

737
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,350
He got me internships,

738
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,180
wrote dozens of letters
of recommendation,

739
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,020
personally called
the dean at Carnegie Mellon

740
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,350
to get me into the
robotics doctoral program.

741
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,350
Told me once,
he wished he'd been a poet.

742
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,180
And he showed me something
he'd written.

743
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,730
Said I was the only person

744
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,980
he trusted enough to show.

745
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,520
That poem was awful.

746
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,430
And no matter how busy he was,

747
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,520
Youens always
made time to talk to me.

748
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,020
He helped me with
whatever I needed,

749
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,350
listen, offer advice,
wise counsel.

750
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,180
Day or night,
it didn't matter,

751
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,100
when you called or
knocked on his door,

752
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,600
he always answered.

753
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,310
Always.

754
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,220
♪ You could ever
really love me... ♪

755
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,890
He was like a father to me.

756
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,930
I honestly don't know
where I'd be without him today.

757
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:26,180
♪ It's in your head... ♪

758
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,680
He invested his
time and energy to make sure

759
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,890
I didn't become a total fuck-up.

760
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,100
He didn't have to.

761
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,180
I'm still not sure why he did.

762
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,390
Okay.
My friend found you a place.

763
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,890
It's a family shelter.

764
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,390
They'll have a room for you
in two days.

765
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,850
Girls, we've got
a place to live.

766
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,890
They can take us
in two days, you said?

767
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,520
Mm-hmm.

768
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,220
Oh, we've got the tarp
if it rains again.

769
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,390
Why don't you just
stay here for two nights?

770
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,100
Really?

771
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,470
Yeah.
Not a problem.

772
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,600
I'll just, uh,
I'll crash at my old place.

773
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,930
Oh, my God, Fiona.

774
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,100
Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

775
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,680
We should go get a blanket
and a bottle of champagne,

776
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,060
go in the park, and lay
in the grass as man and wife,

777
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,810
and let the moon and the stars
bless our union.

778
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,980
Cute!

779
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,640
103.

780
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,140
Oh!

781
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,890
Yay!
That's us.

782
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay, come on.

783
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,520
All set.

784
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,310
Your marriage license is valid
for 60 days in Cook County only.

785
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,930
There's a one-day waiting period

786
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,640
before the license
becomes effective.

787
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,020
Wait.
So we can't get married today?

788
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,020
You can get married
at this exact time tomorrow.

789
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,810
What the fuck?
This sucks.

790
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,890
I look like a fucking
First Lady.

791
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,980
Here.

792
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,100
Go cross your legs

793
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,730
and pretend to be captivated.

794
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,520
Smokey to Bobcat.

795
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,350
Do you hear me?
Over.

796
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,470
What are you guys up to?

797
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,600
We're trying to get Svetlana
married off to a rich dude.

798
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,180
So...

799
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
you just gave 'em your place,
just like that?

800
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,430
What else was I supposed to do?

801
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,180
Man, I was really digging
my quiet mornings

802
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,140
away from Gallagher chaos.

803
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,850
And it's extra bad right now

804
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,310
'cause of Ian's
gay messiah shit.

805
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,390
He should read
Pope Leo the 13th's

806
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,060
encyclical on property rights.

807
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,770
I'll pass it on.

808
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,770
You know, whiskey is actually

809
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,350
clear when it
comes off the still.

810
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,430
It gets the caramel color
from the barrel--

811
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,270
You know, I'm just--
I'm just gonna say this.

812
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,730
Sometimes it feels like

813
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,890
it doesn't even matter
that I'm sitting here.

814
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,810
I know all the places
you've lived.

815
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,850
I know all the languages
you speak.

816
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,350
I've met your exes,
your baby mamas, your spawn.

817
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,100
And yet, you have never asked
one question about me.

818
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,430
Did you know that I became

819
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,020
legal guardian
of my siblings when I was 23?

820
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,600
Or that I dropped out
of high school,

821
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,680
but then I got back
and I got my GED?

822
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,390
Yes, actually, I did.

823
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,350
And I know you did it
to convince your genius brother

824
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,180
who's a recovering alcoholic
to stay in college.

825
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,560
I know you got left at
the altar by your junkie fiancé

826
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,270
with whom you were
very much in love.

827
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,140
- How?
- 'Cause I ask around.

828
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,640
There's some other stuff I know.

829
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,350
You're fiercely protective
of your family.

830
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,930
You're generous.

831
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,980
Like today, for example,

832
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,680
you gave your apartment
to a homeless family.

833
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,100
You are so very much yourself.

834
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,430
You don't even have to try.

835
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,520
And frankly, you scare
the fuckin' shit out of me.

836
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,770
It's him.
It's him.

837
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,390
Svet, Svet.

838
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,140
The buzzard is in the tuba.
The buzzard is in the tuba.

839
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,640
- The what?
- I have no idea.

840
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,730
I've never done this before.

841
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,020
What's she saying?

842
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,470
I can't hear anything.

843
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,310
I can't hear anything.
We never tested the microphone.

844
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,560
All right, well,
she needs to relax.

845
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,390
Tell her to lean in a little.

846
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,270
Svetlana, lean in a little.

847
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,350
Too far.
Too Far.

848
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,060
Too far.
Too far.

849
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,180
Take a sip of your drink.

850
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,640
Sip, not gulp.

851
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,100
Tell her to-to ask him
about something.

852
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,180
All right.
All right.

853
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
All right, Svet.

854
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,520
Ask him about his mother.

855
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,980
No, not his mother.

856
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,390
Ask him about
his favorite sports teams.

857
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,640
Allergies--
what the hell

858
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,810
do people talk about on dates?

859
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,520
Did she just drop
her earpiece in her drink?

860
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,470
Oh, no.

861
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,640
She's gonna grab his cock,
isn't she?

862
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,430
Mm-hmm.
Called that one.

863
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,890
T-shirts!

864
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,390
Each garment has been worn
by the man himself.

865
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,430
- And blessed!
- T-shirts.

866
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,220
$50 suggested donation.

867
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,640
The white one?
Okay. Thank you.

868
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,060
T-shirts, T-shirts.

869
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,020
T-shirts,
get your T-shirts here!

870
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,730
Nice turnout.

871
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,220
Only half of them are regulars.

872
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,680
You did great.

873
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,350
I just sat there while
people talked about

874
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,770
how horribly
they'd been treated,

875
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,770
by family, co-workers...

876
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,730
Can you please sign this,
please?

877
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,350
- ...strangers.
- Thank you.

878
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,390
Sometimes that's all they need.

879
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,180
Tomorrow's our weekly service...

880
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,470
- Thanks so much.
- ...where we invite speakers

881
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,140
to come up
and discuss how to turn

882
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,390
personal pain into
positive action.

883
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,180
We call it
"A Night of Good Grief."

884
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,470
The name is silly,
but the idea isn't.

885
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,980
You up for it?

886
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,850
Well...

887
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,770
I don't...know what to say
that hasn't already been said.

888
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,730
You say it again.

889
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,180
It can't be said enough,
not until queer kids

890
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,100
stop being told there's
something wrong with them.

891
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,730
It was so worth it.

Hey.

903
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,020
- Hm?
- Hey.

904
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,350
We need to talk.

905
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,430
What?
What?

906
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,640
You gotta promise
not to freak out.

907
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,310
I promise.

908
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,020
Okay.
First of all.

909
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,100
You're, like, the best thing
that's ever happened to me

910
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,470
like, by like a bazillion.

911
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,810
But when we were
at the clerk's office,

912
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,220
and she said we had to wait...

913
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,060
I was relieved.

914
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,270
A little.

915
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,520
'Cause I feel like
we rushed into this.

916
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,390
And I totally want you
to be my wife,

917
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,560
my little sweetie boo.

918
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,520
Would you hate me

919
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,470
if we stayed engaged
a teeny bit longer?

920
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,560
Until we're both

921
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,930
no doubt, positively sure
we're ready?

922
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,140
I could never hate you.

923
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,640
- For real?
- Yeah.

924
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,600
And thank you
for being honest with me.

925
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,270
That's, like, super important
for a healthy marriage.

926
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,270
You are awesome.

927
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,600
I love you.

928
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,850
Mm, I love you too.

929
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,390
Mm.

930
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,140
Okay, okay.

931
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,350
Okay, now.

932
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,730
You're getting pretty good
at that.

933
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,520
Fourth time's the charm.

934
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,930
Well,

935
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,390
two left.

936
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,770
Better hope you tire out soon.

937
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,100
Do you think
I'm the only person on Earth

938
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,640
who doesn't want your babies?

939
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,430
I don't want my babies.

940
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,180
That's why I keep
letting other people have them.

941
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,180
I dig this
candid version of you.

942
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,470
Now...ask me something
about myself.

943
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,640
What's the one thing
about Fiona Gallagher

944
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,600
that might surprise me?

945
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,640
That's a tough one.

946
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,890
You seem to have me
all figured out.

947
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,850
That's my gift.

948
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,020
How about...

949
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,810
I think I might not
want to have kids.

950
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,930
But you're a woman.
How is that possible?

951
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,180
Well, my siblings are my kids.

952
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,640
It's Nessa.

953
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,890
Mm-hmm.

954
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,180
I'm supposed to be analyzing

955
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,850
your skills and reporting back.

956
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,270
And how am I doing so far?

957
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,930
Overall positive.

958
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,180
Happy to give you more data.

959
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,520
Hi.
Can I call you back later?

960
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,520
You're fucking kidding me.

961
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,770
- Thanks for the heads up.
- Any time.

962
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,060
FYI, they just dragged in two
sleeping bags and a pull-up bar.

963
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,430
Hello?

964
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,390
- ...uh-huh.
- Hi.

965
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,520
Now, everyone,
this is the lady

966
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,770
who has been helping us.

967
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,730
This is, uh, my sister,

968
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,890
my cousin, his wife,
and their son.

969
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,680
What's going on?

970
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,980
They're paying us to crash here

971
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,730
so we'll have some cash
for the shelter.

972
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,020
Oh, fuck!
My chair!

973
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,470
Ooh, sorry about that.

974
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,640
Good thing
it's an old chair, right?

975
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,730
Hey.
Sorry about last night.

976
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,270
Something came up last minute,
and I'm trying

977
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,270
to juggle everything
but it's snowballing and--

978
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,890
and I--

979
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,430
Hey.

980
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,020
- Yeah.
- It's snowballing.

981
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,100
I had like 40 people show up
to this meeting yesterday.

982
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,680
Yeah, and I had 50 kids show up

983
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,060
to a career symposium
about being a paramedic.

984
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,470
But...I guess since yours
is about God, you win, right?

985
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,640
- Hey, hey, Ian.
- One second, guys.

986
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,270
I'm helping people in need,
same as you.

987
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,390
Are you saying it's only cool
when it's your idea?

988
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,470
I don't ask a lot of you.

989
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,930
This was one thing
that was important to me.

990
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,180
You know, maybe
what you're doing is worth

991
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,930
pissing off the people
that care about you.

992
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,060
That's fine.

993
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,640
But don't insult me

994
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,770
by acting like
it's not happening.

995
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,520
Hi.

996
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,890
You didn't speak at the service.

997
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,600
Uh, I was gonna, but...

998
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,140
everything I was gonna say
was already said.

999
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,020
Sorry for your loss.

1000
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,020
Yeah, I lost him
a long time ago.

1001
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,470
Still doesn't make it easy.

1002
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,390
He was a good dad,
just, um,

1003
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,680
not to me.

1004
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,390
I guess it's easier to be

1005
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,140
kind to somebody
who looks up to you.

1006
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,980
Hey, um,

1007
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,390
I found this
going through his paperwork.

1008
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,770
It's a draft
of a recommendation letter.

1009
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,640
Thought you might want it.

1010
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,020
You know, in all of
his years of teaching,

1011
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,560
I never heard him
talk about a student like that.

1012
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,060
He says he's amazed
by your mind.

1013
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,100
You don't want to keep it?

1014
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,930
Oh, I think I'm too angry
to keep it.

1015
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,520
Kass?

1016
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,140
Where you at?

1017
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,640
♪ One, two, three, four,
blowing down my door ♪

1018
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,020
- ♪ Five, six, seven, eight... ♪
- Babe?

1019
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,180
Kass!

1020
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,810
Oh!

1021
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,140
You saved my life!

1022
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,980
- You really do love me!
- Yeah.

1023
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,020
What time is it?

1024
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,470
Like 4:00?

1025
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,220
The County Clerk's office
is open til 5:00.

1026
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,890
♪ Nothing's gonna
stop me now ♪

1027
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,810
That your new chair?

1028
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,310
Why's it over here?

1029
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,770
So that the pile of assholes who
are squatting in my apartment

1030
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,270
won't destroy it.

1031
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,220
Who aren't actually assholes.

1032
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,560
They're just poor and broke

1033
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,020
and taking advantage of the
situation.

1034
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,350
Just like I've done
100 times.

1035
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,350
And they aren't squatting.

1036
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,810
I told them
that they could stay there.

1037
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:30,850
Did you just get this pic
from Kassidi?

1038
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,020
Yeah.

1039
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,680
"Birth, marriage, death."

1040
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,180
What the hell is that?

1041
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,810
- I think they got hitched.
- What?

1042
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,310
Yeah, I told him not to.

1043
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:45,390
Not legally, right?
She's, like, 15.

1044
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,060
Hey.

1045
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,220
Can I get a ride
to this church?

1046
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,890
Supposed to speak
at this thing, and I don't know.

1047
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,890
Kinda scared shitless.
I mean...

1048
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,730
I don't do speeches.

1049
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,390
So don't do it.

1050
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,680
Sorta feel like I have to.

1051
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,890
Everyone thinks
that I have something to say.

1052
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,890
What if I don't?

1053
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,180
When they're gone, they're gone,
folks, so don't miss out.

1054
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,470
All profits go to help
gays across the planet.

1055
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,350
Can you give me just one second?

1056
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,730
Are we really gonna give
all of our money to Ian?

1057
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,730
No, of course not.

1058
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,310
Thank you so much for waiting.
Gay Jesus loves and blesses you.

1059
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,520
Get your T-shirts here!
Don't miss out, folks.

1060
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,140
We're runnin' out.
T-shirts.

1061
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,770
Oh, shit.
No wonder you're nervous.

1062
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,180
Did you know that all these
people were gonna be here?

1063
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,060
- No.
- Hey.

1064
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,560
They all came for you.

1065
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,600
Isn't this amazing?

1066
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,430
So I just wanna start out
by saying that I'm no hero.

1067
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,470
I'm just a guy
who keeps showing up

1068
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,100
to these anti-gay churches
and hearing shit like,

1069
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,680
"God created man and woman.

1070
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,470
You either look
like a man or a woman.

1071
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,890
Don't...bring us
any of your other shit."

1072
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,520
So they're essentially saying,

1073
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,890
"Don't make me work too hard

1074
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,930
to see you on your own terms,"
right?

1075
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,770
But we have the God-given right
to be who we are.

1076
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,390
Not who others want us to be.

1077
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,350
So when they say shit like,

1078
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,680
"Don't use fake words
like 'nonbinary'

1079
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,020
or 'gender-fluid,'
'cis-whatever,'" it's like...

1080
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,310
Those are my terms, bitch.

1081
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,220
Mm-hmm, yep.

1082
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,100
Mm-hmm.

1083
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:34,180
Which means we have to be
so big,

1084
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,560
so noisy...

1085
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,770
that there's nowhere else
to look.

1086
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,390
And we do it in God's name
because...

1087
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,890
Because God hates haters.

1088
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,310
I spotted 12 safety violations.

1089
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,980
No wonder they pay
so much.

1090
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,680
I think I'm gonna bail.

1091
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,270
I gotta stick it out.
I need the cash.

1092
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,430
Mm-hmm.

1093
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,680
Hey, could you grab me
a clip light?

1094
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,930
Can barely see anything
I'm doing.

1095
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,060
Okay.

1096
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,930
Debbie!

1097
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,060
Call 911!

1098
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,390
Hi.

1099
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,850
This fucking day, man.

1100
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,730
Find Svetlana a man?

1101
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,980
No, she grabbed
the guy's cock.

1102
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,470
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

1103
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,980
Not taking her home
to meet Mom.

1104
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,470
Where you coming from?

1105
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,220
Church.

1106
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,730
Ian has a cult.

1107
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,020
- A what?
- Yeah.

1108
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,140
They think he's Gay Jesus.

1109
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,390
Looking for Fiona Gallagher.

1110
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,560
That's me.

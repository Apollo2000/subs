00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,316
God, it stinks in here.

164
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,784
Oh, sorry.
There's a shirt I need.

165
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,152
Fiona!

166
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,055
We need to go if we're going
to get a ride to the club.

167
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,456
Hey, five minutes.
Look at me.

168
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,091
No, this has got
to go back tomorrow.

169
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:14,761
I'll put it back on later.
I have a tag gun at home.

170
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,462
What? From when I worked at T.
J.Maxx.

171
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,530
Let's go.

172
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,232
Hot dogs downstairs.
Nachos, too.

173
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,234
Have fun.
Bye, Lip!

174
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,400
Hey, Veronica.

175
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,207
Hey.

176
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,009
Hey.

00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,326

00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:37,394
My purse!

188
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,296

00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:52,409

00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:55,913
Hey! Assholes!

193
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,049
Ah, sorry.

194
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,718
That was fucking incredible.

195
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,621
Truly, honestly, one of the most
heroic things I've ever seen.

196
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,189
Did you see him?

197
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,191
Stupid, but, man, heroic.

198
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:10,093
Uh, Steve.

199
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:11,361
Uh, my name is Steve.

200
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:12,796
Uh, I was...

201
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,032
going to offer to buy
you a drink anyway.

202
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,267
Oh. She'll take a drink.

203
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,037
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

204
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:21,705
Uh...
Are you serious?

205
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,674
Where's his stamp?
Can you believe this joker?

206
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,776
If you were doing your job,
he wouldn't have had to.

207
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,178
No stamp, no reentry.

208
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,813
Is he for real?

209
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,481
Fat prick.

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,551
Fine. You're all barred.

211
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,687
For what?
Uh, drugs.

212
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:37,955
What?

213
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,790
He probably let them get away
'cause he knows them.

214
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,725
Shut up, skank.
Watch your mouth.

215
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,493
Or you're going to do what?

216
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:44,528
Okay. Okay, forget it.

217
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,396
Please, forget
it. Okay.

218
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,398
Come on, let's...
let's get a cab.

219
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:49,566
Thank you.

220
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,834
Come on.

221
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,510
Oh!

222
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,913
Oh, shit!

223
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,917
Watch it!

224
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,520
Hey, fucker!

225
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:32,376
Got a hummer today.

226
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,979
What's the law on sex with pets?

227
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:38,715
From Karen Jackson.

228
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,283
No way.

229
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:41,451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:43,420
She got a "C" in physics.
Needed a "B."

231
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,959
Or you, uh...

232
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,727
you wouldn't have waited
this long to tell me.

233
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,329
Oh, five hours.

234
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,664
Okay, you're full of shit.

235
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:56,199
Fuck you.

236
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,537
You ever have a knob job?

237
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:03,674
Once or twice.

238
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,308
Oh. Wow.

239
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:08,845
I didn't hear you
rushing to tell me.

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,115
Yeah, well.

241
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,850
I mean, I thought...

242
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,852
we tell each other everything.

243
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,226
Unless...

244
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,400
You got sucked off by a guy.

245
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:35,906
For instance.

246
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,608
No way. Lake Forest...

247
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:39,609
Lake Forest is not Chicago.

248
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,580
I'm not kidding, Steve.

249
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,017
You are dead if he ever lays
eyes on you. And I mean dead.

250
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,785
I nearly peed myself
when you hit him.

251
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,821
Well, I did a little.

252
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,658
Hey.
Hi.

253
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,293
Wait, how many of you guys
live here?

254
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:57,661
Not me, I'm one down.

255
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,362
But the old guy next door
died in March, which I guess

256
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,898
technically makes us
next-door neighbors.

257
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,533
So you're a nurse, Veronica?
Used to be.

258
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,768
Lying bitch.

259
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,103
She worked housekeeping
at Cook County,

260
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:07,804
bedpans and shit-sheets.

261
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,408
Fine. But I was offered
a place in the nursing school.

262
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,276
Fine. But it never happened.

263
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:16,113
They fired her for selling
medical supplies on eBay.

264
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,581
Will you shut up?
We don't even know him.

265
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,483
Steve.
Carl.

266
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,151
Lip.

267
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,152
Debbie.

268
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,820
How you doing, Debbie?

269
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:24,588
Nice watch.

270
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:26,723
Oh, thanks. Panerai.

271
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:29,059
What'd that set you back,
about six bills?

272
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,228
Plus, Ian.

273
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:33,663
Hey.

274
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:36,500
Hey, Debbie, why do
they call him "Lip"?

275
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,068
His real name's Philip.

276
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,903
Yo, Veronica!

277
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,372
You got my keys?

278
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,774
What's going on here?

279
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,108
This is Steve.

280
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,611
Decked the bouncer at
Purgatory to defend my honor.

281
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:48,779
My honor.

282
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:50,113
Yeah? Which bouncer?

283
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,281
Jimmy Clifton.

284
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,350
Jimmy Cli...

285
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,718
Well, Jesus, man,

286
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,787
put it there!
Respect!

287
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,222
Guy just stands there,
doesn't really do anything.

288
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,791
Yeah, you'll be his
third conviction.

289
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:01,892
Huh?
Third or fourth.

290
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,593
Fourth. Yeah.

291
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:05,462
I mean, after that much
practice, you would think

292
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,464
the man would have manslaughter
down by now.

293
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,065
No more fuck-ups like last time,

294
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,667
like leaving his dad
still breathing.

295
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:11,802
His dad.

296
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,336
Yeah. Five years,

297
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:17,140
over an '87 Monte Carlo with
200,000 miles on the odometer.

298
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,109
Fucking Monte Carlo!

299
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,077
Okay, come on, time for bed.
Up the wooden hill. Come on.

300
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,079
- It's not even midnight yet!
- Aw, man.

301
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,748
Come on, come on, go!
Already? Shut up.

302
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,583
Move, move, move, move, come on.

303
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,986
Yeah, let me take
one last look at you,

304
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,154
while you're still alive!

305
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,224
Here.

306
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,164
What, that's his?

307
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,834
Yeah. Well,
company car.

308
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:46,169
What kind of company?

309
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,571
Internet startup?

310
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,442
Earning what?

311
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,844
Couple mil a year.

312
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:55,011
High school dropout.

313
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:58,782
Got a job as a janitor
in this small tech firm.

314
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,650
Within a year, he owned it.

315
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,152
Made his first billion by 20.

316
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:05,455
Two Jags, controlling
interest in the Red Wings,

317
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,991
10,000 employees
kissing his ass.

318
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,126
"Yes, boss. No, boss."

319
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,162
Why shouldn't he
ride around in style?

320
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,135
Oh, you just made that up.

321
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,873
What...?

322
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,140
Why do you do that?

323
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:25,442
Your face!

324
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:26,977
How is that even funny?
It's not even funny...

325
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,378
How the fuck would I
know how much he earns,

326
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,679
you twisted dumb prick?

327
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,481
I'm not a dumb prick.

328
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,351
Kevin, I just met
the guy an hour ago.

329
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:35,719
Take back "dumb prick"!

330
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:37,721
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica.

331
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,089
What's your pre-tax income?

332
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,557
Well, you sure didn't mind

333
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,658
watching him take his
shirt off, now, did you? Huh?

334
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,827
Not one bit.

335
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,328
In fact,
if you hadn't walked in,

336
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:49,032
Fiona and I were going to knock
him down and tag-team him.

337
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,935
Now I guess I'm stuck with you.

338
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:54,037
Hold on.

339
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,939
The Fiona tag-team,
is that an option?

340
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:00,610
'Cause you know, you can throw
that in the mix...

341
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:01,778
Anytime you like it, too...

342
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,179
I'll be doing it, all right...

343
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:14,457
All quiet up the "wooden hill"?

344
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,493
As quiet as it ever gets.

345
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:19,095
Straight answer: if I hadn't
busted my skull for you tonight,

346
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,530
would you have
looked at me twice?

347
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,466
Who's saying that
I looked twice?

348
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,468
Oh, you did, then.

349
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,309
I can't.

350
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:40,784
You know, 90% of the world's
problems are caused by

351
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:42,719
tiny words that come in pairs.

352
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,789
I mean, we're healthy and we're
happy, but when people ask,

353
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,991
we say...

354
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,993
"Not bad."

355
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,964
You know, the first time
that I saw you dancing,

356
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:58,268
about a month back at Crobar,

357
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:01,738
I was desperate
to buy you a drink.

358
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:06,743
You know, normally I'm shy,
so I told myself: I can't.

359
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:11,414
She won't. We wouldn't.

360
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,085
And then tonight
I see you there again.

361
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,288
All the indications
being that I'm getting...

362
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,092
...a second chance
to make a good impression.

363
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,127
Tell me to stop, and I'll stop.

364
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,175
Take it slower, slower,
slower, slower.

365
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,211
Slower.

366
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:46,449
Slower.

367
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,385
Slower.

368
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,491
Ah! Ah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

369
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,492
Almost... almost...

370
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:36,499
Fiona?
Shit. Shit, shit!

371
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,703
Fiona!

372
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:44,874
Shit.

373
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,777
Fiona, are you home?

374
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,586
Is Fiona in?

375
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,589
Uh... she's upstairs.

376
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,895
I'll go get her.

377
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:09,732
Hey.
Oh.

378
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,868
Yeah, uh, cops looking for you.

379
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,069
Stay here.

380
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,742
Liam.

381
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,945
Liam?

382
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:25,849
You... you...

383
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,555
I wouldn't put him
anywhere near a carpet

384
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,990
till his pants dry a bit.

385
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:34,991
Thanks, Tony.

386
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,094
See you, Fiona.

387
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,631
Who the hell is that?

388
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,435
My dad.

389
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:55,945
You just leave him
there all night?

390
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,981
He's never there when I get up.

391
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:05,021
So, uh, who's the little guy?

392
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,022
Liam?

393
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:09,025
Liam's my brother.

394
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,484
Rita.

395
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,256
Anne's school called.
She's sick.

396
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,891
Everything up to 204 is clean.

397
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,192
I should be back in
a couple of hours.

398
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:17,594
Raul won't care?

399
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,463
He smoked his lunch again.
He won't even know.

400
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:21,931
I'm making tamales tonight.

401
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:22,999
I'll drop off a dozen.

402
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.

403
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,335
Adios...

404
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,270
Oh, and take all the
toilet paper you need.

405
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:28,271
Okay.

406
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:30,807
You ready, big man?

407
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:32,842
Let's do it.
Come on. Here we go.

408
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:43,019
Kevin, did you miss me, dear?

409
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,387
A beer and a bump. And, uh...

410
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,089
Billy, you having one?

411
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,091
Have one!

412
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,761
Go away, Frank.

413
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:54,464
A pen, Mr. Beerkeep,
it is disability day.

414
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:58,101
Disability people haven't
caught up with you yet?

415
00:21:58,135 --> 00:21:59,802
I thought they had some guy

416
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:02,138
following you around
with a camera.

417
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:05,408
They can follow me around
all they want to,

418
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:09,145
but they have to actually
catch me doing something.

419
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,118
What's with the crowd?

420
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:16,586
Layoff at the Chrysler plant.

421
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,654
You see?

422
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:20,123
That's the problem with working.

423
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:23,059
Too much instability. Stress!

424
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:30,133
What the fuck is this?

425
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,169
What's left, after I settled
out last month's bar tab.

426
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,572
Better start a new one, then.

427
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:41,144
Oh! And a round for all
my friends from the UAW.

428
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,482
Wow. Really?

429
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,784
Fuck no.

430
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,542
Hi.

431
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:15,478
Wondering what your schedule's
like on Friday.

432
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:18,448
Uh, I've got a...

433
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,449
I've got a party.

434
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,450
Want a chaperone?

435
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,018
You're not eligible.

436
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,619
Right. Chick thing?

437
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,357
You're not that desperate.

438
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,425
Wanting to see you again
is desperate?

439
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,328
No, feeling like you have
to... that's desperate.

440
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:34,464
Come on, you can
get laid anywhere.

441
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,733
Oh, so I'm only here for a fuck?

442
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,001
Never crossed your mind?

443
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:41,504
Just when you think
you've collared your dream girl,

444
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:42,705
her incontinent,

445
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,841
alcoholic father appears,
wrecks everything,

446
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,476
and she's blaming you?

447
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,577
Your dream girl?

448
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,979
We had drunken sex
on my kitchen floor.

449
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,047
Pretty sad.

450
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,682
Quit pretending
you don't even know me.

451
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,350
You weren't that drunk.

452
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:56,486
Hey, it's Phillip.

453
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,488
Hey, it's, uh,
Dead Man Walking.

454
00:23:58,522 --> 00:23:59,989
Jimmy Clifton called today
looking for you.

455
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,057
No school?

456
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,192
Nah, I got some
teeth pulled today.

457
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:03,993
Wisdom teeth?

458
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,862
Sugar rot.
Ah.

459
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,163
You know, little known fact:

460
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,398
don't just chew your food
on one side,

461
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:09,665
'cause it can buckle your jaw,

462
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,033
which will buckle your hips
and affect your posture.

463
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:12,201
Oh, that's a fact?

464
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,603
Skeletal fact.
Lip.

465
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,606
Hey, um,

466
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,142
talk out of your ass
with that much conviction,

467
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,110
you end up needing
a much bigger toothbrush.

468
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,212
That's a anal fact.

469
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:31,888
Listen, thank you for trying
to get my purse back

470
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:34,023
and, uh, stuff.

471
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,191
But, uh...
Stuff?

472
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,859
I'm not looking.

473
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,462
Not right now.

474
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:43,032
Okay.

475
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,636
Is it all right if I leave
my number for when you might be?

476
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:50,973
<i>Relax, okay?</i>

477
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,475
No.
No, no, you're gonna like it.

478
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,510
What am I, what am I even
gonna say, all right?

479
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,946
You just got to keep
talking about science.

480
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,681
I don't know
anything about science.

481
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:02,051
Okay, so just read from
the table of elements.

482
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,954
Cerium, erbium, praseodymium.

483
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,261
Mrs. Jackson.

484
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,696
Oh!

485
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,765
Karen is thrilled with you.

486
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,135
She got an "A"
on her physics midterm!

487
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,136
Karen!

488
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,804
Honey, your little helper
is here.

489
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,041
This is my brother Ian.

490
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:27,310
Um, I'm out of plastic bags.

491
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:30,146
Why don't you leave your shoes
out here where they can breathe.

492
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,314
Sure.

493
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,184
Mix these two together...

494
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:37,053
Erbium, cerium,

495
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,555
praseodymium, magnesium...

496
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,159
You kids want some homemade
lime chicken chimichangas?

497
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,094
Um, no, no, thanks, Sheila.

498
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,796
I think we're fine.
No? All right.

499
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,499
Uh, praseodymium, uh,

500
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,300
magnesium, sulfur...

501
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,302
All right, I'm off to work.

502
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,172
Hey, fellas.

503
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,275
Where's Karen?
Uh, her room.

504
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,911
I think Google Earth
for a GPS reference

505
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,446
on where Isaac Newton was born.

506
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:07,250
Guess what I
made for your lunch.

507
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:10,653
Cornish game hen
with Asian pear.

508
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:12,121
No.

509
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,257
Wild salmon with baby carrots.

510
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,526
No.

511
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,528
Kiss and I'll tell.

512
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:23,666
I'll find out what I got when
I open the damn box, all right?

513
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,485
All right, I'm late,
Karen, honey!

514
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,786
I guess I'll see you
in the morning.!

515
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:49,659
What's she hiding for?

516
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,130
What are you hiding...

517
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:55,731
...for?

518
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:59,302
Ah, sweet Jesus.

519
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,310

537
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,191
Oh, yeah, yeah. The, um,
the doors were closing

538
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:56,926
on her walker, and Lip
barely got his foot in

539
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,127
in time to stop them from...
Ow!

540
00:27:58,161 --> 00:27:59,428
Jesus, Fiona!

541
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:00,963
Can't remember whether
that's good or bad.

542
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,133
More likely, you two jumped
the turnstiles again

543
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,302
and he twisted it trying
to outrun the transit cops.

544
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,404
No, no! Always
elevate extremities!

545
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,805
Move before you give him
a fucking embolism.

546
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,374
You okay, Lip?

547
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:12,842
Sweetheart? Yeah, just please don't...
don't touch it.

548
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:13,943
Okay.

549
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:15,211
Wiggle your toes.

550
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,647
Go to my house,
top of the freezer.

551
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:18,714
Yeah.
Two ice packs.

552
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:19,815
Second cupboard above the sink.
Yeah.

553
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,751
Liquid ibuprofen,
freeze spray, ACE bandages.

554
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:22,885
Sure.

555
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,153
Shouldn't we get it X-rayed?
Fuck no.

556
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:25,921
He'll be in the E.R. forever,
and for what?

557
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,256
"Submetatarsal hematoma."

558
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,859
Thanks. Tell us something
we didn't know five hours ago.

559
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:31,193
Fuck off. My bedroom,

560
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:32,261
top of the TV.
Yeah.

561
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,163
Pack of smokes and a lighter.

562
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:37,900
Shit! I'm not here!
I'm not here!

563
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,636
What...?
You don't know us, Fiona!

564
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:42,738
Oh, what have you done?

565
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:44,507
What have you done?!

566
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,717
Can I get it through here,

567
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,752
is it better coming
around the back?

568
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,354
Samsung washer.

569
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:01,057
It's not me.

570
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,291
Gallagher, number 2119?

571
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,627
Yeah, but that's not ours.

572
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,661
Well, it's paid for.

573
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,697
You want me
to hook it up or not?

574
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,548
Where you going with those?

575
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:28,350
Uh, Veronica wants them.

576
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:29,852
Well, give me one.

And keep your weight off of it.

582
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,761
I thought you were broke.

583
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:14,263
That's what I said.

584
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:16,031
These were in the washer.

585
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,268
Steve?

586
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:20,269
Yeah.
No.

00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,270
Uh-huh.

588
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,271
Who's Steve?

589
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:24,039
The other night.

590
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:25,107
No.

591
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:26,909
I know.

592
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,215
<i>15 years!</i>

593
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,483
15 years!

594
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,118
I've done everything
in my control...

595
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:37,553
What did I say?!

596
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,821
What did I tell you?!

597
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:39,922
Sow and thou shall reap.

598
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,423
Well, she didn't
reap this from me,

599
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,092
I'll tell you that.

600
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,193
Reap what?

601
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:46,529
Wh-what are you reaping now?

602
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,330
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

603
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:49,732
Whatever it is, I'll try.

604
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,734
I'll-I'll...
I'll really try.

605
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,803
Mom, don't beg him.

606
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:56,572
If he can do this,
then the bastard's not worth it!

607
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,275
Hey, you honor thy father!

608
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,876
Get fucked!

609
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,978
Don't try blaming me for this!

610
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:06,782
You're your own worst enemy,
you two.

611
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:09,718
They say bad things happen
in three; they don't.

612
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,886
Twos! You two!

613
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,423
Insane.

614
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:26,902
Hello.

615
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:28,237
How much you pay for it?

616
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,438
I'm not telling you that.

617
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:30,573
It's a gift.

618
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,041
So you'd remember
the phone number,

619
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,042
which obviously worked.

620
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:34,310
Your washer's in the yard, okay?

621
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:35,978
We don't need it,
I don't want it.

622
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:38,647
So you got to come pick it up
before it starts rusting.

623
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:39,915
Oh, is it?

624
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,818
No.

625
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,119
Did the guy connect it?

626
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:47,156
Yes.

627
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,557
It's working okay?

628
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:50,092
It's not my favorite color.

629
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,427
Oh, so you've tried it.

630
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:08,711
Let me smell your breath.

631
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:12,514
Pork rinds?
No.

632
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,749
Um, those are mine.

633
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,417
See? Hey, since
when do pork rinds

634
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,552
actually come from a pig?

635
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,254
Ian, I am the one
that signs your check.

636
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:20,022
What's bad for him is
really bad for you.

637
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:21,924
If you are stupid enough
to start lying for him...

638
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,192
They're just corn chips
with fake hair,

639
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:24,994
fake corn even.

640
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:25,995
Last warning.

641
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,196
You get yourself to that mosque

642
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,998
so your dad stops
blaming me for the fact

643
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,299
that we're all going to hell.

644
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,134
And talk to your mother.

645
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:33,269
She won't talk to me.

646
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:34,536
I can't force her
to take her meds.

647
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:35,938
Well, I don't want
the cops dragging me

648
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:38,440
out of bed again at 4:00 a.m.
because she's out in the alley

649
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,775
yelling that the CIA
is stealing her trash.

650
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,044
But that happened, didn't it?

651
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,413
Once.

652
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:45,614
Four years ago, yes.

653
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,116
But now she's locked
in the basement,

654
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,617
making a helmet out of tinfoil.

655
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:50,152
Enough's enough!

656
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:51,253
Boys, come on, let's go.

657
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,421
Get in the car.

658
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,523
Now, I have to take
the boys to Cub Scouts

659
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,425
at the mosque before all
the carpets are taken.

660
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:59,094
She's your mother; get her
to take her Thorazine.

661
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,163
No, boys, no candy.
Come on, let's go.

662
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,665
We're gonna be late.
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

663
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:03,899
No more!

664
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,301
Come on, we're gonna be late.

665
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:06,302
Hurry up.

666
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,372
Just tell me you didn't go

667
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:46,108
and get some girl pregnant.

668
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:47,276
No worries.

669
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:50,446
He hates me.

670
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,849
You just,
you look more like mom

671
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:55,718
than any of the rest of us.

672
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:56,952
You probably scare him.

673
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:58,053
Yeah?

674
00:33:58,088 --> 00:33:59,421
Yeah.

675
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,756
He ain't seen nothing yet.

676
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,193
Did he give you money
for the field trip?

677
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:05,928
I'll pay my own way, all right?

678
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,331
No, you won't.

679
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:26,949
You mustet sick of having
to think for everybody.

680
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,918
Well, at least I can.

Good job, Fiona.

690
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:43,158
I don't know how I could
do this without you.

691

Thanks for all your hard work.

692
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:50,799
You're welcome, Dad.

693
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:55,037
My pleasure.

694
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,578
Hmm.

695
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:35,744
Good night, Daddy.

696
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,658
Hello.

697
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:52,094
If that wasn't bullshit,
what was I wearing?

698
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,830
Huh? First time you saw
me, if that wasn't a lie.

699
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,567
Black top with gold trim,

700
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:03,438
black shiny jeans,
thin shoes... straps...

701
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:07,876
Sandals.
With your hair pinned high.

702
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:13,215
Dangly gold earrings
that made me smile.

703
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:19,855
A big watch... too big,
so it slid up your arm.

704
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,424
<i>But it looked great.</i>

705
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:26,828
And you were dancing
next to red-haired girl

706
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:28,997
in a green dress.

707
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:38,407
Yeah, yeah, Jenna.
It was Jenna's birthday.

708
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,609
So you were...
you were watching her,

709
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:42,811
who's a lot better looking
than me.

710
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,880
You think so? Really?

711
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:47,149
Yeah, so how come you're
not stalking Jenna?

712
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:50,152
Because you... you think like
that and Jenna doesn't.

713
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,987
Jenna dances for an audience.

714
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:55,691
You dance like there's no one
else in the room.

715
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:58,760
Your life's not simple, Fiona,

716
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:01,730
and you can't stop it from
showing because you're no fake.

You're not lost,
you don't need finding.

I swear, Fiona, you're nothing
like anyone I've ever met.

00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:14,710
You make me want to enjoy

Agree.

So I lose respect
for guys like Steve

741

So deciding that
he's overeducated

and has more money than sense

746
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:33,682
is somehow more socially
acceptable

747
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:35,050
than asking myself,
for instance,

748
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:37,719
why do the men I always date
treat me like shit?

Agree.

He's had a easy life.

755

Definitely.
And you prefer a guy who's been

What if I do?

842
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,667
Ask me!

843
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,669

846
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,610
And a couple Sox tickets

This is Steve.

861
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:52,704
Oh, no, no, no, we met before,

862
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,940
but you weren't exactly...

863
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:02,280
How much do you weigh?

864
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:05,283
Uh, I don't know.

Oh... no. Nah.

Hmm?

875
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:46,491
What the hell's he on?

876
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,494
Uh, he thinks
he bought Ecstasy,

877
00:48:49,529 --> 00:48:52,631
but the only dealer he gets
credit from is a schizophrenic.

878
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:56,868
It's not a case
of whether or not

879
00:48:56,903 --> 00:48:58,069
I agree.
It's a fact.

880
00:48:58,104 --> 00:48:59,971
If I were a single
parent, we'd be on...

881
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,072
Aren't you a single parent?

882
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,340
"Yeah, but if I had tits..."

883
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,075
Yeah, but if I had tits, Steve,

884
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,744
they would double the money.

885

Yeah? r what?

890
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,053
A tragedy really. I gave my life
to that company.

891
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:16,321
You worked there a week.

892
00:49:16,355 --> 00:49:17,589
What happened?

893
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:19,925
Uh, slaughterhouse, poultry.

894
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:21,126

I am slammed in the ribs

897
00:49:26,165 --> 00:49:27,899

The sacred bond

904
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:43,048
between employer and employee?

905
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:45,450
Gone, Steve.
It's gone.

00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:16,087
It was a kid at school.

982
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:17,722
Yeah?

983
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:19,991
All right, I guess
it doesn't really matter

984
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:21,693
'cause, I mean,
he's long gone now anyways,

985
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:25,663
but, uh... Roger Spikey.

986
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:28,833
Roger Spikey?

987
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,369
Fucking donkey dick
Roger Spikey?

988
00:54:31,403 --> 00:54:33,404
The original beefmeister?

989
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:36,207
Or did he start that rumor?

990
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,543
Not a rumor.

991
00:54:38,577 --> 00:54:40,078
Whoa, that was a bit gay.

992
00:54:40,112 --> 00:54:41,880
What you just did there
with your eyebrows.

993
00:54:41,914 --> 00:54:43,515
You want to watch that.

994
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:45,350
All right, fuck off, all right?

995
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:49,621
But seriously, like...

996
00:54:49,655 --> 00:54:52,957
like up the ass?

997
00:54:52,992 --> 00:54:54,826
Do you get used to that?

998
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,060
Can someone get used to that?

999
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:58,229
I mean... I mean,
the whole point

1000
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:02,100
of the digestive system
is one-way traffic.

1001
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:07,038
It just is.

1002
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,678
What? What?!

1003
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:15,380
"Just is."

1004
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:17,148
Like, like, we're only given
our lungs

1005
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,517
to freakin' smoke, right?

1006
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,498
It's hot!

1007
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:35,066
Don't drop it off.
Please don't drop it.

1008
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,701
Please don't drop it!
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

1009
00:55:36,735 --> 00:55:38,403
oh, my God.

1010
00:55:38,437 --> 00:55:39,871
The sausage is ready.

1011
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:41,206
I haven't had
eggs in a while.

1012
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,441
Somebody already
get the pancakes?

1013
00:55:43,475 --> 00:55:44,909
What's all this?

1014
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:47,545
Debbie's the only person I know
wakes up earlier than I do,

1015
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,280
and I told her
I never eat breakfast,

1016
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:50,682
but she said
it's her favorite meal.

1017
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,183
And I thought since
it's her birthday...

1018
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,851
Whoa!
No, it's not!

1019
00:55:53,886 --> 00:55:55,186
It's not her birthday.

1020
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:57,488
I never said it was.
I said, "I wished it was."

1021
00:55:57,523 --> 00:55:59,023
Ah, right, she said
she wished it was.

1022
00:55:59,058 --> 00:56:00,692
Sorry, Deb,
I totally misheard that.

1023
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:01,960
Perforated eardrum
on the right.

1024
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,466
15 minutes before school, tops.

1025
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,534
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,269
Ian, Lip, dishes soon
as you're done.

1027
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:12,604
Debbie, Carl...
Yeah.

1028
00:56:12,638 --> 00:56:14,572
You've got to take
the trash out.

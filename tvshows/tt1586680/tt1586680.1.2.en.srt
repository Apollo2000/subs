Come here.

181
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:24,105
Hey, Liam.

182
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,414
Any pizza left from last night?

183
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,149
No pizza. Fruit or juice.

184
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:35,417
And we've got eggs.

185
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,485
OJ's in the top,
grapes in bottom drawer.

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,354
Pop-Tarts, Frosted Flakes,
Bisquick,

187
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,089
Heinz Ketchup, and ooh, ooh...

188
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:42,958
even got a couple
two-for-ones for Tide.

189
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,392
Any coupons for meat?

190
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,628
Yeah, they've got a special
on ground chuck at Costco,

191
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:47,896
and Hot Pockets.

192
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,531
That's great.
We'll go tomorrow.

193
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,001
Lip, you seen Frank?

194
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,069
Uh, no.

195
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:56,871
What day is it?
Friday.

196
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:57,973
Why?

197
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,613
Really.

198
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,828
Hey.
Morning, campers.

199
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:21,830
Oh, what you got?
Jelly, plain and glazed.

200
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,632
Save me an apple fritter.
All right.

201
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,735
Yum.

202
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,137
Bet you hate it
when that happens?

203
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,438
They're his tits.

204
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:31,806
It's the only reason
he eats eggs.

205
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,174
And he just licked that one.

206
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:36,945
Oh, great.

207
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,813
I'm trying to get them to
eat a healthy breakfast.

208
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,882
I brought all the

209
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,851
caffeine, sugar, lard.

210
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,823
I'm sorry about last night.

211
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,392
Never apologize
for your parents.

212
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,693
Believe me, I don't.

213
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,562
So you can let go of that.

214
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,566
Has anybody seen Dad?

215
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,669
He was asleep
behind the armchair.

216
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,106
Bye.

217
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,179
It's a tent.

218
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,114
Why is there a tent
in the living room?

219
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,150
Oh, uh, drying it out.

220
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,985
ROTC training
in Wisconsin next week.

221
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,653
I thought it was Dad.

222
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:21,656
I left him a cup
of coffee this morning.

223
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:24,159
I thought I heard
him say "Thanks."

224
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,600
Yes!
Yes! Oh, sorry.

225
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,135
I came in the back way.

226
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,704
Oh, you're not the only one!

227
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:39,207
Uh, Kev, was Dad
at the Alibi last night?

228
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:40,775
Uh, yeah.

229
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,613
<i>But he was hammered.</i>

230
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:47,949
I'm talking
hold-on-to-the-grass...

231
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,551
so-you-don't-fall-off-the-Earth
hammered.

232
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:52,420
You see him at last call?

233
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,322
No.

234
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:56,658
Which is pretty weird,
'cause he usually hangs out

235
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,093
to sink the other
drinkers' dregs.

236
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,061
Thanks.

237
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,529
Ready?

238
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,908
You okay?

239
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,276
I think Dad's missing.

240
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,478
<i>Hey, Ted. Yeah, yeah.</i>

241
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,780
Hey, Jonna.
It's Debbie.

242
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,415
Have you seen Frank
since last night?

243
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,950
No? Since Michael Jackson died?

244
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:24,085
I was wondering if you had
seen him since... All right.

245
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,654
...since last night
at the Alibi.

246
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,089
Sorry about the door,
and the window.

247
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,158
Yeah, yeah, anyways, I was
wondering, have you seen Frank...

248
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:33,428
Hey, did you get an admission into the E.
R. last night or this morning?

249
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:35,997
Last night? No?
Keep and eye out...

250
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,233
Hey, can you just...?
I will look it up.

251
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,267
Shit!

252
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,769
What the fuck?!

253
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,171
Motherfucker.

254
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,008
Stop... Wendy-Wendy!

255
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,576
Hello?
Hello? Wendy.

256
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,311
Stop! Stop!

257
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,714
Hey. Are you still there?

258
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,516
Wendy, Wendy.

259
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,683
Oh, you didn't?

260
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:56,918
Okay, thanks anyway.

261
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:59,587
No. Know if it's
a boy or girl yet?

262
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,457
What is your problem?

263
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,325
I'm supposed to call Ahmed
before work

264
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,027
and I can't find my cell.
My cell's gone.

265
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,929
Help me look for my cell.
It's gone. I lent Lip your cell

266
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:08,997
so he could call around,

267
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:10,365
see anybody knew
where Frank went.

268
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,534
Great. So now both my bills
are being run up over there.

269
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:13,835
Your bills? Hello?

270
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,470
I work my ass off around here,
not just you.

271
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:18,039
Oh, there's the computer.
Don't let me stop you.

272
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,307
It's after 10:00,
get to work.

273
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:20,542
Frank is missing,
you cheap prick.

274
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,843
And you need to see somebody.

275
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,145
Normal guys fall asleep
after sex. Not Kev, oh, no.

276
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,781
Why can't they get their own fucking phone?
No fucking money!

277
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:28,149
Yeah, well, me neither
at this rate.

278
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,317
I love you.

279
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,955
Fucking freak.

280
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:03,985
Anything?

281
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,954
Nobody's seen him
since last night.

282
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,625
Hey, hey, don't worry, Debs.

283
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,961
We're gonna find him, okay?

284
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:16,297
We split up.
All the regular spots, okay?

285
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,166

You can't file a missing persons

305
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,605
Frank's always missing.
That's what I said.

306
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,107
I mean, he's probably just sleeping
it off at a friend's place.

307
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:35,910
He hasn't got any friends.
Who'd give him a bed?

308
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,478
Come on, we've found
him in Dumpsters,

309
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:39,914
garbage trucks,
Mrs. Lutski's bathtub.

310
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,549
Never on the last Friday
of the month.

311
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:42,917
What's Friday have
to do with anything?

312
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:45,053
It's the last Friday?

313
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:47,689
I'll call my watch commander.

314
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:51,392
You can shove your
phone up your ass, Kev.

315
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,494
No more freebies from me, like
doing your taxes every April

316
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,330
'cause you can't understand
the instructions.

317
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:56,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

318
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,266
Hey, take it easy.

319
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,834
Take it easy, all right?

320
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,370
Look, Frank isn't far, okay?

321
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:03,838
He never goes far.

322
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:05,106
I know, but it's
the last Friday.

323
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,641
Last Friday? So what?

324
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:12,280
Disability check day.

325
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,715
Oh, Jesus.

326
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:15,016
Fuck me.

327
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,018
Hey, Jess.

328
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,253
Uh, Frank Gallagher...
did he leave with anybody

329
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,822
when we kicked him
out last night?

330
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:22,090
Name me one person

331
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:24,359
who would be caught dead
with him in that condition.

332
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,627
And Steve was definitely gone
by then,

333
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,661
so Frank wasn't with him.

334
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:27,996
Anybody seen Frank the Plank?

335
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
Which Steve?

336
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:30,798
You know, Steve-Steve.
Fiona's new Steve.

337
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,966
In here?

338
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,901
Yeah, talking to your dad.
Friendly enough.

339
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,336
It was hours before closing.

340
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,971
Right.

341
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,906
Thanks, Kev.

342
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,475
Yeah.

343
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,944
Breaking news now
about a body that was found

344
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,612
on the Southside of the city.

345
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:47,181
Is that over
by Halsted station?

346
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,951
I broke my collarbone falling
down those station steps.

347
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:53,187
After my very first taste
of another woman's tongue.

348

<i>Tony said he'd put

<i>He never misses that check.</i>

350
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:58,860
We waits on the corner.
Practically tackles the mailman

351
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,995
before he can get out
of his little jeep.

352
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,964
We've all known for years
it could end this way.

353
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,099
We don't know
anything's happened.

354
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,501
All the O.D.'s
and pumped stomachs.

355
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,802
The time he passed out
on the tracks.

356
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,470
The El tracks?
Almost lost a hand.

357
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,307
Hey, V.

358
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:14,308
Hey, Ian.

00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:15,843
Um, sorry, Fiona.

Uh, Holly thought she saw
a body under the tracks

368
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,110
on Halsted.
What?

369
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,611
It's not him, Debs,
or the police

370
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:51,946
would have contacted us by now.

371
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,247
It's Holly, sweetheart, okay?

372
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,483
She's been in third grade
for four years.

373
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,151
I'm gonna deck
that little bitch.

374
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:59,854
Listen, does that even
make sense, Debbie?

375
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:02,523
Why would your dad be over on Halsted
when he lives in the opposite direction?

376
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:03,825
Depends. How was he looking

377
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,660
when you left him at the
Alibi Room last night, Steve?

378
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,629
When?

379
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,432
Uh, 10:00, 10:30.

380

I went to apologize, bought him
a drink, then I went home.

Why didn't you say?

Hey, can I talk
to you for a sec?

477
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:58,379
Uh, I had to run a car
to Detroit.

478
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,848
Plan was dump him someplace
weird in Michigan,

479
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,450
Flint maybe.

480

for Toronto,

481

482

snowballed.

483
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:14,428
And you think it-it's funny?

484
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:16,030
No. Funny would have
been Newfoundland.

485
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,865
Because he took a swing at you?

486
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:19,166
No, because he's got a family

487
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:21,202
that he doesn't
give a shit about.

488
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:23,070
Smashing Ian in the face.

489
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,138
Uh...

490
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,342
What my dad is,
what my family is,

491
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:30,211
has fuck all to do with you!

492
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:36,450
You left him there...
you get him back.

493
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:49,797
What the hell is that?

494
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,800
Our ride.

495
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:57,671
There's no fucking way
I'm driving all the way

496
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:58,973
to Toronto
in this piece of shit.

497
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:00,107
We'll take turns driving,

498
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:01,642
watch some movies
on the flat screen,

499
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:02,710
make some mojitos, sleep.

500
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:04,445
We'll have Frank
back by morning.

501
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,613
Yeah, and how are we supposed
to get him across the border

502
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:08,916
without a passport?
Kyle.

503
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,818
You get through
customs in this before?

504
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:12,920
A couple hundred times.
Oh, yeah, with what?

505
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:14,255
Grass mostly.

506
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,357

sometimes illegal aliens.

Hey, Fiona.

Hey, Tony.

513
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:40,514
Lip.

514
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:41,849
Hmm?

515
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:47,054
Yeah, um, I think I'm going
to finish my calculus

516
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:49,223
homework upstairs.

517
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:56,797
Thanks for all your help
with Frank.

518
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,032
Sure. Happy to.

519
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,700
Family, you know.

520
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:02,937
There's coffee in the pot.

521
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:05,039
Probably a couple
decades old, but...

522
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,607
Thanks.

523
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,443
So is this Steve guy
a fixture now?

524
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:12,379
Just somebody I met.

525
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:17,384
CYO Basketball League
Awards Banquet is next week

526
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:18,719
at St. Stephens.

527
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,889
There's a chance I might
get Coach of the Year.

528
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,524
That's terrific, Tony.

529
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:25,259
I bet you're a great coach.

530
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:28,362
Well, they're eight, so mostly
it's just helping them

531
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:30,030
get the ball anywhere
near the basket.

532
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:32,433
No, they're lucky to have you.

533
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,968
One of the kids
always licks the ball

534
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:37,771
before he takes a shot.
I have no idea why.

535
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,607
I was hoping you'd come.

536
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,179
To the banquet?

537
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,747
Mrs. Rudolian
and Mrs. Ignacio

538
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:49,383
are doing the food,
so there'll be all the kielbasa

539
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,252
and Bolognese ragu you can eat.

540
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,187
I know...

541
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:55,789
hard to turn down
an invitation like that, right?

542
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:57,691
Catholic League ladies
might talk.

543
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,360
Screw the Catholic ladies.

544
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:00,928
I haven't set foot in there

545
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,930
since they tossed me out
of the choir.

546
00:29:02,964 --> 00:29:05,332
Tony, we have a call.
Work.

547
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:06,500
So Thursday?

548
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:09,536
Can I think about it?

549
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:10,804

You decent?

584
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,358
Thought you might be thirsty.

585
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:45,692
It's Canadian.

586
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:46,760
There's more in fridge.

587
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:48,328
I asked Veronica to get it.

588
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,632
I don't want anything
Canadian in this house,

00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:55,302
There's no hot water.

Clean clothes,
top of the dryer.

595
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,388
Don't ever hit
one of my kids again.

596
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:15,456
Your kids? They're my...

597
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,291
Never again.

598
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:23,030
Is he still here?

599
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:24,665
Who, Steve?

600
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,099
He's probably still outside.

601
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,769
Well, tell him he's not welcome
in my house.

602
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:30,571
He's the one who got you back.

603
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:35,142
Why would he do that? Hmm?

604
00:32:35,176 --> 00:32:38,178
When I woke up, in Toronto,

605
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:42,249
in a park, looking like
a fucking homeless tweaker,

606
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:44,852
all I could smell
was Drakkar Noir.

607
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:48,088
Middle of a park...
Drakkar Noir.

608
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:50,524
I just spent five hours with him
in that camper.

609
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,627
Same fucking smell!

610
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:11,044
Wish you'd taken a camera.

611
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:13,046
Total shithole.

612
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:16,683
Hey, what's urine and
Canadian beer have in common?

613
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:18,085
They both come from pussies.

614
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:21,655
Bet you're the only
one who missed me.

615
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:23,190
No, 'cause Carl said,

616
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:26,059
"The cable's off.
Where's the ladder?"

617
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:28,529
And Lip said,
"Dad's the only one

618
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:30,564
who knows what to do
on the pole."

619
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:32,399
Did you see Toronto?

620
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah.

621
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:34,801
CN Tower?

622
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:36,169
Christ, yeah!

623
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:39,673
You can see right across all
of Canada from the top.

624
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,575
I didn't stay up
there long, though.

625
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:44,077
Don't know what
Canadian women are into,

626
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:45,712
but they couldn't take
their eyes off me,

627
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,715
like, "Hey, I'm
having that guy."

628
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,085
Got a bit unnerving, so
I headed on back down.

629
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:00,294
Bits of Canada are beautiful.

630
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:02,896
You just have to know
your way around.

631
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,131
Do you now?

632
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,399
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

633
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:07,501
Every inch.

634
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,638
Hey, I gotta go cash a check.

635
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:13,807
Make me a sandwich
for when I get back, okay?

636
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:15,142
Okay.

637
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:38,932
Ow!

638
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,242
Davey, it's me, Frank!
Come on, man!

639
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:50,844
Open up! Let me in!

640
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,514
Just until I find
another place to stay.

641
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:55,582
No way, Frank.

642
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,351
I promised Mary, never again!

643
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,486
We had to burn that mattress.

644
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,821
Come on, Davey!
I'll sleep on the floor.

645
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:03,724
Definitely not!
We got carpet now.

646
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:10,130
Moving out again?

647
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:12,265
Fuck off!

648
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,967
I don't like the way

649
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:16,203
I'm being talked to
around my own house.

650
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,704
Like what?

651
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,139
"You never got me this, Dad.

652
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:20,741
When can I have
that, Dad?"

653
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:22,209
Yak, yak, fucking yak.

654
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:24,077
All six of you.

655
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:25,612
Never mind I'm a single parent!

656
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:28,582
Never mind you wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for me!

657
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:31,852
Surround sound bitching is
the only thanks I get.

658
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:33,754
Life is hard, we all know that.

659
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:35,489
Money is harder.

660
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,190
I can only stretch it so far.

661
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:40,360
Do you even know how much
we spend a week on groceries?

662
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,562
Too much.
That's how much.

663
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:43,730
120 bucks.

664
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:45,365
Fiona pays $70.

665
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,367
Me and Ian go in $25 each.

666
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:50,837
Plus gas, electric, taxes.

667
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:52,472
We pay that.

668
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:55,942
About time you contribute.

669
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:58,045
Do you know how much you spend
a month at the Alibi?

670
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,513
None of your damn business!

671
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,648
Over $700.

672
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:05,085
That's Kevin, right?

673
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,722
My friend Kevin telling
you that behind my back?

674
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,091
Well, he's screwed
the golden goose now.

675
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:15,762
Watch what happens to his tips
when I boycott the Alibi.

676
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:16,763
And go where?

677
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:17,764
The Lamplight.

678
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:18,765
You're barred.

679
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
The Fountain.
Barred.

680
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:21,902
Elmo's Head.

681
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:25,772
Burned to the ground
two weeks ago. Arson.

682
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:27,841
I don't need Kev to tell me.

683
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,443
I check your pockets
every night.

684
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:30,744
See...

685
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,349
You better run!

686
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:38,919
Take it easy!

687
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:48,662
Forget you owe him money?

688
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,397
Everybody thinks
I owe 'em money!

689
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:52,332
You pawned his flat screen.

690
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:55,335
I've been nothing but a friend
to that fat jigga prick.

691
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,003
And his microwave.

692
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:58,839
I won't say it twice...
go home.

693
00:36:58,873 --> 00:36:59,906
What?

694
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,875
I won't say it twice...

695
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:05,846
Okay...

696
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,447
people are laughing.

697
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,282
But they only thought
Toronto was funny

698
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:12,152
once they knew you were okay.

699
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,554
I didn't split
like your mom did.

700
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:16,089
I could of.

701
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:18,892
Let the state figure out what
to do with all six of you.

702
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,060
But I didn't.

703
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,194
And bars weren't...

704
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:23,530
You ask anybody.
A beer...

705
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:24,965
once in a while, and that's it.

706
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:26,867
Three, I'd be on the floor.

707
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:28,969
And they all thought
it was funny then

708
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,771
that I couldn't knock 'em back.

709
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,473
You can't win, you know?

710
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:36,877
Your mom just takes off,
you're all looking at me.

711
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:39,713
Six kids to keep track of
when you've never had

712
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:40,981
to do that stuff.

713
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,349
Food on the table.

714
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:44,284
Clothes for school.

715
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:46,586
Bills to pay. Diapers.

716
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:50,423
Dentists. Oh. Oh.

717
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,893
And you're all looking at me
like I'm fucking up.

718
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,728
Which I am!

719
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,062
Then what's the point?

720
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,464
So you knock back a few?

721
00:37:57,498 --> 00:37:58,932
Then you have a few more.

722
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,567
And while
you're knocking 'em back,

723
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:02,903
you know everybody's laughing,

724
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:05,972
but that's okay
'cause that's what you need.

725
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:08,375
Hold on! That's what you need.

726
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:10,343
You need people laughing.

727
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,947
You need people drinking
anything

728
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,550
so long as it's not six kids

729
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:18,752
that you didn't want
in the first place!

730
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:22,022
So screw 'em all
and just get used to it!

731
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,927

00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:39,573
How you doing, Frank?

736
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:42,976
Can I pour you a nice
tall, frosty Molson?

737
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,911
Old Style, JB back.

738
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:47,280
Oh, how about a Labatt
and a Canadian Club.

739
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:57,757
Jesus!

740
00:39:01,662 --> 00:39:03,296
Ah, fine! Just kill me!

741
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,342
<i>I don't know you, Frank,</i>

742
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:17,177
but it occurred to me,

743
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,012
you and I are the victims here.

744
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,414
Two hardworking,
God-fearing men.

745
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:23,283
We raised our kids
in a straight line

746
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:27,854
with discipline
and with God's good guidance.

747
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:31,591
My Karen was 12 when I heard her
use the C-word.

748
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:32,959
And on a Sunday.

749
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:34,527
Fuck.

750
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:37,197
And her mother?

751
00:39:37,231 --> 00:39:41,201
A woman who's only pleasures
in life come from sex,

752
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:43,203
TV cooking shows,

753
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:46,206
and drawing maximum benefits
from the welfare state.

754
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,008
Hundreds a week.

755
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,042
And for what?

756
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:51,444
Agoraphobia.

757
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,914
A made-up disease
for people who want

758
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:56,883
to sit on their ass
at home and watch TV.

759
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:59,486
I don't know where Sheila's
dignity's gone,

760
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,555
or whether she ever had any
in the first place.

761
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,725
Her whole world is
about this big,

762
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,995
and the less she does,
the more they pay her.

763
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:13,166
I've done it now.

764
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,936
I left them.

765
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,837
I'm not proud.

766
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:19,472
Far from proud.

767
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:25,011
But I just refuse to
be sorry because...

768
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:28,815
because...

769
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:38,191
I refuse to be sorry...

770
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:07,887
Um...

771
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:11,024
Oh, if you're looking
for the brothel,

772
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,225
it's just two doors down.

773
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,227
It doesn't have a mailbox.

774
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:16,730
Right-right there.
No, no, Sheila, for you.

775
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:19,399
An apology.

776
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,268
Apology?

777
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:23,970
Not apology, just...

778
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:26,072
I'm Frank. Ian's dad?

779
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:30,276
Lip's dad?

780
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:32,479
Oh! Oh, the twins?

781
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:34,014
Oh.
No.

782
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:36,583
I... I heard about
what happened.

783
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:37,784
Eddie leaving?

784
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:41,354
Oh.
Uh, my boys, your daughter?

785
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:42,889
I just wanted to say

786
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,491
I'm sorry.

787
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:48,762
Oh, that's-that's-that's
very thoughtful of you.

788
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:50,597
Come in, Frank.

789
00:41:57,104 --> 00:42:00,240
I, uh... You'll have to
take your shoes off.

790
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:05,345
This is a beautiful house,
Sheila.

791
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:09,182
Oh. Thank you.

792
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:10,917
It feels, uh...

793
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:13,286
feels big without him.

794
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,288
You should come over to ours.

795
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,057
You can't move
without stepping on a kid.

796
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:18,124
Six of 'em.

797
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,760
That must be nice.

798
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:23,997
It's great when they're little,

799
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:27,100
but they're growing up now.
Mm-hmm.

800
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:29,502
You miss them, don't you...

801
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:30,503
Mm-hmm.

802
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:33,540
...when they're gone
all the time?

803
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:36,609
And the house all to yourself.

804
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,412
Don't get me wrong, I...

805
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:44,117
I love time to myself, but...

806
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:46,186
it's tough.

807
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,054
Oh.

808
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:49,122
Hey...

809
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:51,357
Frank.

810
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:54,227
Come on, Frank.

811
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,929
You're preaching
to the choir here.

812
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:59,132
I have not been out of the house
in five years.

813
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,967
Five years?

814
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:05,038
I can't.
I have this overwhelming fear.

815
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:08,508
I've got agoraphob...

816
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,077
I'm sorry, Frank.

817
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:14,047
I know I'm a little nutty
about shoes, but feet!

818
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,649
Oh, God! They have to be...!

819
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:18,451
Oh, sorry, Sheila, sorry.

820
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:20,153
I'll-I'll get out
of your hair. Sorry.

821
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:22,956
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

822
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,592
By the time I get a turn
in our one bathroom,

823
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:27,293
there's never any hot water!

824
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:29,829
I tried to run a bath
when I got back from Canada,

825
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:31,131
but no hot water!

826
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:33,366
Six kids, six showers,

827
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,503
me always at the back
of the line!

828
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:39,806
We've got hot water.

829
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,475
Hey, congratu-fuckin-lations!

830
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:47,180
No, I-I meant if...

831
00:43:47,214 --> 00:43:49,015
if you wanted a bath.

832
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:52,318
Oh.

833
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:09,669
Fiona?

834
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:11,704
No.

835
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:17,110
No, she's not here, or no,
she doesn't want to see me?

836
00:44:17,144 --> 00:44:19,579
Both.

837
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,781
Ah. She coming back?

838
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,783
Nah, work. Won't be
home for hours.

839
00:44:28,022 --> 00:44:29,656
Looks good.

840
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,692
Is.

841
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:34,394
Did she say anything?

842
00:44:34,428 --> 00:44:37,797
About you?

843
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:41,134
No. No, not a word.

844
00:44:41,168 --> 00:44:43,803
So you're saying...

845
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:45,271
You fucked up
beyond the capacity

846
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:46,739
of the modern human mind
to process?

847
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:48,374
Yeah.

848
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:52,946
Yeah,
it's a distinct possibility.

849
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,948
Hopeless?
Hard to say.

850
00:44:58,752 --> 00:45:00,386
Even odds?

851
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:01,621
No, less.

852
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:03,756
60-40?
Much less.

853
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:04,791
80-20?

854
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,693
Maybe one in ten.

855
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:13,399
Pretty colossal fuck-up.
Yeah.

856
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:16,069
You're moderately clever; you'll
figure something out, right?

857
00:45:20,107 --> 00:45:24,077
Yep. Gotta get back.
AP Bio-Chem.

858
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:26,412
Wow. That's impressive.

859
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:29,082
Not really,
but if you think so...

860
00:45:29,116 --> 00:45:31,884
Any advice?

861
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:34,921
What, to help you dive back
into my sister's cooch?

862
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:36,122
Or good graces, yeah.

863
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:37,257
That's the same thing, right?

864
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,058
Hopefully.

865
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:43,730
No. No, not a chance.

866
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:53,773
Frank?

867
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:56,242
I-I brought you some clothes.

868
00:45:56,277 --> 00:45:59,112
I stuck yours in the wash,
so I hope these fit.

869
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:01,180
Oh.

870
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,182
Sorry, Sheila, I nodded off.

871
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:05,752
Oh, well, you must be exhausted.

872
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:08,288
Won't Eddie miss them?

873
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:11,291
Not unless he sheds 30 pounds.

874
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:14,294
He found Jesus
and just packed it on.

875
00:46:16,096 --> 00:46:18,765
Lean, aren't you?

876
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:20,833
I can go three days
without food.

877
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,802
Oh, suits you.

878
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:30,843
Well, anyway, they're...

879
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:32,679
yours if you...

880
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:34,280
Oh,

881
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:35,815
Jesus...
Oh, oh.

882
00:46:46,794 --> 00:46:49,762
I'm sorry, it's just...

883
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:53,333
something I haven't seen
in a long time, I...

884
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:55,835
Eddie only just left, didn't he?

885
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:57,670
I never saw Eddie's.

886
00:46:57,705 --> 00:46:59,672
It always had to be
pitch-black for Eddie.

887
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:02,475
I saw an outline once
in a thunderstorm, but...

888
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,511
Like a rolled-up pair of socks.

889
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:12,652
You've got to be over the moon
with a fellow like yours.

890
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:22,895
Oh, listen to me...
Desperate Daisy.

891
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,397
Hey.

892
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:28,868
If desperate is a crime,
then I'm a lifer, Sheila.

893
00:47:28,902 --> 00:47:32,338
No.
Yeah.

894
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:36,709
Single parent?
You get out of the habit.

895
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:38,378
You can...

896
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:41,681
touch him, if you're tempted.

897
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:48,388
No. No, no, I'll just,
I'll just embarrass myself.

898
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,690
Nobody here's complaining.

899
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:06,672
Oh! Uh...
okay, I can...

900
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:08,674
Take your time.

901
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,343
Come with me, Frank.

902
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:11,611
Oh, hold on, Sheila, Sheila...

903
00:48:11,645 --> 00:48:13,613
Come on!
Hang on. Shit! Ow.

904
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:15,715
Oh, you're all right.
Sheila, I can't see.

905
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:18,117
Swing around, my man.

906
00:48:21,388 --> 00:48:23,089
If I'm going
to embarrass myself,

907
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:24,557
I might as well do it right.

908
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:26,793
Wow, you just have the...

909
00:48:26,827 --> 00:48:28,127
Tight. That's tight.

910
00:48:28,162 --> 00:48:30,329
That is... that's very,
very tight.

911
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:33,499
I'm surprised...

912
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:35,701
<i>Tribune</i> said Sagittarius

913
00:48:35,736 --> 00:48:38,337
was in a for a quiet week.

914
00:48:38,372 --> 00:48:40,273
Yeah, but how does this...

915
00:48:40,307 --> 00:48:43,209
Ah!
Too tight, too tight. Listen, um...

916
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:45,244
I've changed my mind.

917
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:48,281
Listen, seriously,
I-I-I don't think...

918
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:49,949
It's just...

919
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:52,819
That's a... what's in there?
That's a big box.

920
00:48:52,853 --> 00:48:55,955
Oh. That's your...
fun box?

921
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:57,089
What's in there?

922
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:58,291
You got...

923
00:48:58,325 --> 00:48:59,892
Oh, those are...
those are pretty sexy.

924
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:01,127
What else is in there?

925
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:03,496
Whew. I...

926
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,499
I'm... I'm having a bit
of a panic attack here.

927
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:08,134
I... I...

928
00:49:10,037 --> 00:49:11,637
No, honest,
I'm struggling to breathe.

929
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,973
Uh...

930
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:15,408
Frank.

931
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:17,410
The more you beg,
the more you're in for.

932
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:19,345
Now relax.

933
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:22,181
I'm-I'm... I'm relaxed.

934
00:49:22,216 --> 00:49:23,716
I'm enjoying this.

935
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,084
I'm fine.

936
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:27,253
Let's have a, um,
a safety word.

937
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:28,955
You always do that.
Shouldn't we have a safety word?

938
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:31,357
Sure, all right.
Let's have a safety word.

939
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,327
Uh, "stop." When I say stop,
that'll be our...

940
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,928
That'll do.

941
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:37,930
Okay.

942
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:44,537
Oh...

943
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:46,672
Look.

944
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,475
He's smiling for me.

945
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:53,212
How about that? I... okay.

946
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:55,848
And when he smiles,
we all smile.

947
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:57,283
Yeah.

948
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:05,057
I was panicking,
I'm not going to lie to you.

949
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:10,029
Just, uh, got a little...

950
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:11,664
Mm-mm, stop.

951
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:16,502
<i>Stop...!</i>

952
00:50:55,709 --> 00:51:00,012
And that is some slow-roasted
Bavarian pork chop,

953
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:02,348
with bacon-braised cabbage,

954
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:05,017
some warm Bavarian
potato salad,

955
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:07,386
apple salsa fresca,

956
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:10,856
and then, um...
just two Tylenol.

957
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:27,373
...deciphering the human genetic code,

958
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:29,709
but he's also one of
the most controversial...

959
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:32,912
iconoclast with a brilliant mind
and an outsized ego

960
00:51:32,946 --> 00:51:36,382
who has flaunted
the conventional wisdom,

961
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:40,119
and tweaked the staid scientific
establishment at every turn.

962
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:42,989
It's not me.

963
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:44,724
I don't have the phone.

964
00:51:44,758 --> 00:51:47,059
Nope.

965
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:49,061
He's an adrenaline junky
whose willingness

966
00:51:49,096 --> 00:51:54,166
to take big risks has led to
bold scientific breakthroughs.

967
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:55,534
And he's not exactly shy about
outing those achievements. Hello?

968
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:56,936
Hey. I'm out back.

969
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,938
Where would you rank yourself

970
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:01,173
in terms of scientific
accomplishment?

971
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,409
Well, in the field of genomics,

972
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:05,645
I think the record
is pretty clear-cut:

973
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:08,748
the first genome in history, uh,

974
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:10,149
the first draft
of the human genome...

975
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:20,826
Hi.

976
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,862
Hey.

977
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:28,234
You stole a floral
delivery van?

978
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:29,402
A peace offering.

979
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,437
A what?

980
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:33,572
A gift.

981
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,977
What am I supposed to do
with all those roses?

982
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:40,079
No, the... the van.

983
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:44,216
You absolutely need something
to haul the kids around in.

984
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,655
I'm sorry, Fiona.

985
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,324
I shouldn't have
kidnapped your dad.

986
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:54,393
It was wrong.

987
00:52:57,597 --> 00:52:59,965
Tri-zone air-conditioning.

988
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,702
Power window and door locks.

989
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:04,737
Alloy wheels...

990
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,951
Here's $80.

991
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:20,486
What for?
The washer.

992
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,588
I don't have enough to pay you
back for all of it right now.

993
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:25,224
No, the washer was a gift.
No, I'll get you the rest as soon as I can.

994
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:28,260
I don't want your money.

995
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:33,065
We don't need your charity.

996
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:36,635
It was a mistake.

997
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,938
I thought I was doing you
a favor, with your dad.

998
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,308
Go away, Steve.

999
00:53:56,087 --> 00:54:00,793
I think the teams that
we have, and what we've accomplished

1000
00:54:00,827 --> 00:54:02,795
are certainly amongst
the biggest discoveries

1001
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:04,597
in modern science.
What did I miss?

1002
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,599
If you have some stereotype
of a scientist in your mind,

1003
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:09,668
Craig Venter probably
doesn't fit it.

1004
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:12,371
He scuba-dived with sharks
to gather microbes...

00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:03,455
But the faulty locking mechanism

00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,926
was illegally imported

1
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,509
It's the recap shit.

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:08,675
What, you guys miss
last week's episode?

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,425
We should probably
show it to 'em.

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,342
I guess.

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,467
Go!

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,675
You want to volunteer? Here?

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:18,841
Yes, sir.
In need of some documentation,

8
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:21,217
community service.
Trying to get into West Point.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,050
Only takes three or four minutes

10
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,800
if you get the,
hose on the tailpipe right.

11
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,300
You're killing dogs?

12
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,050
All right, well,
you guys just relax.

13
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,592
Just die naturally.

14
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:32,384
Where are all
the female employees?

15
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,800
- At the woman's march!
- Selling pussy hats.

16
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,425
"Jugs"?

17
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,675
I lied to you this morning.

18
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,109
- There is a woman on my site.
- Who?

19
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,384
Me.

20
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,300
A-are they giving you
your meds in there?

21
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:45,634
I-I'm protecting
defenseless lambs from having

22
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,133
their emotional and physical
spirits slaughtered.

23
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,008
Gallagher! You made bail.

24
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,509
Your disciples!

25
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:55,716
We crowd sourced your bail
to get you out.

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,092
Gay Jesus!

27
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,109
- Commercial real estate?
- Yeah,

28
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,841
you're the one
who told me to invest.

29
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,485
Max Whitford's just gonna try
and fuck you, trust me.

30
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,925
You seem savvy. We're putting in

31
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,925
another Sunset Brooks
senior care center.

32
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,592
You'd need a hundred to play.

33
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,092
Then I got a hundred
in my pocket.

34
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,800
We did it.

35
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:19,634
- I need a sponsor.
- Me?

36
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,258
Helping another AA member's

37
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,776
a hell of a lot better
for your sobriety

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,675
than chasing after a kid
who's not yours.

39
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:28,634
I'll sponsor you. Come on.

40
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:32,217
We someone who will promote
and protect our values!

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,925
What about Mo White?

42
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,300
Let's make Chicago White again!

43
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,258
Mo White?

44
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:40,425
Yeah. Who are you?

45
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,467
Your country needs you.

46
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,509
That'll show those
misogynistic motherfuckers.

47
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,300
Fuck, yes!

48
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,425
Only two dicks left.

49
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,342
Clearly you haven't had
much experience

50
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,342
around a dick.
It's more like this.

51
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:26,758
Ooh. Hey.

52
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,592
- En garde!
- Ooh!

53
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,509
Ooh!

54
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,175
Shh, shh!

55
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah, we're gonna get busted.

56
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:39,634
Okay, who's next?

57
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,800
This one.

58
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,092
Hell, no.

59
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,841
Yo, yo,
Darryl fucking Feathers, man!

60
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,342
He was the foreman
at my last job.

61
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,550
Shit. This one gets two dicks.

62
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,092
Hey.

63
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,634
Hey.

64
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,008
Um...

65
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,092
The fuck you doing?

66
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,883
Waiting.

67
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,133
- Waiting for what?
- Shim.

68
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:31,509
Good morning,
my indigenous South Siders!

69
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:32,634
Don't mind me.

70
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,509
Just showing our support

71
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,217
for a better tomorrow.

72
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,050
Hi.

73
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,425
W-what's a "shim"?

74
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,925
Shim. God.

75
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,716
But God doesn't have a gender,
or maybe it's both genders,

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,092
so she, himShim.

77
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,175
Mother-father God.

78
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,425
And you're waiting
for Shim to...

79
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,133
Talk to me.

80
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:59,258
Tell me what to do next.

81
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,133
Does that happen a lot?

82
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,258
Used to all the time in jail,

83
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:05,425
but since I've been out,
nothing.

84
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,133
That's because
it never happened.

85
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,258
Shim,

86
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,092
a higher power,
the great I Am, Great Spirit...

87
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:15,050
Call it whatever you want...
But it ain't talking to you.

88
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,300
And we weren't talking to you.

89
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,509
Enlightenment, or whatever
these new-fangled

90
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,384
hippy-dippy religions
are selling,

91
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,634
is a waste of time.

92
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:26,509
Gay Jesus, Taoism,

93
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,675
Scientology, Christian Science,

94
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:33,592
Joel Osteen, Deepak Chopra...

95
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,300
It's like going
to one of those flaky schools

96
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,675
where the students create
their own curriculum,

97
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:41,883
then don't get graded on it.

98
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,716
Religion isn't a startup, Ian.

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,592
You want God to talk to you,

100
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:48,384
you gotta stick with
the classics Buddhism,

101
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,883
Judaism, Christianity.

102
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,883
And if you break the rules,

103
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,342
you burn in hell
for all eternity.

104
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:56,800
And there's your enlightenment.

105
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:59,092
In the meantime,

106
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,966
I shall be saving the South Side

107
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,300
from the endless caravan
of immigrants.

108
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,716
All right.
You guys should get going?

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,300
Come on.
You don't want to be late

110
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,925
for your first day.
Of public school.

111
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,509
That's the one thing
they care about.

112
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:14,883
Wait.

113
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:19,883
There.

114
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,883
Later.

115
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,342
Hey, buddy, Liam,
might want to lose the tie.

116
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,509
No? Okay.

117
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,841
We're making sandwiches
now, Pops?

118
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,966
You think that's weird?

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,550
Here you go, Miss Riley.

120
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:14,467
I can assure you,
there was no suffering.

121
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,217
Bless you, sweet boy.

122
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,716
Sparky's in a better place.

123
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,509
We done?

124
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,050
Ta-da! What do you think?

125
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,175
It's an empty lot.

126
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,258
Yeah, 1/10th of which
belongs to me.

127
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,050
But it's not about
what it looks like now.

128
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,925
It's about what it's gonna be.

129
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,592
You're looking
at the future site

130
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,675
of Sunset Brook Senior Care,
phase two.

131
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,925
It's nice?

132
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,425
""? What is ""?

133
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,509
Well, just seems
like they could've put

134
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,112
a bit more money
into the architecture,

135
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,800
you know?

136
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:09,634
Well, they're going for a

137
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,050
really simple, practical,

138
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,300
kind of European vibe.
I love it.

139
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,133
Yeah, well,
it's definitely practical.

140
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:16,897
Is this the thing
Whitford sucked you into?

141
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,217
Whitford didn't suck me
into anything.

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,008
I invested
in a limited partnership.

143
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,716
So Max Whitford

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,092
makes all the decisions?

145
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,467
The general partner does, yes.

146
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,300
It's an LLC, which means
my liability is limited,

147
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,425
so I can't get sued
by some junkie roofer.

148
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,175
So you can only lose
all your investment,

149
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,133
- which was how much again?
- 100,000.

150
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,716
100,000?

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,300
- Dollars?
- With a 30% return

152
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,758
expected in less than a year.

153
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,758
Come on.
Still got 12 blocks to go.

154
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,634
Christ. Seriously?

155
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,342
Don't worry, Sparky.

156
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm gonna be with you here
till the end.

157
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,384
"Pablo would like
to play and run.

158
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,300
He'd spend his day
in the bright, warm sun."

159
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,092
Hey. Morning.

160
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,966
Sorry. The meeting's
done already?

161
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,300
They're just getting

162
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,092
- startedthere you go.
- Hey, man.

163
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:25,384
Thanks for letting me call you
at 200 a.m.

164
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,300
Yeah, that's what sponsors
are for, you know?

165
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,966
Could I get you
to sign my court sheet?

166
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,509
Yeah, look, you gotta
be on time, though, all right?

167
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:35,675
I don't sign for short-timers.

168
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:36,675
Sorry.

169
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:37,966
It's all right.

170
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,509
Hello?

171
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,925
Shit. Is she okay?

172
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:52,675
Yeah. All right, okay.

173
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,485
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Yo, I gotta go, all right?

174
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,175
My kid's in the emergency room.

175
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,008
You have a kid?

176
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:00,675
We need more dicks.

177
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,841
I know!

178
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,568
So I know these women in my
trade school welding class.

179
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,841
- I think they can help.
- Cool.

180
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,692
You know if you mouth
the words "olive juice,"

181
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,026
it looks like you're saying
"I love you"?

182
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,175
- What?
- Watch.

183
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,342
My God. It totally does.

184
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:19,966
Right?

185
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,401
Yeah, I don't have
many straight friends.

186
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,342
I kind of like this.

187
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:26,175
Me too.
I like having a gay friend.

188
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,217
How old were you when
you realized you were gay?

189
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,008
The second they slapped my ass

190
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,342
and cut the umbilical cord.

191
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:33,883
Okay.

192
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,758
Shit. Look.

193
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,217
Luh-luh-look.

194
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,050
I love it.

195
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:45,509
Hey.

196
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,425
What the hell?

197
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,300
They made a list
of the rapiest bars

198
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,716
in the South Side,
and The Alibi's number one?

199
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
I haven't raped anybody in here.

200
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,384
No one's ever raped
anyone in here!

201
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,627
At least not in the inside.
Out in the alleyway, maybe.

202
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,234
But I knew people thought
The Alibi was shitty,

203
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,675
but now they think we're rapey?

204
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,425
- Who says we're rapey?
- Some stupid article.

205
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,925
Give it to me. Who wrote it?

206
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,800
Bethany Pickford-Watson.

207
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:21,384
Of course she has
two last names.

208
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,342
Does she look familiar to you?

209
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:24,841
- Probably some lesbo.
- No. No.

210
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,610
- I'd hit that for sure.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

211
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,883
"They even pay black prostitutes

212
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,692
with fake boobs to walk around
in short skirts."

213
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:31,841
I'ma kill that bitch.

214
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,050
This is so unfair.

215
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,550
I mean, look around.

216
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,050
W-w-what's so rapey
about this place, anyway?

217
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,485
I don't know, V.
Maybe this place

218
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,300
- is a little rapey.
- You think?

219
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,092
Craig has his dick out
right now.

220
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,883
Craig! Damn it, man!

221
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,258
Ball bag was hot.

222
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,883
Just a little pop quiz

223
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,175
to see how your weekend was.

224
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:13,300
Just kidding.
It's actually ten questions

225
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,550
to see if you remember
how to diagram a sentence.

226
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,300
Liam.

227
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:22,841
Since this is your first day,

228
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,841
I don't expect you
to know any of this.

229
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,467
Just do the best you can.

230
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,092
Begin.

231
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,050
Psst.

232
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,300
Psst, hey.

233
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,883
Greetings, fellow men
of leisure!

234
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,217
I brought free shit for ya,

235
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,342
so wear it with pride.

236
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:04,050
I got hats. Here you go.

237
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,925
Hats for everyone.

238
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,050
V, can I get a little, um...

239
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,800
What else have I got?

240
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,175
T-shirts. Check these out.

241
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,800
Pass 'em down there.

242
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,841
These are cool.
One size fits all.

243
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:18,258
What else do I have?
Bumper stickers.

244
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:20,300
Here, pass those down,
would you?

245
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,592
And, of course, it wouldn't be
a political campaign

246
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,425
without buttons.

247
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,883
Thank you, V.

248
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:33,217
"Mo White Mo Better."

249
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,925
You know that's racist, right?

250
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,675
And, needless to say,

251
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,175
your political contributions
are welcome

252
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,509
and most appreciated.

253
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,925
Are you joking me?

254
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,425
Need I remind you,
gentlemen and lady,

255
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,175
what is at stake here?

256
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:51,925
No one is protecting us.

257
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,217
Mo White is our only hope.

258
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,509
You sure this isn't
about the money, Frank?

259
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:59,217
Of course it's about the money,
Tommy!

260
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,384
Contributions are the lifeblood
of a political campaign.

261
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,384
Do you really think the Ruiz
or Wyman campaign

262
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,675
gives a shit about us?

263
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:10,300
Hell, no!

264
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,008
They're too busy whining

265
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:16,092
about equality
and cultural heritage.

266
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,758
They're not even
from the South Side!

267
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,925
And I don't know that they were

268
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,133
born in this country.

269
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,509
Ruiz?

270
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:28,509
The hell kind of a name is that?

271
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,966
I'd like to see
that birth certificate.

272
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:40,675
Mo White will fight
for the things we care about.

273
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,883
Thank you, man.
Thank you. Gentlemen?

274
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,634
Come on, guys. Let's do this.

275
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,467
I know. It's a bitter pill.

276
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,425
We gotta do it for our own good.

277
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,675
Here you go. There you go.

278
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,008
Don't look at me like that.
Come on. Come on.

279
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,175
- Guys, come on.
- Come on. South Side!

280
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,342
It's important.

281
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,675
Fine.

282
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm not even gonna ask.

283
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:10,258
If you will excuse me...

284
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,841
I got some winnin' to do.

285
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,883
Make sure you vote!

286
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:21,550
I still can't believe
you invested

287
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,550
$100,000 in a vacant lot.

288
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,509
Yep. Signing the papers tonight,

289
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,509
and then we're gonna flip it
quick.

290
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,966
I'm meeting him at 700.

291
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,342
Does Whitford even know
about me?

292
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,550
Does he know about me,
that we're together?

293
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,716
Yeah, we talked about you.

294
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,883
Who are you selling it to?

295
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,758
Sunset Brook.

296
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,509
They're in negotiations
to buy the land.

297
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:48,467
Hi!

298
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,342
So the deal isn't done yet?

299
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,758
Why are you shitting
on my parade?

300
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:53,758
Just because you don't think
it's a good idea

301
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:55,481
doesn't mean you gotta be
a dick about it.

302
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,467
I'm not trying to be a dick.

303
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,300
I'm just saying
that it might be...

304
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,008
I thought we were
gonna eat together.

305
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,942
We can't sit at the table
like normal human beings?

306
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,883
Yeah, but then
the fries get cold.

307
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,443
- Who likes cold French fries?
- Well you didn't even

308
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,258
order fries. Those are my fries.

309
00:16:10,342 --> 00:16:11,610
Well, here.
You can't eat them all.

310
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,883
Thank you very much.

311
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:18,092
Listen, for the record,
I do fully support you.

312
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,217
Phase two is...
is gonna be great.

313
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,859
Well, don't just say it
'cause you think

314
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,151
it's what I want to hear.
Be honest.

315
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,443
I was being honest,
and then you told me

316
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,925
I was shitting all over
your parade.

317
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,675
Can I have
my cheeseburger, please?

318
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah.

319
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,384
Thank you.

320
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:33,841
I'll be at the table.

321
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:01,675
Look, I've never been
to a Buddhist temple before.

322
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:04,966
I need Shim to talk to me.

323
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,716
God. To talk to me.

324
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,634
Any tips?

325
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:15,634
Repeat. "I'm here to learn."

326
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:17,133
I'm here to learn.

327
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,008
"I take refuge

328
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:20,384
in the Buddha."

329
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,425
I take refuge in the Buddha.

330
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,758
"Until I attain enlightenment."

331
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,425
Until I attain enlightenment.

332
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,467
Quick question.

333
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:41,716
Once I attain enlightenment,

334
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,592
then will Shim talk to me?

335
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,716
'Cause they did for a while.

336
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,716
But then, suddenly, it stopped.

337
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,008
So did Shim stop talking to me,

338
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,300
or did I stop hearing Shim?

339
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,841
I got this, Ralph.

340
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,300
- You sure?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

341
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,634
I'll take care of Bootsie.

342
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:10,384
Okay. Thanks, Carl.

343
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:13,342
See you tomorrow.

344
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,217
Don't worry, Bootsie.

345
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,050
No serenity for you today.

346
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,634
Get your dumb-ass tote bag
out of my space!

347
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,509
It's actually not a tote bag.

348
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:38,841
It's a satchel.

349
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,384
And who the hell
starts a new school

350
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,859
with three weeks left
in the school year?

351
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,092
All the private schools
were full.

352
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:48,634
Fucking satchel boy.

353
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,217
I have two daughters.
What kind of father am I

354
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,716
if I'm also the owner
of the local rapery?

355
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,509
V got to you, didn't she?

356
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:02,966
The Alibi should be a sanctuary,

357
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,675
a haven where women
can come, relax,

358
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,384
and only get laid
if they want to.

359
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,651
We could all use a place
where we could

360
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,384
get laid if we wanted to.

361
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,526
In this day and age, you can't

362
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,258
say shit to a woman

363
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:15,925
without her crying harassment.
Hell, they'd sue

364
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,716
their own reflections
if they could.

365
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,675
I'm just not gonna talk
to them anymore.

366
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,092
No one talks to your ass anyway.

367
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,758
Yeah, but if they did,
I wouldn't say anything.

368
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,258
Creepily glaring at them
is not the answer.

369
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:28,925
Hell, I probably catcalled
nine or ten women yesterday.

370
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,901
- You think women like that?
- I'm in construction.

371
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:32,425
I can't just change.
Doesn't matter

372
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,092
if time's up or not.
If a chick walks by,

373
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,883
I instinctively grab my balls,

374
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:38,776
and yell "Suck on this."
It's just what happens.

375
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,008
All right, let's start there.

376
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,925
You can't call 'em chicks
anymore.

377
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,467
Tail?

378
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,092
- No.
- Wool?

379
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,716
No.

380
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,925
Women?

381
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,467
I don't think so.

382
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,092
Contains the word "men."

383
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,425
I got it.

384
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,008
Vaginal enterprises.

385
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,092
Okay, I'm out.

386
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:02,758
Maybe we should just
stick with "women."

387
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:05,133
Some... women...

388
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,800
That's better.

389
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:09,133
Some women like
to be told they're pretty.

390
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:10,467
Now, how are we supposed

391
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,942
to know the difference
between the ones

392
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,234
that like it
and the ones that don't?

393
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:15,008
Old women like being hit on.

394
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:16,883
Maybe we should just allow
the old women in.

395
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,008
- Kermit!
- Why the hell

396
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,675
would we want that?

397
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,467
We need a consistent standard.

398
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,342
All right, here's your standard.

399
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,634
Assume you are disgusting,

400
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,175
that no one wants you
to touch them,

401
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,925
and they couldn't care less
if you think

402
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:30,425
they're pretty or not...
There's your damn standard.

403
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,509
I've never been so confused.

404
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,133
The bottom line

405
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,050
is that the bar
can't be rapey anymore.

406
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,716
If women stay away,

407
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,634
bad for business.

408
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,966
Plus, rapey is wrong.

409
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,634
A-and more importantly,
rapey is wrong.

410
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,758
What's that twirly writing?

411
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,425
Cursive.

412
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,509
- You know cursive.
- Yes, ma'am.

413
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,425
Wow.

414
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,675
Sorry, 'scuse me!

415
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,509
Hi. Hey, I'm looking

416
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:10,966
for a Xan,

417
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,966
Last name?

418
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,592
Um, Galvez.

419
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,467
Xan Galvez.

420
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,092
Is she here? She okay?

421
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,384
And you are...

422
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,175
Lip. I'm her, umher brother.

423
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:29,509
Sorry, don't have
any record of a Xan.

424
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,800
She... she has really crazy hair,

425
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,425
she came in with a broken arm.

426
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,109
We had a girl come in earlier
with a broken arm.

427
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,509
Yeah?

428
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,133
Let's see...

429
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:40,467
- Alexandra Galvez?
- Yes, that's her.

430
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,817
Have a seat.
We'll be with you in a minute.

431
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,300
All right.

432
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,634
Hi, I'm Frank Gallagher,

433
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:53,634
and, that's Mo White.

434
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,592
- He's running for Congress.
- Hello.

435
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,592
And what is your name,
if you don't mind my asking?

436
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,758
Evelyn. Evelyn Thomas.

437
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,258
Well, Evelyn,

438
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:03,550
the reason we're here

439
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:05,133
is that Mo is a

440
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:06,841
proud South Sider,
just like yourself.

441
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,384
He grew up two blocks
from here, over on Halsted,

442
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,425
in what is now a crack den.

443
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,342
And the point being, Evelyn,

444
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,342
it's time for us to take pride

445
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:20,008
in the South Side,

446
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:22,342
and that starts
with good people like you.

447
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,758
Sir, I don't give a rat's ass
about the South Side.

448
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,217
I don't even have a damn job.

449
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,592
I don't either,

450
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:33,008
which is why we need
Mo White in office!

451
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:35,258
- Right, Mo?
- That's right.

452
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:39,300
Mo wants to bring the jobs

453
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:41,966
back to the working people
in the South Side,

454
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,050
the people whose parents and
grandparents built this city!

455
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:48,175
Pride is what made
the South Side safe

456
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,050
and strong, and that all starts

457
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,467
with one thing, which is what?

458
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,634
A job.

459
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:54,342
A job. Bingo.

460
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,258
Would you mind
if we put a sign on your yard

461
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,925
to show your support for Mo?

462
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:00,133
Yeah, I guess that'd be okay.
Sure.

463
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:01,651
That's the South Side pride
I'm talking about.

464
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:03,716
All right. South Side pride.

465
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,883
- You bet.
- I like that.

466
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,258
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

467
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:09,092
Sorry. $10, please.

468
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,966
What?

469
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,592
Any contribution
is gratefully welcome.

470
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,675
We suggest 10.

471
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,425
Some people are doing $20.

472
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:22,758
Thank you, Evelyn.

473
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:30,509
No, I got it. I got it.

474
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,966
Are you awake?

475
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,634
Sorry.

476
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,300
Hey, um,

477
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:08,800
have you achieved enlightenment
here before?

478
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,008
I'm just... I'm not

479
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:11,300
really getting anything.

480
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:15,092
Okay, rough estimate,

481
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,841
how long does it normally take?

482
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,217
For Buddha, it took one night.

483
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,592
Well, that's not that bad.

484
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,300
After ages and lives
of meditation.

485
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:25,384
Right, okay.

486
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,384
I don't have that kind of time.

487
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,008
Namaste.

489
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:20,550
Hey.

490
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,384
Hey.

491
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:37,634
Hey, you okay?
What the hell happened to you?

492
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,092
Fell off the jungle gym.

493
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,258
Made it to the top, though.

494
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,758
Good job.

495
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,133
Does that hurt?

496
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:44,716
- A little.
- Hi.

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,925
- Are you the father?
- No.

498
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,716
No, no, I'm the, brother.

499
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,841
My dad's a drunk,
and my mom disappeared.

500
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,758
Are you the guardian?

501
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,800
No, not exactly.

502
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:59,175
Okay, well, we'll get her
over to X-ray and set the arm.

503
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,716
- Okay.
- And we can only release her

504
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,758
to a parent or legal guardian.
Okay, sweetie.

505
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,467
Okay.

506
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,300
Right back this way.

507
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,675
Hey, V. Shot of Jaeger?

508
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:16,133
Hey, Carl. No way.

509
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,133
What, I can die for our country

510
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,675
but can't get a simple liquor

511
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,384
- till I'm 21?
- It's an incentive.

512
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,217
You don't die, you get to drink.

513
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,568
But you're not gonna stay alive
in the South Side for long

514
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:26,068
if you keep carrying
that little poodle around.

515
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,925
It's a Yorkie,
and he has cancer.

516
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:30,300
Probably only a few days
left to live.

517
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,384
- For the dog, not you.
- Thank you.

518
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,883
Whatcha doing
with a cancer dog, anyway?

519
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:38,485
Community service.
Need it to get into.

520
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,841
- West Point.
- You're going to West Point?

521
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:43,217
Want to, but it'll
probably never happen.

522
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,692
Went to
Congressman Ubberman's office,

523
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,050
see if he could recommend me,

524
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,800
but I couldn't even
get an appointment.

525
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:49,758
Ubberman. He's a congressman?

526
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,841
You know him?

527
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:51,966
White guy? Red face?

528
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,133
- Sweaty?
- Yeah.

529
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:55,050
I'll be damned!

530
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:58,634
Hey, babe, did you know
that Wubby's a congressman?

531
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:00,133
Seriously?

532
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:01,966
When I was a dominatrix,

533
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,384
he was one of my regulars.

534
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,384
Dude used to like me to whip him

535
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,342
- and call him Wubby.
- And now he's a congressman.

536
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:09,800
Do you still whip him?

537
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,758
I retired years ago.

538
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,008
Leather underwear is not
too good for my lady parts.

539
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,758
Would you ever think
about coming out of retirement?

540
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:18,300
- Never.
- Even if it meant giving

541
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:19,258
an underprivileged
South Side kid

542
00:27:19,342 --> 00:27:21,467
a chance at achieving his dream?

543
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,925
S&M is not like
riding a bike, Carl.

544
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,925
You can't just strap on
a pair of stilettos,

545
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,109
pop a ball gag
in someone's mouth,

546
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,467
and start to whipping them.

547
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,384
That is not how you ride a bike.

548
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,634
I mean, that's okay.
Who's gonna let

549
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:35,384
a poor South Side kid
become an officer, anyway?

550
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,050
I'll just enlist,
embrace the suck,

551
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:41,175
retire an old, disabled,
sad alcoholic.

552
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,133
Maybe they'll let me
teach high school ROTC

553
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:45,425
from my wheelchair if I'm lucky.

554
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,300
Come on, Bootsie.
I know you gotta eat.

555
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,258
Hello.
I'm afraid you just missed

556
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:16,716
the Chabot morning service.

557
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,342
Actually, I was just,

558
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:19,883
looking for some answers.

559
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,342
I'm the rabbi.
What's the question?

560
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,467
If a religion or a movement

561
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,883
makes the world a better place,
does it matter

562
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,109
if it goes
in a different direction

563
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,841
than originally intended?

564
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,734
Well, you pretty much
just summed up every religion.

565
00:28:31,758 --> 00:28:34,675
A better question might be
"What is God's will?"

566
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,966
That's exactly
what I want to know.

567
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,966
- Does God speak to you?
- I pray to God, yeah,

568
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,425
but in the Jewish faith,

569
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,901
we believe that the five books
of the Torah

570
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,050
are the word of God.

571
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,342
Kind of like the Bible.

572
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,175
Just the first part.

573
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,758
Yeah, I read it.
So... God did speak to someone?

574
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,008
To Moses, and Moses...

575
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,550
wrote it down.

576
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:55,175
But he spoke to him, with words?

577
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:57,883
But only to Moses.

578
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,550
No one else, ever?

579
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:03,758
Not with words.
He did set a bush on fire once.

580
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,716
What is it with religions
and setting things on fire?

581
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:24,008
Hey.

582
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,300
'Sup, nerd?

583
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,050
Got a deal for you.

584
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,008
- Vikes?
- What?

585
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:30,925
No. See that girl over there?

586
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,758
Cracker Girl? What about her?

587
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,841
She wants to kill me,

588
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:39,509
so what I was thinking

589
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,175
what if I help you
get better grades?

590
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:43,467
Like, with homework and stuff?

591
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,175
For free?

592
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,966
No, for protection
from Cracker Girl.

593
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:52,925
I am failing the shit
out of this class.

594
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,092
Okay, deal.

595
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:56,384
Name's Todd.

596
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,008
Liam.

597
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:05,258
Yes?

598
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:07,175
Wrong house. Sorry.

599
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:09,592
Whoa, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

600
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,758
You a Wyman supporter?

601
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:14,425
I am.

602
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:16,966
Mo White. And you are?

603
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,634
Dee Sanders.

604
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,592
Well, Dee, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

605
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:23,758
Look, I know Wyman
is an African-American,

606
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:25,425
but is that
why you're voting for her?

607
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:27,342
Absolutely. I always do.

608
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,509
And that is terrific, unless...

609
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,800
you want your street repaved.

610
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:34,925
Look at these potholes, Dee.

611
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,925
Wyman's been in Congress
for ten years.

612
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:38,592
You still have potholes.

613
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:42,008
We need to repair
our infrastructure.

614
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:45,425
The South Side was
the crown jewel of Chicago

615
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,384
Clean, safe parks where families

616
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:50,425
and friends could picnic
and unwind.

617
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,300
We were a community.
We looked out for each other.

618
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,716
Wewe were a family.

619
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,550
Now,

620
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,592
it's a liquor store
on every corner,

621
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,384
graffiti on every sign.

622
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,675
Yeah, it's just sad.

623
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:06,300
My question to you is,

624
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:07,716
will a Martin Luther King

625
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,634
African Arts Center fix that?

626
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:12,883
We could use that money
to repave your street,

627
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:16,133
clean our parks, make
the South Side proud again,

628
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:18,175
and that's why
I'm running for Congress, Dee.

629
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,675
South Side pride.

630
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:23,800
And I'd really appreciate
your vote, Dee.

631
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,008
South Side pride.

632
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,217
Help me make it happen.

633
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:40,050
I'm Mo White.

634
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,568
- I'm running for Congress.
- Mo White!

635
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:44,008
- Mo White.
- Mo White. Mo White.

636
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:46,592
We'd like to put
a sign in your yard.

637
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,592
- I'm running for Congress.
- Mo White.

638
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,675
Mo White. You're not
gonna find him on the ballot.

639
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,050
Look what we've got for you.

640
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:03,966
Want a hat, too?

641
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:17,384
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

642
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:25,467
Too sexy.

643
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,092
That's nice.

644
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,258
Think it's too casual.

645
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,133
God, that's boring.
Is that even mine?

646
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:39,592
No. No.

647
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:42,550
Fuck. What the hell do you wear

648
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:45,467
to a 700 business meeting
at a hotel bar?

649
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,384
It's in a bar?

650
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,175
Where?

651
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,966
Just gonna be you and Max,

652
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,925
or will there be
other people there?

653
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,425
Yeah, it's me and Max

654
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,217
at a bar, signing papers.

655
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,758
Super exciting.

656
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:02,342
Can I tag along?

657
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:03,675
No.

658
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:08,384
It'll make me look weak
if you're there.

659
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:10,841
Like, "Hi, I'm just
a stupid woman."

660
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:15,175
I can't sign a document myself,
so I brought along some dude."

661
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:18,592
- Some dude?
- You know what I mean.

662
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:19,925
No, I don't know what you mean.

663
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:22,425
I don't know
what the fuck we are.

664
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:25,217
So now you want a
relationship? What the fuck?

665
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,758
I was asking you how you feel
about usnormal question.

666
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,425
Why are we having
this conversation now?

667
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,258
Do you not trust me?

668
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:34,716
I trust you. I just...

669
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I don't trust Whitford.

670
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,550
So you're jealous?

671
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,217
Yeah, I'm fucking jealous. Yeah.

672
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,258
You happy?

673
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:47,133
I'm doing a business deal
with Max.

674
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:49,425
We're going to communicate.
We're going to text.

675
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,925
We're gonna have meetings.

676
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:55,384
If that makes you jealous,
I'm sorry.

677
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,300
But it doesn't mean
that I'm gonna sleep with him.

678
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:02,300
What it does mean

679
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:04,800
is that I need
new fucking clothes.

680
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:22,634
No way I'ma be able to get

681
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:23,841
my post-baby feet in these.

682
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,467
I should put those
in the dry cleaner.

683
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,217
Hello, old friend.

684
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,634
Sorry, dude. I got here

685
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,092
as quick as I could.
Is she all right?

686
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:49,883
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She got a broken arm,

687
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:51,443
but she's fine.
Look, I need you to be her dad.

688
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,258
What?

689
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,758
They'll only release her
to a parent or a guardian,

690
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:57,425
so I need you
to pretend to be her dad.

691
00:34:57,509 --> 00:35:01,133
- Also, you're a drunk.
- I'm not doing that.

692
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:02,758
Brad, come on, help me out here.

693
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,467
So you want me
to impersonate her father?

694
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,925
Yeah, and sign some paperwork,

695
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:07,151
but I already filled out
most of it.

696
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:08,634
Well, why can't you do it?

697
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:10,175
I'm not old enough
to be her dad,

698
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,942
and plus, I already told them
I was her brother.

699
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:13,675
So I'm your father, too?

700
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,675
Yeah.
Father, stepfather, whatever.

701
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,258
I'm not old enough
to be your father!

702
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:18,675
Yeah, but you look old.

703
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,800
Dude, I'm married now.

704
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,592
Okay, I just got
my shit together.

705
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:24,258
No way am I getting sucked

706
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:26,550
into your weirdo
Gallagher vortex.

707
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:27,734
What the fuck? Brad, please.

708
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,109
Look, if I don't get her
out of here,

709
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:30,716
they're gonna call DCFS.

710
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,318
You can't just walk
into an emergency room

711
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,425
and pretend to be

712
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,758
- some kid's da...
- Shh!

713
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:38,175
This is the universe telling you

714
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:41,384
to do the right thing.
What if Xan was seriously hurt?

715
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,758
You ever think about that?
You're not her parent.

716
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,675
You wouldn't be able
to help her.

717
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:47,258
- Look, Brad...
- Sorry, dude.

718
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:48,716
Brad.

719
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:54,092
Was that the father?

720
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:55,217
Yeah.

721
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,050
There he goes.

722
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,300
Mr. Reliable.

723
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,342
God, this feels good!

724
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:07,800
We're doing important work
here, Frank!

725
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:10,258
South Side loves you.
We're doing great.

726
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,092
And I love the South Side.

727
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:14,592
You know, the least I could do
is help these people

728
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,300
remember what our neighborhood
stands for?

729
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,592
Mo White is back!

730
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,384
What happened?

731
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,342
Nothing, nothing.

732
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,716
You sure?

733
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,634
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

734
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,175
Geez. L-le-le-let's go this way.

735
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:33,800
What the hell is happening?
Are you all right?

736
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:35,467
Never better. Never better.

737
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,008
Are you in pain?

738
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:38,883
Mo, I'm your campaign manager.

739
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,716
If you've got
a health condition,

740
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,925
you gotta tell me about it.

741
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,384
I don't have a health condition!

742
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,342
I just have to watch
where I walk.

743
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:47,716
That's all. Hey, isis,

744
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,509
is there a school nearby?

745
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:52,175
Why?

746
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,634
Ankle bracelet. Whenever I get

747
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:58,050
within 100 yards of a school,

748
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,092
- I get this little shock.
- What?

749
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,217
Why do you wear
an ankle bracelet

750
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,217
that shocks you
when you get near a school?

751
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,050
It was years ago. She told me

752
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,758
she was 18, but...

753
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:10,175
But? But what, Mo?

754
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:12,175
- She wasn't.
- What?

755
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:13,758
Look, we were in love.

756
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:15,384
We were together for five years.

757
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,800
She left me!

758
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:18,217
On her 20th birthday.

759
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,550
So she was 15.

760
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:22,342
Frank, will you calm down?

761
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:24,175
I paid my dues.

762
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:25,675
Well, then why do you have
to wear

763
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:26,925
a fucking ankle bracelet?

764
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,288
It's only
for another six months,

765
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:29,758
until...

766
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,342
Until I'm off parole.

767
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:33,758
Frank, listen.

768
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:35,966
Don't give up on me.

769
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,467
These people...

770
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,509
They need me.

771
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,425
Hi. My name is Tyrell.

772
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:17,050
What the hell is this?

773
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,133
This is a consent form.

774
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:22,342
From now on, any woman
you want to harass

775
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,800
has to give her written consent

776
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,716
before you're allowed
to bother her.

777
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,841
No woman's gonna sign this
unless she's hammered.

778
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:30,883
She has to be sober.

779
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,175
I'm never, ever
getting laid again.

780
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:35,966
Did you ever think you were?

781
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,675
Also, The Alibi will no longer
be serving

782
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:40,841
any drink called
Sex on the Beach.

783
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,467
It will only be known
as "The Beach."

784
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,634
What is this, Acapulco?
Nobody drinks those.

785
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,008
Women do.

786
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,841
TV-wise,
while we'll still be showing

787
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:51,175
the White Sox games,
we're gonna be introducing

788
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,342
some alternative programming
for the ladies.

789
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:55,509
- Like what?
- Cooking shows?

790
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:56,592
Ellen?

791
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,258
This is Us.

792
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:00,384
Let's not get carried away,
Kermit.

793
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,675
What?

794
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,342
Got it on eBay for $21.

795
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:21,133
Really?

796
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:22,425
No. That thing's, like,

797
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:24,217
300 years old.

798
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,800
You thinking about converting?

799
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,467
What?

800
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,590
You're wearing a yarmulke.

801
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,509
Yno.

802
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:35,133
Just, looking around.

803
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:37,716
Well, let me know
if you see anything you like.

804
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,133
Wait.

805
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:44,966
Do you know what God
wants us to do next?

806
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,883
- I have a pretty good idea.
- You do?

807
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:48,258
How? Did God talk to you?

808
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:50,634
No.

809
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:52,175
Someone's gotta have answers.

810
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:55,217
It's called the Bible. Read it.

811
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,342
This stuff's been figured out
since day one.

812
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,758
Day 39. Whatever.

813
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,841
Whenever Eve ate that apple.

814
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:02,592
You really believe
there was an Eve?

815
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:04,175
Don't overthink it.

816
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:06,008
You want to know
what God wants you to do?

817
00:40:06,092 --> 00:40:08,092
Start with the Ten Commandments.

818
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:10,467
They're commandments.

819
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:16,384
Okay.

820
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:21,467
Greetings, Mo White supporters.
Hey, Kev,

821
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,008
couple of cold ones
for your future congressman

822
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:27,008
and his loyal campaign manager.

823
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,883
And two whiskey chasers, please.

824
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:33,258
Gentlemen, if I could have
your attention, please.

825
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:35,384
The fact that you might want me

826
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,300
- as your congressman again...
- Kev!

827
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:38,966
That means a lot.

828
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,175
I would like to clear
my existing tab,

829
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:45,467
and here's a hundie
for the next one.

830
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,634
Thank you, my good man.

831
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,675
Thank you, Frank.

832
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:51,133
And nobody understands
the people of the South Side

833
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,550
- better than Mo White.
- That's right.

834
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,217
- You want better jobs!
- Yeah.

835
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,925
- You want safer streets.
- Yeah.

836
00:40:57,008 --> 00:40:58,592
You want
more affordable housing.

837
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:00,050
- Yeah.
- Well, then,

838
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:03,050
I humbly, humbly,
ask for your vote.

839
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,258
Cheers.

840
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,342
Another round!

841
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,258
And, you are?

842
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:14,258
If I could just have you
sign this right here.

843
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:16,342
Thank you.

844
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,384
Consent form.

845
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,425
Here we go.
For the thousandth time,

846
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,050
there was no way I could know

847
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,675
that girl was only 15.

848
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:25,217
What?

849
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,925
And my relationship with Heather

850
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,467
is long behind me now.

851
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,758
And did you know that in China,

852
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:33,175
the age of consent is 13?

853
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,300
And that is a country
on the rise.

854
00:41:35,384 --> 00:41:36,883
Shit. Okay, thank you, Mo.

855
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:38,509
Thank you. Thank you so much.

856
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:41,175
All right.
We will see you at the polls.

857
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,133
I remember this dude! They hiked

858
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:44,925
the Appalachian Trail together.
Said he was

859
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:46,716
helping her get a merit badge.

860
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,258
Mo left Congress to care
for his dying wife.

861
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,467
Mo left Congress
to bang a 15-year-old.

862
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,550
She said she was 18,
and you should've seen her.

863
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:57,092
Look at this, you tell me
this girl looks 15?

864
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:59,217
Jesus! She looks like she's ten.

865
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,883
12, maybe.

866
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:02,634
Okay, okay.
Did Mo make a mistake?

867
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:04,050
Yes, he did.

868
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,133
But he regrets it,

869
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:08,384
and what's more important,
he paid for it.

870
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,550
He went to jail.

871
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:14,300
He's been rehabilitated.
The system works.

872
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:17,050
I think what we all
have to keep in mind here

873
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,050
is that Mo's
a great congressman,

874
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:23,133
and before that,
he was the best football coach

875
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:25,342
that Robert E. Lee High
ever had,

876
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,716
and do you know
what's even more American

877
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,008
than football?

878
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:31,342
Second chances.

879
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,966
Hell, this whole country
was built on second chances.

880
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,966
O.J. got one.

881
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,175
He blew it, but he got one.

882
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:41,175
Teddy Kennedy, the man
you don't want behind the wheel

883
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,068
if you need a ride
to the other end of the bridge?

884
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,966
Reelected seven times.

885
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,342
And admit it,
we're all pulling for Tiger

886
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:50,258
every time he walks
on the course.

887
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:53,008
My point is,
we all make mistakes.

888
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,800
Don't we all
want a second chance?

889
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:58,050
Man, I know I do.

890
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,716
And for the South Side,

891
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,550
Mo White is that second chance.

892
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:08,342
You got my vote, Mo.

893
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:09,634
Mo White.

894
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:11,300
- Mo White!
- Mo White!

895
00:43:11,384 --> 00:43:13,425
Mo White! Mo White!

896
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,634
Mo White! Mo White!

897
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,800
Mo White! Mo White!

898
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,300
Mo White! Mo White!

899
00:43:19,384 --> 00:43:20,925
Another round! Let's go!

900
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:27,425
Yeah!

901
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:29,425
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Congressman,

902
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:30,841
but there's a...

903
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,175
- Lenora.
- Lenora here to see you.

904
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:35,384
She says she has an appointment,

905
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,675
but I don't have it
on the calendar.

906
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,467
Congressman Ubberman
will see you now.

907
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,258
Thank you so much.

908
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:03,217
Hi, I'm Denise.

909
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,460
Are you Alexandra's guardian?

910
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,175
- Um, yeah.
- Great.

911
00:44:06,258 --> 00:44:07,276
Can I have your driver's license

912
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,050
and insurance card, please?

913
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,467
Um...

914
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,384
look, Denise,

915
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,675
technically, I'm not
her legal guardian.

916
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,384
All right? But I'm...

917
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:20,467
I'm looking out for her
until her mother gets back.

918
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,008
But you don't know
when that's gonna be?

919
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:25,008
No.

920
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:27,550
You know where she is, though?

921
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:29,550
No.

922
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,675
Okay, I'm a social worker
here at the hospital.

923
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,841
They sent me down here
because they have concerns

924
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,217
about Alexandra's household.

925
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,592
What does that mean?

926
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:40,692
You say you're her brother,
and then you're her guardian.

927
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:42,800
A man shows up and then leaves,
and now you say

928
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,526
you're taking care of her
until her mother comes back,

929
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,258
but she said her mother's
not coming back.

930
00:44:46,342 --> 00:44:47,822
Okay, I understand
that that sounds...

931
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:50,592
We will sort all this out
when DCFS gets here.

932
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:54,008
Right.

933
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:18,217
You ready?

934
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,258
Wubby missed you so much.

935
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:23,217
It's been a while.

936
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,550
- What made you...
- No talking!

937
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:26,550
Harder.

938
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:28,217
What did I just say?

939
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,175
- Harder!
- You want harder?

940
00:45:30,258 --> 00:45:32,925
My God!

941
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:37,008
There's a kid...

942
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:39,758
I want you to recommend
to West Point.

943
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:43,675
Good kid. Big heart.

944
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:45,008
Born to serve.

945
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:52,300
I already recommended someone!

946
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:54,342
Bitch, I'm not asking.

947
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:57,050
What's his name?

948
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:59,841
Carl Gallagher.

949
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,509
Maybemaybe I could,

950
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:07,758
un-recommend the other kid.

951
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:08,925
Maybe?

952
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,092
Yes!

953
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:13,592
Yes! Yes!

954
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:16,758
Yes! Yes!

955
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:17,966
Yes!

956
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,175
Hey, Xan, Xan, Xan.

957
00:47:20,258 --> 00:47:21,925
Come on with me, all right?

958
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,467
Code blue. Code blue.

959
00:47:46,258 --> 00:47:47,883
Hey.

960
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,467
Damn, girl!
What you all dressed up for?

961
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,467
I could ask you the same thing.

962
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,966
A story for another time.

963
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,133
I gotta look professional.

964
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,384
I got a meeting.

965
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:58,258
Well, you look good.

966
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,675
Thank you. It's H&M.

967
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:01,425
Gonna return the shit tomorrow.

968
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,550
Meeting with a man or a woman?

969
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,384
Does it matter? I'd wear exactly

970
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,883
the same thing, regardless.

971
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,716
So a man.

972
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,716
Look, I need this deal
to happen, okay?

973
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,550
If I look good, can't hurt.

974
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:14,258
It's called dress for success.

975
00:48:14,342 --> 00:48:15,841
Preaching to the choir.

976
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:17,725
So, are there gonna be drinks
at this meeting?

977
00:48:17,758 --> 00:48:20,758
No, no, we're just
gonna sign some papers.

978
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:22,841
Might have a little
champagne to celebrate.

979
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,217
Nice. Where?

980
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,258
At a hotel downtown.

981
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:29,634
Ford cool with that?

982
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,092
Fucking Ford.

983
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:34,634
He's acting weird.

984
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:36,550
Like, jealous.

985
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:38,133
Wonder why.

986
00:48:38,217 --> 00:48:39,467
It's not like that.

987
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,342
Then what's wrong?

988
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:43,384
Why is he bringing this up now?
I mean, suddenly,

989
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:44,734
he wants to be in a relationship

990
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,758
'cause I got a meeting
with a guy?

991
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,175
Is the guy hot?

992
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:50,342
Yeah, he's hot as fuck.

993
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,342
Yeah, but the...

994
00:48:52,425 --> 00:48:53,467
Why is it all on me?

995
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,467
Why can't Ford and I
just hang out?

996
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,758
Why does it have to turn
to some official thing?

997
00:48:57,841 --> 00:48:59,634
Because when it's not
an official thing,

998
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:01,300
people get hurt.

999
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:03,133
- Hey, what's up, Fiona?
- Hi, Kev.

1000
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,883
When people leave
their options open,

1001
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:06,716
you can't trust each other.

1002
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,776
When I started dating Kev,
I was like, "You're my man",

1003
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,610
"I'm your girl, and if you're
not happy with that,

1004
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,092
I'll kill you in your sleep."

1005
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:13,467
It's true.

1006
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,133
What's that?

1007
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:18,800
I'm trying to make a logo
or a symbol or something

1008
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:20,716
so I can put it in the window

1009
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,716
so women know
that they're safe here.

1010
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,092
- Hey, Kev.
- They're not.

1011
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:26,342
I know. That's why I'm doing
a symbol, or a logo.

1012
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:27,883
I need a quick beer and a bump.

1013
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,925
This might be the hardest
I have ever worked.

1014
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:32,966
Where's your candidate?
Kissing babies?

1015
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,092
I hope he's just kissing.

1016
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,758
Disgusting pedophile.

1017
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,175
Which is why
there's no way in hell

1018
00:49:39,258 --> 00:49:41,758
he's ever gonna win.
I just need him to shut up,

1019
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:43,481
or else people
are gonna stop contributing

1020
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:44,883
to the campaign.

1021
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:47,175
You are unbelievable.

1022
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:49,841
You know me,
daughter of my dreams.

1023
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:52,175
I never stop thinking
about tomorrow.

1024
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:54,634
Kev.

1025
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:57,175
Can I get a bump
of Jamie, please?

1026
00:49:57,258 --> 00:50:00,634
Hey, wasn't that
Bill Clinton's campaign song?

1027
00:50:00,716 --> 00:50:04,384
"Don't Stop Thinking
About Tomorrow"?

1028
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,258
That's what we need.

1029
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:08,258
A campaign song.

1030
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,966
Well...

1031
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,008
Democracy never sleeps.

1032
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:19,758
Unless it's with a 15-year-old.

1033
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:25,841
Hi.

1034
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:28,217
Hey.

1035
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,925
Not even gonna ask.

1036
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:34,342
Totally forgot I was wearing it.

1037
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:38,716
How did you know for sure
you were gay?

1038
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,841
'Cause I was having sex
with a man.

1039
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:42,258
Why?

1040
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:43,966
I don't know.

1041
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,800
I think I might be gay.

1042
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:47,258
You're not gay.

1043
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:48,841
How do you know?

1044
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:50,675
Where is this coming from?
Is this 'cause

1045
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:52,966
- you're a welder now?
- No.

1046
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,883
I don't know. I...

1047
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:55,984
I've just been feeling ways

1048
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,758
that I've never felt before.

1049
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,425
Have you had sex
with another woman?

1050
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:01,175
Yeah. I did, once.

1051
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,675
It was a long time ago, but I

1052
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:03,984
let a woman
I was babysitting for

1053
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:06,008
go down on me.

1054
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:07,342
Really?

1055
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:08,841
Yeah. Got a great tip.

1056
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:12,634
- Did you return the favor?
- No.

1057
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:15,050
Yeah, you're not gay.
You're a pillow princess.

1058
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,217
Have you been with a girl since?

1059
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,318
Yep. I just made out with one

1060
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:19,550
in the bathroom.

1061
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:20,714
Okay, well, that's a start.

1062
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:22,258
What kind of porn do you like?

1063
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:23,716
I don't watch porn.

1064
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,592
Bullshit. Everyone watches porn.

1065
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:29,634
- I'm at least bisexual.
- No.

1066
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:31,300
You're not.

1067
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:34,092
Why do you keep telling me
what I'm not?

1068
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,675
I thought Gay Jesus was all
about love and acceptance.

1069
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:40,758
Sorry.

1070
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:43,258
Yeah, I don't know
what we're about anymore.

1071
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:45,550
The whole Gay Jesus thing

1072
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,133
has gotten
completely out of hand.

1073
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:50,841
I mean, people are doing
crazy shit.

1074
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:53,758
Apparently, now I'm the gay Che.

1075
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:55,300
Lately, I'm just feeling like...

1076
00:51:55,384 --> 00:51:56,966
Hey, news flash

1077
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,175
You're not Jesus,
and you're not gay Che.

1078
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:01,883
You're a bipolar Gallagher
who doesn't take his meds.

1079
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:03,318
So why don't you stop trying
to save the world

1080
00:52:03,342 --> 00:52:05,509
and save yourself?

1081
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:07,217
I don't know what I am anymore.

1082
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,217
At least you know you're gay.

1083
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,841
Yeah.

1084
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,883
Lenora...

1085
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,300
obviously thinks
very highly of you.

1086
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:23,175
Yes, sir.

1087
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:25,133
So...

1088
00:52:30,258 --> 00:52:32,841
I know of no finer candidate

1089
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:35,883
for admittance to West Point

1090
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:39,050
than Carl... Gallagher.

1091
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:44,384
Damn right, you don't.

1092
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:04,966
It's a pretty fucking
good apology.

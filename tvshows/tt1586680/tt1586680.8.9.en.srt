1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,350
Hey.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm living under a highway
with a dead guy,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,770
and I didn't miss Shameless
last week.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,180
Get your shit together, man.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,810
I appreciated
all your help today,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,520
but I didn't ask for it.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,390
I chose booze a long time ago.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,140
You don't like what you see,
don't look.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,100
For a small fee, I'll get you
and your family across.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,850
Hey, Frank,
if you're going to Canada,

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,350
can you bring me back
some Canadian insulin?

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,730
It's 50 percent cheaper
up there.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,350
The fuck is this?

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,390
This is a piece of shit

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,520
that you're gonna turn
into not a piece of shit.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,020
This isn't what it looks like.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,730
What, like you got
some other girl pregnant?

18
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,520
It happened when Sierra and I
weren't together.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,470
Sierra know?

20
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,600
I haven't had a chance
to tell her yet.

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,640
It looks like you've had
nine months to tell her.

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,220
- Are you a homosexual, Ian?
- Indeed, I am.

23
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,560
Would you like
to come up to the altar

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,520
and bring Jesus
back into your life?

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,220
I already got
Jesus in my life.

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,890
Any of you queers
sick of this bullshit

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,850
and want to get out of here?

28
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,220
You were awesome.

29
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,600
Going at it with that pastor.
It's on YouTube.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,560
It already got,
like, 1,000 hits.

31
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,980
- Irish Ford?
- Yes.

32
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,730
- He's the father?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,560
Yeah, for both of us.

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,060
- And our kids are gonna look...
- Oh.

35
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,220
...just like that.

36
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,430
Is that... that's one of Ford's?

37
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,560
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,930
- Five kids, huh?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,270
It's getting
a little out of hand.

40
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,390

Huh.

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,020
There's usually
a ribbon on this tree.

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,350
That way.

60
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,850
Do you know where you're going?

61
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,810
Uh, straight and to the left.

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,390
But I think we passed
that tree before.

63
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,100
Are we even in Canada yet?

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,560
Shut up.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,020
Just a little bit further.
Here we go.

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,770
Get down!

67
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,850
Oh, fuck.

68
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,100
Operation Abort.

69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,270
I repeat, Operation Abort!

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,930
Just go north. Go north.

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,220
- Wha...
- Just keep going north.

73
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,600
- I can't...
- Everything will be fine.

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,140
- Go north.
- But who is that?

75
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,600
- I can't see anybody out there.
- Go fucking...

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,020
- I don't know who it is.
- Is it bandits or thugs?

77
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,430
There's not enough room, okay?

78
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,850
Go find another tree.

79
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,640
Jesus Christ,
you're like a bad dream.

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,390
I don't know who it is.

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,060
- Do you see anybody?
- No, I don't see...

82
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,930
Hello. Wrong side
of the border, boys, eh?

83
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,930
Oh, fuck.

84
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,430
Think we found
your hiking trail.

85
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,100
Oh, shit. What time is it?

86
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,770
It's still early.

87
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,640
Mm.

88
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to sleep over.

89
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,390
No worries.

90
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,270
- I'm sort of hard to resist.
- Mm.

91
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,980
Yeah, well,

92
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,470
standing up for
gender nonconformists

93
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,100
kind of makes you irresistible.

94
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,930
Oh, well, I can quote

95
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,100
some misinterpreted
Bible verses right now

96
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,270
if it'll get you off.

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,770
I should go.

98
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,850
This is...

99
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,850
it's kind of nice,

100
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,980
like, us being a thing again,

101
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,600
right?

102
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,680
Jury's still out.

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,520
Fucker.

104
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,730
You're getting tougher,
Gallagher.

105
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,310
You didn't cry once.

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,140
Yeah, I think my, uh,
pain threshold is improving.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,060
You, uh, wanna grab breakfast?

108
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,100
Gotta get to the crib.
My niece is getting dropped off.

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,980
Oh, you got a niece?

110
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,020
My sister's kid. Xan.

111
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,520
Oh, you got a sister?

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,310
Half sister.

113
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,850
My shithead dad's kid
with some skank he barely knew.

114
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,560
She's been in and out
of rehab, like, 100 times.

115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,730
Oh.

116
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,520
I look after her kid sometimes.

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
Hey, it was cool
having you stay over.

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,680
You get soft on me and I'll
bury my knee into your throat.

119
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,350
Okay.

120
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,220
Fiona, your dog's
been barking all fuckin' night.

121
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,890
Wasn't Rusty.
He was with me at the apartment.

122
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,930
This is where we first
made ramen noodles together.

123
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,180
What's with the... documentary?

124
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,220
Oh, I'm making
a video scrapbook for my boo

125
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,220
before he goes AWOL on me.

126
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,270
Kassidi's having
some separation anxiety

127
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,470
with me leaving to go back to
the academy in a couple weeks.

128
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,810
She wants to make sure
I remember

129
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,020
the goods I got back at home.

130
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,220
This is where
you first went down on me.

131
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,730
She's crazy about me.

132
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Oh, place is turning
into the fuckin' Super 8.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,140
Yeah, that's why I've been
sleeping at my building.

134
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,520
What, you haven't rented
that apartment yet?

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,980
No, I will. Just...

136
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,930
too many folks crashing here
right now.

137
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,600
Hey, we get another dog?

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,140
That's Toto.
He's tied up outside.

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,730
The fuck's a Toto?

140
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,140
Belongs to the hipster couple
up the street.

141
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Got a job dog sitting.

142
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,600
Like 101 Dalmatians up in here.

143
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah, Toto sounds pissed, Debs.

144
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,930
Yeah, he gets barky sometimes.
I can't figure out why.

145
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,980
But they pay 40 bucks a day,

146
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,350
and I need money
for welding school tuition.

147
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,810
- Mornin'.
- Morning.

148
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,980
You and, uh, Trev boning again?

149
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,020
Definitely turning a corner.

150
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,730
Everybody's boning somebody
but me?

151
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,350
We don't call it boning.

152
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,640
It's uniting our souls.

153
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,850
Duran and I call it
"besties with benefits."

154
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,980
Does a hickey count?

155
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,470
I hope you're all
double-bagging.

156
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,310
This place is already
too crowded.

157
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,890
Burn this into your mind.

158
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,470
Ready to take on Svetlana today?

159
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,640
Dominance is in my DNA.

160
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,730
It was hibernating inside me
like a baby bear.

161
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,310
But now I'm woke.

162
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,100
- Mm.
- Grown and grizzly.

163
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,060
You wanna practice
the rules again?

164
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
I'm a man, V.

165
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,520
Men don't practice. We perform.

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,640
Svetlana is a professional
Ballbuster.

167
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,020
You gotta come strong.

168
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, I'm gonna lay down the law
at The Alibi.

169
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,350
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

170
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,270
There are new rules,

171
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,350
there's a new attitude, and...

172
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,140
I want to be called "sir."

173
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,850
"Sir Kev."

174
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,680
No, nah, just... just "sir."

175
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,350
Maybe "Sir Ball"?

176
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,140
I want her
wearing a uniform.

177
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,850
One of those ugly grandma blouse
that you tie up to the neck.

178
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,810
I'm tired of her flashing
her ta-tas all around.

179
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,270
From now on, your ta-tas

180
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,020
will be the only ta-tas
getting flashed.

181
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,310
This bacon?

182
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,350
It's not crispy enough.
Do it again.

183
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,640
Dominance.

184
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:10,770
Boom.

185
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,890
You guys actually
do wear those hats.

186
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,140
I thought that was
only in cartoons.

187
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,850
So you 'fugees come here,

188
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,680
pick up some Invokana, Advair,
EpiPens, smuggle it back.

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,980
Hey, we're servants
of a just cause, huh?

190
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,390
Health care in the States
rapes the elderly and the poor.

191
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,890
Our way's the only way

192
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,220
some grandpa's not gonna
keel over from leukemia

193
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,890
before his 90th birthday.

194
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,640
Or a kid in some tenement

195
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
doesn't stop breathing
after a peanut butter sandwich.

196
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,100
Lot of cash.

197
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,390
How much
were you planning to buy?

198
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,100
Well...

199
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,100
what do you say
you just drop us right up here,

200
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,640
you hold on to the stash
for some Tim Hortons?

201
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,810
No harm, no foul.

202
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

203
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
just attempt to bribe

204
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,100
a member of Her Majesty's
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

205
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,810
How 'bout you pretend
you didn't just arrest us?

206
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,020
This poor homeless man

207
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,270
needs asylum from
the war-torn streets of Aleppo.

208
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,850
The United States
turned its back on him.

209
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,930
I'm a computational
biologist at Loyola

210
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,770
who overstayed my visa.

211
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,930
I'm soliciting
empathy, Muhammad.

212
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,520
Nobody likes a braggart.

213
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,390
It's Rami.
Sounds nothing like Muhammad.

214
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,220
Ow! Ah! Jesus!

215
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,430
What was that?

216
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,560
The fuck?

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,640
That, Mr. Computer Biology,
was a gift from Allah.

218
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Let's go.

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,930
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Wait.

220
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,060
- Are they dead?
- Uh...

221
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
Let's go.

222
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,810
Ouch!

223
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,430
What are you doing?
The border is south.

224
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm not going back.
I'm headed north.

225
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm not staying here.

226
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,140
God damn it!

227
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,980
I am not going back!

228
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,270
Oh, you son of a bitch.

229
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,390
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
- Come on. Come on.

230
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,560
- No. No.
- Let's go. We gotta go this...

231
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,640
- Let's go this way!
- No! No!

232
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,180
It's right around here.
Some issue with the roof.

233
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,310
One of my tenants
complained about leaking?

234
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,220
Looks like exposed flashing.
Take a look.

235
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,680
Definitely gonna have to re-tar

236
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,730
around the entire perimeter.

237
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,560
Thinking it should be, like,
a one-day job, you know?

238
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,350
Cost you about 675.

239
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,140
$675?

240
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,180
Materials and labor included.
You don't want to wait on this.

241
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,100
You'll end up
with rain damage, mold.

242
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,680
End up costing you
a lot more in the long run.

243
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,020
Five hundred, and I'll
refer you to Margo Mierzejewski.

244
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,270
She's rehabbing a lot
of properties around here.

245
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,890
Definitely gonna
need some roofing.

246
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll do it for 550,
half up front.

247
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,180
- Cash okay?
- You got a deal.

248
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,810
What if you applied
for a single room?

249
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,020
That way, I can sneak in
at night and visit you.

250
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,430
We live in barracks.
Twenty dudes to a room.

251
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,890
Well, I can park
a trailer nearby.

252
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,770
Then you can sneak out
and visit me.

253
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,350
We can FaceTime
after evening chow

254
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,680
and on the weekends.

255
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,730
What about conjugal visits?

256
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,060
I mean, I can't go a month

257
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,730
without seeing you
and your little soldier.

258
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,470
Me and my big soldier.

259
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,560
We can do stuff over the phone.
It'll be freaky.

260
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm not gonna
see you for months.

261
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,770
I mean, I'm proud of you for
serving your country and all,

262
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,310
but what am I supposed to do?

263
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,430
I can't go back
and live at my parents'

264
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,430
while I leave you
to the military slut groupies.

265
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,600
There's no girls.

266
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,100
There's always girls.

267
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,890
I am not losing you
to some bitch

268
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,890
with a fucking uniform fetish.

269
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,060
You really wanna
leave this behind?

270
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,930
And we're gonna get
some beds here,

271
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,180
soon as we get
our occupancy permits.

272
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,770
He gonna have to pay anything?

273
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,060
Shelter's free.

274
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,270
My folks kicked him out
for good this time.

275
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,310
Still beats having 'em
pray over me day and night.

276
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,980
Thanks for getting him
out of there

277
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,850
before they sent him
to that homo rehab.

278
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,810
This place seems cool.

279
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,640
It's for those of us who were
told we don't belong anywhere.

280
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,310
I mean, there's a lot
of people who believe that

281
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,390
Jesus wasn't just
some homophobic prick, right?

282
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,350
- Can I help you?
- Excuse me.

283
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,100
Are you the guy from YouTube?

284
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,220
Who are you?

285
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,890
I'm Deacon Jason Cook,

286
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,640
from Ebenezer Baptist Church.

287
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,980
This here is Father Monroe
from Saint Elizabeth's.

288
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,270
And, um, we want to discuss
your message.

289
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,810
My message is,
Jesus is nonbinary,

290
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,430
so deal with it, Deacon.

291
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,930
Amen to that.

292
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,980
We support
an inclusive vision, son.

293
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,100
We're not here
to contradict you.

294
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,020
Mm-mm. We want to thank you.

295
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,140
Your words have been inspiring.
I think...

296
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,060
I think you're
what the people need.

297
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,980
New rule.

298
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,770
No more of your ta-tas
hanging out.

299
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,470
This is a decent establishment.

300
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,980
There will be a dress code.

301
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,310
This is shirt
to bury Catholic nun in, huh?

302
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,680
Not to sell drinks.

303
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,390
It's your new uniform.

304
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,850
This will teach you a lesson

305
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,850
that you don't fuck over
the people you love.

306
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,020
speaking Russian

307
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,180
"Tupyye."

308
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,770
"Tupyye." You say that a lot.

309
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,640
It means "stupid," right?

310
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,020
Well, here's a new new rule.

311
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,560
You don't call us stupid
anymore.

312
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,930
Dominance.

313
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,180
Boom.

314
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,220
Gotta tell you, kid,

315
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,890
I looked over Mr. Youens' case,

316
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,640
and there's not much to go on.

317
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,100
He was in court drunk?

318
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,470
Yeah, it's not
his finest moment.

319
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,350
Um...

320
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,020
how much time do you think
he's gonna get?

321
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,350
Probably the max.

322
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,020
Right, but... I mean, he's old.

323
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,060
Can't you plead hardship
or something?

324
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,470
We got 30 days to appeal
after sentencing.

325
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,430
I'll do my best,
but I'm not Houdini, kid.

326
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,220
We knock a couple years off,
that's a hell of a win.

327
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,270
All right, w-what else can I do?

328
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,060
Commissary money.
They always need that.

329
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,270
Yo, man,
can I grab you for a second?

330
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,930
I'm-I'm kind of busy right now.

331
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,180
I just wanted to, uh...

332
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,600
All right... shh.

333
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,430
Excuse me.

334
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,890
Look, I just wanted to say

335
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,600
I appreciate you
not ratting me out, you know?

336
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,100
Yeah, you tell her yet?

337
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,430
I'm gonna. It just
hasn't been the right time.

338
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,220
All right, just keep me
out of it, okay?

339
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,310
What's up?

340
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,140
Hey, babe. Um...

341
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,770
can I have your car keys?
I gotta run some errands.

342
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,730
Sure. You guys cool?

343
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,810
- Yeah, we're cool.
- Yeah.

344
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,430
Toto. Toto.

345
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,140
Hi, um, I'm here to discuss
payment options for my class,

346
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,930
Advanced Arc Welding,
second level.

347
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,310
- Name?
- Gallagher, Debra.

348
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,890
Your tuition is 2,500.
Check or credit card?

349
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,810
I don't actually have that much.

350
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,730
How much do you have?

351
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,560
Saved about...
200 bucks cash to put down.

352
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,060
You can put that down,
but the deadline

353
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,980
for registration is tomorrow.

354
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,810
And we're gonna need
the remaining 2,300

355
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,270
to hold your slot.

356
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,020
That your son?

357
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,810
Grandson.

358
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,140
This is my daughter.

359
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,930
Her name's Franny.

360
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,060
I had her a couple years ago.

361
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,350
Her father ran off and
left me pregnant all by myself.

362
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,810
I've been begging
on street corners.

363
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,060
I almost lost her
to Child Services.

364
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,730
I need this welding certificate
so I can get a good job

365
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,980
and make real money
and make her proud of me.

366
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,390
So I can stop feeling like I
messed up my life by having her,

367
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,730
because she makes
my life better.

368
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,810
Okay.

369
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,850
I'm gonna sign you up
retroactively

370
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,980
for the deferred plan.

371
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,390
Here.

372
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,310
Bring this back tomorrow
with 300 bucks.

373
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,680
Add it to the 200
that you already put down.

374
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,980
That's 20 percent
of the tuition.

375
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,350
I can't bend past that.

376
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,390
Thank you. I'll have it.
I really appreciate it.

377
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,680
- Have a good day.
- You too.

378
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,140
Toto! Toto!

379
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,640
Toto, stop.

380
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,560
Sorry about that, ma'am.
She gets weird sometimes.

381
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,140
Come. Bad dog.

382
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,220
Ah! Jesus, man.

383
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,060
Shut the fuck up,
would you?

384
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,390
Look, look, look, look, look.
A cabin.

385
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,020
We gotta find something
to cut these cuffs.

386
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,680
We're gonna have to break in.

387
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm not breaking into anything.

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,270
Oh, you want
to get righteous now?

389
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,020
Now you want
to start obeying the laws?

390
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,850
You are old. You are white.

391
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,220
I am not old. I am brown.

392
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,930
Who do you think
they're gonna throw the book at?

393
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,350
Well, I didn't hear you
complaining about

394
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,390
the white man when you
were depending on me

395
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,140
for your personal
freedom and safety.

396
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,890
I gave you $200 to lead a hike.

397
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,430
You're not a freedom fighter.

398
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,310
You're a... you're a...
you're an overpaid Boy Scout.

399
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,770
I should have charged you
double for ingratitude.

400
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,220
- I'm gonna have to kick it in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

401
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,890
It's Canada.
Nobody locks their doors.

402
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,310
Ah, there's no saw.

403
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,730
Are you, uh...
are you left-handed or right?

404
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,770
What? Whoa!

405
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,930
You gotta make sacrifices
for freedom, Muhammad.

406
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,810
What are you...

407
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,810
Hmm.

408
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,600
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit.

409
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,470
Yo, ditch the weed!

410
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,020
Jesus, Toto.

411
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,980
Is that what
you've been barking at?

412
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,770
What the hell?

413
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,770
Hey.

414
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,520
Place is looking good.

415
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,430
Yeah, I spruced it up a bit.

416
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,980
Been sleeping here to get out
of my overcrowded house.

417
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,640
I kind of like it.

418
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,640
So thanks for helping me out.

419
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,310
I was just gonna throw a nail
in it and hammer it down.

420
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,850
Jesus, you're killing me.

421
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,390
Never put a nail in the tongue
and groove; you'll split it.

422
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,770
Okay.

423
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,890
Touch it.

424
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,930
- What?
- The wood.

425
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,520
- What?
- The floor.

426
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,930
It's historic.

427
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,180
Well, this time, I gotta
pay you for your work.

428
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,220
It wasn't work. It was charity.

429
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,980
You saying I'm a charity case?

430
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,430
No. Your floors are.

431
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,730
What are you doing later?

432
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,060
Tonight?

433
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,560
This afternoon.

434
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,060
Some friends are going bowling.

435
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,270
Trendy spot.

436
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,850
Good happy hour menu.
Should be fun.

437
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,560
Are you asking me on a date?

438
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,220
Just telling you where I'll be.

439
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,890
'Cause I don't want
to get too complicated.

440
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,140
You can't help what you are.

441
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,810
I'll text you the info.

442
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,140
Come if you can.

443
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,100
It'll be an enlarged photo.

444
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,220
I'm grown, loser.

445
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,890
Yes, I know what
it's a picture of.

446
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,220
It's my vagina.

447
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,890
I'm gonna go get us some Cokes.

448
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,810
Yeah, I want it hanging up in
his dorm room, larger than life.

449
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,060
Can I get two Cokes
and some woman advice?

450
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,850
Ah-ah, lay it on me.

451
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,020
Kassidi's freaking out
'cause I have to go back

452
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,520
to military school.

453
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,350
She's worried it's gonna
end our relationship.

454
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,180
Well, she's probably right.

455
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,310
Teenage relationships
don't have a high success rate.

456
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,980
Teenage relationships are
only good for herpes and mono.

457
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,310
Sounds like she's looking
for you to make a move.

458
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,980
What kind of move?

459
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,810
A romantic gesture to show
how much you love her.

460
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,600
I once shaved my pubes
into a "V" for V.

461
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,220
But it looked like
it stood for "vagina."

462
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,560
Think it through.

463
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,640
Anything simpler?

464
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,680
Nipple piercing.
Small but meaningful.

465
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,980
Could get her name
tattooed over your heart.

466
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,810
Or put a collar around your
balls and give her the leash.

467
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,640
If she's pressuring you, you
need to tell her to fall back.

468
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,810
Military school
got your shit together.

469
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,600
Can't let anybody
screw that up for you.

470
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Well, she helped me earn
the money for military school.

471
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,060
She's not trying to screw me up.
She loves me.

472
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,680
Mm, 'sup, gang?
What are we all talking about?

473
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,770
We're talking about
how important it is

474
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,520
for Carl to stay in school.

475
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,180
Thanks a lot, V. Kass, wait up.

476
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,220
You're mutilating
my fucking heart!

477
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,810
That kid is doomed.

478
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,020
I am looking
for Svetlana Yevgenivna,

479
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,390
pozhaluista.

480
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,060
Svetlana! Customer!

481
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,270
Freelania Alexeyevich?

482
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,600
speaking Russian

483
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,930
I am blast from whoring past,
no?

484
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,890
speaking Russian

485
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,060
Hey! No speaking Russian!

486
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,390
Five minutes and you're back
unloading the liquor stock.

487
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,890
What do you want?

488
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,890
You helped to smuggle me
into this country.

489
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,180
Freelania Alexeyevich
always repays her debts.

490
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,680
You said you would drop dead

491
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,140
before I could find anyone
to turn me from whore to wife.

492
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,520
I would like to see you
die now, please.

493
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,890
Not true.

494
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,890
You were always
ugly bottom-feeder,

495
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,850
only good for hand jobs.

496
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,390
Very true.

497
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,730
It's too bad you are still...

498
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,020
bitter prostitute slave
working for poor people.

499
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,140
If you weren't
such a cunt, madam,

500
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,060
you might be able
to marry well too.

501
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,930
$4,500 for 40 pounds
of lube and vagina cleanse.

502
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,980
Debt repaid.

503
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,770
Now you are
a "ugly bottom-feeder."

504
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,310
Break time's over.

505
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,810
Youens.

506
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,770
Account number 79877821.

507
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,140
Okay, uh, 30 bucks, please?

508
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,020
Great, and-and do I get

509
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,270
a confirmation number
on that or...

510
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,640
Okay. Okay.

511
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,310
Thank you.

512
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,270
Sal, she's lactose intolerant.

513
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,060
I wrote "no cheese."

514
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,680
You okay?

515
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,390
Yeah.

516
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,020
How's Youens doing?

517
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,560
Shitty.

518
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,770
He's got a sentence hearing
coming up.

519
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,100
And I'm still pissed, but
who else has he got, you know?

520
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,850
Shouldn't give a fuck, but...

521
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,220
He's lucky to have you.

522
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,310
Yeah.

523
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,350
How's Charlie?

524
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,180
He's trying really hard
to be a good dad.

525
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,930
You know, showing up
when he says he's going to,

526
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,470
not lying all the time anymore.

527
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,470
It's really good for Lucas.

528
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,060
- Sierra. Listo.
- Yeah.

529
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,680
Sorry to hear about Youens.

530
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,100
If you need anything,
let me know.

531
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,850
Thanks.

532
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,560
- Hey, uh, question.
- Mm-hmm?

533
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
You know when Frank
ruined your wedding

534
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,220
and told you about
Sean and the heroin?

535
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,180
Jesus, don't remind me.

536
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,430
Would it have been worse

537
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,270
if Frank knew
and never told you?

538
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,100
What's going on?

539
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,220
Um, Sierra's dude
got some other girl pregnant.

540
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Oh, shit.

541
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,390
She know?

542
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,640
No, no.

543
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,180
I'm trying not to feel
like a douchebag

544
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,060
for not having told her.

545
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,100
No, no.
Let her find out from him.

546
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,350
- Okay.
- Question.

547
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,180
If I'm making a profit
here at Patsy's

548
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,890
and I have enough tenants
in my apartment building,

549
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,980
you think I can spare
one apartment for myself?

550
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,310
You moving out?

551
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,270
I was thinking about it.

552
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,100
Can't decide if I can afford it.

553
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,680
Well, at least you know
you won't get evicted.

554
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,930
- Hi, Debs.
- Hey.

555
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,350
Hey, Sierra, can I get a Coke?

556
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,100
Thanks. Toto.

557
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,730
Toto.

558
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,770
Debs, your dog
is harassing my customers.

559
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,350
Think he's doing his job, Fiona.

560
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,850
Think he may be a drug dog.

561
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,060
Look, keep Toto on a short leash
or tie him up outside.

562
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,310
Okay. Come.

563
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,430
Hey, babe. I got your text.
What's the sitch?

564
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,270
Oh, he's so cute.

565
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,140
Your salon
still full of stoners?

566
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,770
Yeah, my most loyal customers.

567
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,850
- Hmm.
- Why?

568
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,310
Think I may have
a cheap supplier

569
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,310
who specializes in weed.

570
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,810
You got product on you?

571
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,810
How much do we need to sell
to make 300 bucks by tomorrow?

572
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,980
About 15 dub sacks.

573
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,770
I can unload it.

574
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,980
Who's your supplier?

575
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,310
He goes by the street name
"Toto."

576
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,640
Help me with the saddle.

577
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,220
I'm not stealing a horse.

578
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,470
The Mounties are
gonna be on our tails.

579
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,980
You wanna get caught?

580
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,430
I don't know the first thing
about riding a horse.

581
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,100
It's no different
than riding a camel.

582
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,680
I've never rid a camel, asshole!

583
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,310
What are you doing with Piper?

584
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,020
Aren't you cute?

585
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,310
What's your name?

586
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,140
Jeni. That's my horse.

587
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,850
I-I... we-we know
how this must look, Jeni.

588
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,770
Uh, but we're sort of
in a desperate way.

589
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,560
Would you mind if we borrowed
Piper and then send her back?

590
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,850
Dad!

591
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,850
- No, no, no, no, honey.
- Jesus Christ.

592
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,520
- Don't do that.
- Dad!

593
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,470
- No, we're not gonna hurt you.
- Dad! Help!

594
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,600
You just punched a little girl!

595
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,180
Okay, that w...
that was an accident.

596
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,310
I was going more for a soft tap.

597
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,430
Uh...

598
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,390
You're so tiny.

599
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,730
Oh, my God.

600
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,680
Let's get the fuck out of here,
bareback.

601
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,810
- You're too close.
- Okay!

602
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,850
- Ju...
- Where-where should I hold on?

603
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,390
I... ju... no, you can
put your arms around my waist.

604
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,810
That's weird.
That's really weird.

605
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,310
My God,
you're so fucking uptight.

606
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,390
I'm slipping.
I'm slipping.

607
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,640
- Well, you better hold on.
- Okay. All right.

608
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,220
- Slow down. Slow down.
- No, we gotta go faster.

609
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,180
God, you're breathing
right in my face.

610
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,390
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on.

611
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,100
- Jesus Christ!
- Piper. Piper.

612
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,890
My knee!

613
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,140
Jesus Christ! Ah!

614
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,850
And then Pastor's like,

615
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,470
"Nina's ready to give her life
to Christ and rebuke Satan."

616
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,810
And I'm just like...

617
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,980
"Shit.

618
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,350
Does this mean I can't
still fuck girls?"

619
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,560
They tell you that Jesus
had all these messed-up ideas,

620
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,140
but the truth is that you...

621
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,930
fucking girls is exactly
what Jesus wants you to do,

622
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,600
because that's love and...
Jesus is love.

623
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,350
You know, most of the assholes
are closeted gays anyway.

624
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,430
They wish they were
as free as you.

625
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,560
Amen.

626
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,930
So why should we stop anybody

627
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,310
from being exactly
who God created us to be?

628
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,770
We are living examples
of God's creation, Jesus' love.

629
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,810
Boys kissing boys
is Jesus' love.

630
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,020
Girls kissing girls...
Jesus' love.

631
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,520
So you tell your church
"amen" to that.

632
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,020
- Amen.
- All right.

633
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,730
- Hi.
- Hey.

634
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,310
- Cool spot.
- Yeah.

635
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,430
Let me, uh,
introduce you to the crew.

636
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,930
- This is Mei Ling, Natasha.
- Hi.

637
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,560
Indio, Marlina, Sophie,
Trisha, and Jose.

638
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,100
- Hi.
- Everybody, this is Fiona.

639
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,850
Hi. Not gonna
remember any of that.

640
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,810
Nice to meet ya.

641
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,520
So how do you know Ford?

642
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,640
Uh, he helped me with some stuff
at my apartment building.

643
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,470
How about you guys?

644
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,060
We met in Nepal,

645
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,220
when he was doing photography
for Associated Press.

646
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,020
Nepal?

647
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,390
Ford is incredible
with his hands.

648
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,470
Renovated our home
when he and I lived together.

649
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,060
Long time ago.

650
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,930
Okay, Fiona, you're on
Mei and Indio's team.

651
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,020
Natasha, get up here.
You're with me and Jose.

652
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,140
- Let's go.
- Okay.

653
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,890
This isn't, like, a...

654
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,640
like, a league or anything,
is it?

655
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,810
No, it's just for fun.

656
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,560
I mean, I only bowl a 225.

657
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,470
What's your average?

658
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,220
I-I have no idea?

659
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,980
- Yes!
- Beautiful!

660
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,060
- Beautiful!
- All right.

661
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,850
I know
it's still early in the season,

662
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,430
but Indiana...

663
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,270
Svetlana's been on that laptop
all day.

664
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,100
I don't trust it.

665
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,350
Think she's
plotting revenge?

666
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,020
This is the same chick
who offed her husband/father

667
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,470
and no one's ever
found the body.

668
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:22,140
Permission to take
cigarette break, Sir... Ball?

669
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,520
Permission granted.

670
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
She gonna kill us.

671
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,680
Dinner's ready.

672
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,180
- Lucas out of the bath?
- Yeah.

673
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,470
This looks good.

674
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,810
Soy sauce or no soy sauce?

675
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,100
Soy sauce.

676
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,060
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,930
You okay?

678
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,560
Yeah. I'm cool.

679
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,770
Thanks.

680
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,730
Um...

681
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,470
I gotta run.

682
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,680
We're about to eat.

683
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,930
Um, I gotta go.

684
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,680
I'll call you later. All right?

685
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,730
Charlie.

686
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,640
What the f...

687
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,180
Yes, Team Fiona!

688
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,770
- speaking German - Mm, mm-hmm.

689
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,770
speaking German

690
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:53,140
speaking German

691
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,520
So do you, uh,
all speak multiple languages?

692
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,310
I only speak
English and Mandarin.

693
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,390
Oh. Are you from China?

694
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,270
No.

695
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,020
How long have you and Ford
been friends?

696
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,600
He's my ex.
We were together for two years.

697
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,890
You're his ex too?

698
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,100
And Sophie; he did
a year and a half with her.

699
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,930
Three with Natasha.

700
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,680
Hey, Nessa, what's up?

701
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,350
There was an accident
at the building.

702
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,270
One of the dudes
working on the roof fell.

703
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,140
Fuck. What?

704
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,770
He's okay, but you
should get here ASAP.

705
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,850
Okay, yeah, I'm on my way.

706
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,430
I gotta go.

707
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,020
There was, uh,
an accident at my building.

708
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
One of the roofer guys
fell off the roof.

709
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,850
Shit. I'll go with you.

710
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,640
speaking German

711
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,560
- Later, man.
- All right. See you.

712
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,180
Hey.

713
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,470
Gonna go take Xan
for some pizza.

714
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,430
You still working?

715
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,310
Yeah, I'll lock up.

716
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,520
What's up?

717
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,180
What you mean?

718
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,640
I mean you only stay late
when something's fucking you up.

719
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,470
I'm cool.

720
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,850
All right, go have fun.

721
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,600
What, Youens still?

722
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,730
Yeah.

723
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,890
Yeah, I just, uh...

724
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,810
I can't stop picturing him
in an orange jumpsuit

725
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,220
for the rest of his life,
you know?

726
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,730
You can't fix everything.

727
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,560
Hey, um...

728
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,980
think you could help me
release a little stress?

729
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,890
Gotta be quick. I'm hungry.

730
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,180
Hey, Xan?

731
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,310
Can you play that game
in the office?

732
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,140
Beat it, Xan.

733
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,270
Oh, sh-shit, I'm sorry. I, um...

734
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,560
I ju...

735
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,430
Shit. Hey. Hey.

736
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,270
Hey.

737
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,930
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

738
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,980
I-I just didn't
have anywhere else to go.

739
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,470
Wh-what's wrong?

740
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,770
What?

741
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,730
Charlie got some girl pregnant.

742
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,180
She just had the fucking baby.

743
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,390
He's at the hospital
with her, and he just...

744
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,980
Lying motherfucker.

745
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,600
You okay?

746
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,980
I don't know, I just...
I can't fucking see straight.

747
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,930
I... he just left
in the middle of dinner.

748
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,430
Like, what the fuck?

749
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,600
Hey, look, it's all right, okay?

750
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,220
You got every right
to be pissed.

751
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,850
Now just... breathe, okay?

752
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,180
Breathe, all right?

753
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,980
Just breathe, you're all right.

754
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,470
Yo, lock the door
when you leave.

755
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,980
We're out.

756
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,470
Hey, Eddie, look,
I'm sorry, all right?

757
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,930
- I didn't mean to...
- I'm sorry.

758
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,270
I fucked up your thing.
I should go.

759
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,220
Hey, hey. Hey.

760
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,350
You wanna talk about it?

761
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,060
Wanna get a coffee or something?

762
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,730
No, I should go.

763
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,520
Okay.

764
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,640
- I got you.
- Sorry.

765
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,350
No. It's all right.

766
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,390
Hey.

767
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,640
Hi.

768
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,140
Any word?

769
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,850
Uh, I talked to the nurses.

770
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,680
Rodney's still in the ER.

771
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,680
They're gonna tell
the family that I'm here.

772
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
Good.

773
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,930
And how are you?

774
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,350
I'm okay.

775
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,390
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,810
Rodney's wife, Trina.

777
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,890
Hi, I'm Fiona. This is Ford.

778
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,680
Hey.

779
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,270
Rodney was working
on my roof when he fell.

780
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,310
Is he okay?

781
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,220
They think he broke his ankle.

782
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,890
Just took him back.

783
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,560
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

784
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,390
Has Linc been by already?

785
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,730
- Linc?
- The contractor.

786
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,180
No, you're the first person
to check in from his job.

787
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,810
Well, if there's anything
that I can do to help,

788
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,220
please, just let me know.
Anything.

789
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,060
- Thank you.
- Sure.

790
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,220
That means a lot.

791
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,980
I'll let Rodney know
you came by.

792
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,520
Okay.

793
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,220
Will you pick up the pace?

794
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,020
We'll make the border
in a couple of hours.

795
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,600
We'll make a new plan
once we're safe.

796
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,680
I need to rest.

797
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,310
I think I busted my knee.

798
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,470
It's not swollen enough
to be busted.

799
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,390
It's probably just bruised.

800
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,930
And men on the battlefield
don't let

801
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,350
something like a little
busted knee stop them.

802
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,390
You want freedom?
It doesn't come with R&R.

803
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,310
Freedom means arms severed
and legs blown off.

804
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,930
Every soldier
has the scars of battle.

805
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,850
We're not soldiers!

806
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,270
We're fugitives.

807
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,100
My wife and I just had a son.

808
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,310
I was planning on
getting settled in Montreal

809
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,270
and then sending for them.

810
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,810
And what if I die
out here tonight

811
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,680
and never see them again?

812
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,850
Well, if you died,

813
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,020
you'd have the respect
of your son.

814
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,060
He'd be able to say
that his dad did everything

815
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,600
to give him a better life.

816
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,890
You may be an asshole

817
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,520
and a know-it-all
and a pain in the ass,

818
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,350
but you're a hero
to your family.

819
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,020
Thank you,

820
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,930
Scout Master.

821
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,600
It's Frank.

822
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,020
All right, you get some rest.
I'll take the first watch.

823
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,390
All right.

824
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,810
We got a deacon, a priest,

825
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,470
and a bunch of nuns
to join the cause.

826
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,270
Thinking of starting
a collection plate,

827
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,850
raise some funds for the kids.

828
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,680
That'd be incredible.

829
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah.

830
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,140
I can't believe

831
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,140
all the people
whose lives you're touching.

832
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,470
You're like the person

833
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,980
I w-wish I had around
when I was growing up.

834
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,270
How is that?

835
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:41,060
Someone to... stand up for me,

836
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,930
take on the world.
be my motherfuckin' defender.

837
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,020
I can be your
motherfuckin' defender.

838
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,600
You made it to Canada, friend.

839
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,020
May they treat you well.

840
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,100
God speed.

841
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,730
Salaam alaikum.

842
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,140
Hey, mornin'.

843
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,890
Yo.

844
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,390
You still on that Bible shit?

845
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,810
Yeah, proving
to my online haters

846
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,310
that Jesus is a fag hag.

847
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,810
@HolyMoses4562 just keeps

848
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,810
writing "abomination"
in all caps.

849
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,470
Tell @HolyMoses
to eat a dick in all caps.

850
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,600
Hey.

851
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,430
What's going on? Long night?

852
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,640
Up late fighting with Kassidi.

853
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,810
She still giving you shit
about going back to school?

854
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,770
She fucking worships me.

855
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,930
I'm not gonna let that go,
just end up like

856
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,350
everyone else in this family
who can't keep a relationship.

857
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,730
- Whoa, what's that...
- Who says we can't...

858
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,600
- ...supposed to mean?
- ...hold a relationship?

859
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,430
We're in love; everyone's
gonna have to accept that.

860
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,520
Got any more evaporated milk?

861
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,470
You gonna use that for Franny?

862
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,930
It's cheaper than formula and
I don't have day care today.

863
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,100
Another gaycorcism's going down.

864
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,140
Gotta gather the kids.

865
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,430
See ya.

866
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,060
What's up, bud?

867
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,100
Missed call from Sierra.

868
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,140
Oh, fuck.

869
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,730
Sierra?

870
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,810
Thought she ditched you.

871
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,600
Eh, you're right.

872
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,640
We do suck at relationships.

873
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,430
I'm home. I'm home!

874
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,560
I'm home!

875
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Overweight minimum wage workers

876
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
buying discount
laundry detergent!

877
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,600
I have missed you so much!

878
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,730
God bless America!

879
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,730
God bless America! Wha-ha!

880
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,520
Hey, Xan.

881
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:48,680
Hey.

882
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,850
Look, I, uh...

883
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,270
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

884
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,560
We're fuck buddies,
not a love triangle.

885
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,180
Everything's chill.

886
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,270
Cool.

887
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,270
Ya fucked up.

888
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,560
She's pissed.

Mommy's gonna get her tuition.

897
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,390
Yes, she is.

898
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,390
How long Svetlana
been on her break?

899
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,020
Feels like a long time, right?

900
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,140
Kev, this isn't good.

901
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,470
I told you, she is
plotting something against us.

902
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,060
Some Russian chick
comes in here yesterday,

903
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,020
and ever since,
Svetlana's been acting weird.

904
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,810
That's it.

905
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,640
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

906
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,560
Domination time.

907
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,560
All right, what's on the laptop?

908
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,930
It's personal business.

909
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,220
no personal business at work.

910
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,890
- Open the laptop.
- No. It's private.

911
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,770
Show us
what's on the laptop

912
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,310
or get shipped to the gulag.

913
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,680
speaking Russian

914
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Show us what's
on the damn computer,

915
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,890
or we're gonna call Immigration.

916
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,560
We had a deal. No ICE.

917
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,350
No deal.

918
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,980
Show us the fucking laptop!

919
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,980
Fine!

920
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,680
You want to see what I'm doing?

921
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,640
I am looking up fact after fact

922
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,180
about rich old fuck

923
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,680
who's about to marry
a bottom-rate whore

924
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,020
who I helped
smuggle into this country.

925
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,890
She gets to have American dream,

926
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,430
live life of beauty
and privilege

927
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,600
while I sit here and get shit on

928
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,140
by two ex-lovers who still

929
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,520
treat me like
a prostitute slave,

930
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,890
who make me wear
a vampire blouse

931
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,600
just to strip me

932
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,310
of the last bit of dignity
that I still have.

933
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,850
Yo, bro.

934
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,810
We gotta talk, man.

935
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,890
Yo, I'm working, all right...

936
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,430
Sierra kicked me out.

937
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,470
Yeah, I heard
you're a dad again.

938
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,890
Congrats.

939
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,600
I don't know what to do.

940
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,890
It took a long time

941
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,850
to get Lucas and Sierra
to trust me again.

942
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,140
Shit was finally
getting better for us.

943
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,220
All right, just keep
your voice down, all right?

944
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,220
Could you just...

945
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,560
Just talk to Sierra for me?

946
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,100
Tell her to take me back.

947
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,810
I can't get involved
in this, okay?

948
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,310
Please, man, please.
She respects you.

949
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,430
I don't know what I'll do
if I lose them again.

950
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,470
I'm finally clean, you know?

951
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,140
I don't want to be
a junkie again.

952
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,600
You gotta help me.

953
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,730
If not for me, for Lucas,

954
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,770
'cause I fucking love that kid.

955
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,140
And he...

956
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,060
He needs a dad.

957
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,930
Please, dude, just...

958
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,810
just... just talk to her.

959
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,520
That was a nice thing
you said to that woman.

960
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,390
Were you just
stringing me along earlier?

961
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,640
What?

962
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,560
The bowling thing?

963
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,520
No, I thought
it'd be fun to hang out.

964
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,140
Look, if-if you're not into me,
you just need to say so,

965
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,890
but don't invite me
to meet all your exes

966
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,390
and then ignore me
the whole time.

967
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,680
We're not in high school.
Just be up front.

968
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,680
You giving me ultimatums
before we're even dating?

969
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,470
Yeah. I am.

970
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,140
Also, I'm not some
messy, complicated chick

971
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,180
who's stuck in a house
with a crazy family.

972
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
I've got goals and plans.

973
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,100
And I'm an amazing
fuckin' catch.

974
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,100
What says "please stop
threatening to kill yourself"?

975
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,180
Rhinestone bracelet.
My four-year-old bedazzled it.

976
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,640
Excellent choice,
but sounds like

977
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,020
you're looking for more
of a promise ring?

978
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,310
What's a promise ring?

979
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,890
Like, commitment
with an exit route.

980
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,680
Got a red sapphire.

981
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Or this, cubic zirconia.

982
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,180
Looks like the real thing.

983
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,520
From the jewelry collection
of Iceberg Slim.

984
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,020
Local pimp. Hundred bucks.

985
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,270
Look, I gotta meet another
client, so what's it gonna be?

986
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,520
I'd go with the pimp.

987
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,520
In the name of Jesus,
the Lord's only begotten son...

988
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,980
...I rebuke
the devil's homosexuality

989

from your body and your soul.

990

You are pure and holy
just as you are.

991
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,020
Your gay body is a blessing,
not a sin.

992
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,180
No, sir.

993
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,390
No, sir. Not today.

994
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,520
This is not the place
for your message.

995

Oh, my message of love?

996
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,850
A church isn't a place for that?

997
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,270
You are not welcome here, son.

998
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,390
- Ushers!
- I'm not welcome?

999
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,470
I thought everyone was welcome
in the house of God.

1000

Easy, come on, fellas.
Take it easy.

Not when you're
disrupting God's word!

1002

All right, well, you can't stop

Fell from a horse,

final source of income

stripped away from me
by the Canucks.

I am penniless and empty-handed,

and the only solace I have

1080

is sharing a lot of beers

Three horrible diseases.

00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:07,964
The fact that
you're all cheating

979
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,797
is a lot more serious

980

You saw the baby
come out of that thing,

Our strike ended.

1300
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:15,839
We were able to negotiate

1301
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:17,631
peaceable and non-abusive
engagements.

1302
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:19,214
Did you hear what I said?

1303
00:51:19,298 --> 00:51:21,173
I got approval
to take a loan

1304
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:22,214
- against my building.
- Now, some of the bangers

1305
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:23,839
are slow to pick up

1306
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:25,006
on what that actually means,
but, you know,

1307
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:25,839
with the upbringing
they've had,

1308
00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:27,673
I'm not surprised.

1309
00:51:27,756 --> 00:51:29,089
Listen, if I bail you out,
are you gonna show up

1310
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:31,214
for your trial?

1311
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:34,839
I-I have no idea where Shim's
gonna take me, Fiona.

1312
00:51:34,922 --> 00:51:35,797
Who?

1313
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:37,631
Shim.

1314
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:38,797
What the hell is a shim?

1315
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,423
[laughs]

1316
00:51:40,506 --> 00:51:41,797
I mean, we have no idea

1317
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:43,590
if God's a she or a he,
do we?

1318
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:47,089
Oh.

1319
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:49,047

for your cooperation.

1325
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:04,548
Uh, we've contacted
your other sexual partners.

1326
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:06,006
Uh, some of you
are gonna need to find

1327
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,381
a new yoga instructor.

1328
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:08,381
Couple of you gentlemen
are gonna need

1329

to look for a new assistant.

1330
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:10,964
What if I stay with Richard

1331
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:12,506
every Tuesday, Thursday,

1332
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,423
- and alternating weekend?
- Perfect.

1333
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,590
You're gonna become
a "thruple"?

1334
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:17,047
Yep.
Thanks, Frank.

1335
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:19,715
Aww, that's just great.

Let's go, boys.

So,

1338
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:25,131
we made it
to the other side.

Who knew STDs could bring
so much happiness?

Hey, Gallagher.

I want to thank you
for showing me

1342

my wife is.

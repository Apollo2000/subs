Here's what you missed
on Shameless last week.

3
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,259
I got really drunk.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:07,423
I got really drunk.

5
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:11,259
And I'm not sure
what happened after that.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,637
What the hell is he doing here?

7
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:16,597
I can't afford to live somewhere else
and support you two.

8
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,016
- Hi, Frank.
- Shit!

9
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,103
- Who the fuck's Tony?
- Tony, sweet.

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,189
The cars I sell are mainly not mine.

11
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,524
I like you, Fiona.

12
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,152
You remember Steve?

13
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,530
Yeah, how's it going?

14
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,576
She doesn't care if you have a girlfriend.
Neither do I.

15
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:37,286
- I'm getting married.
- You what?

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,911
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha.

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,539
Veronica, will you do me
the honor of being my wife?

18
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,417
- Yes!
- You don't seem very happy...

19
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,878
...to be getting married.
- It's because I'm already married.

21
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:01,203
I wasn't thinking
about getting married. He brought it up.

22
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,206
Now I'm, like, obsessed. Phillips.

23
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:05,873
Wasn't he drunk when he proposed?

24
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,253
Oh, yeah, it was like that David
Hasselhoff video, eating a cheeseburger.

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,965
- I never saw that.
- Oh, YouTube it, it's a car wreck.

26
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,758
You can't not watch.

27
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,054
You want a drunk proposal to be
the story you tell your grand-kids?

28
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,140
My husband proposed to me
at the top of the Sears Tower.

29
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,560
Champagne and roses.

30
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,855
Six months into the marriage
I found out he was fucking my sister.

31
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:33,151
- And the moral of the story is?
- My sister's a bitch.

32
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,697
Other than presents and booze,
give three reasons to get married.

33
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,949
Lots of people who love each other
get married every day, Fiona.

34
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,204
I don't know, V. The way things are
between you and Kevin right now...

35
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:48,917
...it seems perfect. Why ruin it?

36
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,432
What do you get for that?

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,227
- What?
- What are they paying...

38
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,437
...for the neck thing? Disability.

39
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,481
Six hundred seventy-four bucks
a month.

40
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,987
That's what I get, heh.

41
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,740
But look, I can do this:

42
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:39,968
While I admire your commitment,
I gotta tell you, it's a bit over the top.

43
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:48,602
I told them I get migraines.

44
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,812
- Genius, huh?
- Huh?

45
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,689
- Try proving I don't have them, heh.
- Ugh.

46
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,487
I bet it itches
like you got crabs in there.

47
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,336
Kev, come out.

48
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,091
- You done?
- Why are we getting married?

49
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,593
- What?
- Other than the presents and the booze...

50
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,180
...can you tell me three good reasons
why you want to get married?

51
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,016
Not really. Wait a minute.

52
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,894
This isn't one of those tests, is it? Where
I'm supposed to change your mind?

53
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,146
Heh, if it is, you just failed.

54
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,149
You don't want to get married?

55
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,778
I mean, things between us
are pretty great. I don't want to ruin it.

56
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,447
- What would we tell people?
- That the wedding's off.

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,283
- No one's damn business why.
- Yeah?

58
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,079
- Yeah.
- Well, great then.

59
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,502
- Guess I gotta tell Momma.
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,129
That's gonna suck.

61
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,716
She's on her way over
to talk about the blessed event.

62
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,552
I am gonna miss getting
a free KitchenAid mixer.

63
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,389
Can you register for gifts
if you're not getting married?

64
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,100
- I got a gift for you. Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

65
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,356
Here comes the bride

66
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,401
All dressed in white

67
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,028
Which I think you can
still get away with, baby.

68
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,615
Hey, Momma.

69
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,411
Oh, I can't believe it.
Oh, I can't believe it!

70
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,081
I can't believe this. What happened?

71
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,542
- Nothing happened.
- How could you do this to me?

72
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,545
Look, nothing's gonna change.
Kev and I are still together.

73
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,423
- Yeah, Momma...
- Don't call me Momma.

74
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,175
We're just cutting out
all the paperwork. Right?

75
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,512
You know, and besides,
until gay people...

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,805
...can get married in this state...

77
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,600
...I'm not gonna.

78
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,896
This isn't what your father wants.
You know that, don't you?

79
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,773
Daddy's dead.
He doesn't want anything.

80
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:02,069
Your daddy, rest his soul,
wants to see his little girl married.

81
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,821
- Look, Momma, I...
- He set a little something aside...

82
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,156
...for you for once
you finally settled down.

83
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,201
- A little what?
- Daddy left you money...

84
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,161
...for your first home
once you got married.

85
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,331
- A house?
- He thought it might keep you...

86
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,957
- ...from being somebody's baby-momma.
- How much?

87
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,961
I don't know, he wanted the envelope
opened on your wedding day.

88
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,423
Now I guess we'll never know.

89
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,386
I just... I never knew
how much it meant to Daddy.

90
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,930
The world.

91
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,014
Maybe we should reconsider, babe.

92
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,183
Heh, but what about the gay people?

93
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,685
They got their parades, they can wait.

94
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,483
It's hot. I'm hot.
Ahem, are you guys hot?

95
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,822
Hot.

96
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,742
- Fiona.
- Coming.

97
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,048
- Hi.
- Hey.

98
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:08,677
- Oh, it's fresh?
- And clean as a whistle.

99
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,930
Thanks, Fiona. You have
no idea what this means to me.

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,641
Means you get to smoke weed and keep
your government job and I get to eat.

101
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,228
It's lasagna, straight from the oven.
Still warm.

102
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,064
So's this.
Keep it that way if you wanna pass.

103
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:26,444
- Lunch. Eat it or miss it, people.
- Thanks. Bye.

104
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,697
- What, more piss food?
- You know it.

105
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,406
All right.

106
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,411
- Cup-a-lasagna, anyone?
- Right here.

107
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,665
- Who was on dishes today?
- Uh, I'll get them after lunch.

108
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,082
Hey, Debs...

109
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,586
- ...you ready to go to Target?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

110
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,463
What's that smell?

111
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,132
- It's either vomit or fancy cheese.
- It can be both if you want.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,052
- Target?
- Deb's gonna go help me register gifts.

113
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,430
Mm, good.

114
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,266
- I thought the wedding was off.
- Back on.

115
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,810
- Kev know?
Mm-hm.

116
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,978
Oh.

117
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,482
- Hey.
- Damn.

118
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,153
Tell that girl I will crap on a paper plate
for her if it gets me some of this grub.

119
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,459
- Francis Gallagher.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,302
Drop your pants.

121
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,307
I don't see how this has any bearings
on my migraines.

122
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,601
Me neither, but it's on the state form.

123
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:41,811
Drop them, sailor.

124
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,900
- Unh.
- Still cold, ha, ha.

125
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,277
- Cough.
- Ahem.

126
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,071
Again.

127
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:53,447
Again.

128
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,158
That's weird.

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,120
Have you ever done
a testicular self-examination?

130
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,875
Oh, God, no. I say leave those three
bad boys down there alone.

131
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,876
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

132
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:09,004
Should only be two testicles
invited to this party.

133
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,466
- What's this?
- I need you and your testicles...

134
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,467
...back here tomorrow for a biopsy.

135
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:16,596
So I got an extra passenger on board,
what's the big deal?

136
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,722
- Normal number's two.
- Not for me.

137
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,850
Third guy's always been there.
He's my lucky charm. Gave me six kids.

138
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,311
Hmm.

139
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,605
Probably benign, then.

140
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,984
You're smart not to worry
until you do a biopsy.

141
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,152
Gives you something to worry about.

142
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,913
Uh, you can't bring a baby
into a bar, ma'am.

143
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,165
You can't get married
if you already are.

144
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,750
I know, I know.

145
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,961
- Why the hell doesn't she know?
- Because.

146
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,797
- I'm afraid to tell her.
- Kev!

147
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,509
I don't wanna make her sad, Fi.
It would break my heart to hurt her.

148
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:59,556
Just tell her the truth, Kev.
If you don't, I will.

149
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,686
Can you hit me with a milk refill?

150
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,607
The devil's in my balls, Billy.
And he's coming for the rest of me.

151
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,067
- Let's hope he can swim.
- Why, Billy?

152
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:13,320
Why me?

153
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:18,240
- Because you're an asshole, Frank.
- Doc says it's probably benign.

154
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:21,327
Look at Lance Armstrong,
he had that ball cancer.

155
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,539
- Ends up fucking a rock star.
- That's right. That's... See?

156
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:28,043
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, hey!

157
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,293
Mm-hm.

158
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,087
Okay, I know this is silly.

159
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:35,591
But I'm really starting to get excited
about this whole wedding thing.

160
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,428
The gifts and the wedding,
and being Mrs. Kevin Ball.

161
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,099
You know old man Parson's place
on 5th?

162
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,934
- I think we should buy it.
- What?

163
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,812
The one where the son went crazy
and hit him with an ax?

164
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,774
It's for sale. We should start
getting our stuff together.

165
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,110
All the loans
and credit scores and all that.

166
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:56,613
What's the matter, babe?

167
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,823
I'm sure they got the blood
cleaned up by now.

168
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:07,206
I can't marry you, Veronica.

169
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:12,544
I'm already married.

170
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:17,424
She's beautiful.

171
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,511
She's a head-case.
She used to throw plates at me.

172
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,932
Couldn't handle her booze.
That's how I got scars on my neck.

173
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,394
You have no idea how many times
I wanted to tell you over the years.

174
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,938
But the more time went on,
the more unreal it all seemed.

175
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,859
You look like a douche bag
with that mullet.

176
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,863
Oh, I can't believe this.

177
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,948
Guess I can forget
about buying a house.

178
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,616
Yeah.

179
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,036
- Maybe not.
- What do you mean?

180
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,664
You don't actually have to get married.
Your mom wants a wedding.

181
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,459
So give her one.

182
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,461
I could get ordained online.

183
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,879
Then we don't file the license
with the state.

184
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,716
- Ha-ha-ha.
- A fake wedding.

185
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:03,721
Why not? You'd still be married.
It just won't be legal.

186
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,142
- Yeah, but what's the point, then?
- All the free shit, baby.

187
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,562
- Oh, damn. That would've sucked.
- Baby, come on.

188
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,066
Showing up at your wedding
fucking paralyzed and shit? Yeah.

189
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,692
Oh, shit.

190
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:22,197
It looks a bit like Top Ramen
in there, doesn't it?

191
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,663
Sweetie, would you like me
to come with you to your biopsy?

192
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,914
No, it's probably nothing.

193
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,418
Benign cyst. An ingrown hair.

194
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,419
Yes, I think you're right.

195
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,505
You're gonna be just fine.

196
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,886
Why the hell are you crying?

197
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,562
I knew it was too good to be true.

198
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,147
You're gonna die.

199
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,859
Jesus, Sheila. I'm not gonna die.
I haven't even had the biopsy yet.

200
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,696
It was probably that nut-vise sex toy
of hers that gave you the damn cancer.

201
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,407
I'm gonna need the house next week
for bible study.

202
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,369
We're doing the Passion play again.
It might get noisy.

203
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,255
I have two plots...

204
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,924
...at Oak Woods Cemetery.

205
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,676
One was for Eddie.

206
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:29,224
Nothing would make me happier
than to bury you in one of them.

207
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,226
Wait there for me.

208
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,770
Oh, God.

209
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,563
I'm gonna die.

210
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,568
He married your father and I,
Aunt Rochelle, Uncle Bobby.

211
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,822
And cousin Jimmy with that first wife,
with the cleft palate.

212
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,451
A cleft palate is merely
the mark God leaves...

213
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,578
...when he kisses a person
before they're born.

214
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,748
Girl's momma
just skipped the folic acid.

215
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:59,504
I'm gonna need you both to come to my
weekend Engagement Encounter retreat.

216
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,381
It covers all of the Pre-Cana material...

217
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,677
...necessary for you to get married
with God's blessing.

218
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,096
Uh, could you excuse us
for just a second, please?

219
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,558
Might be fun to do it
at a church outing, huh?

220
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:15,102
Veronica, that man in there is a priest.

221
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,398
He's gonna require a license.
A marriage license.

222
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,775
I'm pretty sure bigamy
is still a felony in the state of Illinois.

223
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,861
Why'd you let your mom
drag us here?

224
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,280
- Momma wasn't gonna take no.
- What about Fiona?

225
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,950
- Wasn't she gonna marry us?
- Relax, baby, I got this.

226
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,955
Momma, we already have someone
that's gonna do the wedding for us.

227
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,624
This some healing hands, voodoo,
wheat-grass jackass?

228
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,961
Because that's not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes. Tell them, Father.

229
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,423
Tell them that is not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes.

230
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:49,971
Well, I know this. That just like
the honeybee, God has many eyes.

231
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,057
Look, it has to be a priest.
That's what your father wanted.

232
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,686
That's what I want.
And that's what the Lord wants.

233
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,399
- Wedding's not gonna work.
- What happened?

234
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,150
Momma wants a real priest.

235
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,320
Sheila said she'd make
your wedding dress.

236
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,990
Oh, that's nice, but what good is
the dress if I don't have a priest?

237
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,035
You could hire an actor. Remember
the guy who played Elmo at my birthday?

238
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:15,580
- You remember that?
- He took his head off.

239
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,750
- It was traumatizing.
- Think an actor could work?

240
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,003
I can probably get Father Pete to do it,
if Carl will help.

241
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,090
- What's it gonna cost me?
- Uh, Karen and I use your place Friday?

242
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,842
- Done.
- Father Pete? The groper?

243
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,135
God willing.

244
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:33,847
- We got hot dogs?
- Hmm, no hot dogs.

245
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:41,730
What?

246
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,904
Excuse me.

247
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,365
Better late than never.

248
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,533
Even better on time.
What's with the costume?

249
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,578
ROTC.
I made cadet lieutenant colonel today.

250
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,373
- You did? That's great.
- Yeah.

251
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,706
Congratulations.

252
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,044
When I get back, I want the stock shelved
with all labels facing the same direction.

253
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:07,130
- Where are you going?
- Your head is like a funnel.

254
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:10,717
- The Boy Scout trip is this weekend.
- They have Muslim Boy Scouts?

255
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,720
Similar. Motto is still "Be Prepared."

256
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,554
But you learn how to work
with chemicals instead of tying knots.

257
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,267
The troop is sponsored
by the Baptist church.

258
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,477
They give us free outfits
and overnights...

259
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,730
...and we let them think
we're assimilating. Everybody wins.

260
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,899
I'll be back Sunday night.

261
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,154
Lieutenant colonel?
I am so proud of you.

262
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:32,990
It's not that big of a deal.

263
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,326
Linda and the boys are gone
for two nights.

264
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,328
We're gonna have a whole night together
to celebrate.

265
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,475
Unh, oh, God!

266
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,520
- God, I'm sorry.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

267
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,441
Was that the biopsy?
God, right in the...

268
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,651
Here, let's take a look.

269
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,778
- Unh.
- I'm just gonna take a look.

270
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:18,452
Okay, well, that is definitely better.

271
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,708
- I think you're okay.
- Well, now, yeah.

272
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,792
I'm just gonna shave you, okay?

273
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,049
I've never been shaved
down there before.

274
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,969
Just doing a small section.

275
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,394
Okay. Oh.

276
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm sorry about that.

277
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:53,320
Maybe I could come back later
and you could shave the other two.

278
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,660
- There. All done.
- Ooh.

279
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,497
Feels like spring.

280
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,501
Wish I could say
this wasn't gonna hurt.

281
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,383
You don't have to go crazy, Sheila,
but as close to Vera Wang as you can.

282
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,676
You are going to make a beautiful bride.

283
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,556
Oh, Sheila, you're making me
feel like Cinderella.

284
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:23,226
Screw Cinderella.
Little doe-eyed bitch.

285
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,561
Probably one of the worst
role models for little girls.

286
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,190
I think Cinderella was a feminist.

287
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:33,611
The whole idea of marriage is a useless
vestige of an archaic civilization.

288
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,864
- How would you know?
- I watched one unravel.

289
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,867
Oh, so one example of a bad one
makes them all bad? Hmm?

290
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,622
Marriage was nothing more than
a legal exchange of women for property.

291
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,125
- Maybe you're being a little pessimistic.
- Heh, it's just a piece of paper.

292
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,211
A birth certificate is just a piece of paper.

293
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,257
And money.
Money is just a piece of paper.

294
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:57,425
- But those are pretty valuable.
- True.

295
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,304
Hey, Gloria Steinem,
enough of the blah-blah.

296
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:03,223
- Let's talk bachelorette party.
- I got that covered.

297
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,017
- Oh, you better.
- Mm-hm.

298
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:06,769
Because we gonna be doing it.

299
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,230
- What the...? Uh-huh. Mm-hm.
- Single ladies, go on.

300
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:13,733
Feeling sick. Feeling tired.

301
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,864
Seeing more of my oncologist
than I see of my whole family.

302
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,451
The hardest thing for me to accept
is the fact that I can't fix this.

303
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm used to being the mom, you know?

304
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,875
The one who takes care
of everyone and everything.

305
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,377
The fixer.

306
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,589
And this is breast cancer.

307
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,259
I can't fix this.

308
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,763
Just knowing your tits
are trying to kill you.

309
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,473
That's gotta suck.

310
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,144
I mean, mine's in my balls.

311
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:50,770
So they've got a reason to be pissed.

312
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,608
Tucked between two legs,
wedged right near your asshole.

313
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:59,363
There's no good way to sit,
no underwear that's been devised...

314
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,365
...to hold them effectively in place.

315
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,368
They're a bizarre appendage.
An afterthought.

316
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,289
Which is why I don't believe
in intelligent design.

317
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,500
There is no God.

318
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:14,961
We're all gonna die.

319
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,176
Why do I have to do it?

320
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,846
You're the only one young enough
to be an altar boy.

321
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,557
- We'll stop before anything goes down.
- Or anyone.

322
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,315
The Gallagher boys.

323
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:37,067
If you're here to steal
the basket, you're out of luck.

324
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,818
Already off to the bank.

325
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,906
No, Carl here
is interested in being an altar boy.

326
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,368
- That's a big responsibility.
- Yeah. We tried talking him out of it.

327
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,163
But he cried,
so we thought we'd bring him in.

328
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,665
See if you thought he had what it takes.

329
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,209
Hello there, Carl.

330
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,711
Be back for you in a bit, bud.

331
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,678
- Whew.
- Wanna watch Scarface again tonight?

332
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,012
Can't, got a date.

333
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,516
Ooh. Mandy date or Kash date?

334
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,893
Kash date.

335
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,354
You're a slut, man.

336
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,231
Shit.

337
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:21,862
Looks like we have a priest
for V's wedding.

338
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,200
- Fake priest?
- No, no. Priest is real.

339
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,536
We're just not gonna file the license.

340
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,871
Immoral, don't you think?
Lying to God's face.

341
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:32,580
- Really, Mr. Morality.
- Hmm.

342
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,417
- Whose car is this?
- Not like I have a priest in the back.

343
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,586
- Are you still picking up the cake?
- Angelica's Bakery.

344
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,633
Can Kev and V use this car
for their big exit after the reception?

345
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,721
Yeah, think that could work.
I just... I need it back right after.

346
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,638
- Okay.
- Can't do anything bad to it.

347
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,391
And no sex in it.

348
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,643
No sex in it?

349
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,856
I just need this thing in perfect condition.
All right, Fiona. I just...

350
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,401
Whoa, whoa!

351
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,944
- Oh, damn it. Damn it!
- Jesus.

352
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,739
Relax. Relax. It happens.

353
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:07,450
- Okay?
- Yeah, what happens, prison time?

354
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,252
Hey.

355
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,589
- Fiona, I thought that was you.
- Your uniform looks different.

356
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,259
Yeah, they issued new coats.

357
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,678
See you at Kev and Veronica's
wedding tomorrow?

358
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,262
Yeah.

359
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,432
- I need your license and registration.
- What? Why?

360
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,602
Officer, sir.

361
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,186
You were doing 35 in a 25.

362
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,189
There was some swerving, kind of weird.

363
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,941
Here's my license,
but I don't have the registration.

364
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,317
It's my friend's car.

365
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,445
You really are supposed
to have that on you at all times.

366
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,698
Lemme see what I can do.
I'll be right back.

367
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,159
Okay.
Why did you give him your license?

368
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,661
- That's not my real license.
- So now what? Run?

369
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:54,663
No, that never works.

370
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,792
Jesús, you got me?
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

371
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,045
- Who's Jesús?
- Follow car.

372
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,630
Always use a follow car.

373
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,019
Watch your speed.
See you at the wedding, Fi.

374
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,689
- Okay!
- Out.

375
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:22,525
- What?
- Get out.

376
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,989
What about the car?

377
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:31,491
Taken care of.

378
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:42,420
- My heart's in my throat right now.
- That's adrenaline. Kind of cool isn't it?

379
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,349
- I'll see you at the wedding.
- What?

380
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,353
- Angelica's Bakery, right?
- Yeah. Right.

381
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,192
I've decided to start
wearing a tie every day.

382
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,278
I could die at any moment.

383
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,200
I thought it'd be nice to look
my best for the grim reaper.

384
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,869
Son of a bitch.

385
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:20,458
You know what? Fuck him.

386
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,876
Fuck him!

387
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,712
Why give him the satisfaction?
I'll do it myself.

388
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,798
Take my own goddamn life.

389
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:32,219
You know...

390
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:34,430
You know what the real shame
of it is, Kev?

391
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,056
The real shame...

392
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:41,436
...is there are so many things
I still want to do.

393
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,230
Oh, yeah, like what?

394
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,150
Pfft!

395
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,319
Jesus Christ, I don't know.

396
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,988
I don't know.

397
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:55,159
How sad is that? A man doesn't
even know what he wants to do.

398
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:56,367
Woo-hoo-hoo!

399
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,828
- Hey, buddy.
- What's going on?

400
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,915
- What's this?
- You gotta wear it tonight...

401
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,460
...for the bachelor party.
Everyone's gonna wear one.

402
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:07,128
- Andy, get the fuck out...
- Don't be a dick, dude.

403
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,798
- Fucking wear it.
- Bachelor party?

404
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,426
Yeah, if you wanna go, you can come.

405
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,679
What's the plan?

406
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,641
Uh, me and my friends are gonna get
wasted and do stupid shit.

407
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,268
But we gotta get you one of these.

408
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,730
Awesome.

409
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,027
Is the blindfold for surprise
or so I don't know where you live?

410
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,238
- Little of both.
- Ooh.

411
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,409
- Ah.
- Ta-da.

412
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:40,287
Oh.

413
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,790
Oh.

414
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,044
Wow, yeah. This is your house.

415
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,212
Where you live with Linda.

416
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,508
- And the kids.
- Right now, it's our house.

417
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,491
- What's wrong?
- Sorry, it's just... It's too weird.

418
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,077
- What is?
- All of your shit, it's...

419
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,414
It's freaking me out.
And it smells like goats in here.

420
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,791
Ian, wait.

421
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:48,063
Why would she do it
in the first place?

422
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,690
Because she could.

423
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,192
She was, like, one of those
weird Chinese acrobats.

424
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,903
No, those girls are all tiny
and cute when they do it.

425
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,531
She was like Pippi Longstocking
kissing her own ass.

426
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,871
- Jesus.
- Dad, what the hell happened to you?

427
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:07,374
Cord was too long. I got three nuts.

428
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,460
Gonna die.

429
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,858
Fuck.

430
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:15,858
- Marty?
- Surprise, heh.

431
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,695
I'm maid of honor
and I didn't know you had a brother.

432
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:21,531
- There's a reason for that.
- He busted out of prison?

433
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,616
- Last night.
- What was he in for?

434
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,829
- Aggravated assault, larceny and arson.
- Arson? Who you talking about?

435
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,163
V's brother.

436
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, is that, like, a sibling brother,
or just a black-guy brother?

437
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,796
Remember the fire at Curves
in the mall? That was him.

438
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,632
He loves setting fire to things
and he hates women.

439
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,634
- It was the perfect storm.
- He's nuts.

440
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:44,304
Serious, he's nuts. He came at me.
I had to fight my ass off.

441
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,141
Then one time I'm having a brew,
he came up to me, all:

442
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:50,144
- "Ass cunt fuck!" on me.
- Is he retarded?

443
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,730
I wish. Tourette's coupled with bipolar
disorder and a drinking problem.

444
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,982
He's a shrink's wet dream.

445
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:59,318
- What are we gonna do?
- Kick his ass back to prison.

446
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:03,574
If there's one person you can always
count on to fuck things up, it's Marty.

447
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,535
- Bungee jumping, eh?
- From the L tracks.

448
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,372
Good news/bad: Your biopsy
results came back negative.

449
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,000
Tumor was benign, so you're not
gonna die of testicular cancer.

450
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:19,047
Oh, thank God. So I can keep it?

451
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:21,424
Yeah, but the swelling on your brain...

452
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,845
...you probably got going on in there
might end up doing you in.

453
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,555
- What?
- I'm fucking with you.

454
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,223
Bump looks pretty superficial.

455
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,227
If you vomit more than twice,
have any seizures...

456
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,105
...or experience memory loss,
call 911.

457
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:40,861
Well, what if I vomit while I'm having a
seizure, and have no memory of it?

458
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:42,320
Tree in the forest, my friend.

459
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,490
What?

460
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:51,997
You know you can't stay, Marty.
You gotta go back to prison.

461
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,917
Ron, it's bullshit security.
They practically give you your own key.

462
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,586
Aren't you risking parole?
How long do you have left?

463
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,588
Eighteen... Cocksucker! ...months.

464
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,925
- Jesus, Marty. That's no time at all.
- It's your wedding day, Ron.

465
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:08,096
Why don't you turn yourself in? Tell them
it was a mistake. Blame the Tourette's.

466
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:11,307
Tell them it won't happen again.
You know it's for the best.

467
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,059
Faggot!

468
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,395
We'll have you back
before they even know you left.

469
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,105
I'm not going back, Ron.

470
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:22,903
It's your wedding. I'm not gonna miss
your... Shit-pisser! ...wedding day.

471
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,162
This is the dress...

472
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,289
...that I will wear this afternoon.

473
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,336
And it will protect me...

474
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,755
...like this house protects me.

475
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,049
This is the dress.

476
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,927
And today is the day.

477
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,763
And the day is good.

478
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,683
You look nice.
Where are you pretending to go?

479
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,769
I'm going to a wedding today.

480
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,815
I am really gonna do it this time.

481
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:03,277
And it's supposed to be
a beautiful day today.

482
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:07,698
Beautiful and safe and sunny.

483
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:13,287
The sun's just a burning ball of fire that
could plunge from the sky at any time.

484
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,335
Maybe we should just let him come.

485
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:23,046
No way, I'm not having
that nutcase at my wedding.

486
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,840
Can you imagine the service?
"Do you, Veronica...

487
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,551
Fucking bitch! ...Fisher, take this man...

488
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,971
Fucks dick! ...Kevin Ball?"

489
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,265
Uh-uh, no.

490
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:34,766
I'm taking him to prison
where he belongs...

491
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,727
...if I gotta drag his ass
back there myself.

492
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,813
Always happens
when he's off his meds.

493
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,609
- Give me your dress so I can steam it.
- Behind the door.

494
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:51,325
- Nope.
- The bathroom door.

495
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,993
It's a real pretty dress, Roni.

496
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,289
It'll burn nicely with all this taffeta.

497
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,626
Oh, Jesus.

498
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,127
You send me back to jail...

499
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,464
...this dress goes up,
this house goes up, we all go up!

500
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,634
Marty?

501
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:11,636
Marty, open the door.

502
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,638
Open the goddamn door.

503
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,307
You're not getting married without me.

504
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,019
Cock fuck!

505
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,525
He's not doing anything.
Just sitting in there. Lighting a lighter.

506
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:28,612
Oh, my God, this is what he did
at Granddaddy's funeral.

507
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,239
- Gutted half the hospice.
- We should call the cops.

508
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:34,201
If the house goes up
we're not gonna get him out.

509
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:35,868
Call the cops on my own brother?

510
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,955
It's always like this.
Nobody can be the center of attention.

511
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,041
It's always gotta be about him.
You should be in a nuthouse!

512
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,252
- What's going on?
- Veronica's brother is threatening...

513
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,463
...to burn the place down.
- Cool.

514
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:52,134
He's saying that he's gonna light the
dress and the shit-sack house on fire.

515
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,221
What's a shit-sack?

516
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:59,058
All I wanted was to own my own home.
Maybe some small kitchen appliances.

517
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,394
For you, for me. For our home.

518
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:04,940
- Maybe some kids someday.
- I thought you didn't want any kids.

519
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,401
- Based on what?
- Saying how much you hate them.

520
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,236
Uh, yeah, other people's.

521
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:12,114
But I might not mind
having a baby Kev running round.

522
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,949
A little tomorrow person?

523
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,951
What?

524
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:19,246
That's what I call little mixed-race
babies. Tomorrow people.

525
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,914
Little people of tomorrow.

526
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,917
What are we gonna do?

527
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,753
- Maybe we should just call it off.
- No! Not a chance.

528
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,923
Baby, listen, this is our time.

529
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,801
We're gonna get fake married,
and nothing's gonna stop us.

530
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,977
- Tomorrow people?
- Tomorrow people.

531
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,108
Can you sign in for me
at detention today?

532
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,486
Mrs. Pinder won't notice,
she's almost blind.

533
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,029
You ditching?

534
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,531
Kash has something planned.

535
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,451
I thought that was last night.

536
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,662
Was supposed to be,
but, uh, he took me to his place...

537
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:02,455
...and it sort of freaked me out.

538
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:07,294
I mean, I always knew he had a wife
and a life and everything, but seeing it...

539
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:08,836
...and smelling it...

540
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,797
I mean, his life actually has an odor.

541
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,846
What was that for?

542
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,849
I just felt like kissing my boyfriend.

543
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,686
Have fun fucking Kash.

544
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,367
Remember when we were little?

545
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:43,121
And you'd always tag along with me
wherever I went?

546
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,541
I always looked after you,
didn't I, Marty?

547
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,460
And you know why?

548
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:52,005
Because I'm your big little sister.

549
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:55,759
And I didn't want you to get in trouble,
because I love you.

550
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,677
That's why I want you
to go back to prison.

551
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:03,599
Do you know what?

552
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,353
I've been thinking about my wedding,
and you know something?

553
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,356
You were right.

554
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,235
Because my wedding day
wouldn't be my wedding day...

555
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,653
...without my little big brother there.

556
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,371
In fact, I'd like you to be
the one to give me away.

557
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,958
Marty?

558
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:38,009
- You mean it?
- Cross my heart.

559
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,927
Come here, you little nut.

560
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,311
Bitches! You bitches lied to me.

561
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,733
I'm gonna burn down your...
Cock-sucking, cock-fucking...

562
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,250
Damn. That shit does dry fast.

563
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:23,847
Lip. My boy.

564
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:28,101
- My oldest boy.
- Yeah, here to pick up Karen.

565
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,021
- What's with the vest?
- Sheils made it.

566
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,692
Wow. Look at you.

567
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,610
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

568
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:39,028
- Hi, Lip.
- Hi.

569
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,989
Does my head look bigger?

570
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:43,157
Um...

571
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,994
- I don't think it can get any bigger, Dad.
- I have to keep an eye on it.

572
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,289
- Watch for memory loss and vomit.
- More so than usual?

573
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,833
Know what?

574
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,376
- I have a second chance at life.
- Mm-hm.

575
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,047
I'm not gonna surround myself
with negative energy.

576
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:02,302
How about you just show up at this
wedding and do what you do best:

577
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,762
Drink free booze and look happy.

578
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,641
- Yes?
- Heh.

579
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:11,101
All right, Frank. I am ready.

580
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,353
You're coming, Mom?

581
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,855
She's not going anywhere.

582
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,231
Yes, I'm coming.

583
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:19,527
I've got my purse, and my gift,
and my gloves.

584
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,072
And my selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor.

585
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,909
And my monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

586
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,371
And I have my anti-anxiety
disco biscuits.

587
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:34,751
And I am ready to go.
I am really ready.

588
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,980
I'll just get you a piece of cake, Mom.

589
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,532
That would just be...

590
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:09,034
...wonderful, sweetheart.

591
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:12,329
There's just so much
I've gotta get done here.

592
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,221
Ah, that bitch.

593
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,224
What kind of cock-suck
does this to her brother?

594
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:47,114
May daily problems
never cause you undue anxiety...

595
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:50,827
...nor the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives.

596
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:55,331
But may your hearts' first desire
be always the good things...

597
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:57,916
...waiting for you in the life of heaven.

598
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,253
- Amen.
- Amen!

599
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,755
- You may kiss the bride.
- Woo-hoo!

600
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,014
Oh, yes!

601
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,807
Yay!

602
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,769
It's on tonight
Ride that thing like a motorbike

603
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:18,438
Get it out!

604
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,938
We could get it on the dance floor

605
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:25,778
Yeah!

606
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,449
What's going on?

607
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:31,867
Get some, Father!

608
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,168
Come on, Dad, work it.

609
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,963
Go Liam! Go Liam! Go Liam!

610
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:46,590
Say what you gotta say

611
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,344
Take it down, take it down.

612
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,306
Take me away
Say what you gotta say

613
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,813
Oh!

614
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,315
If I was out of your reach
Would you jump for it

615
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:09,489
If I was out of your reach
Would you jump for it

616
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:14,159
Uh... Folks, let's face facts.

617
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:18,039
When it comes to good things,
most of them come in pairs.

618
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:22,918
Like your favorite jeans,
new socks, and Kevin and Veronica.

619
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,128
Aw.

620
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:27,507
And as it turns out,
most people's testicles.

621
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,552
So here's to the happy couple.

622
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,514
Kevin, Veronica,
may you always only have...

623
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:39,143
...two testicles between you.
L'chaim!

624
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,693
Oh. Oh, sweetheart.

625
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,362
May the good Lord watch over you
in your new home.

626
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,032
- Oh, thank you, Momma.
- Thank you.

627
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,579
Say it like you mean it, boy
Say it like you want it

628
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:01,708
Five hundred dollars?
Are you fucking kidding me?

629
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,588
We're getting a Barbie house, baby.

630
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:12,719
Maybe you're making yourself
too available?

631
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,927
You think?

632
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,931
Hey, lady friend,
where the hell is my cake?

633
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,601
Steve is supposed to be here
with the damn thing.

634
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:22,811
That's the trouble with the exciting ones.

635
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,815
The unpredictability
is what makes them so exciting.

636
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,735
But it's also what makes
them so damned unpredictable.

637
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:33,447
He may not be Steve, but he's here.

638
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,496
- Hi.
- Hi.

639
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,581
Do you wanna dance?

640
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,335
- The bible is the word of God.
- How can it be the word of God...

641
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,922
...if it was re-written by King James?
- Passed down from generation...

642
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,925
...to generation!
- Uh-uh-uh! It doesn't make any sense!

643
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:57,764
Aw. This was really a perfect day.

644
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,434
I only wish little Marty
could have been here.

645
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,802
You're late, Dr. Sherman.

646
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,228
I'm...

647
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,731
I can't...

648
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:55,905
Okay, Gallaghers, you're the only
family I got, so let's put this on film.

649
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,242
- Wait. Wait.
- Is it on?

650
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,329
- It's on, it's on. Wait.
- Did it go?

651
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,498
Oh.

652
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,918
Again, set it up again. Here we go.
Ready?

653
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:10,253
- Okay.
- Let's go.

654
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:15,717
- Wait, where's Lip?
- Where...? Oh.

655
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,510
Yeah.

656
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:19,554
Oh, yeah.

657
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,264
Oh, yeah. Give it to me. Oh, yeah.

658
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:26,603
Oh, yeah. Yeah!
Oh, yeah! Give it to me!

659
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:28,353
- Want me to give it to you?
- Yes.

660
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,231
Yeah, she said
she wants you to give it to her.

661
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,402
So just give it to her already! Okay?

662
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,028
Cock and balls!

663
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,887
It really was like a fairy tale.

664
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,811
And she was a real princess.

665
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:12,273
Yeah, well, she's dead now.

666
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,275
How's that for happily ever after?

667
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:22,115
Asshole.

668

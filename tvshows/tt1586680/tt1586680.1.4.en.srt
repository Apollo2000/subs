Sync by Monkeyman

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,086
For those of you who
were too fucking busy...

3
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:07,259
...this is what happened
last week on Shameless.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:07,631
...this is what happened
last week on Shameless.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,382
- I left them.
- You fuck!

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,760
This your home now?

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,973
First time in my life
I ever felt like I actually belonged.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,809
What is it like with my dad
living at your house?

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,893
- Weird.
- It's only gonna get weirder.

10
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,815
- Last night was my first time.
- You mean with me?

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,315
- Virgin?
- Yep.

12
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,859
Aunt Ginger has to go back?

13
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,446
- Don't make her go.
- She doesn't belong to us.

14
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:34,073
Old guy next door died in March,
which I guess makes us neighbors.

15
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:36,243
- Where's my damn toaster?
- Leave me alone.

16
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,829
You would not be so
pissed off if you didn't care.

17
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:41,914
I saw the way you looked at Steve
like a D-O-G in heat.

18
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,127
My mom heard about it.
She invited you to dinner.

19
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,630
Hey.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,074

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,543
Aw. Heh.

22
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,086
Sweet baby.

23
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,087
Put a scarf on.

24
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,639
Debbie, come in
and eat breakfast, okay?

25
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,515
You're up next in the shower.

26
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:25,853
I wanna play for a while.
Ask Carl if he'll get in the stroller.

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,604
Last time, you were locked
in the basement for a day.

28
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:31,233
On purpose.
We were playing Loser Goes to Gitmo.

29
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,153
Let's go. And put that
stroller back in the garbage.

30
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,876
Oh, my God. That's, uh... It's dead.

31
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,377
- You sure?
- Uh-huh. The element's rusted out.

32
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,629
Anyone wanna make
some cookies with me?

33
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,257
- How much to replace it?
- Uh...

34
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,884
- Two bills used, four new.
- Shit.

35
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,387
How about pie?
I can get started on the crust.

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,680
Go take your shower.

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,473
I wanna make pie.

38
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,518
You know what? Hand me the obits.

39
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,521
Maybe, uh, we can scavenge a dead
person's water heater. Thank you.

40
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:11,939
Oh. Mrs. Dombrowski.

41
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,860
Oh, the, uh, shaky-neck lady? I thought
she drowned a couple years ago.

42
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:20,407
No. Mrs. Goga had the shaky neck and
drowned in her own vomit last Easter.

43
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:23,868
No pie. Get in the shower.
I'm not saying it again.

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,370
Carl, no.

45
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,538
I went to school
with Kenny Dombrowski.

46
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,626
- Think he had a crush on me.
- Shh! Wake's this morning. Let's go.

47
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,877
- Up, up, up.
- Can I come?

48
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,587
Um...

49
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,173
No.

50
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,175
Debbie, what is going on with you?

51
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,219
Nothing.

52
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,102
Oof! Shower. After Debbie.

53
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,978
Towel and robe upstairs. Go.

54
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,317
You need to learn
how to change your own diaper.

55
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,173
It's getting windy.

56
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,884
Beautiful day for a party.

57
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,637
It's for kids, Frank. No booze!

58
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,894
Aw.

59
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,230
How would you like your eggs,
sweetie?

60
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,024
- Fluffy.
- Aw.

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,237
They're having a party across the street.

62
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:41,904
What, dear?

63
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:45,367
Across the street.
Some sort of a party for kids.

64
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,201
No booze.

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,538
What's the point?

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,425
Dad?

67
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,067
What the hell is he doing here?

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,029
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,449
- Debbie?
- Heh. What?

70
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,826
- What?
- Stay focused.

71
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,202
Are the Gallaghers in our bathroom?

72
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,582
- I know what you need.
- Huh? Uh-huh.

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,668
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah?

74
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,877
Yeah. Right there.

75
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:07,615
- They're pretty. Fluffy, fluffy.
- Aha! Woo! Mm.

76
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,206
Went to see a lawyer.

77
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,543
Yeah. It turns out I can't afford to live
somewhere else and support you two.

78
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,920
Three.

79
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,047
Why can't you stay with Uncle Ray?

80
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:25,675
He's got gangrene.
You ever smell a rotting foot?

81
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,012
Hey, why don't you get me a refill
there, huh, Karen, honey?

82
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,805
Did you lose your fucking legs?

83
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,141
That's your teenage
diseased mind talking.

84
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,769
You know, you tasted penii
and now you're just crazy.

85
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,903
Oh, shit!

86
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,488
That's cold!

87
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,615
What the hell? Veronica!

88
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,409
There's no hot water!

89
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,331
What?

90
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,084
Fucking Gallaghers.

91
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,465
Look at you letting yourself
into people's houses.

92
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,507
Tall grande latte, two shots.

93
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:49,925
- Sugar?
- Absolutely.

94
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,430
Kids home?

95
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,014
Mm.

96
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:58,310
Boys are out getting a water heater,
Debbie's at the park...

97
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,396
...Carl's out looking for defenseless pets
to torture, and Liam's down for a nap.

98
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,857
So?

99
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,692
No. I'm up to my ass in housework.

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,737
That's why I'm taking you
to a long, deep, leisurely lunch.

101
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,406
- Lunch?
- It's a euphemism.

102
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,740
How quaint.

103
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:16,202
Or would you like a demon dog
and a quick fuck over at the Sheridan.

104
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,995
- Liam?
- Get a sitter.

105
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,790
- Costs too much.
- How much?

106
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,792
At least 50 bucks.

107
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,088
- You're not paying me to fuck you.
- No, I couldn't pay you enough.

108
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,931
- Did you hear that?
- No.

109
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,182
You didn't hear that?

110
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,518
You trying to change the subject?

111
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,437
Liam?

112
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,149
He's too lazy to get out of his crib.
He just yells.

113
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,490
- You stay with Liam.
- Wait, wait, wait.

114
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,033
Hey. Hey.

115
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,994
You take the baby. I'll take the bat.

116
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,203
All right.

117
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,081
Now. Go.

118
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:23,562
Debbie, Jesus.

119
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,397
I thought you went to the park.

120
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,148
I came back.

121
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,942
Are you okay?

122
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,571
Katie Crasden's having a party.

123
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,197
Katie Crasden?

124
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,865
Two streets over.

125
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,284
And she didn't invite you?

126
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,536
She's only 3.

127
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,162
What happened?

128
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,418
Well, I was just walking
past and her dad, he...

129
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,211
Her dad did what?

130
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,426
He was laughing and playing with them
and it just... Just wasn't fair.

131
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,136
What wasn't fair? What?

132
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:58,763
Everything.

133
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,682
So I, um...

134
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,811
I stole something.

135
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,020
Oh.

136
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,480
- So nobody touched you?
- What?

137
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,317
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

138
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,616
Debbie?

139
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,749
Who the hell is that?

140
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,966
We can j... We'll just organize.
It'll be okay.

141
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,302
He's probably right around here.

142
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,307
Just relax.

143
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,600
Oh, here we go.

144
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,104
No traffic tickets to issue today?

145
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:52,900
No one to pull over
for swinging wide on a left-hand turn?

146
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,695
Or is this a supportive friend party...

147
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,822
...for a cop who shot some poor fucker
wasn't even armed?

148
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,369
Leave the people around here alone.
They're good folks.

149
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,703
Who are the parents?
Let's go, people. Out of the way.

150
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,038
Um...

151
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,624
- Your child's missing?
- Yeah.

152
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,668
I need your names
and the name of the child.

153
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,211
Uh, Beth and Gary Casden.

154
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,923
- When was the last time you saw?
- Uh, Casey.

155
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,799
- About an hour ago.
- Okay.

156
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,094
Okay. Uh, what was he wearing?

157
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,679
- Heh.
- Debbie...

158
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,515
...why would you steal
a little girl?

159
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,394
Why would you steal a little boy
and dress him like a little girl?

160
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,481
I wanted a girl,
but there weren't any.

161
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,277
Wha...? Then back to my initial question.
Why would you steal a baby at all?

162
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,570
I miss Ginger.

163
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,114
- What?
- Who?

164
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,282
You took away Aunt Ginger.

165
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,575
Who is Aunt Ginger?

166
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,411
Somebody from V's nursing home.

167
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,120
- What?
- She was my friend.

168
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,288
We have to take him
back right away, okay?

169
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,082
Where are his boy clothes?

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,335
I washed them.

171
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:57,173
Oh, my God. It shrunk.
You put it in the dryer?

172
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,466
That's what you do
after you wash something.

173
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,677
Um...

174
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,928
We can put him
in some of Liam's clothes.

175
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,057
We can't bring a missing kid
back wearing different clothes.

176
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,769
I mean, people will say we did
something to him. Something bad.

177
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,316
Attention, this is...
Attention, this is the Chicago...

178
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,942
- Push...
- I know what to push.

179
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,403
Attention. This is the...

180
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,903
- No, no.
- What are you doing?

181
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,907
- We have to get the information out.
- Then let me drive.

182
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,116
No.

183
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,161
I've been a cop a lot longer than you.

184
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,203
You don't get to drive and talk.

185
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,331
What, are you gonna call your uncle?

186
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,584
Attention. This is the Chicago Police.

187
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,793
We are looking
for a missing 2-year-old...

188
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,796
- Come on in.
- So we're just gonna wait?

189
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:40,716
He's a chain-smoking pothead
in a stress-inducing situation.

190
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,552
He'll be out soon.

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,261
What are we supposed to say?

192
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,971
I don't know. Just play it cool.

193
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,599
Play what cool?

194
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Things people play cool. Jesus, Ian.

195
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,979
You got your own cell?

196
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,940
- No, some kid left it in the cafeteria.
- Ah.

197
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,649
Hey, Kar.

198
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:01,361
I'm at some dead lady's house trying to
see if I can score a water heater.

199
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,072
Meet me after?

200
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,573
Hey, V?

201
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,116
I'm in the bathroom.

202
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:09,620
Hey. I'm in a bit of a jam.
Can you watch him for 15 minutes?

203
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,914
- Damn, Fi. I'm in the middle of...
- Thanks.

204
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,582
Okay. Sure.

205
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,086
Hey, Li...

206
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,130
Who the fuck are you?

207
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,263
Oh, shit.

208
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,893
Hey, Fiona.

209
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,144
Hey, Tony.

210
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,020
You remember Steve?

211
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,563
Yeah. How's it going?

212
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,191
Uh, hear about the missing boy?

213
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,775
No. What happened?

214
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:41,778
Got taken from a birthday party.

215
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,738
Think he might have
just wandered off?

216
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,157
We got everybody out looking.
Choppers, SWAT...

217
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,866
...extra units, Amber alerts.

218
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,952
Wow. Really?

219
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,206
We're gonna catch the bastard that took
Casey and chop his pedophile nuts off.

220
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,466
Less than two hours ago,
a young boy only 2 years of age...

221
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,884
...was abducted from his front yard.

222
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:09,304
You see this? This is what happens
when the world goes crazy.

223
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:11,557
People steal kids.

224
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,184
And Rastafarians
are allowed to roam free.

225
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:17,522
I don't mean real Rastafarians.
I mean Rastaman Goldbergs...

226
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,527
...from Lake Forest with rich parents
who get dropped off in town cars...

227
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,738
...then go beg for money on the streets.
What a load of crap.

228
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,698
Obama-care my ass!

229
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:32,995
What the news people don't tell you:
They love it when kids get stolen.

230
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:37,750
They're just looking for a good story
to saturate our airwaves with.

231
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,919
And why are all
the news ladies Chinese?

232
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:47,677
They should stick to what they know:
Railroads, sushi and dim sum.

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,096
Frank. Guess what.

234
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,600
I made muffins using
a bunt cake batter.

235
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,227
I didn't even need to add another egg.

236
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,940
- Hi, sweetie.
- The shithead gone?

237
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:03,150
- He just left for work.
- I'm still here.

238
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:07,447
- I'm just getting my coat.
- I just had some delicious penii.

239
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,823
- What?
- Little Casey up the street.

240
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,784
Gone missing right from
his own backyard.

241
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:15,538
Hmm. That's terrible.

242
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,958
You missed...

243
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,312
- Yes, ma'am.
- But my husband...

244
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,313
- I know you're all concerned.
- Of course.

245
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,816
Just everybody calm down.
I'll get to all of you, okay?

246
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,735
- Uh, you first, okay?
- All right.

247
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,696
I wasn't sure what size,
so I bought three just in case.

248
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,155
Oh, slow down.

249
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,407
- What?
- Stop the car.

250
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,327
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey. Almost new.

251
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,621
Debbie stole a baby.
We have to return it.

252
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,164
- Debbie stole a baby?
- Yeah.

253
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:01,375
- Why?
- It's Debbie.

254
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,711
I did not see that coming. Um...

255
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,298
- Can't we just give it back?
- I wish we could. It's too late now.

256
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,676
- Wow.
- Find Carl and get home now.

257
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,052
Yeah.

258
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,977
We're looking for a missing
boy named Casey...

259
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,145
...last seen
wearing a Superman costume.

260
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,942
Two years old. Any information
would be greatly appreciated.

261
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,192
No questions asked.

262
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,236
Why the fuck wouldn't
we ask questions?

263
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,364
Because we want
people to feel safe.

264
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,366
How do you find out
what happened if you don't ask?

265
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,869
You understand the premise?
People feel safe.

266
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,913
They give information.
We find the kid.

267
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,540
Safe my ass. I'm asking questions.

268
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,543
- Okay. Yeah. No. Go ahead. Yeah, sure.
- That's what you do.

269
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:45,836
- You do what you want.
- Uh...

270
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:49,090
Casey Casden. Uh, last seen
wearing a Superman costume.

271
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,259
Kev, stop.

272
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,635
What's Liam doing here?

273
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,471
It's not Liam.

274
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:59,267
- Who the hell is this?
- I don't know. Fiona dropped him off.

275
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,102
Attention, all residents.
There's a child still missing.

276
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,895
Approximately 2 years of age...

277
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,523
...wearing a Superman costume.
If you've seen...

278
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,442
Fucking Gallaghers.

279
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,237
When I was a kid,
we could go to a birthday party...

280
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:14,281
...and our parents wouldn't worry
that we were gonna get...

281
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,285
...stolen out of the front yard
by some perv.

282
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,787
That's when America had values.

283
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:25,125
Before Walmart, Dukakis,
peanut butter and jelly in one jar.

284
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,170
You're too young to remember this...

285
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:30,048
...but there was a time
when policemen were respected.

286
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,674
When young men
wanted to fight for their country.

287
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,471
When you could go vote twice
for Mayor Daley down at the 11 th Ward.

288
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:42,059
Before some liberal pricks elected
a Muslim who isn't even American.

289
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,729
We need to get your story
straight for the police.

290
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,480
Why did you take the boy?

291
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,192
He was crying for his mom
and his mom wasn't around.

292
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,734
Did you try to find his mom?

293
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,528
No, he was crying and nobody cared.
So I took him.

294
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,906
- You can't say that. What's with you?
- Fi.

295
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,619
Debs, was he inside or outside
of the yard when you grabbed him?

296
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,622
Inside.

297
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,041
- Okay, so how did you get him out?
- I waved a Snickers bar at him.

298
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,294
Did anybody see you?

299
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,463
- I don't think so. We just ran.
- That wasn't suspicious.

300
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,717
- So you were running down the street...
- I used a stroller.

301
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,384
- What stroller?
- Liam's old one.

302
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,221
The one I told you to throw out?

303
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:21,766
I fixed it. For emergencies.

304
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,354
Open up! Hurry!

305
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,855
Shit.

306
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,817
What in the hell is going on?

307
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,777
- Is this that kid?
- Debbie stole him.

308
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:36,322
We have to give him back
without getting her in Juvie.

309
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,406
- Why in the world would she steal...?
- Hmm.

310
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,827
There must be
a couple hundred cops out there.

311
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:45,539
I know. I'm so sorry.
Debs, will you watch him for a second?

312
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,915
Come with us.

313
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,085
Casey, we're gonna play games, okay?

314
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,670
I'm not sure what's going on.

315
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,673
Maybe it's because your mom bailed
and Frank's a big drunk.

316
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:57,009
What, I'm the asshole now?
She stole a baby.

317
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:58,385
She obviously planned it.

318
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,638
I mean, she took a stroller
out of the garbage and she fixed it.

319
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,268
Hey, Debbie still is a little kid.
Worst thing is she gets help.

320
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:06,853
- Help?
- What kind of help?

321
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,813
- She stole a baby.
- She's not crazy.

322
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,398
She just sort of
accidentally took a kid.

323
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,733
Not if she lured him with a candy bar.

324
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,362
- What are you suggesting?
- Some professional to...

325
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,739
- A shrink?
- Gallaghers do not do therapy.

326
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,450
Missing 2-year-old boy,
Casey Casden.

327
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,911
He was last seen wearing
a Superman costume.

328
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,372
If you have any information, call 911.

329
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,790
Look, we need a plan
to get that boy back.

330
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,126
Family Services
is gonna have a field day.

331
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,752
Family Services?

332
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:37,008
If they find out Frank's moved,
they'll take the kids, split them up.

333
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,384
Remember last time?

334
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,349
Shit.

335
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,518
Exactly.

336
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,814
You know that payphone
that's outside the Kash and Grab?

337
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,231
- Yeah.
- Get on your bike...

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,442
...go to the payphone
and call the police.

339
00:19:55,611 --> 00:20:00,780
Tell them that you saw a little boy
walking down Southport Avenue at 2:45.

340
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,074
- Okay?
- Why should I?

341
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:04,076
You wanna be
in a children's home?

342
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,119
Group home on Union
has a climbing wall.

343
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,413
- Carl.
- Ugh, I don't have a bike.

344
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,957
Wire cutter's in the drawer.

345
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,553
What?

346
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,806
Steve, Fiona, you guys have to get
Debs to take that kid back.

347
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:27,933
I don't know
that I can make that happen.

348
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,769
You have to or we're all fucked.

349
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,729
Okay.

350
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,146
Why do I have to do it?

351
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,900
We've already told the police
we didn't know anything.

352
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,693
- I'm not a good liar.
- You can do this.

353
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,780
- I'm not. You always say so.
- All right. Hey. You know what?

354
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,284
It's been hours and Casey's parents
are really worried about him.

355
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:49,788
Remember that pie you wanted to make?
Let's do that tonight.

356
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,084
What do I have to do?

357
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,836
I saw a little boy walking down
Southport Avenue at like 2:45.

358
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,383
- Two forty-five?
- Yeah, 2:45. Asshole.

359
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,510
Got a sighting. A kid saw the boy
walking down Southport.

360
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,930
I was walking up Southport Avenue...

361
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,640
...when I saw little Casey.

362
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,267
You didn't know his name.

363
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,558
- A little boy.
- Yeah.

364
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,478
- All alone.
- All alone.

365
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:14,814
And crying. I asked her
where her mom was.

366
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,065
Not "her."

367
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,818
Oh, um, I asked him where his mom was
and he didn't know.

368
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,154
He seemed upset,
so I gave him some chocolate.

369
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,950
Good, Debs. You're doing great.

370
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,786
Veronica, go to the cleaners,
ask Mrs. Bergdoll...

371
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,288
...to use the phone.
- That woman's a cold bitch.

372
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,540
I've got something for that.
Don't worry.

373
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,586
Hey, Mrs. B.
Can I use your phone really quick?

374
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:39,547
I got some green bud
for your glaucoma.

375
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,173
Hmm...

376
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:44,719
I saw a little boy with a Superman suit
walking down Grand.

377
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,346
- And what time was that?
- About 15 minutes ago.

378
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:50,348
I thought maybe this is the boy
everyone's talking about.

379
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,643
I'm sorry. A Spider-Man suit?

380
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,769
I didn't say Spider-Man.
I said Superman.

381
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,730
He had a cape and he was with a girl.

382
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:59,066
- Can you describe...?
- Asshole.

383
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:03,653
So I went to the phone outside
Connie's Pizza to call the police...

384
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:07,575
...but I couldn't use the phone,
because it was broken.

385
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:14,080
- And did you try to call anyone else?
- Yes, I did.

386
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,125
Oh. Right. I was standing on the street...

387
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,628
...and I asked people who were passing
if I could use their phone.

388
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,673
I said it was an emergency,
but no one listened.

389
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,801
I don't know
if it was because I was young...

390
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:29,555
...or poor.

391
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,109
Ha-ha-ha-ho!

392
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:50,201
Okay, let's see.

393
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,288
Oh.

394
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,084
Frank?

395
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,667
Uh-oh.

396
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,296
What am I gonna do?

397
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,465
Stop?

398
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,236
- Hi, Frank.
- Shit! Sorry, Karen.

399
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,364
- I thought you were gone.
- Frank?

400
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,656
Pass me a towel?

401
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,750
You got it all wet.

402
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:43,671
A hand towel's fine.
And don't throw it, please.

403
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,484
Casey!

404
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,905
- What time do you go into work today?
- Uh...

405
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,782
- I go in at 6.
- You're going in early.

406
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,577
Tell them you saw a little boy
in a Superman costume...

407
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:17,413
...walking down Grand Avenue.

408
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,832
What are you doing?
You're not on till 6.

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,085
I'm here now, what's the harm?
Gary, how you doing, man?

410
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,171
- Another Old Style?
- Yup.

411
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:30,634
Gosh, you know what?
I am feeling nostalgic today.

412
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,556
Hear what I said?
I said I was feeling nostalgic.

413
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:38,142
- What's "nostalgic"?
- Well, I'm glad you asked.

414
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,688
I was walking to work and I saw this cute
little kid wearing a Superman costume.

415
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:46,317
You know, with a cape and everything?
Takes you back. He was a cute kid.

416
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:52,740
Yeah, Superman costume.
Cute little kid.

417
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:56,285
- A little kid in a Superman costume?
- Superman costume, sandy hair.

418
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,537
That's the boy that's missing. Where?

419
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,873
On Grand.
I just passed him five minutes ago.

420
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,001
- Well, we have to call that in, Kev.
- Yes, we do.

421
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,505
How's my favorite lady?

422
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,757
She'll be better
when her numbers come up...

423
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:12,009
...and Allied Shippers
can kiss her fine black ass.

424
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,971
- I got a good feeling.
- You say that every week.

425
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:18,057
- Four vodka tonics?
- Only three today.

426
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:19,682
Marilyn wants a virgin colada.

427
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,686
She blacked out last night,
so she a little nervous.

428
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:27,982
No, no, no. If I can't buy my girlfriend's
mom drinks, what good am I?

429
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,401
No damn good.

430
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:32,738
- That's right. Can I get these for you?
- No, I got them.

431
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:34,949
Yes. He took it out.

432
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:40,703
- You were right there. Yeah.
- I was. No, I was.

433
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,164
Ladies, I'm just gonna
grab these glasses, okay?

434
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,167
You can grab anything of mine you like.
What's your name?

435
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,795
- Kev.
- Kev.

436
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:51,382
Well, that's nice and short
and easy to whisper.

437
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,633
Like, "Do it again, Kev."

438
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,050
- Heh.
- Uh-huh.

439
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,719
Yeah, heh.

440
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,637
Mr. Barkeep...

441
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,932
...a large boilermaker.

442
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,394
And keep them coming.

443
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,690
Did you bring in the water heater
from the porch?

444
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,650
- No.
- Well, it's not on the porch.

445
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,653
Seriously?

446
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:19,492
Bunch of fucking animals.

447
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,453
Steve, Debbie, Liam, we gotta go.
Fiona, you got Casey.

448
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,330
I'll see you at Sheila's after.

449
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,541
Hey, don't worry,
she's gonna be great.

450
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,336
- She doesn't even seem sorry.
- She is, she's just a kid.

451
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,007
She can't tell lies. She never could.

452
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,717
We're all going to jail.

453
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,386
Why can't I just take Casey back now?

454
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,640
We can't let anybody see you with Casey
leaving our house.

455
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,143
Fiona is gonna take Casey
to the rendezvous spot.

456
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,229
She'll give him to you
and you'll take him back to his house.

457
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:48,896
Otherwise, the plan won't work.

458
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,358
Fiona is gonna go to Sheila's
to make sure she has an alibi.

459
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,111
I don't think I can do this.

460
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:59,700
Yeah, you're gonna be great, Debs.
Just don't fuck it up.

461
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,624
- Hey, Debs?
- Yeah?

462
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,294
Do you know why doctors, lawyers
and nurses are great liars?

463
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,212
- No.
- Because they lie to help people.

464
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,174
A doctor wouldn't tell a sick patient,
"You're gonna die."

465
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,385
He would say, "We're doing
everything we can." Wouldn't he?

466
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,887
Yeah?

467
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,058
So pretend you're being a doctor today,
and tell a doctor's kind of lie.

468
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,603
Can you be a doctor for me?

469
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,813
Can I be a nurse?

470
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,231
That's my girl.

471
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:37,945
In a moment we will take you live
to the scene of the crime...

472
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,824
...with our head correspondent,
Charles Catino.

473
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,160
But first,
if you have any information...

474
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,578
...regarding the whereabouts
of Casey Casden...

475
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,414
...please call the number
at the bottom of your screen.

476
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,583
Charles, are you there?

477
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,381
Shots on me.

478
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,051
You are soaking wet.

479
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,261
- Wipe it up.
- Get it. Get it.

480
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,263
Check, please.
Can we have the check?

481
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:11,105
Uh, so...

482
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:13,231
...fixing up the basement?
- Mm-hm.

483
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,693
Gonna try.
Sheetrock that corner space for my bed.

484
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,363
The other half's already paneled,
so I'm good there.

485
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,324
Got a spot for the sink.
Toilet's already in.

486
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:26,662
So just run some cable
for the flat screen and I'm all set.

487
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,205
So...

488
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,501
...that Sheila, she's something, huh?
Heh.

489
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,878
That's one way to put it.

490
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:39,883
Does your ass ever stop hurting?

491
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:47,057
No. Advil's your best bet.
It helps with the inflammation.

492
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,727
Hey, Kev.

493
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,394
- Hey.
- See my friend?

494
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,772
I know she acts like she hits
on everyone, but she doesn't.

495
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,442
She likes you.

496
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,359
Well, I'm flattered, but I can't.

497
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,445
Kev, you wanna get to it?

498
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,364
Oh, come on,
what could one little drink hurt?

499
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:05,867
Um, you know. Really, no.

500
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,912
Look, she doesn't care
if you have a girlfriend.

501
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,288
Neither do I.

502
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,459
Can you handle two?

503
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:17,546
What, the both of you?

504
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,425
Uh, I can't, really.

505
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,636
Actually, I'm getting married.

506
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,222
Wha...? What's that, now? Married?

507
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,184
- No, no... Frank, can I get you a shot?
- Veronica?

508
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,688
- Frank...
- Hey, Jess, roll out the champagne.

509
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,816
- Our boy here's getting hitched.
- What?

510
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:41,028
- Kev is marrying Veronica.
- Frank...

511
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,404
- Carol. Carol, come here.
- Ahh!

512
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,823
- No, Frank...
- Carol.

513
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,741
- No, no, no.
- Carol.

514
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,035
No, no, no. Frank...

515
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,621
Kev's making an honest woman
out of your daughter.

516
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,122
- You what?
- Yeah!

517
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,664
Oh, my God! Ha, ha.

518
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,000
To think I was drinking,
worrying about that missing boy.

519
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,336
- Who gives a shit about that now?
- Hey!

520
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,464
- My daughter's getting married!
- Kev's getting married to Veronica.

521
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:08,096
And I got the oldest bottle
of Asti Spumante.

522
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:12,392
You have made me
the happiest woman in the world.

523
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,728
- I'm gonna go call Veronica.
- Wait, wait! No.

524
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,355
She'll wanna call you.
Don't ruin the surprise.

525
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:20,400
Okay, everybody, drinks on the house!

526
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,321
Here we go. One for the mama.
There you go.

527
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,535
All right, one for the big daddy.
Now for the mama. There we go.

528
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,452
Yeah!

529
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,455
You're getting married!

530
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,751
Woo-hoo!

531
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,107
Fiona Gallagher?

532
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:02,733
Yeah.

533
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:05,319
- Yeah, what about her?
- Nothing.

534
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,364
Good.

535
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:15,079
You really wanna hook up with her?
A lot of kids over there, man.

536
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,541
Heh. You're kidding, right?
Your marriage only lasted six weeks.

537
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,836
- Seven.
- And she wound up with the house.

538
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,588
My car's paid off!

539
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,173
You giving me advice is ridiculous.

540
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:51,616
Fiona, what a pleasant surprise.

541
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,036
They haven't found him yet?

542
00:31:55,913 --> 00:32:00,250
I can't stop thinking about
what his parents must be going through.

543
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,169
I know.

544
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,756
Less than two hours
ago, a young boy only 2 years of age...

545
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,215
Do you want a drink?

546
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,720
I've got a lot of booze. No mixers.

547
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:13,346
Cup of coffee would be great.

548
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:16,307
Will not rest
until the little boy is returned home.

549
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,726
Why don't I make it?

550
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,520
Oh, don't mind me.

551
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,651
I accidentally took three of my pills
instead of one.

552
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:29,320
In just a moment we will take
you live to the scene of the crime...

553
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,365
Hey, wait a second.

554
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,576
Hi, mister. Hey there.

555
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:39,705
How about giving me a big hug?

556
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,042
I quote, "The city will not rest..."

557
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,134
I'm gonna blush and then they'll know.

558
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,096
I can't be a nurse.
I'm not patient, I hate bed pans.

559
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:58,767
I can't walk in clogs,
and let's face it, I'm too small.

560
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,395
Peekaboo. Peekaboo.

561
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,942
- Peekaboo. Peeka...
- Oh, my God.

562
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,407
Mommy!

563
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,368
- Casey's back!
- I don't believe it.

564
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,828
- Is it him?
- Mommy!

565
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,873
- It is. It is.
- It's him, he's back.

566
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:28,963
My baby. My baby.

567
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,508
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick.

568
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:32,884
Where did you find him?

569
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:35,929
He was walking all by himself.
I didn't know where he lived.

570
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:39,223
- Thank you, you're an angel.
- I don't... I don't...

571
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,184
I don't know how to thank you.
Uh, here, just, um...

572
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,648
Here, take all... Take it. Take all of it. Just
take everything. Thank you. Thank you.

573
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,569
I told you we'd find him.

574
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,698
My Debbie found him.
A Gallagher saved the day.

575
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:57,116
You bunch of losers. Heh.

576
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,579
Bye.

577
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,125
That's Debs'.

578
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:08,378
No, I'm just helping her.

579
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,882
You're on my hand. You're...

580
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,677
All right, I am your father.

581
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,347
Hey, Deb. Good job.

582
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:22,184
- Fiona, you wanna come with us?
- Where?

583
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,269
- We need to take Deb to the station.
- What for?

584
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,063
We need to take a statement.

585
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,193
She found him.
I mean, isn't that enough?

586
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,445
We need a statement.
You can stay with her.

587
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:37,907
Nurse Debbie can handle it.

588
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,411
What I'm trying to tell you is...

589
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,956
...that I have never seen her love
anybody...

590
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,251
- I mean, anybody...
- Come on.

591
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,380
No. Anybody as much as she loves you.

592
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,467
- For real?
- Mm. For real.

593
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,429
- Including her daddy. Mm-hm.
- No.

594
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,181
Come on.

595
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,393
Ooh, and, honey, she love him like...
Mm.

596
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:10,440
Ooh. Mm.

597
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:15,362
Shit.

598
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:25,204
V!

599
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,083
V!

600
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,003
- V!
- Hey!

601
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,588
V!

602
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,385
You hear me?
I need to speak to Veronica Fisher.

603
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,304
- What the hell?
- Would you shut up out there?

604
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:47,018
- What are you doing?
- I'm here to tell you something.

605
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,188
I mean, I'm here to ask you something.

606
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,690
How did you get so drunk
in the afternoon?

607
00:35:56,862 --> 00:36:00,574
Veronica Fisher, will you do me
the honor of being my wife?

608
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,786
- Yes, heh. Yeah! Yeah! Yes.
- Oh.

609
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,581
- I love you, baby.
- Ha-ha-ha.

610
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,251
I first saw him on Southport.

611
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,922
He caught my eye because
my baby brother Liam loves Superman.

612
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,259
After I noticed he was alone,
I took his hand. He's a good walker.

613
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,260
Very well-mannered for a toddler.

614
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,222
I thought for sure
someone would let me use their phone.

615
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,599
I'm just so shocked
at the lack of humanity.

616
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:27,893
Yes, I'd love a cookie.

617
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:30,853
I remembered Grand Avenue
from my Aunt Ginger.

618
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:34,733
Do they require you to wear a jacket
and tie, or is that your choice?

619
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,693
I find it very sexy.

620
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,628
- Big day.
- Yeah.

621
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,836
Happy ending.

622
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,298
Yep.

623
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:06,014
You missed a good pot roast last week.
My mom really, uh, pulled out all the stops.

624
00:37:07,557 --> 00:37:09,391
Yeah.

625
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:13,021
Sorry about that.

626
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,199
That's so great about Debbie
finding that little Casey.

627
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:29,496
Yeah, I know. He's lucky it was her
and not some crazy fucker.

628
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,123
Like your new jeans.

629
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,460
Oh, thanks. They didn't cheer me up
as much as I'd hoped.

630
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,088
My house is so fucking weird.
I wish I'd been kidnapped.

631
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,382
Is it that bad?

632
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,509
You should have seen them
at breakfast.

633
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,927
I can't imagine
what dinners are gonna be like.

634
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,472
In fact, as soon as he gets down
to the bottom...

635
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,307
...I look back and there are
all these people behind us.

636
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,853
- And I start yelling, "Go back! Go back!"
- Why? Heh.

637
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,940
Because he stepped off of the thing
and just stopped there...

638
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,733
...and there are all of these people...
Thank you, love.

639
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,445
You know,
your house is Frank's wet dream.

640
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,782
- Never gonna get him out.
- Mm-mm.

641
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,704
Wanna sneak into my backyard
and do it on the tire swing?

642
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,541
- Lip?
- Wait, I'm thinking.

643
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,585
Well, I guess
sometimes there are happy endings.

644
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,005
Casey Casden,
the little boy who disappeared...

645
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,717
...from his own front yard earlier today,
has been delivered home...

646
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,092
...safe and sound.

647
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,385
Thank you, Lisa.

648
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,264
- That is indeed great, great news.
- Fiona.

649
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:31,724
In other matters, a medical...

650
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,605
What's up?

651
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,733
Um...

652
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,942
For Debbie.

653
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,530
Okay. Mm-hm?

654
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:51,744
Hey, Debs. Look what Steve bought.

655
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:53,746
Oh, my God. For me?

656
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,541
Absolutely.
For doing such a great job today.

657
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,710
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna name her?

658
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:05,507
Gin-Gin. After Aunt Ginger.
Let's go up to my room. We can play.

659
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:11,472
Oh, Gin-Gin, you're so funny, heh.

660
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,934
Oh, Gin-Gin, you're so much fun.

661
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:31,742
Kev, babe, wake up.
It's time to get drunk again.

662
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,373
Six-ninety, 700, 710...

663
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,460
...715 exactly.

664
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,675
Hmm... Ah!

665
00:39:58,144 --> 00:40:01,856
- Thanks for buying her that doll.
- Not a problem.

666
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,485
- You know what'd feel great right now?
- Hmm?

667
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,987
A long, hot shower.

668
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,490
I'll wash your back.

669
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,996
Shit.

670
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,418
No hot water.

671
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,880
You really are beautiful.

672
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,552
Like...

673
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,722
I hope I'm not fucking up the kids.

674
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,893
Fiona?

675
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,356
Fiona, where are you?

676
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,235
Here.

677
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,112
Fiona!

678
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,449
- Hey, hey.
- Mommy.

679
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,663
What the hell? Champagne?

680
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,956
I'm getting married.

681
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,041
Oh, my God!

682
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:10,425
Bitches, start planning
the bachelorette party.

683
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,844
- Congratulations.
- Are you drunk?

684
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,387
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

685
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,432
She's just happy
you're getting married.

686
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,268
She's great.

687
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,771
Yeah, man. She's a good egg.
She deserves it.

688
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,858
Yes, but does she deserve you,
you bastard?

689
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:32,822
No. Nobody does.

690
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:56,804
Take the Advil now.
You wanna stay ahead of the pain.

691
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,068
Congratulations.

692
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,617
- Penny for your thoughts.
- Really, Grandma?

693
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,623
I know. I'm a 60-year-old lady
with the vaj of a newborn.

694
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,586
You know I love you guys, right?

695
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,922
I couldn't raise these kids
without you and V.

696
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,052
They borrow your shit all the time.
I'm sorry. I know it's lame. But thanks.

697
00:42:37,804 --> 00:42:40,889
I don't know how I'd do it
without you guys. I love you so much.

698
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:42,559
I'm just so happy for you both.

699
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,563
Yeah, yeah. You know that Jägermeister
really makes you chatty, right?

700
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,771
You know that?

701
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:52,150
Look at V.

702
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:55,028
Isn't she beautiful?

703
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,992
Yeah. She sure is.

704
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,414
What the hell is that?

705
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:10,503
- Sign right there, please.
- Debbie?

706
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,342
What is this?

707
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,597
It's our new water heater.
I got it on sale.

708
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,181
- All right, Deb.
- Ha, ha.

709
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,849
And free delivery.

710
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,853
- They said because I'm a hero.
- That you are, my girl.

711
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:30,648
- Oh, man.
- Heh.

712
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:34,693
You're gonna go to the back and make
a sharp left and install it in the kitchen.

713
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:37,030
- Right on back.
- Yeah, straight down.

714
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,530
Bump.

715
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,452
- By the way, I call the first hot shower.
- How much did that set you back?

716
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,786
That was something, huh?

717
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,539
Yeah.

718
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,085
You know,
for a guy who just got engaged...

719
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,088
...you don't seem very happy
to be getting married.

720
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,969
It's because I'm already married.

721
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,266
Debs, you gotta get ready for school.

722
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:50,478
I can't go to school.

723
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,438
Why not?

724
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,568
Gin-Gin had me up half the night
with diarrhea.

725
00:44:57,735 --> 00:44:59,195
Oh.

726

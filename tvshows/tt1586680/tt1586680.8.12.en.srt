1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,060
Oh, God.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,270
You seriously don't remember

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,730
what happened last week
on Shameless?

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,310
Roll the tape.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,180
My God's a faggot.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,680
My God's a dyke, a whore!

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,770
If I pass out, keep going.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,850
Do not stop until
you cut off all three.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,350
Two left.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,600
But I hope you tire out soon.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,100
Here.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,560
- This is a piece of shit

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,680
that you're gonna turn into
not-a-piece-of-shit.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,100
I've always wanted
to ride a Jet Ski.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,430
Dylan said I could
use the yellow one.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,390
What does Dylan's father do

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,310
that he has a yacht
and a private plane?

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,220
Wanna grab breakfast?

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,980
Gotta get to the crib.
My niece is getting dropped off.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,930
Freelania, you have everything.

21
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,140
- Vera made this for me.

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,850
How did you make this
all happen?

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,640
Jesus.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,390
What do you got in there,
a dead body?

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,930
I do not believe she's dead yet.

26
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,730
Don't forget dinner
at The Grill.

27
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,060
I wanna show off
my beautiful bride-to-be.

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,810
Yes, I'll marry you!

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,600
Fucking hell yes!

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,310
What the fuck?
You cut up all my uniforms?

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,140
...been okay with me
going back to school now

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,930
- 'cause we're married!
- I will never be okay

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,470
with being away from you, bae!
Never!

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,220
I let you stay in
my apartment and you sue me?

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,810
So what's the worst case?

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,470
You're gonna be lucky
if they don't put you in jail.

37
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,350
- Rusty!

38
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,640
They are going down.

Where are you going?

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,890
I'm going to work.
Go back to sleep, all right?

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,180
I'm proud of you.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,270
- This last year...

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,600
you're strong.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,730
I didn't know that before.

61
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,600
Thanks.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,770
Can we stay at my place tonight?

63
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,770
Uh... yeah.

64
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,020
Yeah, sure.
That'd be good, all right?

65
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,730
I love you.

66
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,180
I love you too.

67
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,350
Get some sleep.

68
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,890
Close the fucking door!

69
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,930
What the hell are you doing?

70
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,270
I gotta run some errands
and she's already downstairs.

71
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,310
I gotta get clothes
and a new duffel.

72
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,100
- She tore up all my old shit.
- Hm.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,770
When you go down, tell her
I'm in the shower, okay?

74
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, how long...

75
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,560
Morning!

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,930
Hey.

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,270
Oh, uh, Carl's in the shower.

78
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm whipping up waffles.

79
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,520
Oh, um... Liam is asleep
out in the backyard.

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,980
Is that normal?

81
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,640
- Hey.

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,560
Hey, Liam.

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,100
Hey, buddy.

84
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I think you were
sleepwalking again.

85
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,890
- Yeah.

86
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,890
Hey, are those my keys?

87
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,430
I don't know.

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,470
What is it with you
and keys, huh?

89
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,600
All right, come on.

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,770
Let's get you inside.

91
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,350
There you go, Papa Frank.

92
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,980
Thank you,
favorite daughter-in-law.

93
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,640
- Only daughter-in-law.

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,520
Liam.
Sit.

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,390
Hey, uh,
would you save Lucas a waffle?

96
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,560
I gotta go to work

97
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,930
and he and Sierra
spent the night.

98
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,310
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

99
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,680
- Mm-hmm.
- I met your friend Dylan's dad.

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,220
You tell him I can go on

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,890
the yacht vacation
with them tomorrow?

102
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,060
I looked the man up.

103
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,640
He makes nothing.
He creates nothing.

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,140
He buys businesses,
tears them apart,

105
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,470
sells the pieces,

106
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,520
and then discards
the employees like trash.

107
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,310
He's a legal thief.

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,850
Here you are, Liam.

109
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,560
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,310
He wants the companies to fail.

111
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,060
The world's not just, Liam.

112
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,930
No one's gonna take care of us
in our old age.

113
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,730
We have a moral duty
to rip this asshole off.

114
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,430
You know how to take photos
with this?

115
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,980
His bacon's getting cold.

117
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,470
What's with the boot?
I cauterized the stumps.

118
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,930
They were still bleeding,

119
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,100
- so I went to the ER.

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,220
Waste of money.

121
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,020
Cauterization has been used

122
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,220
since the Egyptians were
building pyramids.

123
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,600
Are those waffles?
Yum.

124
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,390
So can I go on the cruise
with Dylan's family or not?

125
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,060
Well... are we partners?

126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,270
Yeah.

127
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,850
Okay, good.

128
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm very proud
to be your partner.

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,890
And your job, partner,

130
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,430
is to go to the Caribbean
and have a great time.

131
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,770
After you get the code.

132
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,060
- To turn off the alarm.

133
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,430
And pics of their valuables

134
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,600
and of the security system.

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,430
One more big score,
I can retire in style.

136
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,680
Carl!
You motherfucker!

137
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,600
What the hell was that?

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,390
Marital bliss.

139
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,350
Well,

140
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,350
I steal her wedding dress,
I take her place at wedding

141
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,680
and marry rich old man
with saggy diaper.

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,390
You don't think he's gonna
notice the difference?

143
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,270
He thought I was her.
He is weak in the head.

144
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,600
What about the wedding guests?

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,180
I wear a veil.
No one will see.

146
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,810
- Kev.

147
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,430
- Get her phone.
- You get her phone.

148
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,020
I get it.
Hold machete.

149
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,470
She tries anything,
you cut her face, okay?

150
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,270
No way.
I'm not slashing her face

151
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,310
if she tries
to make a run for it.

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,890
"Zlata"?

153
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,430
Shit.

154
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,060
Her mother is coming
to the wedding.

155
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

156
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,640
She's gonna know Svetlana
isn't her daughter, right?

157
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,270
You yell one more time,
I will shave your head,

158
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,850
I will cut off your nipples,

159
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,350
and I will sell you
to the Mexican cartel

160
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,470
for big fun, okay?

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,270
When is Zlata coming?

162
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,640
Today.

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,140
I am supposed to pick her up
at airport.

164
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,180
And I need to pee.

165
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,020
Get a bowl.

166
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,850
What?

167
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,390
Use it for her to pee.

168
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,680
Through her pants?

169
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,730
Take the pants off!
Get a bowl.

170
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,310
- Ah, Zlata.

171
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,680
Scary old Soviet.

172
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,220
Survived Stalingrad
as a young girl

173
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,350
by eating human flesh.

174
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,520
She was a cannibal?

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,730
- Oh, hey, Fiona.
- Hey.

176
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,680
Just back for a shower
and a quick change of clothes.

177
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
Jesus.

178
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,350
What happened to your toes?

179
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,470
Frank cut 'em off.

180
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,600
He what?!

181
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,100
It's no big deal.
I asked him to.

182
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,020
You get rid of
the squatters yet?

183
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,060
Ah... no.

184
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,560
Uh, Ford and Nessa are
watching the building

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,470
while I go to a lawyer thing.

186
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,770
Burn 'em out.

187
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,220
It's the oldest trick

188
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,890
arson.

189
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,140
You set a good blaze,
they got two choices:

190
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,980
run out
of the building screaming

191
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,470
or burn to death,

192
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,020
and you get to the collect
the insurance.

193
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,180
Has anyone seen my other boot?

194
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,770
I'm not gonna
burn my building down, Frank.

195
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,350
Why not?
Being a landlord sucks.

196
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,520
Tenants who won't pay
their rent,

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
toilets clogged with...

198
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,850
massive after-Thanksgiving
turds...

199
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,220
oh, there it is.

200
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,220
You need to get in touch
with Pyro Paulie.

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,350
- Paulie Paterniski.

202
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,770
Best firebug on the South Side.

203
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,850
I think he works
at the Handy Mart now.

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,600
Don't let his looks scare you.

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,180
He had a trigger fuse

206
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,020
on a bucket of jet fuel
go sideways on him.

207
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,680
The doctors used
skin from his ass

208
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,640
to rebuild his face.

209
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,430
Okay, I'm off to
the city planner's office.

210
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,310
I gotta go too.

211
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm going to a birthday party
with Franny

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,470
for Derek's great-great-grandma
who's turning, like,

213
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,980
200 years old or something.

214
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,850
I was gonna ask you if you think
I should go or not.

215
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,310
- But I think I should.
Okay.

216
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,600
- I gotta take a shower.
- Okay.

217
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,020
Hey, uh, is Ian around?

218
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,930
I don't know.
I just got here.

219
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,310
He's not here.

220
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,140
I don't think
he came home last night.

221
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,600
Well, have the police
been here yet?

222
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
They have a warrant
for his arrest.

223
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,520
What the fuck happened?

224
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,060
Things got out of hand.

225
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,270
Is he off his meds?

226
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,980
I have no idea.

227
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,060
Ian, hi.
It's Fiona.

228
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,520
Call me back, okay?
What the fuck?

229
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,850
You name it yet?

230
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,770
Your bike.

231
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,060
I haven't really
thought about it.

232
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,890
Is it a boy or a girl?

233
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,890
He's definitely a dude.

234
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,850
Then... what about...
Keith?

235
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,680
Why Keith?

236
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,520
I just like the name Keith.

237
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,730
Can I help?

238
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,600
Uh... sure, yeah.

239
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,980
There's, um... a box of pegs
on Brad's desk.

240
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,770
Thanks.

241
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:39,980
Hey.

242
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,220
Still nothing from her mom?

243
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,270
Hell no.

244
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,390
I'm so done
with her fucking shit.

245
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,980
There's no box on the desk.

246
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,770
Oh?

247
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,270
All right, I'll go take a look.

248
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,930
Keep an eye on that, all right?

249
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,270
Yo, where's that, uh,
box of pegs?

250
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,430
Uh, in that pile right there.

251
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,350
All right.

252
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,680
That a yoga mat?

253
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,310
Uh, yeah.

254
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,560
My sponsor thought I might
wanna give it a try.

255
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,730
- Oh.

256
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,600
Supposed to be relaxing.

257
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,770
So, gonna ask me how I am today?

258
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,100
Go on.
Ask me how I am today.

259
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,810
Okay.

260
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,600
How are you today?

261
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Fan-fucking-tastic.

262
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,470
- I got laid last night.

263
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,430
Oh!
Cami?

264
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,350
Yeah, asshole, Cami.
My fiancée.

265
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,470
How was it?

266
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,270
I don't know, exactly.

267
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,520
I mean, I came so fast

268
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,850
I don't think
she enjoyed it much,

269
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,680
but, uh...

270
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm back in the bed.

271
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
That's, uh... that's great.

272
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,930
Man, congrats.
Really.

273
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,810
Yeah.

274
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah, it is.
Thanks.

275
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,220
Small victories, right?

276
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,180
Yeah, right.

277
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,180
Have a nice day.

278
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,850
Cocaine or cash?

279
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,350
- The duffel.

280
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,560
Oh.
Military school uniforms,

281
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,180
field supplies...

282
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,680
Has Kassi been around here
looking for me?

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,850
No. Called a couple dozen times,
though.

284
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,680
You can't tell her I was here.

285
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,430
Wanna tell me what's going on?

286
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,890
Well, I have to go back
to military school tomorrow.

287
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,470
Kassi doesn't want me to.

288
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,850
Cut up all my old shit
with a carpet knife.

289
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,060
Had to buy new shit

290
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,730
and can't afford
to replace it again.

291
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,060
Sounds like true love.

292
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,680
It is.
And I love her too.

293
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,310
But I also love my brothers

294
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,520
in 2nd Squad, Bravo Platoon
just as much.

295
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,930
I mean,
can't she understand that?

296
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,310
You can love two things at once

297
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,980
if you're not fucking
them both, right?

298
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,850
Yeah, make sure no one
smokes back here.

299
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,060
You get a spark too close
to that,

300
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,890
could take out the whole block.

301
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,560
Really think this is gonna work?

302
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,180
No fucking idea.

303
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,930
What if she doesn't drink?

304
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,310
She's Russian.
She drinks.

305
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,060
What if she doesn't
come with us?

306
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,270
Why wouldn't she come with us?

307
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,890
What if she's hungry?

308
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,680
I mean, what do cannibals eat
other than people?

309
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,560
Do they like pizza?
We could stop and get a pizza.

310
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,770
- There.

311
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,220
There.
Ms. Zlata?

312
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,680
- I'll take that for you.
Jesus.

313
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,930
Mm...

314
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,560
Yep.

315
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,980
Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,680
What's up?
You sounded upset.

317
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,140
Have you seen Ian?

318
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,180
No, not for a couple days.

319
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,770
The cops are looking for him.

320
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,020
What?
Why?

321
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,730
All this Gay Jesus shit

322
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,020
he's mixed up in...
they set a van on fire.

323
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,470
Look, he hasn't called me back

324
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,980
and no one seems
to know where he is, so...

325
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,930
if you talk to him,
tell him to come right home

326
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,520
and we'll figure something out,
okay?

327
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,560
I gotta go.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,430
Sorry, it's a...
a family thing.

329
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,310
Well. I spoke
to the Latham's attorney.

330
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,850
That guy is
a real piece of work.

331
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,810
I think your roofer
found his name

332
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,980
on the back of a bus bench.

333
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,060
But they are prepared

334
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,390
to settle.

335
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,520
Really?

336
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,060
For $3 million.

337
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,600
They offered to remove you
from the suit

338
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,140
and pursue litigation solely
with your insurance company

339
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,310
if you're prepared
to make a few concessions.

340
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,890
Like what?

341
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,930
Sign the title of the building
over to them.

342
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,390
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

343
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,810
And they want...

344
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,930
"Sparkles."
They want Sparkles back.

345
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,810
My dog, Rusty?
They want my fucking dog?

346
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,390
They said their kids
got very attached

347
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,020
and they're, quote,
"crying themselves to sleep,"

348
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,020
end-quote,
ever since you stole him.

349
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,770
I stole him?

350
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,810
They stole him from me!

351
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,390
They're motherfuckers!

352
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,140
Tell them to get
their own goddamn dog.

353
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,470
There's another option.

354
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,850
You sell the building... now,

355
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,310
before it goes to trial...

356
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,680
and spend the money.

357
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,640
Go to Vegas.

358
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,180
Take a trip around the world.

359
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,980
And then just
declare bankruptcy.

360
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,470
Bankruptcy?

361
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,850
Yeah.

362
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,850
It's better than letting them

363
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,430
take everything you own.

364
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,270
Gail, me and you?

365
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,930
Ah, no, wait!

you punch in the code

finish the movie,

then go bowling in the basement.

400

What happened to your foot?

403
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,520
Accident at work.
No biggie.

404
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,810
My mom tell you
Pepa and I are getting married?

405
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,850
I'd like you to consider...

406
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,810
letting me share custody
of Franny.

407
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,350
I can afford
to pay child support

408
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,310
and... I know you could
use the money.

409
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,310
Go fuck yourself, Derek.

410
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,890
Okay, everybody's here!

411
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,310
Let's go.
Bisabuela's awake.

412
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,680
Let's take the photo.

413
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,100
You look great.
That's a cute dress.

414
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,270
Hi, baby!

415
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,180
Let's take a picture.
Come on.

416
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,390
Ah!
Cute dress.

417
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,270
At least think about it?

418
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,470
Okay?

419
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,600
Here we are, Ms. Zlata!

420
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,730
I know you must be thirsty
after your long trip.

421
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,180
Jesus, who's the corpse
in the Phyllis Diller wig?

422
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,390
Don't get too close.

423
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,930
She has the taste
for human flesh.

424
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,730
How many Valium
are we supposed to give her?

425
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,730
What the hell are you wearing?

426
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,770
How many of them have you
already crushed up?

427
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,640
Uh, four, maybe?
Five, I think.

428
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,060
All right, add two
for good measure.

429
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
What the hell is she doing here?

430
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,680
Svetlana's friend Freelania

431
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,430
is supposed to marry
this super rich old guy,

432
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,350
but Svetlana's gonna
marry him instead.

433
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,390
So we're gonna drug the mother
so she doesn't realize

434
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,730
that it's Svetlana marrying him,
not Freelania.

435
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,930
We don't think it's a good plan
but we're gonna go along

436
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,060
and just hope that we don't
get arrested for kidnapping.

437
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,060
I honestly don't understand
a single word you just said.

438
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,770
Here we are.

439
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,100
Vodka.

440
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,220
Vodka.

441
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,680
Old gal can really
hold her hooch, huh?

442
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,310
Where have you been?

443
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,930
Oh, uh... I went out
and got you these.

444
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,350
- For our anniversary.

445
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,140
No it's not.

446
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,520
- No.

447
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,730
You sure?

448
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,390
We met one month, eighteen days,

449
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,890
six hours
and twelve minutes ago.

450
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,680
Oh.
Well...

451
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,060
I woke up thinking about you
so I got you these.

452
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,270
Oh. Wow.

453
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,310
How sweet.

454
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,930
You know,
I've got a little surprise

455
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,520
for you too.

456
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,310
Mm.

457
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,810
Do you love me?

458
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,220
Yes, of course.

459
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,220
- A lot.

460
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,100
- Mm...

461
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,310
Ow, what the hell?

462
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,600
How stupid do you think
I am, Carl?

463
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,100
- Come on, Kassidi.

464
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,770
You followed me?

465
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,600
"Find my Phone," Carl!

466
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
I have to go back!

467
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,890
My men in my platoon
are counting on me!

468
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,390
No, no!

469
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,810
I'll give you 60 grand for it,
right now, sight unseen.

470
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,220
I have over 80 in it.

471
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,680
Yeah, but I'll take over
the mortgage,

472
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,180
and you can pocket that cash
and just walk away.

473
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,640
I was hoping for 90.

474
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,270
- 50.

475
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,600
40.

476
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,310
Jesus, I called to see
if you'd be interested

477
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,270
in buying my building,
not to get bent over a fence.

478
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,930
Well, it's a distressed sale.

479
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,270
30.

480
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,020
20.

481
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,430
- 10.
You know what?

482
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,810
Go fuck yourself.

483
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,020
Good girl.

484
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,930
What?

485
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,640
Sit down.

486
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,390
Come on, sit down.

487
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,180
You don't wanna sell.

488
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,730
The whole neighborhood's
on the way up.

489
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,600
You're gonna make a killing
in a couple years.

490
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
They're suing me for 6 million.

491
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,140
There's always some lazy bastard
staring up at you

492
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,890
from down in the shit.

493
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,180
So what do I do?

494
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,560
Well, you make them
a final offer

495
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,020
that doesn't kill you
and that they think

496
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,310
is a winning lottery ticket.

497
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,810
Like how much?

498
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,470
Five grand.
Ten.

499
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,100
Can you excuse me a minute?

500
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,810
- Hey.
Anything?

501
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,980
No, he hasn't called me back.
You?

502
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,980
You seen the clip?

503
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,980
It's already got,
like, 30,000 views.

504
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,890
My God is a dyke.

505
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,600
- My God is trans...
- He looks fuckin' nuts.

506
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,310
A junkie... a whore!

507
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,390
What does that say?

508
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,810
"Gay Jesus speaks the truth."

509
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,350
How the hell would I know?

510
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,520
Shit.

511
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,930
I went by the center
and Trevor's had people

512
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,680
out looking for him all day.

513
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,390
I gotta go back to my building.

514
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,930
Kicked out those deadbeats yet?

515
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,180
No, Ford's been watching
my building all day.

516
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,140
No, no, Charlie!
How many more times

517
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,390
How many times
do I have to say no?

518
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,680
Yo, guys!

519
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,270
I said fucking no, Charlie.

520
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,850
Joshua is his brother.

521
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,470
Half-brother!

522
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,680
What does that matter?

523
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,640
Okay, Lucas wants to meet him

524
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,270
and I said he could.

525
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,020
- He's my son.

526
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,470
I can call my son any goddamn...

527
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,730
- Fuck you!
Shit.

528
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,600
You can't call him
any time you want,

529
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,680
- because he's fucking...
Calm the fuck down!

530
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,100
Yo.
- Calm!

531
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,020
- Asshole!
- You're fucking crazy!

532
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,140
- You're crazy!
- Just stop it! Hey!

533
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,770
Someone's gonna
call the cops, all right?

534
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,430
- Both of you.
- He's my kid too!

535
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,560
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

536
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,730
Stop!
Stop!

537
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,560
Charlie!
Go, all right?

538
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,100
Yeah, go back to your whore.

539
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,770
Have her pop out another
fucking baby for you.

540
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,520
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

541
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,640
- Fuck it.

542
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,430
- Hey.
No.

543
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,890
Kev!
Can you come up for a sec?

544
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,470
Hey,
Freelania is crazy powerful.

545
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,100
She's using some Jedi mind trick
voodoo shit on me down there.

546
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,600
Holy shit.

547
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,470
- You look...
Incredible, right?

548
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,770
You need to try on your tux.

549
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,220
I have to wear a tux?

550
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,520
You are giving away the bride.

551
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,310
- Yeah, I have no father.

552
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,520
So you do it.

553
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,220
Mm-hmm.

554
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,980
I'm honored.

555
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,640
I also need you there

556
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,680
for muscle,
in case things go wrong.

557
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,850
What are we gonna do
with Freelania

558
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,220
after the wedding?

559
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm selling her
to an old friend.

560
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,310
Works freighters out of Minsk.

561
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,430
- Oh, she's too old for sailors.

562
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,220
Probably just put rocks
in her pockets

563
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,600
and dump her in the lake.

564
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,560
Wow.

565
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,310
Father of the bride.

566
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,640
That's a nice silver service.

567
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,930
Uh-huh, Rolex, Cartier,
Hublot...

568
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,680
Can we maybe find
another house to rob?

569
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
What?
No.

570
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,310
This is perfect.

571
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,680
They'll be gone.
We know the code.

572
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,350
You got the code, right?

573
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,850
Yeah, but Dylan's my friend.

574
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,520
Do we steal from our friends?

575
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,100
No, we don't, and we're not.

576
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,310
Dylan's our friend.

577
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,600
We're not gonna take
anything from him.

578
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,310
It's his criminal father
that we're bringing to justice.

579
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,930
But they're taking me on
their vacation and everything.

580
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,520
Eh, just to assuage
their ruling-class guilt.

581
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,140
You're like the old clothes
rich people donate to Goodwill...

582
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,770
something they don't need,

583
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,890
but they can pat themselves
on the back for anyway.

584
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,560
Hey.

585
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,730
We have the chance
to do the right thing here.

586
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,430
You need to see
the bigger picture.

587
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,220
He's a robber baron,

588
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,850
stealing food from the mouths
of working-class children.

589
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,100
Are you gonna give
the stuff we steal

590
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,390
to hungry children?

591
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,060
It's a metaphor.

592
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,100
We can never undo the damage

593
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,270
that Dylan's dads have done.

594
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,430
But we can right the scales
in our own small way

595
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,890
and strike a chord

596
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,310
for below-the-poverty-line folks
everywhere.

597
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,560
It's the ethical thing to do.

598
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,270
Take that.

599
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,930
Detective Clark,
Chicago Police Department.

600
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,890
Looking for Ian Gallagher.

601
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,730
- Ian Gallagher.

602
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,520
Never heard of him.

603
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,100
You have to eat.

604
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,520
Trevor's here.
He wants to talk.

605
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,600
How'd you find me?

606
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,060
Bic.

607
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,600
The cops are looking for you

608
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,470
and they came
by the center twice today.

609
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,930
What are you planning to do?

610
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,980
I don't know yet.

611
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,140
Well, they're threatening
to send cops to the center

612
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,430
to round up kids,
throw them into group homes,

613
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,730
send 'em back to their parents.

614
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,140
They want you to give Blake
back to his parents

615
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,980
and for you and Bic
to turn yourselves in.

616
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,810
I'm making a difference here.

617
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,520
I feel good.
Alive.

618
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,890
Fiona and Lip
are trying to find you.

619
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm worried about you.

620
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,680
I think that you might
be off your meds.

621
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,640
If they raid
the center tomorrow,

622
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,930
it'll be all over the news.

623
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,140
My donors will disappear.
The city will probably yank

624
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
my permits and I'll have
to shut down.

625
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,310
Would you look at me?

626
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,140
Are you even listening?

627
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,020
Look at me!

628
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,350
These kids believe in you,

629
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,890
but this isn't about
you helping them anymore.

630
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,520
This is about you loving
all of the attention

631
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,390
and the hero worship.

632
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,180
If you care about these kids...
I mean truly care about them...

633
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,890
you'll turn yourself in
before anyone gets hurt.

634
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,060
That's what a real leader
would have the courage to do.

635
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,600
Debbie!
Debbie!

636
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,890
Oh, hey, Carl.

637
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,890
Grab your torch
and cut me out of here.

638
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,430
Well, I can't.
My gear's in Farhad's truck.

639
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,350
Damn.

640
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,310
Kassidi really don't want you
to go back to school, huh?

641
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,680
Please.
There's not much time.

642
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,220
She's in the shower.

643
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,680
Derek's getting married to Pepa.

644
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,850
He wants shared custody
of Franny.

645
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,310
There's a hacksaw
in the basement.

646
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,890
You could saw them off.

647
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,640
On the plus side,
he'd pay child support.

648
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,890
And he says Marine kids
have really good healthcare.

649
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,220
You only have to
cut through one.

650
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,180
I can cut the others!

651
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,850
On the minus side, I wanna stab
him in the head every time

652
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,770
I see him and
that skinny bitch Pepa together.

653
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,890
I think Kassidi put the keys

654
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,600
in her pants pocket.

655
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,220
Try to go in and sneak in there
while she's in the shower.

656
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,520
And then Franny will
be spending time with Pepa!

657
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,220
And what will she call Pepa?
"Mommy"?

658
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,730
- Deb, will you please...

659
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,220
"Mama"?

660
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,640
Oh!
Hello, Debbie.

661
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,310
Oh, hey, Kassidi.

662
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,850
Hey, thanks again
for the waffles this morning.

663
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,020
Oh, no problem.
I'm thinking about

664
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,060
making eggs Benedict tomorrow.

665
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,770
Sounds delicious.

666
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,640
Hey, thanks for listening, Carl.

667
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,850
Really helps sometimes
to be able to talk things out.

668
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,680
Hey.
Hey.

669
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,980
Lucas asleep?

670
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,890
A while ago.

671
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,100
I'm sorry.

672
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,140
- The Charlie thing.

673
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,770
And the way that asshole gets
to pretend

674
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,310
like nothing ever happened.

675
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,100
Oh, fuck.
I forgot.

676
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,980
I'm sorry.
I'll get rid of these.

677
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,980
- I-it's cool.
- No, it's definitely not cool.

678
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,520
Hey, hey.

679
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,810
It's all right.

680
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,060
Fuck.
I'll go brush my teeth.

681
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,850
No...

682
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,140
it's all right, okay?
Really.

683
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,680
Okay?

684
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,810
I think I might
be a little drunk.

685
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,890
How'd the lawyer meeting go?

686
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,730
I'm thinking of
leaving the country.

687
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,060
And where are you thinking
of going?

688
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,600
Pretty much anywhere.

689
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,060
Then go to the airport, get on

690
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,810
whatever international
flight's taking off next,

691
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,680
leave it to fate.

692
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,140
You coming with me?

693
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,270
You want me to?

694
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,680
That's not an answer.

695
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,020
Okay, then.
Sure.

696
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,220
I don't know what this is.

697
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,930
"This"?

698
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,350
Us.

699
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,100
What do you want it to be?

700
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,600
You really have to stop

701
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,560
answering my questions
with a question.

702
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,100
Is that bothering you, is it?

703
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,850
What should I say

704
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,730
when I talk about you
to other people?

705
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,350
Tell them whatever you want.

706
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,390
Am I your girlfriend?

707
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,930
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

708
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,350
Are you sleeping
with anybody else?

709
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,770
No.

710
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,560
And I'd tell you
before that happened.

711
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,220
I'm happy...

712
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,560
with what this is.

713
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,810
And I'm willing
to make adjustments

714
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,730
if you let me know
what you want.

715
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,770
I want you to be
madly in love with me.

716
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:22,350
I'm not 17 years old.

717
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,770
I don't fall madly in love
with people anymore.

718
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,890
Ever?

719
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,640
I've fallen madly in love.

720
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,810
Didn't work out so well.

721
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,020
Who was she?

722
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,640
Do you really wanna know?

723
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,140
No.

724
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:50,180
I just can't see myself...
picking up and leaving.

725
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,390
Chicago's my home.

726
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,180
I like it here.

727
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,770
Back to the murder scenarios?

728
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,770
No.

729
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,810
It's time to go Gallagher.

730
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,350
Do you need to use
the bedpan again?

731
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,470
No, I'm all right.

732
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,680
I know you want to go back
to that school,

733
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,770
but now we can start
our lives together

734
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,100
as newlyweds.

735
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,390
Oh, first thing we need to do
is get an apartment.

736
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,890
Nothing too big, you know.

737
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,220
Maybe we'll get lucky

738
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,930
and we'll find something
in the projects.

739
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,270
You know, one of those buildings
where the elevator never works

740
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,850
and...

741
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,770
there's always gangs out
in the stairwell.

742
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,270
We'll have to get
an extra bedroom too...

743
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,980
for the kids.
I want six.

744
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,430
Don't you?

745
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,350
We can have three boys
and three girls.

746
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,270
And their names will start
with a C and a K

747
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,430
just like us.
Like...

748
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,980
Charlie and Kristin...

749
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,100
Karen... Katherine...

750
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,810
Cody, Cole, Cooper...

751
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,390
Oh, we can call him little Coop.

752
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,890
We'll shower once a week.

753
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,640
And...

754
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,850
and we can, uh, eat fast food
and get really fat.

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,390
Looking for Paulie.

764
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,850
In the back.

765
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,600
You Pyro Paulie?

766
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,470
Yes.

767
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,890
Fiona Gallagher.

768
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,730
Geneva.

769
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,930
Wake up.

770
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,980
I know what I have to do now.

771
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,100
And it's big.

772
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,270
Up.

773
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,930
Up! Up!
Everyone up!

774
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,930
Come on!
I need sheets.

775
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,680
I need... lots
and lots of sheets!

776
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,640
Whoa.

777
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,980
Sent a limo, huh?

778
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,100
Son?

779
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,600
The code?

780
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,810
Sir.

781
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,180
Who the hell are you?

782
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,390
Oh.
Father of the bride.

783
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,640
- Well, no, no.

784
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,770
I'm not the father.
I'm a friend, but, uh...

785
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,600
but I get to give her away.

786
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,560
Fucking fantastic.

787
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,020
Oh, hey, Dad.
Big day, huh?

788
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,890
Whoa.
Where are your shoes?

789
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,640
- Your shoes.

790
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,180
You can't get married
in slippers, right?

791
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,560
Jesus Christ, Everett.
Go find his goddamn shoes,

792
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,850
would you, please?

793
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,390
Did you see who's here, Dad?

794
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,520
Arthur.

795
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,350
Came all the way
from Palm Beach.

796
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,810
- Arthur.

797
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,220
You started the company
with him.

798
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,140
You wanted him to be
your best man.

799
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,470
Yeah.

800
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,520
Wedding's gonna start

801
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
any minute, Dad.

802
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,220
Oh, great.
I'm starving.

803
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,600
Jesus, what a shit show.

804
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,470
Well, I better go get the bride.

805
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,680
Thank God there's
a prenup, right?

806
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,470
Is that a pipe bomb?

807
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,850
Smoke bomb.

808
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,730
Pyro Paulie swears
it won't explode

809
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,930
- or start a fire.

810
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,730
Name doesn't inspire
a whole lot of confidence.

811
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,060
You should see his face.

812
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,680

813
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,560

Pick up the girl, come on!

823
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,810
I'm gonna call the police.
You could've killed us.

824
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,890
Here's the deal, shitheads.

825
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,560
This is $4,000.

826
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,020
And I will give it to you...
right now.

827
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,560
If you get in your shitty car,
point yourselves west,

828
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,890
and don't stop till you hit
the Pacific Ocean.

829
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,850
- Go fuck yourself.
- You haven't heard

830
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,560
the whole offer yet, Trina.

831
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,980
When you get
to the Pacific Ocean,

832
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,810
you call me
and you give me an address

833
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,890
so that every month
for the next year...

834
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,270
assuming you drop
your bullshit lawsuit...

835
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:09,020
I can send you a money order
for $500.

836
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,600
Go to hell.

837
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,060
Think about it, Rodney.

838
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,680
Lawsuits can take years
before they get to court.

839
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,350
And who knows?
In the end, you might lose.

840
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,180
We won't lose.

841
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,390
Maybe yes, maybe no.

842
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,270
My lawyer thinks I'm gonna win.

843
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:38,810

I was just so fucking pissed,
you know?

he fucked up, but, uh...

876
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,390
we all fuck up, so...

877
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,770
I told you I was sorry.

878
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,270
You two weren't together

879
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,270
when he got
that other girl pregnant.

880
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,140
You know, and he didn't
wanna lose you.

881
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Where the fuck
is this coming from?

882
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,600
You don't love me.

883
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,100
- I've been drunk...

884
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Or high almost every day
since I was 12 years old.

885
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,270
And Brad was off the wagon
and Youens died...

886
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,390
- I don't know.

887
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,930
I want to.

888
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,520
You know, I really do,
but I-I've been sleepwalking

889
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,430
through my life for years,
and...

890
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,140
you know, I've been so loaded,

891
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,180
I-I haven't known what I want...

892
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,020
you know, or who I wanna be,

893
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,270
or-or-or be with, and I just...

894
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,980
Fuck!

895
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,310
Just leave.
Please.

896
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,020
- I was drunk on our first date.

897
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,680
- Lip...
- I was drunk

898
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,270
almost the entire time
that we were together.

899
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,020
I don't know how
to be with myself,

900
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,730
let alone someone else.

901
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,850
Man, I don't know
what I want, but I...

902
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,470
I know I have to
be honest with you.

903
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,680
And it's because
I care about you...

904
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,310
Just go, Lip!

905
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,980
Please!
Oh, my God.

906
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,430
- I'm sorry.

907
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,140
Don't!

908
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,470
I'm sorry.

909
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,850
God is Gay and he loves you!

910
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,850
God is Gay and he loves you!

911
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,890

913
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,390
This might just make CNN.

00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,430
Showtime.

915
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,060
- God is gay and he loves you.

916
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,560
Take a look in front of me...

917
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,220
We are gay and we love you.

918
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,060
We are trans and we love you.

919
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,140

920
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,680
and we love you.

921
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,100
We are the city of Chicago
and we love you.

922
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,600
- Gay Jesus!
- We are queer...

923
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,850
and we love you.

924
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,270
We are bisexual and we love you.

925
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,520
That's him.

926
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,180
Ian Gallagher, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

927
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,520
We are your cops.
We are your neighbors.

928
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,060
We are your doctors.

929
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,270
Gallagher, get down
from the truck. Now.

930
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,470
He's not Ian Gallagher.

931

939

945
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,770
Come on. Jesus.
Right... right here.

Where do you think
that old man went?

1000
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,180
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.

1001
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,060
Looks about done.

1002
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,560
Yeah.

1003
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,730
You gonna keep it or sell it?

1004
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,930
Keep it, I think.

1005
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,680
You okay?

1006
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,140
Uh...

1007
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,640
I was honest with Sierra.

1008
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:27,390
But I think it really
fucked her up.

1009
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,430
Nobody ever said being honest
would be painless.

1010

Where's Eddie?

1011
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,730
She quit.

1012
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,850
Took off for Cabo with
some guy she met at Sturgis.

1013
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,390
She coming back for the kid?

1014
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,180
She called Social Services
to come pick her up.

1015
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,310
So Eddie split, huh?

1016
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,430
Hey, why don't you come
stay with me for a couple days?

1017
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,430
Just till we find out
where she went.

1018
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,770

- Holy shit.

Police have identified the man

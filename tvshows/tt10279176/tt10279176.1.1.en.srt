OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,404
- No!

3
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,378
- Victor 107.

4
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,089
- Victor 107, go ahead.

5
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,633
- Still waiting on Argenta.

6
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,552
She said she was coming
20 minutes ago.

7
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,930
- Had to reroute
for a UAC call.

8
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:29,972
Working on your relief.

9
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,141
- How long we talking?

10
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,727
- No ETA yet.

11
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,166
- Hey, chief,
where's your bathroom?

12
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,293
Baño?

13
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,294
- Customers only.

14
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,588
- Well, maybe you can make
an exception.

15
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,464
Or you can sell me
one of these boxes.

16
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:03,589
I'll take a shit
in that instead.

17
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:08,970
All the way down
on the left.

18
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,347
Hey, it's occupied.

19
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:01,606
Just a second.

20
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:12,325
I'd give it a minute
if I were you.

21
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:16,245
Tried to warn you.

22
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,140
Victor 107 to dispatch.

23
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,893
- Victor 107, go ahead.

24
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,439
- I'm gonna need some backup
at the U-Store-All Plus

25
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,733
on the southwest corner
of Airway Road.

26
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,276
I've got a tunnel
approximately 30 feet deep.

27
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,030
- Copy, Victor 107.

28
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,574
We got a major bailout
at the Otay Villa Apartments

29
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,367
by Echo One, 12 UDAs.

30
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,535
Will send support ASAP.

31
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,999
- Shit.

32
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,474
Fuck.

33
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:56,775
- Oh, shit.

34
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:01,947
Stop! Stop!
Don't shoot in the tunnel!

35
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,381
Get the fuck out!

36
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,428
Get out, come on!

37
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,919
- There's the man of the hour.

38
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,380
You know damn well you
shouldn't have gone down there.

39
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,424
- What are you gonna do,
fire me?

40
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
Hey, thanks, man.

41
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,598
- It was a hell
of a bust, though.

42
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,767
Talking CNN-level shit.

43
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,270
DEA brass is gonna be posing
for pics

44
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:14,979
in that tunnel for weeks.

45
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,108
- Hey, I can get back down
in that tunnel,

46
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,484
you know, snake it out,
see where it goes.

47
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,279
- Eh, you've done enough.

48
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,115
Go on back to the station.
I'll be right behind you.

49
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
Good work.

50
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,493
- What'd he tell you?

51
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,995
- How we doing, fellas?

52
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:31,161
Glad we could clean
this up for you.

53
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:17,791
Surprise!

54
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,960
- Holy shit.

55
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:22,838
Aw, come on.

56
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,549
- Here you go, Clemens.

57
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,884
- No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

58
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,844
I think we got him.

59
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,220
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

60
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,974
I thought I made it clear
that I didn't want a party.

61
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,683
- Hey, hey, don't blame me,
all right?

62
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,018
This was all Joe Don's idea.

63
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,187
- Oh.
- Except, uh--except for this.

64
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,190
I had everyone sign it.
Go on, open it up.

65
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,566
I figured you, uh--
you'd hate that.

66
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,150
- You're right.

67
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
- Look, Ben, before you go,

68
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,821
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

69
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,739
- No, no, don't do that.
- Hey, come on, let me finish.

70
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,908
- I'm giving you
a direct order.

71
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,408
Shut the fuck up and drink.

72
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,037
I'm gonna miss you,
you crusty bastard.

73
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,749
- Hey, y'all, listen up
for just a second.

74
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,378
I just want to raise a beer
to Agent Ben Clemens.

75
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:09,718
- Ben, after 32 years
of distinguished service,

76
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
the United States Customs
and Border Protection

77
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,266
officially kicks your ass
out the door.

78
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,809
To Ben Clemens, y'all!

79
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,870
- My guinea pig had babies.

80
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,165
You said you bought two boys.

81
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,040
- Well, looks like I was wrong.

82
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,917
Go watch TV.

83
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,460
- Ah.

84
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,174
- Are you going today?
- Yep.

85
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,471
- Ben.

86
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,513
Thank you.

87
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,732
I hate to ask, but how long
do you think it's gonna take?

88
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:46,899
- I won't know till I see it.

89
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,284
- Ben, I loved my husband,

90
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,578
but Javi took
a second mortgage on the house

91
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,831
to pay for Mexico.

92
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
I have a meeting with the bank

93
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,418
to see if they'll
give us an extension,

94
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,836
but they're gonna foreclose
on our house here

95
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,255
if I don't pay
for Mexico soon, and--

96
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,633
- There won't be enough
to cover the loan

97
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,342
without finishing the cabin.

98
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,761
- Yeah.

99
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,345
We need to sell.

100
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,849
I'm sorry.

101
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,975
- Hey, we both know Javi

102
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,227
would have dragged me
down there anyway.

103
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,356
He was a good guy,
but he was a shit carpenter.

104
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:33,320
Javi didn't leave us much,
but he left us you.

105
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,642
- Do you need help, sir?

106
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,977
- No, no.

107
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,355
I'm very strong.

108
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,361
- You don't recognize me
without my uniform,

109
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,445
do you, Alvaro?

110
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,908
- Stop!

111
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,951
God damn it, just stop!

112
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:28,667
How many times
you gonna do this dance, huh?

113
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,261
- What's up, old-timer?

114
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,140
- Joe Don, I need a 10-16
at the Home Depot on Plaza.

115
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,893
I must have picked
this asshole up five times

116
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,768
in the past year alone.

117
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,519
- Ben, there's protocol.

118
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,355
- Fuck protocol.

119
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,941
He's right here,
standing in front of me.

120
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,067
I can bring him in
if you want.

121
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,403
- Ben, it's not
your job anymore.

122
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:56,528
Gotta go, buddy.

123
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,077
- You gonna let me go now?

124
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,082
No, no, no, no.

125
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,000
Do I look like
I need a necklace?

126
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,981
- There you go.

127
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,150
That's better.

128
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,334
- What a shithole.

129
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,818
Ugh.

130
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:09,364
Ooh--ugh.

131
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,871
God, Javi.

132
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,665
Fucking--

133
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:18,790
Jesus.

134
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:20,792
Ugh.

135
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,471
Christ.

136
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,362
Fuck this.

137
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,573
Javi, you were a fucking pig.

138
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,021
- This okay?

139
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,331
- Yeah, can I get a...menu?

140
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:23,456
Menu?

141
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,350
- Hi.

142
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,354
No menus necessary.
We make what's fresh here.

143
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,356
- Oh, uh...

144
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,858
got any fish tacos?

145
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,110
- The best you'll ever have.

146
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,945
- Sold.
- Okay.

147
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,988
- And un cerveza, por favor.

148
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
- Okay.

149
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:06,541
- Ahh.

150
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,721
- What brought you
to Estrella de Mar?

151
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:24,017
- A friend of mine used
to eat here all the time,

152
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,895
and he was very picky
about his Mexican food.

153
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,148
- Smart friend.
And what's his name?

154
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:30,440
- Javi Lopez.

155
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,698
- He was a good customer.

156
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,909
- Javi was well-liked
around here.

157
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,243
You worked together?

158
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,704
- He was my partner.

159
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:44,829
- Sorry for your loss.

160
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:48,541
- I'm Neto.

161
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,588
This is Eduardo.

162
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,549
- And Luis.
- Mucho gusto.

163
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,592
- Ben.

164
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:01,304
- You taking over Javi's
old place?

165
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:01,554
- I'm gonna fix it up,
try to sell it for his family.

166
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,770
- The sooner you finish it,
the better, amigo.

167
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,493
- Gracias.

168
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,160
- You're welcome.

169
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,670
- Hey.
- Hey, stranger.

170
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,754
- What's up?

171
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,964
- Well, not that you need
the reminder,

172
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,131
but you know,
Kate's party's tomorrow.

173
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,219
Did you forget?

174
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,596
- No.

175
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,139
Well, it starts at noon.

176
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,807
So come anytime.

177
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,060
- Look, Jill,
I really wish I could,

178
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,106
but it's been a busy week,
a lot going on.

179
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:53,356
- Oh, it's not like you can use
work as an excuse anymore.

180
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,113
- You know how it is
between me and Frank.

181
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,948
- Your daughter is graduating,
all right?

182
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,490
You know she got into
that program at USD?

183
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,032
- Really?

184
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:05,618
That--that's great.

185
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,958
- You're her father,
not Frank.

186
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,710
Okay?
You should be there.

187
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,545
- You're right.

188
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,504
- If only you had said
that more,

189
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,672
we might still be married.

190
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,215
Probably not.

191
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,342
- Now who's right?

192
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:21,551
- All right, all right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

193
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:40,737
- What, are you gonna
arrest me, hick?

194
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,875
- You got a problem, gringo?

195
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,000
- No. I pay my bills.

196
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,541
Hey!

197
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,917
Yeah--not you.
You!

198
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,554
- Give me your best one.

199
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,847
Yeah.

200
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,975
How much?

201
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,938
Ten dollars.

202
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,148
- I got seven.
That's what I got.

203
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,651
Okay, seven is okay.

204
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,611
- Thank you.

205
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:44,736
Yeah.

206
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,290
- Yeah, it was pretty
cool to rumble through

207
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,374
a slot canyon at night.

208
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,876
We saw a herd of deer.

209
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,043
- Regular cowboy now, huh?

210
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,849
- Hey, hey.

211
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,434
You sure Katie's
gonna be okay with me coming?

212
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,936
- It just seems a little, uh--
- A little what?

213
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,854
- Like you just invited me

214
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,855
so you didn't have to go
by yourself.

215
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,200
Well, this is--
- Save it.

216
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,325
- Yeah.

217
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,790
- Ben! Hey.
- Frank.

218
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:39,749
- Happy to see you.
Bring it in, man.

219
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,460
- I'm good.
- Okay.

220
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,336
Uh, I've been
thinking about you.

221
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,754
I mean, God,
retirement is, like,

222
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,548
right up there
with death and divorce

223
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,883
as one of life's
most stressful challenges,

224
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,009
so if you ever need
a profession--

225
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,221
- I'm gonna go find Katie.
- Yeah, okay. Hi.

226
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,555
- Hey.
- I'm Frank, Kate's stepdad.

227
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,684
- Right, I'm Garrett,
Ben's emotional support animal.

228
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,268
- It's good to see you.
- Hey, come over here.

229
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,229
- Hey, you made it.

230
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,815
Aw, let me look at you.
You look good.

231
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,234
Liar.

232
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,319
- How's the leisure life?

233
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,696
- I was just going over that
with Dr. Touchy McFeely.

234
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,074
- Oh, come on.
He's just trying to connect.

235
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,991
- I wish he'd stop.

236
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,579
Well, Katie's by the pool
with her friends, but hang on.

237
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,457
I think you're
gonna want this.

238
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:23,835
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,171
- Mmm.

240
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:27,338
I'm gonna find the kid.
- Okay.

241
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,601
Whoo!

242
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,398
Dad.

243
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,652
- Katie.

244
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,070
- You want some?

245
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,282
- You know how I feel
about that.

246
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,784
- Uh, yeah,
but no government job anymore,

247
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,827
and it's legal, so.

248
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,455
- And you're still not
a lawyer yet.

249
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,498
- Okay.
Can you just--

250
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,958
- Cool.

251
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,083
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Thank you.

252
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,629
Thank you for coming.

253
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,505
- I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

254
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,965
- Oh, yes, you would.

255
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,094
You got a tattoo?

256
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,971
- I did.

257
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,598
Just a graduation gift
to myself.

258
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,808
- Oh.

259
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,602
That's really, uh--
it's nice.

260
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,937
Thank you.

261
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,522
- I got something for you too.

262
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,317
It's nothing much.
It's--

263
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,318
- Oh, my God.
That's beautiful.

264
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,819
- You'll be the first
Clemens

265
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,404
to have a master's degree.

266
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,989
- I think Mom has hers.

267
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,158
- Well, her last name
is Kerr now.

268
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,283
- Huh.
Whose fault is that?

269
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:38,576
Are you seeing anyone?

270
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,662
- No. Are you?

271
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:50,129
- Uh, you know, I should
probably go say hi.

272
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,423
- I'm fine.
- I'm gonna--okay.

273
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:52,590
Hey, live a little.

274
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,761
- Okay, family photo time.
- Okay, yeah.

275
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,678
- Here we go.
Hey, Garrett,

276
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,846
would you mind
taking a picture?

277
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,764
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

278
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,473
- Hey, do you mind
holding my beer?

279
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,265
- Okay.
- You.

280
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,391
- There we go.
Okay.

281
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,017
- Okay.
- Okay.

282
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,644
Bunch up, guys.

283
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,311
In close.
- Okay.

284
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,024
- Cheese on three.
Sounds original.

285
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:10,525
- Hey, Ben.
Ben, Ben, come.

286
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,485
Come join us.

287
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,403
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Ben, come in here.

288
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,072
- Come on. Come join us.
- Get in here.

289
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,449
- All right.
- You're part of the family.

290
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,617
- Come on.
- Here I come.

291
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:19,784
Could you hold this?
All right.

292
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:26,833
- All right, guys, bunch up.
On three.

293
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,627
All right, three, two, one.

294
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,587
Cheese!

295
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:22,346
- Closed?

296
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,226
- Not yet.

297
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,315
Hungry?

298
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:32,481
- Always.

299
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,487
- And how's the house coming?

300
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,031
- I haven't had much time yet.

301
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,197
I was up north at
my daughter's graduation party.

302
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,034
You got any kids?

303
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,206
- I wish I did.

304
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,587
- You feed everyone
who's crossing?

305
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:36,754
- They were hungry.

306
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,888
Humans have walked on the moon,

307
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,351
there's a rover on Mars,
and meanwhile, down here,

308
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,062
we can't seem to stop fighting
over the lines in the sand.

309
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:53,229
- Well, those lines
were put there for a reason.

310
00:37:59,652 --> 00:37:59,735
- A reason?

311
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,164
What would you do
if a young woman

312
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,917
came to your door

313
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,254
hungry, hurt,

314
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:18,421
and looking for a job--
not a handout, a job?

315
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,885
Would she get
to cross your line?

316
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,596
- It's not my line.

317
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:27,763
- But you held it.

318
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,060
- It was my job to make sure

319
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:33,269
that my side of the line
was as safe as possible.

320
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,988
- You sound like Javi.

321
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:48,826
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

322
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:53,164
- You should.

323
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,253
He was a good man.

324
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:05,801
- Javi was more than just
a customer, wasn't he?

325
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:14,518
- I miss him.

326
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,314
- That makes two of us.

327
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,888
- Help me.
- What the fuck?

328
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,640
Jesus Christ.

329
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,482
- What the hell are you doing
in my truck?

330
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:02,608
- Stop.
I don't understand you.

331
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:07,696
Fear for me baby.

332
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,667
Okay, I'll take you back
to the restaurant.

333
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,251
- No.

334
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,961
Estados Unidos.

335
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,337
- Estados--

336
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,256
are you out
of your fucking mind?

337
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,842
- You are la migra.

338
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,385
- Yes, migra, border patrol,

339
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,011
which is why
I don't take you.

340
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,347
It's illegal.

341
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,099
Understand?

342
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:35,391
No bueno.

343
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,900
Stop!

344
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,192
Stay in the car.

345
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,195
You can ride in the front.

346
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,920
Jesus Christ.

347
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,396
- I can't understand
what you're saying.

348
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,043
- All right, you want help?
Come on.

349
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,340
- Hey, they're gonna help you.

350
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,259
- You're already
making friends?

351
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:52,384
- Hey, she's in trouble.

352
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:53,844
- Eduardo!

353
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:05,314
- Hey.

354
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,277
- Take her home.

355
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:36,845
- Eh, I got a daughter her age.

356
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,891
- You think reporting him
is gonna do her any good?

357
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,100
If anything, it's gonna
get her killed quicker.

358
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,358
- She fell in love
with the wrong man.

359
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,902
- She didn't fall in love.

360
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,069
Dante chose her.
She didn't have a choice.

361
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:52,087
- Fuck me.

362
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:56,967
Shit.

363
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,690
Oh, f--

364
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,318
Jesus Christ!

365
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:22,451
Hey, hey,
what do you want?

366
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,494
What are you doing?
Okay, okay.

367
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:23,994
All right,
easy, easy, easy.

368
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:24,578
Jesus.

369
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:24,745
All right.

370
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:35,506
Fuck.

371
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:46,392
- Trick or treat.

372
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:15,879
Stay away from my woman.

373
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,302
- Hmm?

374
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,303
- Got it.

375
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,898
- Oh, God!
Damn it.

376
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:03,612
- I'm pretty sure we already
went through this!

377
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,032
- Hey, look,
I told you I can't--

378
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:09,826
Oh, fuck.

379
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,750
You can't be here.

380
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:16,917
You almost got me killed,
comprende?

381
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,965
- All right, listen.
Calm down, calm down.

382
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,132
Calm down.
Calm down.

383
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:27,302
Shit.
Jesus.

384
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:28,887
Hey.
Hey.

385
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,434
Shit.

386
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,109
- Hey, fun party.
- I need a favor.

387
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,153
- Yeah, of course you do.
Why else would you be calling?

388
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:45,362
- There's a girl down here.
She needs asylum.

389
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:49,866
- Down where?

390
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,828
- Mexico.
- What?

391
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,746
What girl?

392
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,999
- I need you call
that ICE lawyer, Ingrid.

393
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,418
Have her put the wheels
in motion.

394
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,044
Tell her that she fears
for her life.

395
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:01,211
The girl's na--uh.

396
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,471
- Maria Elena Flores.

397
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,973
- Get ahold of her office.
Give her that name.

398
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,349
- Ben--
- By the book, Garrett.

399
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:14,641
Just do it.

400
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,567
- What's taking you so long?

401
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,154
What?

402
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,090
- Hey, it's Ben.

403
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,550
I realize you
might not be working,

404
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,218
but I need you to come
to the cabin now.

405
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:55,390
It's urgent.

406
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:56,558
You need to hide.

407
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:56,808
Go!

408
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,844
I don't mean
to sound unfriendly,

409
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,262
but this is private property.

410
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:37,015
- Get back in your car.

411
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:42,604
I'm not gonna say it again.

412
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,255
- Whatever he's looking for,

413
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:08,380
he's not gonna
find it in there.

414
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,030
- Where the fuck is she?

415
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:34,197
- Where the fuck is who?

416
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:51,358
- Hands where I can see them!

417
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,699
Hey!

418
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,325
Drop that phone!

419
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,828
- Drop the fucking phone!

420
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,870
- Please, no kill.

421
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,737
- We have to go.

422
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,573
We gotta go.

423
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,574
Come on.

424
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,268
Take this.
Take it!

425
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:08,393
Come on,
we have to go!

426
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,521
Come on.

427
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:12,606
Get in.

428
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:03,740
Oh, thank God.

429
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:31,184
- Fuck!

429
00:54:32,305 --> 00:55:32,839

00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,072
- You need to leave now!
- I have a right to be here.

10
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,161
Okay, ma'am?
- Not near my child you don't.

11
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,728
- Mommy, let's go.

12
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,164
- Okay.

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,296
I am calling the police.

14
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,037
- Don't do that.
I'm not bothering you.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,971
- Yes, there is a black man
threatening me and my son.

16
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:41,041
- There she goes, y'all.

17
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,651
What? I am just working out!

18
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:45,958
- We're Central Park
in the Ramble.

19
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,917
Please hurry. - This is America.

21
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,791
Let's see what we got.

22
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,361
- Okay, folks, what's going on?

23
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:58,362
- Officers, nothing's going on.

24
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,755
- This is him. This is the man.

25
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:02,062
- Officers, listen,
I've done nothing to her.

26
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:03,889
- Yo, big guy, back it up.
- Me?

27
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,021
I'm not doing anything.

28
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,718
- Mom, I need to go get my ball.

29
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:09,156
- Dylan, stay here.
He is scaring my son.

30
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,722
- How? Because I'm black?

31
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,116
Listen, officers, I'm out here
minding my own business.

32
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,204
She comes...

33
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,399
- Sir, do you have your ID
on you?

34
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,250
- I don't have
to show you anything.

35
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,425
I know my rights.

36
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,880
- Mommy, mommy, come look.
There's a man.

37
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:19,905
- Dylan, get back here.

38
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,298
- He's not moving.

39
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,474
- Everyone stay where you are.
We got a vic.

40
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,563
- Honey, move away from there.
- Semi-conscious male

41
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,435
bleeding from the head.
I need a bus.

42
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:29,282
- Oh, my God, that's why
he was acting so crazy.

43
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,457
He just attacked someone.
- What?

44
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,004
No, I don't know anything
about that.

45
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,286
- Sir, put the phone down
and put your hands behind back.

46
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,920
- Why?
- Hands behind your back, now!

47
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,096
- Listen...
- Stop resisting!

48
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,551
- I'm not resisting!
- Stop resisting!

49
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,708
Stop resisting!
- I'm not resisting!

50
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,450
Stop resisting, stop!

51
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,628
- We found him bleeding,
pants down.

52
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,369
- Captain Benson.

53
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,849
Hi, I'm a police officer.

54
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,155
Can you tell me your name?

55
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,852
- Eric.

56
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,377
- Hey, Eric.

57
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,552
- I need you to step back.

58
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,988
- It's legal, blondie.
- Okay.

59
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,686
- Eric, what happened?

60
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,601
- He went nuts.

61
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:04,863
He raped me.

62
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,343
- Who? You know him?

63
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,130
- I have a right to film.

64
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,001
- I just need you to move back.

65
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,263
Now.

66
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,265
- Eric. Eric, stay with me.

67
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:16,547
- We need to move him now.
- Okay.

68
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,225
Officer Tamin will ride
with you.

69
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,923
- Sorry, COVID.
- I'll meet them there.

70
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,447
- Woman's kid found the vic.

71
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,927
- Said the suspect
was on the scene

72
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,189
menacing her and her kid.

73
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,844
- Rollins, take her statement.
- Copy that.

74
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,194
- And how did you make him
as a suspect?

75
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,196
- He was combative, aggressive.

76
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,806
- You arrested him
for being aggressive?

77
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,157
- No, sir, I ran his ID.
Two outstanding warrants.

78
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,161
- Ow.

79
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,814
You?

80
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,076
I know you, don't I?

81
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,469
- How 'bout I ask the questions?

82
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,341
What were you doing in the park?

83
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,038
- I'm not answering
any of your questions.

84
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,300
Why am I even under arrest?

85
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,364
- You have outstanding warrants.

86
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,956
- For protesting.

87
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,629
- I knew he was up to no good.
- How'd you know that?

88
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,395
- His body language,
the way he raised his voice.

89
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,441
He was scaring my son.

90
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:03,531
Hey, I-I'm not one
of those Karens.

91
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,317
- Do we have to do it this way?

92
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,884
We're profiling this guy.
- I know.

93
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,233
Listen, he's got warrants.

94
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,104
He's not helping himself here.

95
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,498
Plus, this is only
gonna get worse.

96
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,503
- Put him in the car!

97
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,462
- Yo, for what, man? Come on!

98
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:22,830
- Stop resisting!
- Get your hands off me, man!

99
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,204
- Stop resisting.
Duck your head.

100
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,814
- Hey, come on!

101
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,008
- I got you covering your cam.
- Get off me, man, come on!

102
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,165
- This is livestreaming!
- Get in there.

109
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,146
- Hold up, the mom called
the cops on Jayvon

110
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,496
before anyone found the body?

111
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,498
The unis didn't tell us that.

112
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,979
- But you did have probable
cause to arrest, right?

113
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,197
- We didn't arrest him.

114
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,590
He was cuffed when we got there.

115
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:47,741
- And you think he's good
for the assault?

116
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,463
- We don't know.
He was in the vicinity,

117
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,769
he refused to talk,
he has warrants.

118
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,118
- For what?

119
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,531
- BLM curfew arrest.
He missed his desk appearance.

120
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,818
- We're not prosecuting those.

121
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,970
- He also had a sealed juvie
for a public disturbance,

122
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,343
noise complaint.

123
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,476
- So no sexual assault?
Nothing violent?

124
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,062
Did the vic ID him,
or was it just the mom?

125
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,307
- The vic, Eric Aquino,
26, lost consciousness

126
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,762
before we could get
a full statement.

127
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,875
- So no?

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,444
Has Jayvon lawyered up yet?

129
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,533
- He's handling himself
pretty well without one.

130
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:19,536
- If he's good for this,
I need an airtight case.

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,321
With that video going viral

132
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,602
and the way half the city thinks

133
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,226
about the cops right now...
- Understood.

134
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,632
- I told the cops at the scene.

135
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,547
That's where I work out
every morning.

136
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,133
Had nothing to do
with that guy being hurt.

137
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,029
- At 7:00 A.M.?
Where were you coming from?

138
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,465
- Night shift.

139
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,728
I sort for Empire Parcel.

140
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,271
- Okay, what time
do you get off of work?

141
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:42,124
- Are y'all even asking
that white woman questions?

142
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,956
Look, I expect
this nonsense from her,

143
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,741
but doesn't this get old
for you, man?

144
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,444
- Eric's one of the good guys.

145
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:58,923
Who the hell would do this?

146
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,142
- You know him?

147
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,448
- Yeah, he was a resident.

148
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,667
They bumped him up during COVID
to work ER.

149
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,714
I'm sorry. - It's okay.

150
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,456
Were you able to do a rape kit?

151
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,781
- Not yet.
He's still unconscious.

152
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,068
But there was some anal trauma.

153
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,524
I can get you his clothes
to run DNA.

154
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,940
- That'd be great.

155
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,464
And as soon as
we can talk to him...

156
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,900
- We're waiting on a scan.

157
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,163
I told his family
that you were here.

158
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,556
They're Filipino Catholics,

159
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,514
so they may not be aware

160
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:27,212
of his orientation.

161
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,692
- Okay.

162
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,826
- Every time he works
a night shift, I worry.

163
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,784
I wait up for him to come home.

164
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,700
I called. No answer.

165
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,330
- How does he usually
get home from work?

166
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,661
- He walks.
- Through the park?

167
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,447
- I tell him not to.
It's dangerous.

168
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,893
She wants to know if
it was the guy in the video.

169
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,417
- The black guy.

170
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,506
- We are talking to him.

171
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,467
I'm gonna ask you if
you know anything about...

172
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,252
Eric's social life,

173
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,907
his friends and relationships.

174
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,606
- No.

175
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,346
No time for that.

176
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,261
All work

177
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,612
and family.

178
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,964
He's a good boy.

179
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,707
- He's a good guy, the doctor,

180
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,405
but walking through
the Ramble at night...

181
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,841
Can they really not know?

182
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,757
- When I told my family,
they had absolutely no idea.

183
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,474
If you ask them now,
they still don't know.

184
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:36,543
- Wow.

185
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,781
Maybe you should
tell them again.

186
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,023
- Not right now.

187
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,634
We still have relatives
in Beirut.

188
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,201
Between that and COVID,
they got a lot on their plate.

189
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,900
- Detectives.

190
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,990
I didn't want to say this
in front of my mother.

191
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,732
Eric texted me last night,
told me not to wait up.

192
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,908
- Do you know where he went?

193
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:57,433
- Eric likes to unwind
after a shift.

194
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,305
Those outdoor bars
on Ninth Avenue,

195
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,482
it's a party scene now.

196
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,874
- Thanks.

197
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,441
- Thank you.

198
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,138
- Start checking traffic cams?

199
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,228
- Yeah, run his credit cards,
see if we get lucky.

200
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,495
<i>- Just please, listen,
that's not necessary.</i>

201
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:16,844
- How bad is it?

202
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,020
- Jayvon's video's got
five million hits,

203
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,998
and you don't wanna know how
many calls I've been getting.

204
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,111
Please tell me
that he is good for this.

205
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,766
- Well, he hasn't confessed,
but I checked his alibi.

206
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,942
There's a problem
with the timeline.

207
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,944
- Good, good,
that gives me some leverage.

208
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,469
Let's get to the bottom of this.

209
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
- Jayvon, this is ADA Carisi.

210
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,646
- The ADA?

211
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,082
That supposed
to make me nervous?

212
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,345
- Not at all, Mr. Brown.
We all want the same thing...

213
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,782
To get to the truth.

214
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,436
- You already have the truth.
- No, not all of it.

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,873
You got to the park at 7:00,

216
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,310
but we found out
that you punched out at 5:00.

217
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,487
- And there's a gap
in your timeline, Mr. Brown,

218
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,596
the same time Eric Aquino
was attacked in the Ramble.

219
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,056
- I had nothing to do with that.

220
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,538
- Okay, if you didn't,
just tell us where you were.

221
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,584
Help yourself out, Jayvon.

222
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,807
I was having coffee
with my sponsor

223
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,809
before our 6:00 A.M. meeting.

224
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,333
- 6:00 A.M. meeting?
What program?

225
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,378
- NA.

226
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:16,512
Last spring, I hurt my back.

227
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,123
I got hooked on oxy.
I'm clean now.

228
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,299
- So why didn't you
just tell us that?

229
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,258
- I wanna advance.

230
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,261
Drivers get better benefits,
better pay.

231
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,002
I didn't want you

232
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,873
telling my boss
I was at a meeting.

233
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,658
- There's no way your boss

234
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,182
will ever hear that from us,

235
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,706
but I'm gonna need
your sponsor's number.

236
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,192
- That the kid who
was attacked in the park?

237
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,323
It's all over the news.

238
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,934
- Do you recognize him
from last night?

239
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,433
Because he was here
charging drinks at closing.

240
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,328
- That right?

241
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,200
I don't remember him.

242
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,897
- How 'bout this guy?

243
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,465
- Him? Yeah, I think so.

244
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,598
But it was busy.
Everyone was outside.

245
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,990
Nobody at the bar.

246
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,906
When I'm slammed,
I only got eyes for the green.

247
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,362
- All right, well,
we'll need to take a look

248
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:05,648
at your security cam footage.

249
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,868
- Sorry, no can do. It's busted.

250
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,435
- Mr. Donovan, we don't care
if you black out your windows,

251
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,872
stay open past last call.

252
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,438
- I run a reputable place.

253
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,199
- Okay, so you won't mind
a couple of my tech guys

254
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,268
come down and see
if they can find anything?

255
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,009
- Not without a warrant.

256
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,011
- Rollins.

257
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,103
We might not need him.

258
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,236
Just got
the traffic cam footage.

259
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,631
- Well, it's definitely
not Jayvon.

260
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,371
Hold on.

261
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,459
That guy was at the park.

262
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,113
- Are you sure?

263
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,594
- Yeah, he was mouthing off,
filming us at the arrest.

264
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
Son of a bitch.

265
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,297
- This guy was in the park?

266
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,690
Any chance you got an ID?

267
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,170
- He was just filming,

268
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,713
which, as we've been told
repeatedly, is not illegal.

269
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,932
- He was brazen enough to go
back to his own crime scene,

270
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:54,978
so maybe he posted it.
- Okay, text me those photos.

271
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,613
See if TARU
can track down the video.

272
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,050
Aquino's still unconscious?
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,965
- See if the brother
can ID this guy.

274
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,011
- Liv...

275
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,414
I got Jayvon's sponsor
on the line.

276
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,057
He's a corporate lawyer.

277
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:10,147
He says he'll only talk to us
if Jayvon gives him permission.

278
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,193
- Okay.

279
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:15,109
- Corey, it's okay
to talk to them.

280
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,414
<i>- That's all I need to hear.</i>

281
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,807
- This is Captain Benson.

282
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,201
Can you tell us
when you last saw Jayvon?

283
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,593
<i>- This morning.</i>

284
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,726
<i>We met at 5:30 for coffee
and a walk.</i>

285
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,728
<i>At 6:00, we went to
our NA meeting</i>

286
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,426
<i>in the garden at St. Clair's.
At 7:00, we said goodbye.</i>

287
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,350
<i>He was his way to the park
to work out, Captain.</i>

288
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,995
- That's what I been
telling her.

289
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,258
<i>- Jayvon has been diligently
working his program.</i>

290
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,651
<i>I don't see him doing anything</i>

291
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
<i>that would jeopardize
his recovery or his job,</i>

292
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,090
<i>and I could get a dozen others
to vouch for him as well.</i>

293
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,439
- Thank you very much.

294
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,876
<i>- Jayvon, do you need a lawyer?</i>

295
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,660
<i>I can send someone from my firm.</i>

296
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,271
- That's up to them.
Am I free to go?

297
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,186
- Yes, we just have
to call the DA

298
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,579
and get him to drop the charges.

299
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,103
- Yeah. I would do that.

300
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,801
<i>- As soon as possible, Captain.</i>

301
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,759
<i>Jayvon,
call if you need anything.</i>

302
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,108
- Fin.

303
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,676
- Start the paperwork? On it.

304
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,811
Jayvon, can we ask you
another question?

305
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,116
- Do I have a choice?

306
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,639
- There may be another suspect,

307
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,816
and we were hoping
that you could help us.

308
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,777
- You want my help now?

309
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,302
- He was in the park
this morning at the scene.

310
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,782
Did you notice him?

311
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:23,786
- Before or after the cops
threw me in the squad car?

312
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,834
Even if I did notice him,

313
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:30,358
why would I help you?

314
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,969
- I get it.
You have the right to be angry.

315
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,842
- Don't tell me
I have a right to my anger.

316
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,628
I already know that.

317
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,721
- All those machines...

318
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,507
All the tests...

319
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,337
The doctors have no idea

320
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,687
when or if Eric
is going to wake up.

321
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,647
- I am so sorry.

322
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,739
- He is in God's hands now.

323
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,003
How could that man in the park
just leave him there?

324
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:10,485
- We don't think it was him.

325
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,271
Do you recognize this man?

326
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,840
- No.

327
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,756
I know Eric's friends
from high school, but...

328
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,717
That was a long time ago.

329
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,200
- He is Eric's type.

330
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,462
Straight-looking, preppy.

331
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,029
Calls him his "Chino Boys."

332
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,596
- You ever meet him?

333
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,139
- It's not like he ever
brought these guys home

334
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,947
for Sunday chicken adobo. - Hmm.

335
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,384
Anyone in Eric's life
who might know?

336
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:43,257
- My brother compartmentalized.

337
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,520
Med school in one box,
family another.

338
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,043
- Hookups in a third.

339
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,654
- Kat?
- One sec.

340
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,918
- TARU may have something.

341
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,704
- "Hottie Cop Telling Me
to Move"?

342
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,358
Seriously?

343
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,510
<i>- I have a right to film.
- Guys, move back, thank you.</i>

344
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:03,016
<i>- NYPD, man, protecting
and serving themselves.</i>

345
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,497
<i>Defund the police.
Defund the police!</i>

346
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,847
- We have an ID on this guy?

347
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,240
- Just a handle. ThirstTrap94.

348
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,502
- "Thirst trap"?

349
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,113
Wow, this dude's
feeling himself.

350
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,766
- Yeah.

351
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,638
I checked his other posts,
and I found this.

352
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:19,119
Danielle and Hana.

353
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,424
Start there?

354
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,426
- Find the one
that he didn't tag.

355
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,646
She may have a more interesting
story to tell.

356
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,603
- Always.

357
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,563
- Captain.
- Chief.

358
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:29,999
- I know it's late,

359
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,915
but I need a word with you
and Sergeant Tutuola...

360
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,831
Jayvon Brown has filed
a lawsuit against NYPD.

361
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,443
You've both been named.

362
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,753
- Jayvon Brown had
outstanding warrants.

363
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,948
He wouldn't answer questions...

364
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,147
- There was a crowd.

365
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,539
You know how fast
they turn now...

366
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,977
- Stop.
You both sound defensive.

367
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,371
These days,
that's not a good look.

368
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,330
- Chief, we were by the book.

369
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,550
- That's the book
that got us here!

370
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,296
After George Floyd,

371
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,603
Breonna Taylor, this city,

372
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,953
this country, are on boil.

373
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,738
Business as usual will not work.

374
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,657
- We hear you.
- Good.

375
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,485
1PP has launched
an investigation,

376
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,793
and IAB wants to start with you.

377
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,838
- When?
- Tomorrow.

378
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,058
Keep in mind,

379
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,321
we're under a microscope.

380
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,063
When you go in there,
short answers.

381
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,673
Don't overexplain.

382
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,894
- Okay.
- And bring a lawyer.

383
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,728
- Sergeant, walk me out.

384
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,519
- Captain did nothing wrong.

385
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:58,348
- I know you two are close,
but I have to ask.

386
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,935
Would things have
played out differently

387
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,047
if Jayvon were white?

388
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,919
- Yeah, I mean,
the woman, Colleen,

389
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,941
she would've never called
the police in the first place,

390
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,837
and if she did, the precinct
cop wouldn't have cuffed him.

391
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,317
- I concur.

392
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,536
And when SVU got there,

393
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,625
do you think racial bias
played any part

394
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,497
in how things were handled?

395
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,151
- Not consciously.

396
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,588
I've worked with Captain Benson
for over 20 years.

397
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,460
Her only bias is for the victim.

398
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,420
- All right. Thank you.

399
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:32,513
Sergeant...

400
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,645
I know I'm not someone
you relate to,

401
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,257
but we have one thing in common.

402
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,998
We're both Black and blue.

403
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,044
We've been on this job
a long time.

404
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,891
Did you know my father
joined the force in the '70s?

405
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,265
- No, I didn't know that.

406
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,744
- Made Sergeant.

407
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,703
Those days,
that was about as far

408
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,922
as they'd let us go.

409
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,968
Those days are over.
Things are changing.

410
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,624
Know how many times
I've heard that?

411
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,756
The one thing I do know

412
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,324
is this country will always
break your heart.

413
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,848
- Ah, this time's different.

414
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,025
This is a true inflection point.

415
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,679
- If you say so, Chief.

416
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:12,074
- We are. I know it.

417
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,295
I also know the old guard
won't go down without a fight.

418
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,774
There's gonna be a purge.

419
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:20,256
- Hold up.
So what are you saying?

420
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,779
- I appreciate your loyalty,

421
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,651
but you need to watch out
for yourself.

422
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,262
This is your second lawsuit
this year.

423
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,482
You shot a black man
in his home.

424
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,093
- Who was trying
to kill his son.

425
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,530
- It was a good shooting,
but that doesn't matter.

426
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,097
None of us are safe.

427
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,056
Not me, not you,

428
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,102
not Captain Benson.

429
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,416
- What did Joe do now?

430
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,113
- Joe? You got a last name?

431
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:54,116
- Joe Murphy.
- How do you know him?

432
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,250
- We used to have a thing
for, like, a minute.

433
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:00,166
He needs to be canceled.

434
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,124
- We noticed he untagged you.

435
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,822
- Yeah, he couldn't take it
that I broke up with him.

436
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,998
He can be a real charmer,

437
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,261
but he's a different person

438
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,784
once he hits
the tequila turnpike.

439
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,177
- How so?

440
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,267
- When he couldn't get it up,
he'd go off on me.

441
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,139
He'd come back the next day
with flowers,

442
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,795
but that got old fast.

443
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,579
What was I thinking?

444
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,973
Twenty-five, and he still
lives with his mother.

445
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,549
- Mrs. Murphy?
- Yeah?

446
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,246
- We're here to see
your son, Joe.

447
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,943
- I don't think he's home.

448
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:42,121
- I'm right here, Ma.

449
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,211
Hey, blondie cop.

450
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:47,169
I hope you're not upset
about my video.

451
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,519
- No, it was very helpful.

452
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,869
- Look, I know I was all

453
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:54,524
"BLM" in the park.

454
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,874
But really, you cops
didn't do anything wrong.

455
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,268
I heard that thug's
filing a lawsuit.

456
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,314
Do you need me to back you up?

457
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,533
- Actually, yes.

458
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,772
Yeah, it would be great if you
could come down to the station

459
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:06,904
and just give us a statement.

460
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,364
- Sure. Whatever you guys need.

461
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,496
- Joe.

462
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,367
- It's all right, Ma.
If I can help...

463
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,369
- Joe, Joe.

464
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,544
You need a mask.

465
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,634
- He came in willingly?

466
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,594
- Yeah, he made a big show
of wanting to help.

467
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,986
For what it's worth,

468
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,337
Eric Aquino's brother did say
he's Eric's type.

469
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,035
- The lab found DNA
on Aquino's underwear.

470
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,863
You think Murphy's
cooperative enough

471
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,169
to give us a sample?

472
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:33,346
- We don't have to ask him.
He's wearing a mask.

473
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,217
- Hmm.

474
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,394
- Why don't I get him
a fresh one?

475
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:39,830
- Keep me posted.

476
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,572
I gotta head to IAB.

477
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,748
Hey, by the way,

478
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,707
Garland say anything about me?

479
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,319
- Yeah. Watch your back.

480
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,719
- Hey, you mind swapping out
for a mask with a filter?

481
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,068
NYPD protocol.

482
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,288
- Sure.
Can't be too careful, right?

483
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:04,464
- No.

484
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,122
- So did you see Jayvon Brown
do anything suspicious?

485
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,124
- No, when I got there,
he was cuffed.

486
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,648
- Hmm, okay, and the vic?

487
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,519
You ever seen him before?

488
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:17,999
- No, sorry.

489
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,783
- Really?

490
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,569
So this isn't you?

491
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:26,007
- Oh, wait. That's the guy?

492
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,401
Wow, I didn't put
two and two together.

493
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,074
- So you don't remember
having drinks with him

494
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,666
at Owney Madden's?
Leaving after last call?

495
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,929
- Whoa, whoa. No.

496
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:38,411
It's not like that.
He followed me out of the bar.

497
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,847
He was kinda hitting on me.

498
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,912
I didn't want to be rude,
so I let him walk with me.

499
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,285
- All the way to the park?

500
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,505
- Dude, do I look gay?

501
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:46,636
I'm engaged.

502
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,072
I went right to
my fiancée's place.

503
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,683
- This was when?

504
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,162
4:30? 5:00?

505
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:53,513
- So how did you end up
back in the park?

506
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:54,992
- Well, Ashley lives
by the park.

507
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,167
- Oh.

508
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:57,168
- I heard all the sirens outside

509
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,169
and went down to check it out.

510
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,562
- So I'll need to talk
to Ashley.

511
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:02,086
- Sure, I'll call her.
- We'll do that.

512
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,927
- Captain Benson?
- Yes.

513
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,189
- Captain Curry.

514
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,843
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

515
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,192
- Actually, we've met...

516
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,283
Briefly, at Ed Tucker's funeral.

517
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,459
- Oh, yes, of course.

518
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,636
I'm sorry,
I wasn't myself that day.

519
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,681
- Neither was I.

520
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,553
Ed was my rabbi.

521
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,990
His poor wife.

522
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,035
- Yes.

523
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,646
Are you recording this?

524
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,798
- Once we start the interview.
We can wait for your lawyer.

525
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:43,693
- I'm not bringing one.

526
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,304
I know that that video
went viral,

527
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,307
but our conduct was...
Was by the book.

528
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,047
- Then this shouldn't take long.

529
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,967
- He's sleeping.

530
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,360
Good. Means he's guilty.

531
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,362
How's his alibi? - Bogus.

532
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:03,060
- What about the DNA?
- Not back yet.

533
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,149
- He doesn't need to know that.

534
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,240
- Joe. Joe!

535
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,462
- Ashley back me up?
- And then some.

536
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,290
She told us that you got
to her place

537
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,161
around 10:00 P.M.

538
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,555
- What can I say? She's loyal.

539
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,427
- And she's a liar.
How 'bout you?

540
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,732
- What are you talking about?

541
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,691
- Oh, we're taking your DNA
from your mask.

542
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,606
Now is there any reason
it might be a match

543
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,522
to the DNA
that we found on Aquino?

544
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,307
- Uh...

545
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,571
Okay, I might've left this out.

546
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,357
The guy asked me
to come into the park,

547
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,749
smoke a joint.

548
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,099
I'm drunk, I say yes,

549
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,928
then he gets persuasive.

550
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,408
- Meaning?

551
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,193
- He says, "Close your eyes.
Pretend I'm a girl.

552
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,718
I'm gonna give you
the greatest blow..."

553
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,938
Forgive me.
He offers to service me.

554
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,287
- And then what happened?

555
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,246
- He starts to unzip me.

556
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,901
Like I say, I'm not gay,
so I freak out.

557
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,381
I push him off of me and run.

558
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,731
- How hard you push him?
- Not hard.

559
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,690
I look back,
he's running after me.

560
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,300
He was a lot more drunk
than I was.

561
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,954
He must've taken a fall.

562
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,435
- Did you see him take a fall?

563
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,481
- Mr. Murphy's attorney's here.

564
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,179
- Thanks, Sonny.

565
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,659
Tell your sister, Teresa,
I say hi.

566
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,052
- They'll need the room.
- Hold up, he's lawyering up?

567
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,619
Why don't we just arraign
his ass?

568
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:24,727
- Wait, I didn't ask
for a lawyer.

569
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,623
- Zito, Joe.
Mr. Donovan hired me.

570
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,234
He's looking out for you
and your mother.

571
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,541
- The owner of the bar
and your mom.

572
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,630
That's why he covered for you.

573
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:37,938
- He did? He's loyal too.

574
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,983
Good people.

575
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,116
I drink for free every night.

576
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:49,515
- The victim, Eric Aquino,
couldn't describe his assailant

577
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,255
because he was unconscious.

578
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,866
- So other than the park mother,

579
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,650
Colleen Reynold's
false accusation,

580
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,870
you had no reason
to suspect Jayvon Brown?

581
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,612
- As I said, Mr. Brown
was already under arrest

582
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,831
for outstanding warrants
when we got there.

583
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,877
- So you're saying
you had no choice?

584
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,921
- A crowd was gathering.

585
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,357
He wasn't cooperating.

586
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,489
I didn't wanna release him

587
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,144
before ruling him out
as a suspect.

588
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:12,494
- Okay.

589
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,192
Captain Benson, had you ever
encountered Mr. Brown before?

590
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:18,108
- No, not to my knowledge.

591
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:20,371
- Do you recall a stop
and frisk of a black male

592
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:23,200
on August 6, 2013

593
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:24,637
outside the Wagner Houses?

594
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,509
- Can you give me
a little bit more context?

595
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:31,513
- Detective Nick Amaro
filed the 2-50.

596
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,647
He was your partner then?
The Jolene Castille case?

597
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,040
- The chef. Right, right, right.

598
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,477
- Ms. Castille, a white woman,

599
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,479
shot Mehcad Carter,
an innocent Black teen,

600
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,219
falsely claiming
he was a rapist.

601
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:43,438
- That was a tragedy,

602
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,093
and we tried to remedy
that situation, but...

603
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,723
- Captain, one of the Black
males you and your partner

604
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:51,402
stopped and frisked that day
was Jayvon Brown.

605
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,758
- He must have fit the profile.

606
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,064
We were pursuing

607
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,023
a black male serial rapist.

608
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,591
- And what profile
did he fit yesterday?

609
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:11,205
- Again, the arresting officers
had run his name,

610
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,773
and they found
outstanding warrants.

611
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,819
- Did you ask the officers
to run Colleen Reynolds' name?

612
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,561
- No, I did not.

613
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,824
- She has a history
of false accusations

614
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,087
and her ex has a restraining
order against her.

615
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,046
- I should have
run her name too.

616
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,265
That... that was my mistake.

617
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,877
- Have you given any thought as
to why you made that mistake?

618
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,489
- If you're suggesting

619
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,448
that I'm biased, I'm not.

620
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:40,321
And I am well aware
of false accusations,

621
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:43,498
especially with men of color.

622
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:48,329
- I'm gonna stop you here

623
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,524
before you tell me
you're an ally.

624
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,375
- Excuse me?

625
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,291
- Since George Floyd, I've
taken statement after statement

626
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,206
from two kinds of cops:

627
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,687
the baton swinging gladiators
who take one look at me

628
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,515
and can barely hide
their disdain...

629
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,039
- And I'm sorry that you
had to experience that.

630
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,999
- And the well-intentioned,
guardian cops

631
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,870
who never see
themselves as racist,

632
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,090
but are in denial
about their complicity

633
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:14,311
in the systemic racism
within the NYPD...

634
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,531
Cops like you, Captain Benson.

635
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:21,884
- I'm well aware

636
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:24,800
there's racism in NYPD.

637
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:27,368
- And what about your own bias?

638
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,545
- I'm not racist.

639
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,068
- I'm sure you're not,

640
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,331
explicitly.

641
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,073
But implicitly?

642
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:40,381
If you grew up in this country,
it's in you and me.

643
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,339
I struggle every day
with my own biases.

644
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,167
For too many people,

645
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,517
law enforcement has
lost all credibility,

646
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,563
and until every one of us

647
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,827
takes a serious self-inventory,

648
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,048
we can't begin to get it back.

649
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,145
- Ah. After speaking to Joe,

650
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,321
I found a way out
of this unfortunate situation.

651
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,670
- Have you?

652
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:09,889
- Yeah, as my client stated,

653
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,978
he was lured to the park
by Mr. Aquino,

654
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,981
who gave him drugs
and became sexually aggressive.

655
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,156
- Really, so why is Mr. Aquino

656
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,114
in the ICU, unconscious,

657
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,812
a victim of rape?

658
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,335
- That's how things
sometimes go wrong

659
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:24,120
when drugs, alcohol, and
misplaced passion are involved.

660
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:26,427
- Okay, you wanna sell that
to a jury?

661
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,168
Go ahead. Book him.

662
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,779
Attempted murder, assault one,
and criminal sexual act.

663
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,129
- Hold up, Counselor.

664
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,175
Given the unfortunate
turn of events,

665
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:38,700
Joe would be willing
to consider mis-d assault.

666
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:41,007
- Mr. Aquino has
bruising, trauma,

667
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,139
and your client's DNA
in his underwear.

668
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,272
- Which can happen
with consensual sex.

669
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:46,708
- Consensual?

670
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:47,816
He tried to force himself on me.

671
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,904
- All right, Joe, if I may...

672
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:49,992
- All right,
get him out of here.

673
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,210
- Stand up, Joe.
You're under arrest.

674
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,734
- All right, good luck
getting an indictment.

675
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,020
Aside from that viral video

676
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:56,196
of cops arresting
an innocent black man,

677
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,043
you don't even have a "he said,
he said" here, Counselor.

678
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,896
Your vic's in a coma.
- Let's go.

679
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,253
- Hey.
- Hey.

680
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,169
Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course.

681
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,389
- I know it's been a long day.
- Yeah.

682
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,217
- Where are we?

683
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,306
- We arrested Joe Murphy.

684
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,916
He admitted to sex with Aquino

685
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,657
but denies having assaulted him.

686
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,050
- And Aquino's
still unconscious?

687
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,792
- Yes.

688
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,881
- It may be better
if Sergeant Tutuola

689
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,404
testifies at the grand jury.

690
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,277
Rather than a white woman,
Captain?

691
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,417
- How'd it go at IAB?

692
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,114
- What have you heard?

693
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:47,900
- Not a word, which worries me.

694
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,076
- Chief, I didn't sleep
last night.

695
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,035
Been going over and over
and over in my head

696
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,429
about what happened
in that park,

697
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:56,996
and trying to figure out

698
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,606
what I could've
done differently,

699
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,695
and...

700
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,784
And what I missed.

701
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,568
- And what do you think?

702
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,267
- I think that I
have been so focused

703
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,225
on the victims

704
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,489
that my own bias

705
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,665
didn't even occur to me.

706
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,624
- And now?

707
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:20,454
- I don't know.

708
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,195
How much did that bias

709
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:24,240
affect my choices,

710
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:27,026
affect my decisions

711
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,333
as a cop?

712
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,249
I'm reeling.

713
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,208
- We all are.

714
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,126
The level
of community outrage...

715
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:43,477
There's a freight train coming.

716
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,784
1PP senses it too.

717
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,307
My worry is,

718
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,657
they're more interested in
the optics than actual change.

719
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,312
- Is that why you had Fin

720
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,314
tell me to watch my back?

721
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,840
- When an organization
feels threatened,

722
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,842
if they believe they can
protect themselves

723
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,975
by sacrificing a few pawns,

724
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,325
they will not hesitate.

725
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:13,637
- You worked with Eric Aquino.

726
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,770
- He's selfless.

727
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,337
A gentle soul.

728
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,644
- Can you describe his injuries?

729
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,516
- A head wound so severe

730
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,432
that he still hasn't
regained consciousness

731
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,696
and anal trauma consistent
with sexual assault.

732
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,046
- Was there DNA?

733
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,048
- Joe Murphy's DNA was a match

734
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,877
for the semen found
in Aquino's underwear.

735
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,793
- Mr. Aquino is unable
to testify here today.

736
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,665
Can you tell us what happened
when the police discovered him?

737
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,015
- He was bleeding from the head.

738
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,017
His pants were down and bloody.

739
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,932
He was able to make
a brief statement

740
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,150
which led us to proceed

741
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,718
with the sexual assault
investigation.

742
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:51,719
- Thank you, Sergeant.

743
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,069
- Can I ask a question?

744
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:57,464
- You can ask me, and I'll...
- That's okay, I'll ask.

745
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,640
Did the victim say
who had assaulted him?

746
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,903
- No.
- But isn't this the case

747
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,731
where you arrested
Jayvon Brown first?

748
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:05,472
- The police were called.

749
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,300
He had outstanding warrants.

750
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,997
- So you all assume
it was a black man

751
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,043
just because he was there?

752
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,783
- We didn't know
what we were looking at.

753
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:14,152
- So why should we
believe you now?

754
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,962
- Miss, there's a process here,

755
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,746
and if you have questions,
you need to...

756
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:21,053
- I have a lot of questions.

757
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,924
The only reason Jayvon
was arrested

758
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,056
was because of that Karen

759
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,448
saying she was threatened,
right?

760
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,494
- That is not relevant
to these proceedings,

761
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,337
and the Sergeant does not
have to answer that.

762
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,673
- Jayvon Brown was arrested

763
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,588
according to standard
police procedure.

764
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,939
"Police procedure"?

765
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,158
The same procedure you used

766
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:40,352
when you shot that boy's father,

767
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,291
another black man
in the projects?

768
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,519
- That was a train wreck.

769
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:55,000
You know I'm losing control
of the grand jury?

770
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,958
- Was not my idea to testify.

771
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,327
- Because you didn't agree
with the way

772
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,353
Jayvon's arrest went down?
- I didn't say that.

773
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:01,920
- No, but the grand jury
all heard it.

774
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,878
- Well, even if they did,
Joe Murphy is guilty.

775
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,445
That has nothing to do
with Jayvon.

776
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:07,926
- Try saying that in there.

777
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,754
Don't you see
they're looking for reasons

778
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,191
not to trust the cops right now,

779
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,497
and when you...
When you get on the stand,

780
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,935
and you testify like
you're being held hostage,

781
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,545
that doesn't help me
get the indictment!

782
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,044
- Is that what this is about?
'Cause I'm sorry, Counselor,

783
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,132
if we didn't give this case
to you wrapped up

784
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:22,941
in a nice little bow. - Fin.

785
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,291
If you had second thoughts
about arresting Jayvon,

786
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,684
you should've told me
before you went up there.

787
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,164
- Maybe you should know.

788
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,861
After all your years
of being a cop,

789
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,013
you've never seen
black cops stand back

790
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,081
during stop and frisk?

791
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,082
- Oh, what does this
have to do with me?

792
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,475
- I'm just saying.

793
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:37,018
You can take a cop out
of Staten Island...

794
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:37,999
- What, are you
calling me racist?

795
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,174
What the hell is that, huh?

796
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:40,499
- No, no, no, no.
No one is saying that!

797
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,612
- Folks, calm down.
You're making a scene.

798
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,875
- I'm in the middle
of a grand jury, Mr. Freddo.

799
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,181
What are you doing here?

800
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,444
My client decided to testify.

801
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:49,837
- Oh, really?

802
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,728
Does he understand that
he has to waive immunity?

803
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,624
- He knows. Buckle up, Sonny.

804
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,932
- Perp walking in
to a grand jury?

805
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,281
Something's up.

806
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,502
- Well, whatever lies
Murphy tells,

807
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:04,069
he's locked into a trial.

808
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,158
- If this goes to trial.

809
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,552
They're rolling the dice
that I won't get an indictment.

810
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,126
- Yes. Okay.

811
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,954
I lied to the police.

812
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,651
I had met Mr. Aquino in a bar,

813
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,784
and he and I did walk
into the park together.

814
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,655
- And didn't you also lie

815
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,962
about what happened
once you got to the park?

816
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,008
- Yes.

817
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:33,054
And this is not easy for me.

818
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,057
The truth is
we were drunk, high.

819
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:39,539
He unzipped me,
initiated a sexual encounter.

820
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:42,629
- And so you lied to the cops
about that too, right?

821
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,155
- I was ashamed.

822
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,201
My fiancée, my mom,

823
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,334
I didn't want them to know...

824
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:56,338
I'm bi.

825
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,688
- I appreciate your bravery

826
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,516
in outing yourself here today,

827
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,953
but can you tell us truthfully

828
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:06,522
what happened after
your sexual encounter?

829
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:09,482
- Nothing.
Nothing happened after that.

830
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:10,700
- I'm sorry, what?

831
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,156
- Eric and I had
a brief sexual moment.

832
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,530
I'm not proud of it,
but like I said, I was drunk.

833
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:17,098
I zipped up.
I went home to my fiancée.

834
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,022
I have no idea what happened
to Eric after that.

835
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,885
- Mr. Murphy, didn't you
tell the detectives

836
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,974
that Eric had gotten
aggressive with you,

837
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,106
and you pushed him off?

838
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,170
- Yeah, well,
I was just telling them

839
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:27,500
what they wanted to hear.

840
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,372
- You mean you lied again?

841
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:33,114
Okay, so basically, today,

842
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,377
you have admitted
to every detail

843
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:36,726
of your encounter

844
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,642
until the point that
Eric Aquino was assaulted.

845
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:40,904
I'm sorry, but this sounds

846
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,950
like you're admitting
what you can't deny

847
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,430
and denying
what you can't admit,

848
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:46,214
so why... why should
we believe you now?

849
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:48,695
- The confession was coerced.

850
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,612
One of the cops told me
they were mad at me

851
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,092
for filming Jayvon's arrest.

852
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,398
They got a lot of flack
for arresting him,

853
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,941
and I was going to have
to take the fall.

854
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:01,011
- So even though
Eric Aquino was raped,

855
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:03,101
and is still in a coma,

856
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,319
you're the victim here?

857
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,669
That is your testimony? - No.

858
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,499
We're all victims here.

859
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:15,287
Eric, Jayvon, and me.

860
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,394
- Mr. Murphy,
we've heard enough.

861
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,377
Thank you. - Excuse me.

862
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,988
Let the man finish.

863
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:29,518
- I'm horrified about
what happened to Eric,

864
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,303
but that has nothing
to do with me.

865
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,174
I did not hurt him.

866
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,958
That's why I came in today

867
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,613
even though my lawyer
advised me not to.

868
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,318
The cops are lying to you.

869
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,019
I'm not.

870
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,348
- This your new office?

871
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,264
- Take a seat.

872
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,004
- How you doing?

873
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,789
- Not good.

874
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,834
- It's only been a few hours.

875
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:27,707
- For a grand jury,
that is a lifetime.

876
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,883
He lied through his teeth.

877
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,538
He knew exactly
what cards to play.

878
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:33,843
The more I went after him,

879
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,324
the more the grand jurors
sympathized with him.

880
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,021
- Juries are smart, Dominick.

881
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:40,459
- Usually.

882
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,635
But they're so mad
at the NYPD right now,

883
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,114
they wanna punish us.

884
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,726
- Hey, Sonny.
Well, win some, lose some.

885
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,467
Warden just told me
they voted No Bill.

886
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,859
Joey walks.

887
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:52,949
You should've taken
the mis-d, kiddo.

888
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,216
- It's not over.

889
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,914
- No, it's not.

890
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,351
Somebody still needs to tell
Eric Aquino's family

891
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,658
what just happened.

892
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:11,011
- This man leaves my son
to die, and he goes free?

893
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,099
How could this happen?

894
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:13,642
- He told the grand jury
we framed him.

895
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,624
- And they believed him
over the police.

896
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,540
- It's a complicated time.

897
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,238
- I don't understand.

898
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,718
- What she means, Mom,
is NYPD screwed up.

899
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,763
- Mark Peter, be polite.

900
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,591
- This is all on you!

901
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,829
If you hadn't arrested
Jayvon Brown,

902
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:29,464
none of this would've happened,
would it?

903
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:43,783
- Hey, Noah.
Time for bed, honey.

904
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,918
What are you watching?

905
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:52,879
- The video of you
arresting the wrong guy.

906
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,144
Everybody at school's seen it.

907
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,454
- Okay.

908
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:08,677
You wanna talk about it?

909
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:12,725
- Why did you arrest him?

910
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:16,294
Are you racist?

911
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,252
- Noah...

912
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,559
Come on.

913
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,996
Noah, you know that I'm not.

914
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,957
- Did you tell him you're sorry?

915
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,613
- There's a lawsuit,

916
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:35,443
and my bosses told me that I...

917
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,924
That I shouldn't talk to him.

918
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,883
- Why?

919
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:44,670
You always tell me to apologize
when I do something wrong.

920
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:56,421
- Mr. Brown...

921
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,639
Can I talk to you?

922
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,301
Don't you have anything
better to do

923
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,383
than pressure me
into dropping my complaint?

924
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,516
- That's not why I'm here.

925
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,998
- So you know I got laid off.

926
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:12,698
Somehow it was all in
the papers that I'm in NA.

927
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,917
- I'm sorry,
and I can call your boss...

928
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,658
- Don't.

929
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,181
You've done enough.

930
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,361
- I wanted to let you know

931
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,842
that the DA is pursuing charges
against Colleen Reynolds

932
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,975
for filing a false report.

933
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,674
- Okay,

934
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,502
so... so I lose my job,

935
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,156
Murphy walks,

936
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,985
and now you think
you can just distract everyone

937
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,901
and claim some moral high
ground by charging that woman?

938
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,646
- The NYPD has...

939
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,826
<i>I</i> have a lot of work to do.

940
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,525
- Yeah.

941
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,353
You do.

942

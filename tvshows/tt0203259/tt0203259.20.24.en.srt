1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,990
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:03,533
sexually based offenses

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,790
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,234
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

5
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,093
who investigate these vicious felonies

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,493
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,713
known as the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,453
These are their stories.

9
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,193
There's no reason
for you to be scared, honey.

10
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,294
I don't bite.

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,723
Do I look scared?

12
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:23,675
You could sit a little bit closer.

13
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:25,683
How's this?

14
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,263
Are you ready for some fun, Daddy?

15
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,693
Call me Adam, I don't need
the whole Daddy shtick.

16
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,416
What do you need?

17
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,263
How 'bout seeing what you look like

18
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:49,873
underneath this dress, huh?

19
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:51,793
That can be arranged.

20
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,443
Ooh.

21
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:56,923
Oh!

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,863
God, you're hot.

23
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,166
How old are you?

24
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:13,643
It's not polite to ask a lady her age.

25
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:17,796
Good morning.

26
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,093
Is it? You tell me.

27
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:22,383
Considering I've barely closed my eyes

28
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,344
since Rob Miller got out of prison.

29
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:26,845
He's targeting me, Fin.

30
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:29,393
He wants me to know that
he has all the power.

31
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:31,263
Liv, we have a unmarked car
on your block,

32
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:32,494
one in front of Noah's school.

33
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:33,703
There's no way he can get at you.

34
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,273
There's no way he can get at me?

35
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,093
He walked right into that restaurant

36
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:38,939
and introduced himself to Noah.

37
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,696
I should have shot the son of a bitch.

38
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,583
No, not so loud.
Stone is in your office, okay?

39
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,063
I called him in.

40
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,323
Okay.

41
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,569
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,983
Wish I had better news.

43
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,559
Please don't tell me it's worse

44
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,776
than Rob Miller making bail.

45
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,921
Feds dropped the charges.

46
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,767
Damn.

47
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:10,637
He blackmailed the judge,
he threatened witnesses,

48
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,106
he threatened Nikki Staines.

49
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:17,416
We have him on tape saying,
"No Nikki, no case."

50
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,623
A federal judge ruled
that statement didn't rise

51
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,803
to the legal standard.

52
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,805
- What now?
- What about Nikki's rape?

53
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,005
There's nothing there. Nikki's scared.

54
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,962
She's claiming it was consensual.

55
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,931
I'll talk to her.

56
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,463
_

57
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,408
Oh, my baby. It's gonna be okay.

58
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,900
Why don't you go to your room
and lie down?

59
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,788
What kind of person...?

60
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,820
What?

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,150
Miller killed my daughter's dog.

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,515
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,430
This is Penny's ashes right there.

64
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,597
The vet said that it was rat poison.

65
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:04,056
Now, the landlord didn't
put down any rat poison,

66
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,806
and I sure didn't put down
any rat poison.

67
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:07,983
So how?

68
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,679
My daughter said that
there's this woman

69
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,720
that offered Penny a treat
on their walk last night,

70
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,291
and she thought it was okay, right?

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,198
And then.. and then this
morning, the dog was...

72
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:22,220
Oh, Nikki, I'm so sorry.

73
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,606
Listen, the woman said,

74
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,055
"Say hello to your mom."

75
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,213
Why?

76
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,990
Rob Miller knows that
I wasn't gonna testify.

77
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,223
So that's why I'm here.

78
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:41,112
We need you to testify, Nikki.

79
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,301
Listen to me.

80
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:46,364
The Feds dropped the charges.

81
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:48,764
No.

82
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,234
No, no, no, no.

83
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,503
Absolutely not.

84
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,642
Okay, Nikki, just hear me out.

85
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,754
- Hear me...
- No!

86
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,541
Just hear me out. I understand.

87
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:59,408
So talk to me about
the Wally Stevens case,

88
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:01,033
the underage girls.

89
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,697
Miller obviously thought that
he'd be implicated,

90
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,315
and that's why he stole your phone.

91
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,603
For nothing!

92
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:09,056
There is not a word on that phone

93
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:10,299
that connects him to the case.

94
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,556
So why? What was he afraid of?

95
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,291
Can Wally put him at those sex parties?

96
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,312
- Tell me, what did he...
- I can't!

97
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:22,658
Attorney-client privilege, right?

98
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,791
Ever heard of it?

99
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:26,788
I'm not about to risk
getting myself disbarred.

100
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,166
Listen, I am incredibly appreciative

101
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,580
of what you've done for me,

102
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,879
Olivia, but you gotta go now.

103
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,056
Go now.

104
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:50,372
There has to be a way to tie Rob Miller

105
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:53,654
to Wally Stevens to the sex parties.

106
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:57,338
He blackmailed a judge,
he stole Nikki Staines' phone;

107
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,823
has to be connected.

108
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,263
What are we missing?

109
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,955
We've gone over the case
forwards and backwards.

110
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:04,472
- It's fallen apart.
- No.

111
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,815
The three 16-year-olds,

112
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,885
that we put at the party are
all backing off their story.

113
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,322
They're claiming that nothing happened.

114
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,112
Right, because he got to
them or got to their parents.

115
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,261
Check the bank accounts.

116
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,862
This guy doesn't leave
a fingerprint on the knife.

117
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,153
Fin, we have half a dozen witnesses...

118
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,353
We had witnesses. They all lawyered up.

119
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,135
Exactly! That's my point.

120
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:26,373
Judge Leonard retired to the Maldives.

121
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,773
This Wally Stevens guy's
untouchable, Double Jeopardy.

122
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,353
I know, Fin. I was there, thank you.

123
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,277
Lieu, listen,
I hear you on all of this,

124
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,043
but we got something from
the Harbor Unit

125
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,518
that we have to deal with right now.

126
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,799
A young female washed up

127
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,326
at a pier on the Hudson River.

128
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,093
Let's go.

129
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,760
_

130
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:49,760
Can't be more than 15, 16;
naked, no ID.

131
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,002
How long was she in the water?

132
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,689
My guess, a couple of hours,
day at the most.

133
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,580
The ME can give you
a more accurate time frame.

134
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:55,822
Did she fall off a boat?

135
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,339
Looks like every bone
in her body is broken.

136
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,384
Her organs are liquefied.

137
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:11,308
This girl fell out of the sky.

138
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:06,623
I just wanted to let you know,

139
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,990
that a uniformed officer
will be with the sitter,

140
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,713
when she picks Noah
up from school today.

141
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,115
Great. Thank you so much,
I appreciate it.

142
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:15,640
How is Noah doing?

143
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:17,302
Ah, he's thrilled.

144
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,029
He gets to ride to and
from school in a squad car,

145
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,155
but the school administration,

146
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,826
- not so much.
- Miller's a bad guy,

147
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,810
but do you really think
that he would go after

148
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,367
- a Lieutenant's kid?
- Rollins, I don't know,

149
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,808
what he's capable of.

150
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:33,333
The prelim report
from the ME on our Jane Doe.

151
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,786
No water in her lungs,

152
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,523
so she was dead
before she hit the river.

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,166
- So cause of death?
- OD.

154
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,553
China White,
highly-concentrated fentanyl.

155
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,810
This girl wasn't an addict.

156
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,157
There's no trace in her hair
or nails, no needle marks.

157
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,591
So she was given a hot shot.

158
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,436
The ME's ruling it
undetermined for now,

159
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,043
but they also found
the presence of semen

160
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,653
from two different men.

161
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,189
No DNA hits.

162
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,310
And there's no matches
with Missing Persons?

163
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,423
Not yet.

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,612
This girl is healthy,
she has expensive dental work,

165
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,091
she had parents, I mean,

166
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:01,536
they have to be looking for her.

167
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,833
Well, it's only been 24 hours.

168
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,090
We'll keep checking.

169
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,843
The ME just finished the autopsy.

170
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:07,992
Go. Go.

171
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,242
From the condition of the body,

172
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,958
I'd say she fell at least 2,000 feet.

173
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,825
All right, so small plane,
maybe a helicopter.

174
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,187
That's your department.

175
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,755
I can tell you that
she was in the water

176
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,792
less than 15 hours
before she washed ashore.

177
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,099
All right, great. So we get

178
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,935
a grid of the tidal pattern
from the Coast Guard,

179
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,174
we find out where she hit the water,

180
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,509
we cross reference that with the FAA,
for aircraft in that area...

181
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,685
So we know,

182
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,341
where, when, how...

183
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,733
we still don't know who.

184
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,075
Just getting to that.

185
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:33,789
At first, I was at a loss
for this little mermaid.

186
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:37,836
No tattoos, breast implants,
but then I found these.

187
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,993
What is that, a contact lens?

188
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,200
Two of them.

189
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:43,197
It's a miracle they stayed on
the eyeball through the fall.

190
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,782
Right, so we can contact
the manufacturer,

191
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:47,024
but the phrase "needle in a haystack"
comes to mind.

192
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,339
If you let me finish...

193
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,246
these lenses have
a unique prescription.

194
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:52,352
The left eye corrects 20/40.

195
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,099
The right, 20/400.

196
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,798
That kind of difference
in visual acuity

197
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,815
from eye to eye is one in a million.

198
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,510
Narrow it down enough for you?

199
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,047
Hmm.

200
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,977
_

201
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:13,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,861
Lindsay Parker, 16.

203
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:19,043
Her ophthalmologist confirmed
the contacts lens prescription.

204
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,693
She lived here with her parents,

205
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,263
Vanessa and Hugo Parker.

206
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:23,823
And they didn't file
a Missing Persons report

207
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,455
- for a 16-year-old girl.
- Well, she's 16.

208
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,874
These days, that's pretty independent.

209
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:29,305
I mean, who knows if they even
realize she's missing.

210
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,497
Yeah, this never gets easier, does it?

211
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,924
No.

212
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:35,891
Yes?

213
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:38,188
I'm Lieutenant Benson,
this is Detective Rollins.

214
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,783
We're from the Special Victims Unit.

215
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,980
So you found her?
Please tell me you found her.

216
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:45,002
- Can we come in?
- Of course.

217
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,819
Vanessa, it's the police.

218
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:53,672
Where's Lindsay? Where's my baby?

219
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,250
Lieutenant, Detective.

220
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,805
What are you doing here?

221
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,169
I'm just here to help, Lieutenant.

222
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,556
I can assure you.

223
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,773
Rob's been our family
attorney for ten years.

224
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,980
When Lindsay didn't come home,
he was my first call.

225
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,938
We need to speak with you
about Lindsay.

226
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,766
Lindsay was spending the weekend

227
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:34,774
at her friend Brooke's house
in Sag Harbor.

228
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:37,163
When she didn't answer
her phone, we called the house.

229
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,389
The parents told us
their daughter told them

230
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,516
that she was with us.

231
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,683
Okay, we're gonna need their contact.

232
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,592
Oh, of course.

233
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,916
We didn't call the police.

234
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,610
They're teenage girls
and Lindsay's been

235
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,443
to parties before and come home late.

236
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,663
And we just... we didn't wanna
embarrass her.

237
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:57,522
So we called Rob to hire
a private detective

238
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,307
if it came to that.

239
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:03,052
So, Mr. and Mrs. Parker...

240
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:06,134
we are so very sorry.

241
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,633
Wait, Lindsay's all right, isn't she?

242
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,655
- No.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:19,955
Is this your daughter?

244
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,711
Oh, my God.

245
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,047
Yes, wha... what...?

246
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:29,483
No. No, that's not Lindsay.

247
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,586
I mean, that's not...
That's not Lindsay.

248
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:34,485
What happened?
Was this some kind of accident?

249
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:36,613
We're still investigating.

250
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:39,385
We wanna find out
what happened to Lindsay,

251
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:41,561
so we're gonna need her phone records,

252
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,155
access to her social media...

253
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,372
- I can get you all of that.
- Okay.

254
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,849
Again, we're so very sorry.

255
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:53,015
If there's anything that
we can do to help you...

256
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:56,224
Her body....what are we supposed to do?

257
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,723
Where is she?

258
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,450
We'll help you make arrangements.

259
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:00,567
Yeah.

260
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,344
So, we'll give you some time,

261
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,995
and we'll be in touch.

262
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,343
If you have any questions, feel free.

263
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,795
I can show you out.

264
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,724
Anything the police need,
obviously, I'm here to help.

265
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,713
You know what?
I'm gonna meet you outside.

266
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,845
- You sure?
- Yep. I'm good, Amanda.

267
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,489
I'll be out front.

268
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,565
I realize this is awkward.

269
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,782
I don't even know where
to begin with you.

270
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,549
Do your clients know that
you're a criminal?

271
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,769
They're aware that
I was falsely charged.

272
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,141
Their daughter is dead;
shouldn't that be our priority?

273
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:51,138
Well, that's my top priority,
believe me.

274
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,985
But what is your role in all of this?

275
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,521
Excuse me?

276
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,143
Well, their 16-year-old daughter

277
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:02,156
was murdered one week
after you are released

278
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,507
from federal custody.

279
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:04,873
Do you hear yourself?

280
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,173
This is just a tragic coincidence.

281
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,650
I don't believe in coincidences.

282
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,663
What you're saying right now
is clear evidence

283
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,143
of police bias, your bias.

284
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,299
Okay.

285
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,287
Are you angry because I figured out

286
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:21,260
your little CSU ruse at the bar
two months ago?

287
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,962
Yeah, I'm angry.

288
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,036
I'm very angry,
but not because of that.

289
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,513
Or maybe because I declined
to pursue our relationship.

290
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,204
Don't flatter yourself.

291
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,808
If there weren't two grieving parents

292
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:45,285
in the next room, I'd break your jaw.

293
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:46,862
You'd regret that, Lieutenant.

294
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,555
Stay away from me.
Stay away from my son.

295
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,411
Because if you don't, I promise you,

296
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,448
I will do something that
we both regret.

297
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,594
Okay.

298
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,513
We don't wanna get you
in trouble, Brooke,

299
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,815
but your friend is dead.

300
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:16,313
I know. I can't believe it.

301
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:19,232
Okay, when's the last time
you saw Lindsay?

302
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,151
We were at this party.

303
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,397
- Where?
- Uh, somewhere in the city.

304
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,754
We took a car service from Sag Harbor.

305
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,574
Lindsay had the address.
I was pretty wasted.

306
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:32,594
What happened at this party?

307
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,234
I don't wanna tell you.

308
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:38,234
Brooke, I'm sorry, but you have to.

309
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,747
I'm scared.

310
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:42,221
Honey, I know you're scared.

311
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,377
Listen, none of this
is your fault, okay?

312
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,074
We just need to figure out
what happened to Lindsay.

313
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,959
This wasn't a party with
your friends, was it, Brooke?

314
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,052
It's okay.

315
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:57,707
But you need to tell us the truth.

316
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,328
- There were men there.
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,137
Lindsay and I, uh...

318
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,134
sometimes they treated us like adults.

319
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,185
You know, champagne, coke...

320
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,680
It was exciting.

321
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,855
One guy even gave me a Birkin bag.

322
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:22,351
Please don't tell my parents.

323
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:26,637
Lindsay's cell phone went dead

324
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,602
at 2:36 a.m. Sunday morning.

325
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,134
- Where?
- The signal was picked up

326
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,866
by a cell tower in Tribeca.

327
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,979
We can pinpoint a five-block radius.

328
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,391
So run every single building
in the zone.

329
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:37,647
I'm already on it.

330
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:39,641
I'm checking car services
that made trips

331
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:41,945
from Sag Harbor to Manhattan
that night.

332
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,305
Okay, so, this may be a long shot,

333
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:47,078
but I want you to show
this girl a picture

334
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:49,641
of Wally Stevens and everyone else that

335
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,625
we've picked up
at an underage sex party

336
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,069
in the last six months.

337
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,586
There has to be a connection,

338
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,471
and Rob Miller is at the center of it.

339
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:02,797
And just let us know
if you recognize anybody.

340
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,177
No.

341
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:06,272
No.

342
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,721
Oh, that's Wally.

343
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:10,414
We met at The Maidstone.
He was really nice.

344
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,985
Did he invite you to the party?

345
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,994
- Yes.
- Okay.

346
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,934
Anybody else?

347
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:18,594
No.

348
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,134
No.

349
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,904
Mm-mm.

350
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,415
Are you sure about that?

351
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,397
I don't know.
I guess he looks familiar.

352
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:34,954
From the party?

353
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,700
No, maybe I saw him on TV.

354
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,051
Okay.

355
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,858
Anybody else?

356
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,884
Wait, go back.

357
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,167
- I know him.
- How do you know him?

358
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,774
He was at a party
in the Hamptons last September.

359
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,221
He was with this girl,

360
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,930
an Italian foreign exchange student.

361
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:03,141
_

362
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,828
Do you know her?

363
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,165
Brooke. She was adorable.

364
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,112
You're not helping yourself here, Alex.

365
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,589
I didn't have sex with her.

366
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,505
What about this girl?

367
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,064
She looks familiar.

368
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:16,586
Familiar, how?

369
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,188
Did you see these two girls
go to a party

370
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:20,721
in the Hamptons last September?

371
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,781
Are you kidding me, almost a year ago?

372
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:24,235
Tell them what you know, Alex,

373
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,902
if you wanna get out by 70.

374
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,776
Fine, I recognize them,

375
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,423
but I didn't have sex
with either of them.

376
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,617
- I swear.
- Did he?

377
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,854
I... I don't know who that is.

378
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,043
The way you're twitching,
pal, I don't believe you.

379
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,436
Is there a question here?

380
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,043
Yeah. Does he know her?

381
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,329
I can't say.

382
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:52,012
Well, you should know she's dead.

383
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,539
I had nothing to do with that.

384
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,024
I think you should listen
to your lawyer

385
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,235
and tell us what you know.

386
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,704
If you wanna get out of here by 70,

387
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,047
you'll still have a little life left;

388
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,994
90, not so much.

389
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,468
If you saw this guy
with this pants down,

390
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,336
if you saw him within five feet
of these two girls,

391
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,328
if you saw him so much
as light up a cigarette

392
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:11,788
in a no smoking area,
then we can work with you.

393
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,525
But you have gotta tell us
how you know him.

394
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,250
Okay.

395
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:19,707
Okay.

396
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,968
Maybe I saw him at that party
in the Hamptons.

397
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,868
But I am not testifying
against Rob Miller.

398
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:32,399
I'll take my chances inside.

399
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,188
Hey, Jim.

400
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,345
You looking for Noah, Ms. Benson?

401
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,366
Yeah, where is he?

402
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,323
- There must be some mix up.
- What?

403
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,800
He got checked off for early pickup.

404
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:54,007
Not by me.

405
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:55,117
How could you not know?

406
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:57,314
Two uniformed officers said that
they had authorization for...

407
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,138
No, I didn't send them.

408
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,135
Signed off, Lieutenant
Olivia Benson right there.

409
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,977
- That wasn't me.
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

410
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,460
- Amanda.
- Yeah, Liv.

411
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,555
Amanda, I need you
to put out an all-city alert.

412
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,187
Somebody's taken Noah.

413
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:19,031
No. No, Noah's here.

414
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:21,803
I've got him.
Two unis from the 21st dropped him off.

415
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,149
They said you asked for a pickup.

416
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:26,142
No, I didn't, Amanda.

417
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,629
It was Rob Miller.

418
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,456
It had to be.

419
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:33,641
He... he's sending me a message,
Amanda.

420
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,290
He's sending me a message
that he can take my son

421
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:38,057
whenever he wants.

422
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,295
Just don't let him out
of your eyesight, okay?

423
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:41,514
Okay.

424
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,639
Liv, it's all right. I've got him.

425
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,854
Okay? He's safe.

426
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:02,285
You son of a bitch.

427
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,205
Take it easy. Noah's fine.

428
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:07,204
Stay away from my son.

429
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,641
Or what, you'll shoot me?

430
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,203
Take my advice,

431
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,585
make life easier on yourself.

432
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:13,041
Drop this case.

433
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:14,796
Go to hell.

434
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:24,033
So Rob Miller and Wally Stevens.

435
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,179
Rob Miller stole Nikki Staines' phone,

436
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,577
because he was scared
that Stevens would

437
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,561
implicate him in the underage sex case.

438
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,788
There was nothing on the phone.

439
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,797
The charges against Stevens
were dropped,

440
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:34,930
but that's how we know that

441
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,642
Rob Miller got to Judge Leonard.

442
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,238
Which we also can't prove.
What about the girls?

443
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,213
Well, okay. So, Brooke Davis,

444
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,571
was with Lindsay Parker

445
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,629
the night she was killed.
Brooke ID'd Alex Kay,

446
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,658
who put Miller at a sex party
last September in the Hamptons,

447
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:52,215
but now refuses to testify
against Miller.

448
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,195
So here's my working theory.

449
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:58,578
Rob Miller runs into Lindsay,

450
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:01,801
who just happens to be
his clients' daughter,

451
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,676
at a party Saturday night.

452
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:08,244
Miller panics because he thinks
that Lindsay can ID him.

453
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,602
He gives her a hot shot.

454
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,815
Okay, I know that there are

455
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:15,444
definitely a lot of dots to connect...

456
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:17,611
I'd say that's
an understatement, Lieutenant.

457
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:22,025
He's a man, not a supervillain.

458
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:25,485
He had to have made a mistake.

459
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,035
If he did, I don't see it.

460
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,772
My office, Counselor.

461
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,467
Whose side are you on?

462
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,165
Not Rob Miller's.

463
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:49,981
Doesn't look that way.

464
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,930
You're accusing me of something.

465
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,069
I'm just asking.

466
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,691
I know that Rob Miller is guilty.

467
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:04,301
- How?
- How?

468
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:07,616
Because he had unis pick up
my son from his school.

469
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,413
He was clearly threatening me.

470
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,661
He looked me in the eye and he told me

471
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,688
to drop the case.

472
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:16,291
When were you gonna tell me this?

473
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:19,496
That's irrelevant to the investigation.

474
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:23,360
Olivia, it is completely
relevant to the investigation.

475
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,469
He's threatening Noah.

476
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,974
Anything you find out,

477
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,069
his lawyer will claim

478
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:31,264
you have a personal
vendetta against him.

479
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,747
Peter, I'm worried that
he's going to hurt my son.

480
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:51,569
Rob Miller is a criminal, Peter.

481
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:55,608
He's a rapist, he's a murderer...

482
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:58,443
and we got nothing.

483
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:03,982
And he's gonna get away
with all of this.

484
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,641
Hey.

485
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,511
- Oh.
- Thanks for meeting me.

486
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:25,538
Look, I am only here because you swore

487
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:27,185
you wouldn't ask me to testify.

488
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,392
I'm not.

489
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:30,211
So, what do you want?

490
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,180
Same thing you want,
Rob Miller behind bars.

491
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,051
How the hell are we gonna do that?

492
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,598
We're gonna break a couple of rules.

493
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:20,181
Brooke, you can come on in.
Just leave your stuff there.

494
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,686
Have a seat on the couch.

495
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,700
You got a judge to sign off
on an arrest warrant.

496
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:54,210
- I did.
- With what evidence?

497
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,767
Just trust me.

498
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,023
Do I have a choice?

499
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:00,594
Parkers are here.

500
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,481
- With their lawyer?
- Yeah.

501
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:09,011
- Mr. and Mrs. Parker.
- You have a break in the case?

502
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:11,452
Yes, we have a suspect
in your daughter's murder.

503
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,841
- Who?
- Actually, it's your lawyer.

504
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,889
- What?
- Rob Miller.

505
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:18,936
You're under arrest

506
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:21,241
for the murder of Lindsay Parker.

507
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:24,452
Get him out of here.

508
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,861
So you're just gonna
keep me in the dark?

509
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:36,455
Well, the fisherman
shouldn't worry about

510
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:37,931
what the chef is gonna
do with his catch.

511
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:40,523
I love metaphors, Peter,
but not so much

512
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:44,906
when it involves a
rapist/murderer's day in court.

513
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,296
And even less when
the State's case is...

514
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,611
Circumstantial?

515
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:51,676
Only circumstantial.

516
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,898
For all I know, all we have is
a bunch of arrows

517
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:58,895
on a corkboard signifying
a whole lot of nothing.

518
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:01,656
Do you think Rob Miller raped
Nikki Staines?

519
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,212
Of course.

520
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:04,729
Do you think he murdered
Lindsay Parker?

521
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,653
- You know that I do.
- Good.

522
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,775
You caught the fish,
now let me cook it.

523
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,070
_

524
00:26:17,198 --> 00:26:19,158
At first we thought it was weird,

525
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,554
you know,
partying with old guys, but...

526
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,117
But?

527
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,946
I mean, we could hook up
with guys from our school,

528
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,336
but they don't...

529
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:28,856
They don't give you Birkin bags?

530
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,736
I mean, it's not like
we were whores or anything.

531
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,166
No, no, of course not.

532
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,765
You were 16-year-old girls
who were taken advantage of

533
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,982
by rich, horny old men.

534
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,589
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

535
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,890
And tell me, Miss Davis,
was one of these men,

536
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,110
the defendant?

537
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:46,762
I'm not sure.

538
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,659
I've never seen his face before.

539
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:50,523
So it's just a coincidence,

540
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,068
that you and Mr. Miller ate
lunch at BLT Steakhouse?

541
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:55,186
I've never been to the BLT.

542
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:57,024
That's odd...

543
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,812
because your phone was.

544
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,079
These are GPS records
from two cell phones.

545
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:06,098
Do you recognize the 631 number?

546
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:08,289
Yes, that's my number.

547
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:11,036
Where was your phone located
on Tuesday, May 13th

548
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,906
between 1:17 p.m. and 2:34 p.m.?

549
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,996
106 East 57th Street.

550
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,296
The same place during the same time

551
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:21,630
as the 914 number.

552
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,395
- That's what it looks like.
- Good.

553
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,909
In case you're wondering,

554
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:29,206
that number belongs
to the defendant, Rob Miller.

555
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:32,796
And the location is BLT Steakhouse.

556
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:35,128
The exact one, the same place that

557
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:37,359
you swore you'd never eaten at before.

558
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,186
Now tell me, at that lunch,

559
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,116
did Mr. Miller give you any money?

560
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:43,491
No, I told you.
I've never been to that restaurant.

561
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,932
- This is nonsense.
- Sit, Mr. Miller.

562
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:47,526
Be that as it may,

563
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,556
has Mr. Miller ever given you any cash?

564
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:51,896
No.

565
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,595
Miss Davis...

566
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:57,856
do you recognize this document?

567
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,166
Yes, that's my bank statement.

568
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,516
Direct your attention
to transaction on May 13th.

569
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,013
That's impossible.

570
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:11,272
What happened at 3:40 p.m.
on the 13th, Miss Davis?

571
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:13,928
There was a deposit for $9,500,

572
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:15,655
but I've never had that much cash.

573
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:16,902
I didn't make that deposit.

574
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:18,382
So you didn't deposit the money

575
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,809
on the same day you didn't
have lunch with the defendant?

576
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:22,056
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

577
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:24,537
You know what it looks like
to me, Miss Davis?

578
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:26,698
It looks like Mr. Miller paid you

579
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:28,175
to un-remember his face.

580
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,720
- Objection.
- Sustained.

581
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:34,920
Nothing further.

582
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,036
Let me ask you something, Brooke.

583
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:42,700
Did you ever meet Rob Miller?

584
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,034
No.

585
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:47,651
- Did he ever give you $9,500?
- No way.

586
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,710
Thank you.

587
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,751
No, he's not a member.

588
00:28:58,926 --> 00:29:01,356
As a matter of fact,
I have no idea who he is,

589
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,186
and I've been working
for the club for 27 years.

590
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:05,666
You just let anyone in?

591
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:07,496
No, he was looking for a member,

592
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:09,146
so I said he could wait in the lobby.

593
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:10,848
Which member was he looking for?

594
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:11,996
Mr. Miller.

595
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,583
I've never even seen this guy.

596
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:15,761
That's two strikes, Mr. Miller.

597
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,206
- Now that's him, isn't it?
- Yes.

598
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:22,828
And that's Mr. Miller's guest leaving.

599
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,031
Do you notice anything
different about him?

600
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:28,256
He came in with an envelope,
he left without one.

601
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:31,153
And that was 15 minutes
after Mr. Miller arrived.

602
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:34,803
17, if you look
at the time stamp on the video.

603
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,436
Huh.

604
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:44,129
Mr. Burton, did you actually see.

605
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:47,481
Mr. Miller greet his so-called guest?

606
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:48,655
No.

607
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:52,161
Did you actually see him take

608
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,621
the envelope from his guest?

609
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,026
No.

610
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,144
That's Lamar Jackson.

611
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,973
Have you had occasion
to meet Mr. Jackson?

612
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:04,872
Yeah, he's a con.
I arrested him in 2014.

613
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,967
- For what?
- Selling narcotics.

614
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,895
Have you ever heard of China White?

615
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,293
Yeah, that's the street term
for fentanyl.

616
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,420
That's what he was selling
when I busted him.

617
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,395
Where is Mr. Jackson now?

618
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,067
I wouldn't know.

619
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,637
Would it surprise you
if Mr. Stone asked him

620
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,897
to take the stand?

621
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,167
Nothing surprises me anymore.

622
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:27,647
Well, I'll tell you this much,

623
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:29,997
it'd surprise me,
because that would mean.

624
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,895
Mr. Stone was suborning perjury.

625
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,062
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

626
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:36,817
I have no more questions
for the witness, Your Honor.

627
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,007
The People rest, Your Honor.

628
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,261
Mr. Biegel?

629
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,027
The Defense calls Nikki Staines.

630
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,476
On the afternoon of May 13th,

631
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,148
did you make a visit

632
00:30:58,185 --> 00:30:59,878
to the Commerce Bank of Manhattan?

633
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,082
I did.

634
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,742
You remember how much money
you deposited?

635
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:06,966
It was $9,500.

636
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,613
Into your personal account?

637
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,919
- No.
- No.

638
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:12,127
Because you don't have
an account at Commerce do you?

639
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:14,877
- No.
- I didn't think so.

640
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:18,963
Can you tell me into whose
account you made a deposit?

641
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:21,923
It was Brooke Davis' account.

642
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,419
$9,500. Whoa.

643
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:25,770
Feeling generous, were you?

644
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,909
- Objection.
- Sustained.

645
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:31,895
Ms. Staines, can you tell me
why you would deposit money

646
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,129
into a complete stranger's account?

647
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,731
I was trying to frame your client.

648
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:45,958
Excuse me?

649
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:49,551
I was trying to frame Rob Miller.

650
00:31:57,653 --> 00:31:59,911
I'm speechless, Ms. Staines.

651
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,839
Speechless.

652
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,801
Why would you try to frame
the defendant, Ms. Staines?

653
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:24,826
Because he threatened me.

654
00:32:24,998 --> 00:32:26,438
How did he threaten you?

655
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:29,695
I was in the middle
of a contested custody battle,

656
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:33,741
and Rob Miller had compromising
photos of me

657
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:36,239
that he threatened to turn over
to my ex-husband.

658
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:39,231
And you were scared you would
lose custody of your daughter?

659
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,216
He's evil.

660
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,509
He'll do whatever it takes
to get what he wants

661
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:45,465
no matter who it hurts.

662
00:32:45,552 --> 00:32:47,072
Are you still scared of him?

663
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:50,372
Um, I don't know.

664
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,869
She was completely blacked out.

665
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:00,341
She doesn't remember anything.

666
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,898
What if she does?

667
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:04,341
What if Benson convinces her
to testify?

668
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,539
It'll be taken care of.

669
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:09,529
- How?
- No Nikki, no case.

670
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:11,942
Do you recognize
those voices, Ms. Staines?

671
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,731
That was Chief Dodds and the defendant.

672
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:17,508
Which one of them said,
"No Nikki, no case."?

673
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,392
That was Rob Miller.

674
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,676
I'll ask again.

675
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,645
Are you still scared?

676
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,269
He killed Lindsay Parker, didn't he?

677
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,411
Objection.

678
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:30,700
The jury will disregard
the witness' last statement.

679
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:33,153
In fact, you were so scared
of Rob Miller

680
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,190
that you manufactured
circumstantial evidence

681
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,941
in order to trick the jury
into convicting him.

682
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,621
Yes.

683
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:43,505
You were so scared that
you risked your career

684
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,828
and your freedom to put him in prison.

685
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,489
I have a daughter.

686
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:54,122
He would be a threat to me
for the rest of my life

687
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:56,304
if I didn't do anything.

688
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:21,537
What the hell?

689
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,179
I shouldn't be talking to you.

690
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:28,520
Oh, I see.

691
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,833
Now you worry about ethics.

692
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,179
Haven't you learned by now that people

693
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:36,372
that screw with me typically
don't have happy endings?

694
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,497
Endings I want. Endings I control.

695
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,098
It's called power, Lieutenant.

696
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:42,704
Good night.

697
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,830
I've got it.

698
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,903
You pissants don't comprehend it.

699
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:53,716
You'll see, when the dust settles,

700
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,013
you, your friend Nikki Staines...

701
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,140
You okay, Liv?

702
00:34:57,177 --> 00:35:00,611
Get this piece of dirt away from me.

703
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:03,485
Do not touch me.

704
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,039
A word to the wise, Lieutenant.

705
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,540
You're a tiny fish.

706
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:12,372
Tiny fish always get eaten
by the bigger fish.

707
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:16,715
Like it or not,
it's how the world works.

708
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,861
Somebody's freaking out.

709
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:24,731
You were at the trial?

710
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:27,971
No, but I heard Nikki put on
quite a show.

711
00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:45,700
What, Nikki? What are you doing?

712
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:48,127
Oh, my God, stop it.

713
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,458
What I did, I didn't just do it
for me, you know.

714
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:51,845
Whoa.

715
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:55,017
I would have never agreed to this.

716
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,747
Yeah, that's why we didn't
say anything to you.

717
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,094
"We"? Who's "we"?

718
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:01,403
Stone knew about this?

719
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,149
Christ, Liv.

720
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:06,229
It was his idea.

721
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:23,977
You and Stone tried to frame Miller?

722
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:26,297
Yeah. He is guilty.

723
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:29,500
You could both be disbarred for this.

724
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,657
Oh, God. You know what?

725
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:33,594
There are things that are
more important

726
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:36,591
than a license to tap dance
around a courtroom.

727
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,758
Oh, my God.

728
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:40,353
We've been doing this a long time, Liv.

729
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,687
And we don't say it out loud
or when the lights are on,

730
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:47,031
but there are times in the dark

731
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:51,179
when we whisper, "Sometimes the law's"

732
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:52,956
"just not good enough."

733
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,500
And a threat to my child's
safety is one of those times.

734
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:04,087
At least I won't have to look

735
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:05,719
over my shoulder for
the rest of my life.

736
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,796
Oh, and guess what. Neither will you.

737
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:11,375
No. No.

738
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,094
I am not part of this.

739
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,949
Yeah, you are.

740
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,768
_

741
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,494
Have you reached a verdict?

742
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,283
We have.

743
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,989
What say you?

744
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:43,539
On the sole count of the indictment,

745
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,525
Murder in the Second Degree,

746
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,041
we find the defendant,
Robert Alan Miller,

747
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:50,736
guilty.

748
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:54,073
Wait, what?

749
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,815
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Rob, that can't...

750
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:02,476
Rob. Rob, hold on a sec.

751
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,643
Son of a bitch.

752
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,502
You set me up, you son of a bitch!

753
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:06,783
You set me up!

754
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,300
Order! Order!

755
00:38:23,772 --> 00:38:25,827
I don't even know what to say.

756
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:27,745
Congratulations?

757
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,919
I mean, you won the case

758
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,416
without a single piece of evidence.

759
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:34,564
I proved Miller was a bad guy,

760
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:36,682
and the jury put him away
for that alone.

761
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:38,941
For once the arrow
on the wheel of justice

762
00:38:38,978 --> 00:38:41,604
- stopped at the right place.
- Yeah, with a little help.

763
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:43,385
Everybody needs a little help, Liv.

764
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:45,533
Even me.

765
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:47,355
Actually, you're the one
person who could probably

766
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,111
- make it on her own.
- Okay, well, let's take it easy.

767
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:50,354
We both know that's not true.

768
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:51,768
Yeah, I do, but...

769
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,505
that's not what most
people wanna hear, is it?

770
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:55,938
Peter.

771
00:38:58,451 --> 00:38:59,876
- Thank you.
- Why?

772
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:02,215
Because I put my integrity
and my career

773
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:05,002
and everything I believe in
in jeopardy for a good friend?

774
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,860
Yes. Yes.

775
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:11,752
And I didn't ask for this.

776
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,712
I know you didn't ask for it.
I did it anyway.

777
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,572
I was always gonna do it.

778
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:19,479
I hope you find someone
like that again.

779
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,567
What does that mean?

780
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:23,325
Look at what I just did in there.

781
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,932
Now, I don't regret any of it
for a minute, none of it.

782
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,552
I simply lost perspective.
This is on me.

783
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:32,382
It's a... it's a weakness
and it's a crack

784
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:33,635
in my character.

785
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,135
But the fact is,
you became more important to me

786
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:39,002
than the case I was trying
and that is not me, Liv.

787
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,333
You can look at a case
with an open heart.

788
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,510
I can't do that. I have... no, stop.

789
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:59,619
I have to look
at a case through clear eyes.

790
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,722
- Hold on, hold on.
- I will risk...

791
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:06,072
Stop, just listen. I have to move on.

792
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,332
I have to go or risk
getting blinded again.

793
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,337
Wait.

794
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:14,988
You take care of yourself, Liv.

795

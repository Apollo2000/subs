I wrote that book because
we needed the money.

And you were ashamed.

696

your real name on the book.

And conveniently, they
didn't say anything

until they were charged with
murdering their mother.

Look, you won't have to.
Neither of them will admit it.

You know, it always struck me as odd.

The law says that

a mother has to take care of
her kids when they're young.

they have to take care of
her when she gets old...

or sick.

Rose Edelman got sick, very sick.

00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:42,217
Her doctor said that she
had six months to live.

00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,210
And then she died.

Joe and Ben loved their
mother Rose so much,

they kept her as she was

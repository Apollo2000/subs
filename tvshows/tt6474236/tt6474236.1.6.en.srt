1
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:17,007
Mohamed? Mohamed?

2
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,972
 This is Ayman alZawahiri.

3
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:24,397
Tell the Americans we can take
on the United States.

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,821
The war has only just begun.

5
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:30,284
 Anybody else handle
this device besides you?

6
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:32,371
 I said I locked it up, man.
 Okay.

7
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,125
 What exactly do you want
from me?

8
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:37,549
 I definitely want us
to be more than buddies.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,512
 You've been flagged
for recent expense patterns.

10
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,559
 I'm having dinner and drinks
with important people.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,646
 You need to start living
within your means.

12
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,567
 Sir, your card
has been declined.

13
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,738
 Really?
 There is a chain of command

14
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,575
by which decisions are made.

15
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,038
Your boss has yet to learn
this lesson.

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,419
 Use the chain of command.
It exists for a reason.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,175
In other words, get the hell
out of my office.

18
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,972
 Sanchez, you and Louie
can go fuck yourselves.

19
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:05,395
 By the way, that open slot
heading up the New York office?

20
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:08,986
I just found out Louis Freeh's
D. C. Guy got the job.

21
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,368
Sanchez. One of the best.

22
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,413
Martin, you started this.

23
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,209
Nobody else
at the Agency foresaw

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,671
what's happening with alQaeda.

25
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,716
You are the prophet.

26
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:23,139
You have my undivided devotion,
Martin.

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,185
 They sent a fucking cable

28
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,982
saying that this guy is
coming into our country,

29
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:30,738
that he has a Saudi passport
and a U. S. Visa.

30
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,199
 Welcome to America, sir.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
 53 people
from the CIA have read it,

32
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,581
and we're not sharing this yet?

33
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,501
 Diane will tell us
when we can share.

34
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,380
 I'm calling O'Neill.  Wait.

35
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,673
There's a reason for the wall.
There is a reason.

36
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,448
 They're here.

37
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:54,493
They're here in America.

38
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:57,125
We have no idea
what we're up against.

39
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,930
 We are Muslims.

40
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:10,521
We are Muslims who believe
in their religion,

41
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:13,067
both in ideology and practice,

42
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,615
and hence, we tried our best

43
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,539
to establish this Islamic
state and Islamic society.

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,125
We have sacrificed,

45
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:23,250
and we are still ready
for more sacrifices.

46
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:13,517
Your English is perfect.

47
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,566
 No one is perfect.

48
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,616
 I want to rely on you

49
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,999
to fix things for us in America.

50
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:31,051
 Dr. Zawahiri,
I'm at your service.

51
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:33,725
I will do all that I can.

52
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,735
 This is the world
you're dealing with.

53
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:27,952
This potentially explosive,
dangerous world.

54
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:31,166
Your situation needs to be
handled with discretion.

55
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,670
So long as you're here,

56
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:36,510
Alec Station's been left
in good hands.

57
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:39,307
I believe that.

58
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,313
 I was taught well.

59
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,442
 Let's examine...

60
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,031
You've built an operation
based outside this country.

61
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,369
 That's where all roads lead.
 Away from here.

62
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,789
 Southeast Asia.

63
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,585
 So, take a step back

64
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,254
and look
at the intelligence structure

65
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,551
that you've put together
painstakingly.

66
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,304
Should you hand
over the keys to this house

67
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,809
so soon after its construction?

68
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,938
Do you allow others
to unlock doors,

69
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,071
to poke around,
remove posts and beams?

70
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:11,455
Collapse the intricate
structure that you've erected?

71
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,835
This is the decision
you need to make.

72
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,381
You have the clarity of mind
and sense of purpose

73
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,386
to arrive at the right choice.

74
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,737
 Are you writing a book?

75
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,747
 I'm not sure yet what it is.
Maybe. It may be a book.

76
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,462
 Can I ask what it's about?

77
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,305
 I try to follow
Samuel Clemens' dictum

78
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:04,269
of write what you know.

79
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,440
I don't know much,
but what I do know I know well.

80
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,656
 You know me better
than anyone ever has.

81
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:20,886
 Can I be... I need
to be perfectly honest.

82
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:22,305
 It's okay, I shouldn't  No.

83
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:24,561
 I'm sorry, I
 No, will you please

84
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,948
 Nothing.

85
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,702
Still nothing.

86
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,164
 She's probably trying
to get some answers for you.

87
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:59,212
 Really. You think?  Could be.

88
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:02,468
I don't know why you keep
assuming the worst in people.

89
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:06,060
 I think we saw something
we weren't supposed to see.

90
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,287
 How do you say cunt in Arabic?

91
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,050
 She wants you in her office
in three minutes.

92
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,680
 Three minutes?

93
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,268
Not two? Not four?

94
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,274
 She said three.

95
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,488
 Come.

96
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,498
 You wanted to see
 Close the door.

97
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,810
You are, at times,
on the receiving end

98
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:10,605
of classified intelligence.

99
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,985
 More than 50 people inside
Langley know about Mihdhar.

100
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,905
 You need to understand
something,

101
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,495
and I want you to understand it
deeply and clearly.

102
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,957
You are never the decider

103
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,086
of what to do
with that intelligence.

104
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,048
You may recall a night

105
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,386
when you endeavored to remove
classified materials

106
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,931
from this office.

107
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,144
The Professor
was forgiving enough

108
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:32,315
not to prosecute you.

109
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,239
I am not so forgiving.

110
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,703
When you receive
classified intelligence,

111
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:41,291
either by happenstance
or by design,

112
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,590
if you reveal that intelligence
to anyone outside this Station,

113
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:48,430
intelligence that I have not
personally cleared,

114
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:51,102
I will see to it
that you are handcuffed,

115
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,440
that you are escorted
from this building,

116
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:56,907
that you are imprisoned and
tried for theft and treason.

117
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,373
Now get the fuck
out of my office

118
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,169
and close the door behind you.

119
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,716
 Vince. Thanks for coming by.

120
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:49,970
Good to see you.
 Found it, finally.

121
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:53,393
 You've been up here before.
 I've never been upstairs.

122
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,439
They keep us squirreled
away in the basement.

123
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,527
This whole visitor deal

124
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,405
between the Agency and
the Bureau, there's a reason

125
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,451
we call it the
hostageexchange program.

126
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:05,585
Can I get you a drink?

127
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,215
We just put in a long day

128
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:11,639
keeping America safe.
I think we deserve a scotch.

129
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,770
Yes?  Sure.

130
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:17,776
Has been a long day. Okay.

131
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:20,573
 Are you married, Vince?

132
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,034
In a relationship?

133
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,871
 Not married.

134
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,376
In a, you know,

135
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:28,798
relationship or two.

136
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,846
 I remember those days.

137
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:35,645
Makes it easier.

138
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:39,235
 I'm not following.  Right.

139
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,239
Let me back up.

140
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,287
I'm trying to make some changes
at Alec Station,

141
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,040
and one of them is making sure

142
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,836
that as many operations
as possible are done

143
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:49,798
handinhand with the Bureau.

144
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,052
The best work between
the Agency and the FBI

145
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:54,390
is done on the ground,
out in the field.

146
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,479
And I hate to see
an experienced agent like you

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,360
stuck in a windowless cubicle
day after day.

148
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:03,826
Especially one who speaks,
how many languages? Three?

149
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,412
 Four, actually.

150
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:08,376
Well, including English.

151
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:11,299
 Well, French, Spanish
 And Italian.

152
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,429
 Impressive.

153
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,816
We have an operation
in Morocco next week.

154
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,321
Now, I would be happy
to reach out to your boss,

155
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:25,787
but maybe you should talk
to him yourself.

156
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:29,711
What do you think?

157
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:33,259
 So...

158
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,807
so I wouldn't be
the responsible liaison anymore

159
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,602
between Alec and I49?

160
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,480
 You would gather intel
firsthand,

161
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:43,030
in the field, and pass it
directly to the Bureau.

162
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,250
 Well,

163
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:51,547
I'll tell you
the honest to God truth

164
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:54,385
I'd love to get the hell
out of this office.

165
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,391
Travel a bit, get back
to what I used to do.

166
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:59,689
 I'd like that for you too.

167
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,199
We've reached an understanding?

168
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,138
 How you settling in, boss?

169
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,017
Much better view
than you had in D. C.

170
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,146
 Hello, John. Good to see you.
 You all set up?

171
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,066
I can help find you
an apartment if you need one.

172
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,570
II got people
all over the city.

173
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,239
 I have a realtor looking.

174
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,118
I prefer not to be beholden
to anybody out there

175
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,707
doing me a special favor.
You understand.

176
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,965
 Sure. Sure, of course.
Listen, these are for you.

177
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,802
Welcome to Gotham.

178
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,640
I want to say, um,
you know I've had

179
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,102
had my differences
with Director Freeh.

180
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,190
On occasion with you too.

181
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:46,735
But I hope we can
make a fresh start,

182
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,404
bury the hatchet.

183
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,283
I want you to know
that I'm here to support you.

184
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:53,707
I'm on your team.
You tell me what you need.

185
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,755
 I appreciate that, John.
I really do.

186
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,968
And I'm glad you stopped by.

187
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,888
Would you sit for a sec?

188
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,562
 Yep. Yeah.

189
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:07,067
 A couple of things.

190
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,363
As you can imagine,
I've been briefed

191
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:12,411
on the ongoing investigation
into your finances.

192
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,166
I hope you will continue
to cooperate.

193
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,379
 Yes. Of course.

194
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,091
 On an unrelated note,

195
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:21,220
it's come to my attention
that you're nearing

196
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:23,810
your 25th year at the Bureau.

197
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,783
 This is an unrelated note?
 It's standard procedure.

198
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,498
Mandatory for anybody coming up
on their 25th year.

199
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:38,004
You learn the pension benefits,
health care,

200
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:39,633
a little financial
planning advice,

201
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,471
and you get
a free trip to Florida.

202
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,976
 You know, there's several
guys who are a lot older

203
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,563
than me
floating around the office.

204
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,191
 And they're gonna get
their dates as well.

205
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,736
But this week is for you.

206
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,573
 Things are pretty busy
this week.

207
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,245
 It's mandatory.

208
00:17:57,251 --> 00:18:00,256
 All right.
I can visit Space Mountain.

209
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:02,220
 Whatever works for you.

210
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,524
 It's good talking to you.

211
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,778
Welcome to New York.
Congrats on the promotion.

212
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,406
See you at the end of the week.

213
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,703
 John.

214
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,709
I appreciate the gift.
I really do, but I don't smoke.

215
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,714
You'll get more use
out of these than I will.

216
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,020
 I'm not replacing these
with a heartshaped box

217
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,066
of chocolates, if that's
what you're looking for.

218
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,450
 Understood. I don't eat
much chocolate anyway.

219
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,036
 I bet you don't.

220
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,667
 And John.
Those aren't Cubans are they?

221
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:42,299
'Cause last I checked, we still
have an embargo with Castro.

222
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,222
 No clue. I was regifting.

223
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,502
 So, the good news for y'all,

224
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:02,840
given that you've passed
that 20year mark,

225
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,305
given that you're coming up
on year 25yay

226
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,267
is that you're moving
from the possibility

227
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,733
of halfpay retirement
into threequarters pay,

228
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,946
which is as high
as you're gonna get.

229
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:15,365
Y'all have reached

230
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,246
the mountaintop, people.
Enjoy the view.

231
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:19,833
Also, completely separate...
 Yeah.

232
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,295
Hey, guess
who's almost done packing?

233
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,132
 Packing? Packing for what?

234
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,638
 You shut up.
You know for what.

235
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,474
And I'm gonna get there
in New York City

236
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,855
and I'm gonna break out my
stash of Victoria's Secret,

237
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:34,236
and I'm gonna blow
your freakin' mind.

238
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,365
 Wait. Is it Mom?

239
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,160
 Johnny.

240
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,039
You're disgusting.

241
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,335
Don't you pretend
you don't know who this is.

242
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:44,506
Don't you pretend you
haven't been crying yourself

243
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:48,139
to sleep every night just
waiting for me to get there.

244
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,934
I hope you're clearing
space in your dresser

245
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,646
for my new panties.

246
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,907
 Don't worry. They're
teeny, teeny tiny, Johnny.

247
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,535
 Darling, listen,
I got you a sweet apartment

248
00:19:58,536 --> 00:19:59,829
for the time being.

249
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,875
 You what?

250
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,502
I thought I was
moving in with you.

251
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,923
 No, no. Not just yet.
Not right now.

252
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,676
I've got some linguists
staying with me.

253
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:09,139
 You what?  Some linguists.

254
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,061
Doing some translating.

255
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,392
Security.
I need to talk to security.

256
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:53,854
 Yes, sir. Can I ask your room?

257
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,816
 Now.  Yes, sir.

258
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:58,320
Um, yes, we need someone
at the front desk right away.

259
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,492
Okay, thank you.

260
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:07,757
 Three hours. It's out
of my hands for three hours.

261
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,969
 Okay.

262
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,057
 Found it in a dumpster
around back.

263
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,896
 So what's missing?

264
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,985
 Cash. 500 bucks. Cigar cutter.

265
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,822
 The gold one?  Yeah.

266
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:22,494
 And what about
the classified papers?

267
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:25,793
 All there. There.

268
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:28,549
But...  What?

269
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:33,850
 Nothing. It... Itit seems
like they weren't messed with.

270
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:36,271
It seems like...

271
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:37,858
simple robbery.

272
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,695
 But there's no way
to tell for sure.

273
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,282
 No.

274
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:47,461
So...

275
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,393
Do I tell him?

276
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:57,815
 Um, John. I...

277
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,735
I'm an English Professor.
I'm not

278
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,656
 You're an ethical person.
You're a logical thinker.

279
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:03,786
Help me out.

280
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,754
 Okay.

281
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,809
I think there are two issues.

282
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,567
The first is the moral one.
You broke the rules.

283
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:24,117
So you decide whether it's
important to turn yourself in.

284
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:27,040
The second issue
what if something happens

285
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,171
as a result of the documents
being read?

286
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:34,931
They weren't taken,
but they might have been read.

287
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:36,976
I don't know what's in them,

288
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:40,652
but I assume they're classified
for a reason.

289
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:45,787
Am I right?

290
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,796
John?

291
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:10,501
 John. Thanks for coming in.

292
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,339
Go ahead, Mike.

293
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:19,645
 We dusted the entire case,
inside and out.

294
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:23,319
Several distinct, identifiable
fingerprints on the exterior,

295
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,199
including yours, Mr. O'Neill,
your secretary's,

296
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,788
two members
of the hotel security staff,

297
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,586
and one other we didn't have
in the database.

298
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:33,088
As for the classified documents,

299
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,884
we found two sets of prints

300
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:38,808
yours and your secretary's.

301
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,564
 I looked at the forensics
and the criminal report,

302
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:43,484
and we feel it's safe to assume

303
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,446
that this is a simple case
of robbery.

304
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,377
Thank you...

305
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,255
All right, all right.

306
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:55,801
Well, I hope we can...

307
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,389
hope we can put this to bed
now and move on.

308
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,270
Keep it internal,
within the New York Office.

309
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,037
 John...

310
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,668
can you tell us what happened
a few months ago

311
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,297
with your Palm Pilot?

312
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:16,717
 Excuse me?

313
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:18,220
 It's come to our attention

314
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,974
that it was out
of your possession

315
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,936
for a period of time
and that it was returned to you

316
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:23,565
by a D. C. Transit cop.

317
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,359
 Who brought it
to your attention?

318
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,196
 That's not important.

319
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,367
 It's important to me.
It's my personal device.

320
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,704
It's none of your business

321
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,373
whether it was out
of my possession.

322
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,294
 I think it's fairly clear,
that given what was

323
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:36,549
in your briefcase, you're
not terrific at separating

324
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,889
the professional
from the personal.

325
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,310
Mike's gonna have to inspect it,

326
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,899
make sure there's
no classified contacts,

327
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,239
determine whether anything
was electronically copied.

328
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:57,216
 Have fun.

329
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:04,312
You done with this?

330
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:06,651
 Yes, sir. I am.
 You sureyou sure?

331
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,071
 Yes, sir.

332
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,556
 Nice shoes, man.
What the fuck?

333
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:24,060
 Boss wasn't crazy about
what I was wearing before.

334
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,149
 Ferragamos, dude?
For moving furniture?

335
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,028
 They're weirdly comfortable.

336
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,535
 Tell me about it,
I got six pair.

337
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,374
 And I was working today.

338
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,378
I didn't have time to change

339
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,842
into my designer track suit
and Air Pippens.

340
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:42,556
 Shit. You bustin' on me,
you little bitch?

341
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,100
Finally get a day off Langley,

342
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,522
you bustin' my chops
about my clothes?

343
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:48,526
 No, it's a good look.
Works for you.

344
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:50,279
 You're fucking right it does.

345
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,824
And they're Pippen 2s,
you cocksucker.

346
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,828
 My God, you guys,
thank you so much.

347
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:55,540
You're the greatest.
It's one flight up.

348
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,293
On the right hand side.

349
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:58,796
Johnny was supposed to be here.
 We got it, Sheri.

350
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,215
 I don't know where he is.
 It's all good.

351
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,597
-  He's here?
-  Yeah.

352
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,400
 John!

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,864
You're here.

354
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:14,369
You're here.  Yeah, baby.

355
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,955
I missed you.

356
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,836
I missed you, I missed you.
I miss

357
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:20,757
I missed you so much.

358
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,719
You're not even tan,
weren't you in Florida?

359
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,682
 Yeah, yeah.
 God, I missed you.

360
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,727
How are you?  I'm perfect.

361
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:30,568
Everything's perfect.
Especially now.

362
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,698
Have become the second catcher

363
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:34,033
on this ball club...

364
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,704
 Elaine. Hey, Elaine.

365
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:37,081
Hey, turn this bullshit off,
will you?

366
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:38,250
We got the Mets playing.

367
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:39,878
 You're in Manhattan, Gordo.

368
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,674
We watch the Yankees
in Manhattan.

369
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,343
 You tell him, Elaine.

370
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,180
 Get yourself to Flushing,
you want the Mets.

371
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,143
 Yeah, I might just go to
Flushing, cheaper beers there,

372
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:48,771
that's for sure.
 But then of course,

373
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:51,611
you walk outside,
you're in Flushing.

374
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:59,543
 I thought you said
his girlfriend's name was Liz?

375
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:02,966
 The one I met was named Liz.

376
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,638
-  Are they still together?
-  No...

377
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,978
 What does that mean?
 It means I work with the guy.

378
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,192
I don't question
his personal life.

379
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,948
 You spend most of your time
with him.

380
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,744
You travel with him.
 Yeah, Heather.

381
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,248
I love these guys.
I'd trust them with my life.

382
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,419
But we don'twe're
not the same.

383
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,300
We don't all want
the same things.

384
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,637
 So tell me.

385
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:29,101
 Tell you what?
 Tell me what you want.

386
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:31,356
 This.

387
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:33,360
 A blonde girl?
 That blonde girl.

388
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,447
 Not too many of those
in Beirut?

389
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,911
 Not too many Arabs
in small town Ohio.

390
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:40,207
 So we're both exotics?

391
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,877
 I'm attracted
to the difference.

392
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,090
I can admit it.

393
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:46,637
 Okay.

394
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:49,350
 But that's not what really
draws me in.

395
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,605
 What draws you in?

396
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,151
 Where we connect.

397
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:56,240
 Where's that? .

398
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,203
Here...

399
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:02,001
and here...

400
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:03,879
and there.

401
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:07,344
 Nah, I'm telling you,
I miss it.

402
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:08,723
 Really?  All the time.

403
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:10,142
 Upstate New York?  Yeah.

404
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,104
 What the hell is there
to do up there?

405
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:14,526
 What is there to do?
Well, II used to fish.

406
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,154
I mean, there's
a beautiful stream

407
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:17,824
down the hill from my house.

408
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,663
I'd camp on the weekends.
 Like out in the woods?

409
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,458
 Yeah, out in the woods.
 Like sleeping on the ground

410
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:24,170
in the woods?  Yeah.

411
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,757
What? You've never gone camping?

412
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:28,011
 No, buddy, I have not.
 Well, I will take you

413
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,640
camping some time.
 No, no, Floyd.

414
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,351
 You're gonna love it.
 No, I'm from Queens.

415
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,314
We don't do woods.

416
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,367
 I guess they think
I'm doing a good job.

417
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:42,707
So they want to move me up,
make me operational.

418
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,379
I'm telling you, boss,
if it's cool with you,

419
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,550
it'd be great to get
out of that office.

420
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:52,267
Fucking Alec Station, man,
it's like toxic down there.

421
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:55,190
Like they  Shut up.

422
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,654
 What?  Shut the fuck up.

423
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:00,117
You out of your fucking mind?

424
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,622
 Boss, I think, and they think,

425
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:04,333
I could actually be
more effective

426
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:06,421
 They don't want
to send you abroad

427
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:08,801
because they value you.

428
00:29:08,802 --> 00:29:12,391
They want you overseas so you
trip over your own balls.

429
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:15,398
So if something goes wrong,
they can blame it on you.

430
00:29:19,114 --> 00:29:21,409
Hey.

431
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,998
 What are you talking about?

432
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:27,881
 Come on, who are you to them?

433
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,135
You're me.

434
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,722
You're my eyes and my ears.

435
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:35,395
That's why they don't want you
over there.

436
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,692
Because I trust you to tell me

437
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,654
what's going on
in that basement.

438
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,284
To get your hands on the intel,
pass it on to me

439
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:45,499
so I can act on it.

440
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,216
They want you gone so they
don't have to deal with me.

441
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,563
 I understand.

442
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:59,736
 You understand?  I do.

443
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:01,240
I understand.

444
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:06,457
 Vince.

445
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:10,298
They're on me.

446
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,887
Feel like they're trying
to force me out.

447
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:16,310
 Why?  I don't know.

448
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:18,775
 What's going on?
 I don't fucking know.

449
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,116
You get your ass on
that train tomorrow morning,

450
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:25,329
go back to Virginia,
and do your job.

451
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,509
You do your job.
You find out what they know.

452
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,599
Then tell me.

453
00:34:13,745 --> 00:34:16,416
 Walla?

454
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:28,477
 Walla.

455
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:59,997
 Zoom.  "Zohm."

456
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,126
 Zohm? "Zooom."

457
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,591
-  Zoom.
- Zoom.

458
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,560
 Walla.

459
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,690
 Walla.

460
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:06,391
 Walla.

461
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:08,563
 Hey!

462
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:24,626
And over
a dozen are unaccounted for.

463
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,255
An attack took place today
as the USS "Cole"

464
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,011
was in port near
the port city of Aden.

465
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:32,935
The battleship, a navy
missileguided destroyer...

466
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:36,232
En route to the Persian Gulf.

467
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,779
A small boat
with two or three men aboard

468
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,739
approached the navy ship.

469
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,045
Destroying much
of the engine room.

470
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:49,299
The explosion was
just below the mess deck

471
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,345
where dozens of sailors
were lining up

472
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:52,765
for lunch in the galley.

473
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:53,935
Reports are...

1
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,830
<i>Quem hodierna die rebus humanis eximi,</i>

2
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,730
<i>et ad te accersire iussisti,</i>

3
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,390
<i>blande et misericorditer suscipias,</i>

4
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,290
<i>non ei dominentur umbrae mortis,</i>

5
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,820
<i>nec tegat eum chaos et caligo</i>

6
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,170
<i>tenebrarum sed exutus
omnium criminum labe...</i>

7
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,140
<i>In sinu abrahae patriarchae collocatus,</i>

8
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,380
<i>locum lucis et refrigerii...</i>

9
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,830
Look!

10
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,660
He's come back to us!

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,150
Go. Go.

12
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,120
Who are you burying
in such fine style?

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Your brother.

14
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,350
How did he die?

15
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,150
No one knows.

16
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,740
It was so sudden, Alfred.

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,290
He...

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
One moment, he was well
and then he collapsed and...

19
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,230
It was terrible.

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,470
I can't believe this.

21
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,170
Thank God you've recovered.

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,170
We were so scared
to lose the both of you.

23
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,710
Hail and farewell, my brother.

24
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,160
Hail and farewell.

25
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,410
Father!

26
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,960
Father! Father!

27
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,410
My son!

28
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,180
My son! Oh, my son!

29
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,250
Father.

30
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,460
- My son!
- My boy!

31
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Oh!

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,990
Helgi!

33
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,100
Ketill, my friend.

34
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,960
Come. Come!

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,350
You see how I am! Come!
Let me thank you.

36
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,590
Oh, thank the gods!

37
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,040
You have saved us.

38
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,730
You had no cause to do it,
but you have done it.

39
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,460
Floki was right.

40
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,360
We have all changed!

41
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,640
My friend.

42
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,310
I wish we had something
to celebrate with!

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,380
Oh, we do.

44
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,070
So let's celebrate.

45
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,880
Thank you.

46
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,960
My people, you are
all welcome to the table.

47
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,520
It is important to us

48
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,860
that everyone here
feels involved

49
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,240
in the life of our great town.

50
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,730
Kattegat has grown.

51
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,460
It is now a huge
trading station,

52
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,320
the greatest trading station
in Scandinavia.

53
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,080
Kattegat has changed
since my father's time.

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,980
In those days, he knew everyone

55
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,400
and he was happy
to share his power

56
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,820
with those he knew
and trusted, of course.

57
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,170
My father gave me
this responsibility.

58
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,450
And our father, Odin,

59
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,340
gave me this responsibility.

60
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,210
I have accepted it,
and I ask you to trust me.

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,970
We cannot allow everyone to vote

62
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,630
on everything
which affects our kingdom.

63
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,290
We have a duty to protect it!

64
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,670
I have a duty to protect it!

65
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,470
So...

66
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,720
We have to change the rules.

67
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,180
What are you doing?

68
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,110
Packing your things, my dear.

69
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Your husband is dead.

70
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,590
You've no reason to remain here,

71
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,250
unless, of course,
you are with child?

72
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,290
Otherwise, you must return
home to your mother.

73
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,540
I really am very sorry.

74
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,710
I don't think
you are sorry at all.

75
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,060
I think that you control
everything that happens here.

76
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,960
If only that were true.

77
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,860
You don't seem very sorry
that my husband, and your son,

78
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,200
died so suddenly,

79
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,830
and I don't know
what to make of that.

80
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,730
You don't need
to make anything of that,

81
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,730
my dear child.

82
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,800
Life is complicated enough.

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,940
And you are young enough
to find another husband.

84
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,600
Well, then, I hope his mother
is nothing like you!

85
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,230
My dear, he should be so lucky.

86
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,090
People I trust

87
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,690
will vote on land issues,
matrimonial matters,

88
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,860
murder inquiries,

89
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,900
things that you do not
need to worry about.

90
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,280
Because I will take care of you.

91
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,350
I will lead you!

92
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,010
No, what is truly important
is to know who we are!

93
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,740
And who is with us,
and who is against us.

94
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,570
And we know
who we are, don't we?

95
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes!

96
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,540
Yes, we do!

97
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,920
So now it is time to find out
those who threaten us,

98
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,540
who is against us.

99
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,200
Maybe it is your neighbor.

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,070
Perhaps it is someone you know.

101
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,720
A family member.

102
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,350
A brother.

103
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
A son.

104
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,770
They talk about me.

105
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,630
They whisper
that I am the enemy.

106
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,330
But, of course,
they are the enemy.

107
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,880
They want to destroy
our kingdom.

108
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,960
They want to encourage
our enemies to attack us

109
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,340
and invade us!

110
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,610
Is that what you want?

111
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,720
No!

112
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,410
Do you want me to protect you?

113
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
Yes!

114
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you want me to destroy them?

115
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,240
Yes!

116
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Yes!

117
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,310
Yes!

118
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Yes!

119
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,600
Odin! Ivar!
Odin! Ivar! Odin! Ivar!

120
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,060
Why is Elsewith not here?

121
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,310
And Ethelfled?

122
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,930
I thought we should talk.

123
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,620
You and I.

124
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,350
It's not been easy
since you fell sick.

125
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,700
I had to deal with the traitors.

126
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,730
They were still plotting
against you.

127
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,150
Perhaps they still are.

128
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
And...

129
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,050
I had to deal with your brother.

130
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,330
My brother?

131
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,060
What exactly does that mean?

132
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,000
It means...

133
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,620
His death wasn't natural.

134
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,010
You had better explain.

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,670
And quickly!

136
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,600
He had plotted
against you before, Alfred.

137
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,680
He told me. He confessed.

138
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,990
And then he said he would
never plot against you again,

139
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,540
but I satisfied myself
he was lying.

140
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I knew, as long as he was alive,

141
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,790
he would do anything,

142
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,590
join any plot, any conspiracy

143
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,040
that promised to make him King.

144
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,740
He thought you had usurped him.

145
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,500
And he could never,
ever forgive you.

146
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,710
So?

147
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,440
I poisoned him.

148
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,450
I killed one of my sons...

149
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,310
To save the other.

150
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,420
May God forgive me.

151
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,220
Can we talk now?

152
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,610
You have woken from a long sleep

153
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,300
and seem to have forgotten
that you're a king.

154
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,960
You are behaving

155
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,510
as if you were
an ordinary person.

156
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,520
You grieve as if you were
an ordinary person!

157
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,620
You show your feelings

158
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,310
as if you were
an ordinary person!

159
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,070
But all of that must stop!

160
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,910
A king

161
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,080
cannot be
like an ordinary person.

162
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,160
Must not behave or have feelings

163
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,880
like an ordinary person.

164
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,480
A king must be prepared to do
the most terrible things.

165
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,170
Things against all conscience...

166
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,350
If he wants to survive.

167
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,820
You saw them.

168
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,920
Saw who?

169
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,580
Hvitserk.

170
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,130
And that girl.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,380
He hates me.

172
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,720
I ought to have him killed.

173
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,590
If I can order the death
of my own brother,

174
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,700
then who else will dare
stand against me?

175
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,530
I think that would be a mistake.

176
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,680
Why?

177
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,650
Ivar, you are a god.

178
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,100
And a merciful god

179
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,960
will always be more popular
among the common people

180
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
than a vengeful god, like Odin.

181
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,700
Wouldn't you rather
be loved than feared?

182
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,220
I don't know.

183
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,990
I'm not sure.

184
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,020
Why aren't you getting ready?

185
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,920
We have to leave.

186
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,550
Yes, Floki. We are ready.

187
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,970
Come on, you old witch.

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,940
What? Why did you say that?

189
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,700
Because it's true.

190
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,800
You're a witch and a murderess,

191
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,250
and you deserve to die.

192
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,810
What are you doing?

193
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,430
Stop!

194
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,950
Don't you worry, Floki!

195
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,400
We're doing this for love!

196
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,370
For the love of my brother
and sister!

197
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,370
No! No!

198
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,610
Stop this now!

199
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,990
Don't move, Floki!

200
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,720
Stop!
Don't touch her!

201
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,060
She never killed anyone!

202
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,280
Ketill, this is madness!

203
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,630
No! I've thought about this
a long time, Floki!

204
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,420
Please!

205
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,500
I should have known!

206
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,360
Always the good man!

207
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,850
Arse-licker!

208
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,850
I should have known

209
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,780
you were more ambitious than me!

210
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,060
My only ambition is revenge!

211
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,380
Ketill.

212
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,030
Leave Eyvind and Helgi outside.

213
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,970
Let's deal with them
in the morning.

214
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,440
Sorry to startle you.

215
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,550
But I've been thinking about you,

216
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,620
my dear brother.

217
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,100
What have you been thinking?

218
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,350
I have been thinking...

219
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,590
That you can make yourself
more useful to me.

220
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,730
It concerns me that
you have no proper role here.

221
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,700
That you live
such an empty and idle life.

222
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,880
After all, you're my brother
and I love you.

223
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,470
So how could I
make myself useful?

224
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,610
You could leave Kattegat.

225
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,060
Go on a diplomatic trip

226
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,140
to the Great Hall
of King Olaf the Stout,

227
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,620
and cement our alliance,
help him prepare

228
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,040
for our springtime attacks
on York and Wessex.

229
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,730
And if I refuse?

230
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,250
I don't want to leave Kattegat.

231
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm afraid you cannot refuse.

232
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,090
What is your name?

233
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,750
Thora.

234
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,820
Thora.

235
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,930
My brother has been remiss
in not introducing us.

236
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
He seems very fond of you.

237
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,520
We love each other.

238
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,420
Hmm.

239
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,210
That is good.

240
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,010
That is good, Hvitserk.

241
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,150
Then it would be a pity
if I had to burn her alive.

242
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,320
You wouldn't do that, brother...

243
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,050
Now, would you?

244
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,270
No. No, I wouldn't.

245
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,270
Not if you agree
to leave Kattegat

246
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,790
first thing in the morning.

247
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,280
Hmm?

248
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,270
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,340
I'm sorry I brought them here.

250
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,830
I didn't know.

251
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,660
Don't snivel.

252
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,530
What difference does it make?

253
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,770
We're all just meat.

254
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,190
It all goes to nothing.

255
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't understand.

256
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,510
Of course you do.

257
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,790
Do you really suppose
I could forgive them?

258
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,590
I thought it was possible.

259
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,870
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have come all the way here.

260
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,700
You had me
believing again, Ketill.

261
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,740
We are what we are, Floki.

262
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,360
And the gods have made us so.

263
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,580
You can't kill Helgi.

264
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,240
None of this is his fault.

265
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,800
He loved your daughter
and he's a good man.

266
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,180
Spare him, at least.

267
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,080
Maybe I will, Floki.

268
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
If Helgi is still alive
in the morning,

269
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,980
we could consider saving him.

270
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,570
I agree. It would make us
all feel better.

271
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,060

00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,080
Look at her!

280
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,150
Yes.

281
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,130
- King Harald.
- Who's next?

282
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,440
Bjorn Ironside.

283
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,030
Come on!

284
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,410
We need to make a plan.

285
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,830
I am growing impatient.

286
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,800
You don't mean to sail

287
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,560
at this time
of the year, surely?

288
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,460
That is exactly
what I intend to do.

289
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,670
Ivar will not be
expecting our arrival.

290
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,540
At this time of the year,
there are many storms at sea.

291
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,990
Are you telling me you have
no fear of these storms?

292
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,920
That you cannot imagine
that our fleet will flounder?

293
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
I have no doubt that
we will have safe passage.

294
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,270
How can you be so sure?

295
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,590
My father told me.

296
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,520
Your father?

297
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,010
You mean Ragnar?
Ragnar told you?

298
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Yes. He spoke to me
in a dream.

299
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't you ever dream?

300
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,710
Hail Gunnhild!

301
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,690
Your father loved Ivar.

302
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,790
Everyone knows that.
He chose Ivar.

303
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,900
He chose me.

304
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,550
I'm his eldest son.

305
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,450
Kattegat belongs to me.

306
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,590
Huh.

307
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,870
I had an arrangement
with Ivar that,

308
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,980
after his death,
I would be King of Kattegat.

309
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,090
Hmm. Well, then we will make
the same arrangement.

310
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,610
Easy for you to say, Bjorn.

311
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,030
But what can you swear on
to persuade me to believe you?

312
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,100
My sacred arm ring, of course.

313
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,010
And then on the life
of my intended wife, Gunnhild.

314
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,010
She must agree
and swear to the gods

315
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,980
that once I die,
you will become King.

316
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,810
Whether or not
she will want to marry you

317
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,610
will be of no further
consequence to me.

318
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,780
I'll be dead.

319
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,200
But for now, King Harald...

320
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,440
You must give the orders

321
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,340
and start preparing your ships.

322
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,790
What an exciting world
we live in.

323
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,140
What an exciting world!

324
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,150
You will have your ships,
Bjorn Ironside.

325
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,720
<i>♪ Up onto the overturned keel ♪</i>

326
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,170
<i>♪ Clamber with heart of steel ♪</i>

327
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,350
<i>♪ Cold is the ocean's spray ♪</i>

328
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,350
<i>♪ And your death is on its way ♪</i>

329
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,010
<i>♪ And your death is on its way ♪</i>

330
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,550
Lower your head, old man.

331
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,140
The ax is coming.

332
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,860
Don't be afraid.

333
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,210
I am not afraid.

334
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,640
Move! Move!

335
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,400
Move!

336
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,070
Floki.

337
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,740
I want to live.

338
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,670
I have never done
anything against Ketill.

339
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,570
I was always more on his side
than Eyvind's.

340
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,160
And surely he knows that?

341
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,920
He does know it.

342
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,130
Come outside, Helgi.

343
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,930
<i>♪ Be strong ♪</i>

344
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,930
<i>♪ Though rain beats down ♪</i>

345
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,730
<i>♪ Upon your balding crown ♪</i>

346
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,940
<i>♪ With maidens you had your way ♪</i>

347
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,150
<i>♪ Each must die some day ♪</i>

348
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,360
<i>♪ And each must die someday ♪</i>

349
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,000
Out of the way!

350
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,360
My Lord,

351
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,010
the ships of a large Viking army

352
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,670
have been seen in West Wales.

353
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,840
If they continue their course,

354
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,910
they will arrive at our borders

355
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,950
within a matter of days.

356
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,540
Summon a witan.

357
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Who are they?

358
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,140
We think they are Danes.

359
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,350
They've sailed from their base
in Dublin across to Cornwall

360
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,040
with at least 300 ships.

361
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,150
Hmm.

362
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,180
You've talked to the witan.

363
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,050
You've talked to your nobles.
Are they prepared?

364
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,700
How many warriors
can they put on the field?

365
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,910
About 2,000.

366
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,810
The Danes will have
a thousand more warriors.

367
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,780
I will ride myself
at the head of the army

368
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,580
to inspire our forces.

369
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,300
I also believe that I have
some good commanders.

370
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,410
The Danes won't be frightened

371
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,550
to see you at the head of the army,

372
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,140
believe me.

373
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,650
And why do you say that?

374
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,760
I have a terrible habit
of telling the truth.

375
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,770
Very well.

376
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,570
Then what do you advise?

377
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,780
I advise you make me
the head of your army.

378
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,230
I think you should listen to me.

379
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,710
Words are fine,
but they don't win battles.

380
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,170
If you make me
the head of the army,

381
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,130
I will find a way of dealing
with the Danes.

382
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,620
Otherwise, you have no hope.

383
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,160
Why do you sneak up on me?

384
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
Why do you stay in the shadows?

385
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,480
You're a king.

386
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,480
What do you want to say?

387
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,420
I just, um...

388
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,560
Wanted to remind you that
fate has brought us together.

389
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,020
You yourself said as much...

390
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,880
While you were still married.

391
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,540
I said I knew my life
was going to change.

392
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,750
And so it has.

393
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,580
I am no longer the person I was.

394
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,900
We are always the same.

395
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,280
We just pretend to change.

396
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,220
I see that Bjorn Ironside
has claimed you.

397
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,150
You are mistaken.

398
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,950
No man will ever claim me.

399
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,680
I prefer to think that the gods

400
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,540
have you and me in mind.

401
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,580
I don't know about the gods.

402
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,210
What do you have in mind, then?

403
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,590
Do you still want to be
King of all Norway?

404
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,630
My ambition has never changed.

405
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,050
Well, then...

406
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,020
I should like to be Queen.

407
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,120
My Lady?

408
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,460
What were you doing?

409
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,880
It doesn't matter.

410
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,810
It really doesn't matter.

411
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,450
Father!

412
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Father!

413
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,700
What happened?

414
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,670
Floki, tell me what happened.

415
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Take this.

416
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
Floki!

417
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,190
They killed them all.

418
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,960
All of them.

419
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,750
Your father and your brother...

420
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,060
They killed them all.

421
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,210
- They wanted revenge.
- No.

422
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,520
And they had planned it
a long time.

423
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,110
No.

424
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,280
I couldn't stop them.

425
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,220
No.

426
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,630
I can't believe it.

427
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,360
What about Helgi?

428
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,540
No, please,

429
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,780
surely they couldn't have
killed him. Please.

430
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,090
All of them.

431
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,720
Helgi too.

432
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,680
I pleaded with them.

433
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
I asked your father
to spare him, but...

434
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,860
No.

435
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,380
- I'm sorry, Aud.
- No.

436
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,380
No, please, no,
they couldn't have.

438
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,560
Sorry, Aud.

439
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,010
I should never have
brought you all to this place.

440
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,750
You didn't even really
see the gods, did you?

441
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,260
When you come back
we should get married.

442
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,390
Yes.

443
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,740
We will have lots of children.

444
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,810
You won't be idle anymore.

445
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,750
Oh, I won't be idle
even before that,

446
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,130
believe me.

447
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,750
What do you mean?

448
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,200
You scare me.

449
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,000
It means that I have
come to a decision.

450
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,410
It has taken a long time,

451
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,000
but I know
it's the right choice.

452
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,660
What have you decided?
Tell me, please.

453
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,390
I can't tell you.
It would be too dangerous.

454
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,600
Farewell, my love.

455
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,050
And be careful.

456
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,150
- Yes?
- Mmm-hmm.

457
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,570
Be careful of my brother.

458
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,350
King Harald is in love with you.

459
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,350
I know.

460
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,080
Did he tell you?

461
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,360
Yes.

462
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,190
He has told me that
we are fated to be together.

463
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,230
Mmm.

464
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,710
Do you really believe that?

465
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,610
Who knows our fate? Do you?

466
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,280
He still wants to be
King of Norway.

467
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,520
Ah.

468
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,390
And it seems he puts
the highest value on love.

469
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,290
He is a man who always
wants to be in love.

470
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,570
I would like to have his heart
instead of mine.

471
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,260
Why do you say that?

472
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,440
Well, I've had many women.

473
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,750
But I am not sure
I have ever been in love.

474
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,720
And you are not in love with me?

475
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,820
Ah, I don't know.

476
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,590
I think about you all the time.

477
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,900
When I am thinking about
something else

478
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,250
and then
I think about you again.

479
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,770
And it happens day and night.

480
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,630
Why are you telling me this?

481
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
I don't know.
Perhaps I am in love.

482
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,300
What if you don't love me?

483
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,300
What if you love King Harald?

484
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,130
He could make you
the Queen of Norway.

485
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,060
I suppose he could try.

486
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,140
I am afraid.

487
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
I am afraid to ask you
if you love me.

488
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,630
You are one of the most
famous men in the world.

489
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,020
And you're afraid of me?

490
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,880
I am alone.

491
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,230
Alone, naked, and afraid.

492
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,930
You know something?

493
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,100
I respect you even more
for saying that.

494
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,560
And I will take your words

495
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,280
and lock them away
in my heart forever.

496
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,620
Say it.

497
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,800
Say it.

498
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,530
Say it.

499
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,320
Say it.

500
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,540
Say it.

501
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,060
I love you.

502
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,920
Yes.

503

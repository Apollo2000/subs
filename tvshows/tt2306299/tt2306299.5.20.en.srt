We followed your orders

and appointed an earl
in every district

They collect taxes and fines.

-So?
-[scout] We saw two armies

18
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,714
marching together.
One was led by Bjorn Ironside

19

and King Harald Finehair.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,134
You recognized them?

21
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,275
And the other army, by a King
or earl we did not recognize.

22
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:19,656
Together with someone
we did recognize.

23
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,175
My brother, Hvitserk.

24

Yes, my King.

00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:28,217
And you are completely sure?

Don't you think that's good,
Freydis?

My fellow gods at last

Perhaps we should negotiate
with him.

No. No.

37
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,450
My brother is right.

38
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,144
Never again will we negotiate
with Ivar.

39

You were between life

What did that teach you?

46
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,060
The only thing that I've learned

47
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,305
is that life

48
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,893
is about suffering.

49
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,621
There's no escape from it.

50
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,555
That's the truth.

51
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,214
What's important

52
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,873
is how we deal with suffering,

How do I tell my children that
life is all about suffering?

out for themselves.

with gore.

And then the warriors
and all the gods in Valhalla

will bear arms

78

the wolf

86
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,160
will swallow All-Father.

87

then what future do we have?

They have great plans,

yes, but those plans do not
involve you.

You, the ordinary folk
of Kattegat.

I am the only one
who speaks for you.

00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:22,132
And I have never had children.

347
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,102
Do you want children?

348
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,140
It's what my body was made for.

349
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,802
Except to give pleasure
to me and to men.

You are an extraordinary woman,
Gunnhild.

352
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,157
I am just like any other woman.

353
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,850
I don't want to "have"
to do anything.

354

I don't want to be trapped.

I want to fight.

And I want to ride wild horses.

even though I want us
to be in love.

I'm crazy, right?

360
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,947
I had an idea you might be.

00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,224
It didn't put you off?

362
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:27,093
Listen, I want to have sex.

363
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,202
I might die tomorrow.

364
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,273
Or you might die tomorrow.

365
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,828
But, in any case, if possible,

366
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:41,211
I should like to be with child.

Freydis,
what are you doing here?

377
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:56,113
I had to come.

I have things to say.

I am so very sorry.

He killed our baby.

384
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,724
He is a monster.
You have to stop him.

How?

386
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,936
There is a secret way
into the town.

387
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,768
Ivar created it
for his own escape.

That's how I got out.

389
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:33,910
I will show your scouts
where it is

390
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,739
and I will open it
for you in the morning.

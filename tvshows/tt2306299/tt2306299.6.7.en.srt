1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,336
Previously on Viking...

2
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:04,965
All hail King Harald...
King of all Norway!

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:06,340
Your son took everything I had.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,378
If I have to die,
it is worth it.

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,926
How do you plan to deliver on
your promise to all of them?

6
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,030
Listen, you stupid old man!

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,331
It was my fate to become King of Norway.
And here I am.

8
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:22,730
Harald is going to kill you!

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,908
Come with me!
I have a boat waiting.

10
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:28,705
I am going
back to Kattegat.

11
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,795
I need to see my son.

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:30,995
You're sick, Hvitserk. Sick.

13
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:32,332
If you go out, what will you do?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,074

15
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Lagertha.

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Who killed her?

17
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,860
No one knows, Lord Ubbe.

18
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
What was she doing here?

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,353
On her own with nobody?

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,709
Poor Lagertha.

21
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,980
 Where's Gunnhild?

22
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,849
My chrildren were
her dreams true?

23
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,853
You don't know.

24
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:21,860
No, no! I have to go.
I have to find out.

25
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,700
Go and help her.

26
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,211
Where is my brother, hmm?

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,169
Where is Hvitserk?

28
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,835
Go and find him.

29
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,130
Yes, my Lord Ubbe.

30
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,230
I need him.

31
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,860
You killed my mother.

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,380
But I can still weep for
Lagertha the shield-maiden.

33
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,430
What is it?

34
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,100
We have to get to Kattegat.

35
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,510
I have to get to Kattegat.

36
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,720
We can't find Hvitserk.

37
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,189
He doesn't seem
to be in Kattegat.

38
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,847
Keep looking.

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,620
I'll find him.

40
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,164
Torvi told me that you're
in love with Bjorn.

41
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:40,520
I may be.

42
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,729
I hope that doesn't mean
you wish Queen Gunnhild ill?

43
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,504
Of course not.

44
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:47,993
I respect her.

45
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,791
I want her to be safe and well.

46
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,909
She is carrying Bjorn's child.

47
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,820
She is carrying the
child of the man I love.

48
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:24,501
Where's Hvitserk?

49
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:28,087
I don't know.

50
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,784
I don't know.

51
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,380
I haven't seen him all day.

52
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,660
My dear King Olaf.

53
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,900
I suppose you have come
to pledge your allegiance.

54
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,980
It was not well done.

55
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,460
It was not as you arranged.

56
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,350
Still, I am King now.

57
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,340
King of Norway.

58
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,820
And you owe me allegiance.

59
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,380
I cannot.

60
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,700
What is so difficult for
you, old man?

61
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,340
It was a genuine vote.

62
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
I won.

63
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,204
I wanted Bjorn to be the
first King of Norway.

64
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,300
There were many who
thought differently.

65
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,780
They didn't want Bjorn.

66
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,300
It was too obvious for
them to vote for Bjorn.

67
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,068
They wanted someone who
represented ordinary people.

68
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,460
And that's why they
voted for me...

69
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
but you still won't accept it.

70
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
No.

71
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,140
I won't accept it.

72
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,260
It is a tragedy.

73
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:09,060
I must do to you what 
you did to me, Olaf.

74
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,220
I must throw you into prison until
you see the error of your ways.

75
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:26,744
Or until you die.
I don't mind either way.

76
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Let me be!

77
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,260
I will walk to eternity
in my own shoes.

78
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,206
Hmm.

79
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,660
So, it was always the truth
that the death of Ragnar

80
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,980
would bring calamities
beyond imagining.

81
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,780
I only see things.

82
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't make them.

83
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:23,109
I fore-suffer them, lying in the
damp earth beneath these walls.

84
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,150
You told Lagertha that she would
be killed by a son of Ragnar.

85
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,900
I say only what I see,

86
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,020
and I know that humankind
cannot bear too much reality.

87
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Was it Ivar?

88
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,220
It was Ivar...

89
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,220
and yet it was not Ivar.

90
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,662
Ivar is guilty and
innocent at the same time.

91
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,260
I need to know.

92
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,380
You will know.

93
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,294
And then you will wish
that you did not know.

94
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Like Hali...

95
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,540
we are all on our
way to Valhalla.

96
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Hali?

97
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
No!

98
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,820
No, Torvi.

99
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,420
Hali is dead.

100
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Farewell, Hali.

101
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Farewell, my son.

102
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,127
The gods decided to take you to
themselves before I was ready.

103
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,420
But at least you will soon
be with Lagertha again,

104
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,220
in the Halls of the Aesir.

105
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Sweet Hali...

106
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,300
you are not gone because you
will always be in our hearts.

107
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,300
And we love you.

108
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Torvi.

109
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
You are wounded.

110
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,540
Can there be no
end to this grief?

111
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Lagertha?

112
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,580
She reached Kattegat.

113
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,140
But then someone killed her.

114
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:05,810
Do you know why she wanted
so badly to go to Kattegat?

115
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,979
She wanted to tell you that we fought
and defeated White Hair and his bandits.

116
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,100
She wanted you to know
the courage of your son.

117
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,700
You should be so proud.

118
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,060
Lagertha must have
a great funeral.

119
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:29,900
She meant so much to so many.

120
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,660
And I will return for it.

121
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,868
No, you are still too weak.

122
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:40,123
I wish we did not go back
to Kattegat with Lagertha.

123
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,809
Perhaps I could
have saved her life.

124
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,921
I will not be weak now,
when we say goodbye to her.

125
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,330
Don't cry.

126
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,620
We leave for Kattegat tomorrow.

127
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
Hvitserk.

128
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,380
Please live, Hvitserk.

129
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Ivar.

130
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,490
Warm yourself.

131
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,100
Have something strong to drink.

132
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,100
There is nothing to do except
look forward to the spring.

133
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,220
But life goes on.

134
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
We must endure the winter.

135
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Still, we must amuse ourselves.

136
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,266
I want to skate on frozen ponds.

137
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,233
I want to cut the
throat of the first pig.

138
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,469
And I want to hang the
mistletoe for the Christ-Mass.

139
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,018
And I want to bathe
naked in a hot spring...

140
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,618
with hot steam rising,
but ice and snow all around.

141
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,700
And my breath will be a geyser,

142
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,328
and my soul will bathe
there and slake its thirst.

143
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,260
And you, dear Ivar,
the future King of all Scandinavia...

144
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,678
what would you like?

145
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:36,820
I would like to walk.

146
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,700
That would be a miracle.

147
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,620
I've heard that your
God performs miracles.

148
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Jesus Christ...

149
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,940
raised a man from the dead.

150
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,730
He made a lame man walk.

151
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,535
He fed a thousand people with
just a few loaves and fishes.

152
00:14:56,635 --> 00:15:00,497
How do you think it's too much
to ask from him to cure his

153
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,940
We will all pray for that
miracle, Ivar the Boneless.

154
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,725
What about you, Prince Oleg?

155
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,460
What is it that amuses you?

156
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,450
What is it that you really want?

157
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,550
As usual, I want the impossible.

158
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,860
I want to go back
into my mother's womb.

159
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,078
I want to float there...

160
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,422
in that small,
limitless universe...

161
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,936
among the stars.

162
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,060
With no beginning, no end.

163
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,449
Waiting for the
new world to begin.

164
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,506
I know we have all
been here before.

165
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,398
We're constantly reborn.

166
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,834
It's what I believe.

167
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Don't you, Ivar?

168
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
Yes.

169
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,460
That's also what I believe.

170
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Ubbe!

171
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Asa!

172
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,060
Oh, sweetheart.

173
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You are safe.

174
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,460
But Hali is dead.

175
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
I know.

176
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,100
But what a brave warrior he was.

177
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,940
I am certain that he is
on his way to Valhalla.

178
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,996
I am so sorry.
I should have let you go.

179
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,192
I loved him. You must know that.

180
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,538
I know.

181
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
We all did.

182
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,663
Now he's waiting for Lagertha.

183
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,211
This must be a
magnificent funeral.

184
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,980
Greater than anything else
in the memory of our folk.

185
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:47,780
Your mistress, the famous
shield-maiden Lagertha, is dead.

186
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,900
But we cannot let her
sail to Valhalla alone.

187
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,075
Someone must serve her in the next
world and accompany her there.

188
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,550
I do not want to sacrifice
a slave who might

189
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,770
be unwilling to perform
these sacred duties.

190
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,935
I believe it must be done
willingly and joyfully,

191
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,955
and that one of you is
fated to be that person.

192
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,580
Who would willingly sacrifice
themselves to go with Lagertha?

193
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,140
I will!

194
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
I will.

195
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
I will go with her.

196
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,700
I cannot allow it, Torvi.

197
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,620
You are carrying a child.

198
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,220
The child has not agreed to go
to the next world with Lagertha.

199
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,140
It must be one of you,

200
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,700
and the gods have already
made their choice.

201
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:52,257
Let them show us.

202
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
What is your name?

203
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Gyda.

204
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,100
I was named after
Lagertha's daughter,

205
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,140
who died in a plague
when she was young.

206
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,540
My mother said my fate would
always be linked to Lagertha.

207
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Are you happy, Gyda?

208
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
How could you ask?

209
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,220
To be chosen by the gods.

210
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,220
Who would not be happy?

211
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,930
Well done!

212
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,460
Spices!
Come pick your spices from me!

213
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:00,100
I have a message for
you, Ivar the Boneless.

214
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,500
Prince Dir sends you greetings.

215
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,820
He is safe, well, and restored.

216
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,300
But, for the time
being, still in hiding.

217
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,216
However, he hopes that one
day he will be strong enough

218
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,260
to help you achieve
your ambition...

219
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,740
which is also his ambition.

220
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,700
He sends you this cross...

221
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:34,460
by which you will know him,
and is a token of his enduring friendship.

222
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Now, I must leave.

223
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,380
Please do not turn
or watch me go.

224
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:50,010
Please, come and help me.
I need some help holding this.

225
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
Who was that?

226
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,380
He didn't tell me his name.

227
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,364
But he told me that
Prince Dir is safe

228
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,360
and that he is prepared to
help us when the time has come.

229
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,860
Then he is an angel
sent from God.

230
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
You're right.

231
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,260
An angel sent from the gods.

232
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
He hasn't spoken.

233
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
He hardly eats.

234
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,340
Sometimes he cries
out in his sleep.

235
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
What does he say?

236
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,620
Nothing that
makes any sense.

237
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Brother.

238
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Hvitserk!

239
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,809
Talk to me.

240
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,626
Why did you
go into the forest?

241
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:45,470
Did you want to die, huh?

242
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:46,974
Why would you want to die?

243
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
Lagertha's dead!

244
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,133
Did you know Lagertha was dead?

245
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,860
I... I need to sleep.

246
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,820
Talk to me.

247
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,060
I don't want to talk.
I want to sleep.

248
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:10,769
Behold, I see my mistress,
seated in paradise.

249
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,555
Paradise is beautiful and green.

250
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,290
And with her are shield-maidens.

251
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,540
She calls me.

252
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,628
Take me to her.

253
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,140
Gyda, beloved of the gods,

254
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,020
you must drink to your mistress,

255
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,180
and in honor of Frey and Freya.

256
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,176
I will gladly drink.
I will drink to my mistress, Lagertha.

257
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,690
And to Frey and Freya,

258
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,660
and to all the gods
gathered here today.

259
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,300
We must prepare you so you are ready
to be received in Valhalla by the gods.

260
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Gyda.

261
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:15,815
You are Gyda.

262
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,609
You have declared yourself
a willing sacrifice.

263
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,124
You wish to accompany your
mistress to the other world.

264
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
Yes.

265
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,300
Then you know who I am.

266
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,940
I am called the Angel of Death.

267
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:35,276
Yes. I know.

268
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,700
I can kill you with a knife.

269
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:41,820
Or a cord around your neck.

270
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Which would you prefer?

271
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
A knife.

272
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Thank you.

273
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Are you afraid?

274
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
No.

275
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,900
I know that death
is not the end.

276
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
So, I'm not afraid.

277
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,180
The Valkyries will
ride alongside

278
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,140
and guide you to Valhalla.

279
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,100
Look at my eyes.

280
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Look!

281
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Whoo!

282
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,260
Now are you happy, my love?

283
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,243
Of course. This was my dream,
and you made it come true.

284
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,780
This was the simplest
dream of all.

285
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,393
But the rest will follow.

286
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,580
You understand, don't you?

287
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,700
It's only the beginning.

288
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,660
It's only the beginning!

289
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,344
Farewell, Lagertha, Queen of
Kattegat, Mother of Norway.

290
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,700
May the gods love
and keep you...

291
00:29:56,752 --> 00:30:00,642
and may your reunion with
Ragnar be joyful, noisy

292
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,585
and filled with love.

293
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,071
Farewell, Lagertha...

294
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,300
my shield, my hero.

295
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,895
One day we shall meet again
in the Halls of the Aesir,

296
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,893
and you will teach me once
more how to fight as a woman

297
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
and how to prevail.

298
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,650
For women always prevail.

299
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,790
That is what you taught me.
And that is the truth.

300
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
I love you.

301
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,508
There is really nothing else to
say, Lagertha.

302
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,260
I know you will look after my
boys, Hali and Guthrum.

303
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:50,698
There will be so
much for you to do...

304
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,056
but don't forget them.

305
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,361
Hali is always hungry.

306
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,726
I must live in the
world without you.

307
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,875
But wherever I go,
you will go with me...

308
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,140
and give me courage and hope.

309
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,820
Goodbye, Grandmother.

310
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,660
Don't worry. The Valkyries will ride
alongside and guide you to Valhalla.

311
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
What is it?

312
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,421
The world has changed.

313
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
I think I know.

314
00:32:57,386 --> 00:32:58,703
But I don't want to know.

315
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
Bjorn.

316
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:48,799
You don't need to tell me, Ubbe.

317
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,597
I already know.

318
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,839
My mother is dead.

319
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,820
And nothing will ever
be the same again.

320
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,301
I hoped the day
would never come...

321
00:34:48,941 --> 00:34:50,778
when I had to bid you farewell.

322
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,429
You were
always my strength...

323
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,601
my guide.

324
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:00,420
You taught me to go
on, no matter what.

325
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,540
You taught me not to be afraid.

326
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,626
And now I see that, like me...

327
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,992
the earth itself is
unwilling to let you go.

328
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,711
But the gods call you home.

329
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,508
They eagerly await your
arrival in Valhalla...

330
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,305
as does my father.

331
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,257
I wish I could be there...

332
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,755
at your reunion, secretly,

333
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,809
in Odin's glittering,
gold-shielded hall,

334
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,407
surrounded by all the gods.

335
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,900
You are already a legend.

336
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,160
The greatest
shield-maiden of all time.

337
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,180
A hero to thousands of women.

338
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,287
But, to me,
you will always be my mother...

339
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,067
who bore me...

340
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,427
who raised me...

341
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,620
who protected and fought for me.

342
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,740
And I swear,
I will fight for you now!

343
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,820
I did not protect you in life,
but I can punish your murderer after it.

344
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Farewell.

345
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,114
I have loved you more than
I have loved any other.

346
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Farewell, Lagertha.

347
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Farewell.

348
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
I love you.

349
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:53,597
I will miss you.

350
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,380
I will avenge you.

351
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,301
Draw!

352
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:49,844
Loose!

353
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,380
Loose!

354
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,673
Loose!

355
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Loose!

356
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Pull!

357
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,820
In my dreams,
we are always together.

358
00:41:21,305 --> 00:42:21,432

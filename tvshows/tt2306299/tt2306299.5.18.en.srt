1
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,228
No...

2
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,750
And then he took
one of the children,

3
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:04,581
a little boy,
and then he ate him!

4
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:13,694
Halt!

5
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,081
Who are you, stranger?

6
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,014
My name is Hvitserk,

7
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,602
son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

8
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,952
I'’ve come to see King Olaf.
We are meant to be allies.

9
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,957
Friend, I have just ridden

10
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:38,960
across mountain ranges
and frozen lakes.

11
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,031
I am dying of cold.

12
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,136
Will you not at least

13
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,310
let me warm myself
by your fire?

14
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,969
Is this the hospitality
of a friend and ally?

15
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,869
You arrive here unexpectedly

16
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,458
and the first thing you do
is insult me!

17
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:55,977
Yes.

18
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:58,325
Forgive me.

19
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:01,466
Indeed.

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,468
I will of course take you
to meet King Olaf.

21
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:04,883
Thank you.

22
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,643
But first you must
take off your clothes.

23
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,372
What?

24
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,824
Take off your clothes.

25
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,205
Otherwise
you cannot see him.

26
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,190
I wanted to congratulate you.

27
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:57,158
Thank you, King Harald.

28
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,022
I thought you wanted
to be Queen of Norway.

29
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,645
Yes.

30
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,855
But I never said who
I wanted to be King.

31
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,242
-Happy days.
-Mmm.

32
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:13,796
-Happy days.
-Yes.

33
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,867
You know, it feels as if
I'’m really in a dream.

34
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,869
All my youth I'’ve had
to hide away

35
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:20,837
and I couldn'’t tell anybody
who I was.

36
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:23,461
But now at the wedding
of my brother,

37
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,014
Bjorn Ironside!

38
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,470
One of the most famous men
in all the world.

39
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:33,505
And I have you,

40
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,025
I have you to thank
for that, King Harald.

41
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,717
I mean, you could'’ve
killed me but you didn'’t.

42
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,650
And now we'’re going back
to Kattegat, huh,

43
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:41,755
my father'’s realm.

44
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,515
I mean, why should I not
be happy, huh?

45
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,206
Be happy!

46
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:48,037
Drink another horn,
drink several, huh?

47
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,004
Get ready for our journey.

48
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,834
It won'’t be easy.

49
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,870
Some of our ships
will surely flounder.

50
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,907
Hmm. Oh, but not mine.

51
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,218
No.

52
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,359
See, the gods,
they wouldn'’t allow it,

53
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,050
'’cause I'm a son
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

54
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,534
Ah.

55
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,122
And the gods look after me.

56
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,124
I mean, they always did.
It'’s just...

57
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,643
Just that I didn'’t know.

58
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,059
-Huh, Skol.
-Skol.

59
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,617
Friend.

60
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,278
Congratulations.

61
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,903
I wanted her.

62
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,112
She knew that.
But you prevailed.

63
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:34,911
It'’s a virtue of being
a son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

64
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,879
I really don'’t know why.

65
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,259
Of course you know why.

66
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,675
You'’re not stupid.

67
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,092
You always wanted
to be Ragnar Lothbrok.

68
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,750
You felt like his equal.
I know that.

69
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,441
-Skol.
-Ah, thank you.

70
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:50,582
There was nothing
you couldn'’t do.

71
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,240
You didn'’t understand

72
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:55,069
why people followed Ragnar
and not you.

73
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,139
Isn'’t that true?

74
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,661
But you will never be Ragnar.

75
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,456
And you will never be
King of Norway.

76
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,286
And do you want to know why?

77
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,357
Why don'’t you tell me?

78
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:08,807
It has nothing to do with

79
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:13,122
power, or titles, or your army.

80
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:17,644
It is in the gift of the gods.

81
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:21,958
I'’m happy for you today, Bjorn.

82
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,477
You married a beautiful woman.

83
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,998
Of course,
some would say that

84
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,932
that will be
the greatest curse of all.

85
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,347
But I don'’t believe that.

86
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,143
I envy you.

87
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,214
Envy I understand.

88
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,425
That doesn'’t stop us
working together.

89
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:42,565
Or trusting each other.

90
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,189
-Does it?
-Of course not.

91
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,470
There are far greater things
at stake

92
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,850
than just a woman.

93
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,027
Ah, but she is not just
a woman though, is she?

94
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:03,784
My Lord Olaf. This is...

95
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,545
I know who it is!

96
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,066
Come and sit down, Hvitserk.

97
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,105
Your brother Ivar

98
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:17,108
told me he would send you

99
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,110
and so,

100
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,975
I have been waiting.

101
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:26,738
-Give our guest some mead.
-Yes, Lord.

102
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,262
Skol.

103
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,679
Skol.

104
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,137
Another son of Ragnar.

105
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:53,144
That is a sign of...

106
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:56,147
respect.

107
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,772
So,

108
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:03,154
what do you think
of this place so far?

109
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,507
The truth?

110
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,167
I think all this
is an illusion

111
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:20,723
and you are what they call

112
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,898
the Buddha.

113
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,360
Move!

114
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,088
Ha! Ha! Ha!

115
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,541
Ha! Ha!

116
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,031
Whoa!

117
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,551
Move out of the way! Move!

118
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:58,554
Make way.
Move! Move!

119
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,177
Get back! Stay back!

120
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,076
Move! You back!

121
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,199
No, please!

122
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,684
Stay back! Move!

123
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,038
Open the door!

124
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,556
Open the door now!

125
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:58,579
Come.

126
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,827
Please. Sit.

127
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:13,422
Thora, I am trying
to rule well.

128
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:16,252
I am trying to rule

129
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,598
for the benefit of our people,

130
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,256
not the strangers,

131
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,465
not the outsiders
who threaten us.

132
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:28,471
I use my divinity
to protect you,

133
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:31,129
like a father.

134
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,099
But still you hate me.

135
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:40,276
You deface my image.
You criticize me.

136
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,280
Why?

137
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,663
In Ragnar'’s time,

138
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:50,459
everyone was free.

139
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,219
That'’s what
my parents told me.

140
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,257
They could say
what they wanted,

141
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,294
they could do
what they wanted.

142
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,676
Ragnar never
forced them to do anything.

143
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:05,163
And above all,

144
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,858
he never forced them
to worship him.

145
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:14,655
He knew, he was only human.

146
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,312
Just like the rest of us.

147
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,353
You have spoken well.

148
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:26,426
Go.

149
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,498
Go?

150
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:36,436
I remember your father.

151
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,266
He is a good man.

152
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:44,168
One of us.

153
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,343
Go.

154
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,868
I look forward
to traveling to England

155
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,871
and raiding
with your brother.

156
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:01,185
I hear many stories
of his prowess

157
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:02,462
as a warrior.

158
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,881
What kind of a ruler
is your brother?

159
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,539
Is he, uh...

160
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,127
Is he cruel?

161
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:15,026
Is he a monster?

162
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,615
I need to know.

163
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,704
My brother has
declared himself to be a God.

164
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,811
He'’s no longer
the Ivar I knew.

165
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,088
The brother I knew.

166
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,298
He'’s a tyrant.

167
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,959
You! Over here!

168
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:27,443
Put them together!

169
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,275
Thora!

170
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:32,414
Be quiet!

171
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,416
Father!

172
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,833
And yet you want me
to join him in raiding England?

173
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,835
Uh, no.

174
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,630
No?

175
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,428
Would you like to explain?

176
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,532
Over here!

177
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,983
Run, run! Run!

178
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:51,778
I cannot!

179
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:52,952
No!

180
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:55,955
No. No.

181
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,094
No...

182
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,476
King Olaf,
I haven'’t come here

183
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,478
to ask you to help Ivar,

184
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,515
recover York
and attack Wessex.

185
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,656
I'’ve come here
to ask you to attack Ivar

186
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,658
and overthrow him as
King of Kattegat.

187
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:13,869
Mmm. I understand.

188
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:20,358
But I probably will go
with my original plan.

189
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,568
King Olaf, listen...

190
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,570
King Olaf!

191
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,089
King Olaf!

192
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:02,115
You didn'’t even dig
your daughter'’s grave.

193
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,084
I thought she became more
your child than mine.

194
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,224
And she was always
too good for you.

195
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,777
You'’re probably right.

196
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,951
Who knows these things?

197
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,609
You screw a woman.
You have a child.

198
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,473
Who in Hel knows
about that child?

199
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,337
Who cares?

200
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:25,483
You are the same as
the rest of us after all!

201
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,071
You were just pretending!

202
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,350
Do it! Do it!

203
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:35,286
No, Kjetill, I won'’t.

204
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,152
The man I once was

205
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:42,121
would have dug this spade just
deep enough into your skull

206
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,329
to make you unconscious.

207
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,159
And when you woke up,

208
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:49,852
I would let you witness me
burn your wife alive.

209
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:53,718
And then I would force
your one remaining son

210
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:55,168
to cut off your balls
and have you eat them.

211
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,999
And as you slowly bled out,

212
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,865
the last thing you would see
would be me raping your son,

213
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,660
not knowing
if I would show him the mercy

214
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:05,868
of killing him or not.

215
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,534
But you see,

216
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,055
I won'’t do any of that.

217
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,818
For even though you

218
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,199
and Eyvind

219
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,753
and everyone else
in this cursed settlement

220
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,377
have showed me that I can'’t
change other human beings,

221
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,241
I have changed myself.

222
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:37,176
And I intend to stay this way.

223
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,387
I owe it to the dead.

224
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,048
Do with this place as you like.

225
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,397
I am done with the humans.

226
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,416
Wen, wen,

227
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:12,935
little wen,

228
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:18,907
shrink like coal on hearth.

229
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:24,395
Wizen like filth on wall!

230
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,397
Waste away...

231
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:29,745
like water in pail!

232
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:33,266
Become as little

233
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:38,271
as grain of linseed,

234
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,103
and smaller

235
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:46,245
than hand-worm'’s hip bone...

236
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:51,042
until at last you are...

237
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,977
nothing at all.

238
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,295
Oh. You must leave.

239
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:05,056
What?

240
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:11,925
Who?

241
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,307
She is nothing!
She is nothing!

242
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,826
No concern of yours.

243
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,968
Who is that woman?

244
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:22,073
Huh. She is nobody.

245
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,388
Please, I have told you.
You must leave!

246
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,804
No.

247
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,705
A crazy woman.
I have been looking after her.

248
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,297
Lagertha?

249
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,470
Please...

250
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:40,678
Lagertha, is that you?

251
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:47,858
Take this.

252
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,690
Bjorn! Bjorn! Bjorn!

253
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,692
Thank you.

254
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,245
Give us this day
our daily bread.

255
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,698
Thy will be done
as it is in Heaven...

256
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,322
And forgive us
our trespasses...

257
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,426
Thy Kingdom come...

258
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,704
Thy will be done.

259
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,467
And deliver us from evil...

260
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,882
From evil.

261
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,193
From evil.

262
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:24,688
It gladdens me
to know that Odin

263
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,310
prepares for a feast.

264
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,662
Soon I shall be drinking

265
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,147
ale from curved horns!

266
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,393
This hero that comes
into Valhalla

267
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,084
does not lament his death.

268
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:47,158
I shall not enter
Odin'’s hall with fear.

269
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:52,232
There I shall wait
for my sons to join me.

270
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:54,752
And when they do,

271
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,548
I will bask

272
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,550
in their tales of triumph.

273
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,590
The Aesir will welcome me.

274
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:09,111
My death comes
without apology!

275
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,735
And I welcome

276
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,772
the Valkyries
to summon me home!

277
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:19,432
Deliver me, O Lord,
from mine enemies!

278
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,746
Over there. Over there.

279
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:32,997
No!

280
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,623
I always dream of you.

281
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,902
Last night,

282
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,938
I dreamt you were feeding me
blood pudding.

283
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:46,425
What does that mean?

284
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,775
It means you'’ve
given me your heart.

285
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:58,989
Ragnar.

286
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,972
Where is this?

287
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,185
Where am I?

288
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,877
The royal villa at Wessex.

289
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,190
Wessex.

290
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,472
Ecbert.

291
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:36,233
Yes.

292
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:38,373
Ecbert.

293
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:53,837
The three Danish kings

294
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:55,666
have camped
about five miles upriver.

295
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:57,979
They are preparing
to attack as soon as possible.

296
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,498
Then obviously
we should attack them at once.

297
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,154
I don'’t think so.

298
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,502
What possible advantage
do we gain by delaying?

299
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,365
They will very soon discover
that we are here.

300
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,229
I'’m sure they already know
we are here.

301
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,888
Then what on earth
do you propose?

302
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,580
I propose we go down there
and we speak to them.

303
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:13,753
Speak to them?

304
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:15,203
That is the best way

305
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:18,344
to avoid a terrible battle
and unnecessary death.

306
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:20,035
Then how do we know that
you will not just betray us,

307
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,209
and join them?

308
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,382
You don'’t.

309
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,384
But if you want
to overrule your King,

310
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,490
who appointed me
the leader of the army,

311
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:27,905
go ahead.

312
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,703
King Olaf asks if you have
changed your mind.

313
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,257
Will you join him
and King Ivar

314
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,294
in attacking England,
as you agreed?

315
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:48,020
I wish I could agree.

316
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:51,955
This is a ridiculous way
to die.

317
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,337
Too hot in a cold climate.

318
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:57,650
I'’m sure you appreciate
the irony.

319
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,479
I love irony.

320
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:01,654
But still...
Death is death.

321
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:04,484
That'’s true. Not really
a laughing matter.

322
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:07,833
But I'’m decided
against my brother.

323
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,526
The King must
make up his own mind.

324
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:14,563
I thought he agreed with me.

325
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:18,498
You must never try
to anticipate

326
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,810
the desires of Kings.

327
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:22,813
I thought you, of all people,

328
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,539
might have understood
that by now.

329
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:44,792
Ubbe, Ubbe, Ubbe!

330
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:48,450
Ubbe, Ubbe, Ubbe!

331
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,769
You see, you'’re famous.

332
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:02,430
Ubbe, Ubbe,
Ubbe!

333
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:16,375
Yes. Yes.

334
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:18,515
Aah... Aah...

335
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:39,467
The head. One more.

336
00:29:58,348 --> 00:29:59,521
What is it?

337
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,835
You have a son, King Ivar.

338
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:06,321
I have a son.

339
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,703
I have a son.

340
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,670
Give me my baby.

341
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:11,810
He will not be able

342
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,466
to take the milk
from your breasts.

343
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,123
What are you talking about?

344
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,538
-I--
-Give me my baby.

345
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:24,719
Oh...

346
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,102
My beautiful little Baldur.

347
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:31,346
My little God.

348
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,558
Show Ivar his blessed son.

349
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:38,284
Yes.

350
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,220
Give me my son.

351
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,889
My divine Baldur.

352
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,582
I'’ve waited for this...

353
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,034
Did I not tell you,

354
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,382
and did you not believe me
when I said that

355
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,317
deformity is a true sign
of the Gods'’ favor?

356
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:25,538
Ubbe, Ubbe, Ubbe!

357
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,246
Ubbe.

358
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,833
Son of Ragnar.

359
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,457
Welcome.

360
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:50,943
My name is King Hemming.

361
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,463
And here are King Angantyr
and King Frodo.

362
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:58,088
Of all the enemies
we expected to encounter,

363
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:00,125
we could hardly have imagined
encountering you.

364
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:02,955
I am not your enemy.

365
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,795
Let us go and drink.
Let me explain.

366
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,452
Lagertha,

367
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:20,110
Queen of Vikings,

368
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:22,078
we welcome you
back to Wessex,

369
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:24,321
to the royal villa
of my grandfather, King Ecbert.

370
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,294
We were so very glad
to find you alive.

371
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,400
Thank you, King Alfred.

372
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,025
Thank all of you.

373
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,998
Ubbe and Torvi have gone
to fight a Danish army

374
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,689
at the borders of our Kingdom.

375
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:52,522
And I heard my son has gone
to attack Ivar in Kattegat.

376
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,455
Mmm...

377
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,388
Life moves on,

378
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:58,183
whether or not
we are a part of it.

379
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:02,773
Everything changes.

380
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,986
As I have changed.

381
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:11,990
I am no longer Lagertha,

382
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,439
shield maiden,

383
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,924
since my shield is gone.

384
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,896
I have nothing
to protect myself with.

385
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,520
Only yourself...

386
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,868
and your honesty.

387
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:34,702
Sweet Judith,
do you think that is enough?

388
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:39,189
I don'’t understand.

389
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:40,708
You'’re leading a Saxon army

390
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,054
on behalf of
the King of Wessex?

391
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,055
Yes.

392
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,162
We had made
an alliance with him.

393
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,578
Before you and your people
even got here.

394
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,546
But they are our enemies.

395
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,928
Why did you make
an alliance with our enemies?

396
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,724
Sometimes it'’s sensible
to make deals

397
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,037
when you have
long-term goals to achieve.

398
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,418
Perhaps women understand that
more than men.

399
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,250
Men just go and fight
and kill each other,

400
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,390
and only afterwards realize
they didn'’t need to.

401
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,771
There were better alternatives.

402
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:12,843
Who is this woman?

403
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,744
A shield maiden.
Torvi.

404
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:18,504
My wife.

405
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,750
Is there much more
you need to know, King Frodo?

406
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,959
What is the fruit
of your alliance?

407
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,928
King Alfred of Wessex

408
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,690
has granted us a large area
of land in his kingdom.

409
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,107
It was always
my father'’s dream

410
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,075
to establish
a working settlement here.

411
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:41,251
What does that mean to us?

412
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:43,840
If your armies are willing
to give up the sword,

413
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,117
then you can move
into the lands

414
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,946
in East Anglia at once.

415
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:50,260
Instead of dying uselessly
on the battlefield,

416
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,228
your warriors
and your shield maidens

417
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:53,850
can take up the plow
and the loom

418
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,300
and they can make a life here.

419
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,130
There is nothing to stop you.

420
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:00,719
And yet you have
everything to gain.

421
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:08,485
What is the name
of that stone?

422
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:12,731
Lapis lazuli.

423
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:15,837
Where does it come from?

424
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,669
Somewhere far away,

425
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,912
along the Silk Roads.

426
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,433
Blue

427
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:29,057
is the most expensive
of all the pigments,

428
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:32,026
which is why we reserve it
for the Virgin Mary.

429
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:34,097
It'’s an incredible color!

430
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,341
It shines!

431
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:39,309
As the moon shines

432
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:42,174
in the reflected light
from the sun,

433
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:44,487
so Mary shines
in the reflected light

434
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,764
from her son,

435
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,353
Jesus Christ.

436
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,773
I think you will have a son.

437
00:35:56,361 --> 00:36:00,054
As you, Lagertha, have a son.
And I, two sons...

438
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,370
although I murdered
one of them.

439
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,201
And now I am dying.

440
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,584
-No!
-Yes.

441
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:17,589
I have a lump in my breast.

442
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,593
I know other women
have died from such a thing.

443
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:27,599
It seems that you no longer
have your shield either.

444
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,155
No.

445
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,780
And no experience learned

446
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,437
can compensate for it.

447
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,543
I can'’t bear it.

448
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:47,101
You are young.
You can bear anything!

449
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,634
You'’ve been
a warrior like me.

450
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:05,740
In your own way.

451
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,126
But I don'’t agree with you.

452
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:19,789
There are still many things
for us to discover

453
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,588
on the other side
of the shield wall.

454
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:33,320
It seems we might have
to fight our way out of here.

455
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:35,425
If we have to fight our way
out of here,

456
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,289
then we will do it together.

457
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,397
And if the odds
are against us,

458
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:45,228
then it will make me happy
to die with you.

459
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,821
I never thought I would hear
a woman say that.

460
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,616
Oh.

461
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,755
Everyone can be wrong.

462
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:55,790
Ubbe.

463
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:56,826
Even you.

464
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,933
Two of us want
to avail ourselves

465
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:02,832
and our warriors
of your offer.

466
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,627
But, uh...

467
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:07,388
King Frodo
refuses to agree.

468
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,322
He wants to continue
the raid.

469
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,324
Then there is only one thing
left to do.

470
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:17,502
I take your refusal
as an insult

471
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,676
and I challenge you
to a single combat.

472
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:21,333
Good.

473
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,162
This makes me very happy,

474
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:24,681
Ubbe Lothbrok.

475
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:03,746
Give.

476
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,990
Sympathize.

477
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,097
Control.

478
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,929
I have decided

479
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:16,966
to go with you after all

480
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:21,798
and attack Ivar'’s kingdom.

481
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:24,283
Good?

482
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,634
Let us talk
a little while together,

483
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:31,463
you and I, my son.

484
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,640
I waited for you a long time.

485
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:38,401
I thought you would make

486
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,024
everything perfect.

487
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,338
Because you would be
like a God,

488
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:47,134
the shining one,

489
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:48,791
like Baldur.

490
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:50,793
Hmm.

491
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:57,178
It was my dream.

492
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:01,666
But it was only a dream.

493
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,674
You are not divine...

494
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:14,023
Because you remind me
of myself.

495
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,509
And you would continue
to remind me,

496
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:18,752
and everyone else,

497
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:20,374
of what I am.

498
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:26,449
And you see, I cannot
let that happen.

499
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,351
I cannot allow you to suffer

500
00:41:33,698 --> 00:41:36,528
like I have suffered
throughout my life.

501
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:44,363
How could I
do that to you, hmm?

502
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:53,545
What kind of a father
could do that to a son?

503
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:58,239
To any son?

504
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,492
No. No.

505
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,565
No.

506
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,920
I cannot help you anymore.

507
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:27,924
You'’ll have to make
your own way in life, Baldur.

508
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:31,756
My boy.

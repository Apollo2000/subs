00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:11,604
﻿Previously on Babylon Berlin...

2
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:13,472
- ﻿I'm Fritz.
﻿- Greta.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,041
﻿Greta. Nice name.

4
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:18,778
﻿I don’t have to tell you that everything
﻿you hear in this house

5
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,113
- ﻿is highly confidential.
﻿- Nо, I know that.

6
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,883
﻿In those sheds
﻿there are 13 cases of treason,

7
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:26,752
﻿due to the illegal import
﻿of warfare agents.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,323
﻿Anti-aircraft guns, tanks, heavy guns.
﻿And now... poison gas.

9
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:33,526
- Where is the film?
- ﻿You don't know who you're dealing with.

10
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:36,562
﻿They only ever made one copy
﻿of each of König's films.

11
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:37,964
﻿The courier always took them.

12
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:41,434
﻿You know I guaranteed that we would solve
﻿this problem before the elections.

13
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,269
﻿Bruno? I need your help.

14
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:45,371
- ﻿Krajewski is the key.
- Finally.

15
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:53,612
﻿Stay calm. Nothing will happen to you.

16
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:57,183
﻿Relax your body.

17
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,619
﻿All fetters fall off you.

18
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,657
﻿Inhale very deeply...

19
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,294
﻿and exhale.

20
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,496
﻿Yes.

21
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:14,233
﻿Good. Your body is relaxing.

22
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,805
﻿And all fetters fall off you,
﻿if you want it.

23
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:25,044
﻿Now focus on your eyes,

24
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:30,616
﻿on the little muscles behind your eyes.
﻿Those muscles are relaxing.

25
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:32,618
﻿And when you notice

26
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:36,455
﻿that your eyes won't open anymore.
﻿even if you want them to,

27
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,124
﻿then nod

28
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,131
﻿I will take the blindfold off now.

29
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:48,367
﻿But you will notice
﻿that your eyes are so relaxed

30
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,403
﻿that they won't open anymore.

31
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:54,407
﻿And now we will further enhance
﻿this state of relaxation

32
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:57,543
﻿which is flowing
﻿through your entire body now

33
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,213
﻿even more by you opening your eyes
﻿once very briefly

34
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:02,348
﻿and closing them again.

35
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:06,852
﻿When you close them, you will enter
﻿an even deeper state of relaxation.

36
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,922
﻿Open your eyes

37
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,223
﻿now.

38

39
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,646
﻿First of all you need to dust the library.

40
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,148
﻿But be careful.

41
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,650
﻿Many of the tomes are very valuable.

42
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:12,818
﻿OK.

43
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,887
﻿And then, like we said, a basic cleaning.

44
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,690
﻿First the stairs, then the skirting
﻿boards, then the floors,

45
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,726
﻿take the rugs out and beat them.
﻿Then do the silver like I showed you.

46
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,095
﻿You were able to shine it so wonderfully.

47
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,930
﻿Children, get into the taxi.

48
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,534
﻿Dinner at 8pm. Cheese and salad,
﻿as always, cucumber,

49
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:31,570
﻿but no pickles, they're too salty.
﻿And Greta?

50
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:34,907
﻿I know he will ask for it,
﻿but he mustn't have meat.

51
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,509
﻿Not even ham or cold meats.

52
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,212
﻿Dr. Hutten has emphasised it again.
﻿So, no exceptions.

53
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:44,183
﻿Tell him there is nothing in the house
﻿and that I prepared the dinner,

54
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,852
- ﻿so he won't get the wrong idea. Yes?
- Yes.

55
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,088
﻿And now I'll leave you alone.

56
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,726
﻿Right, my dears, off we go.

57
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:55,461
﻿Please go.

58
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:41,840
﻿Nice dress.

59
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,811
﻿Thanks. I need to be back for half seven.

60
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,112
﻿Matter of honour.

61
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,982
﻿Eight at the latest,
﻿when the old man comes home.

62
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:54,220
﻿Young man, remember,
﻿last trip back in 60 minutes.

63
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,790
﻿If you're not here on time,
﻿you and your girl will have to swim.

64
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,427
﻿Please get in, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:02,928
﻿Tickets, please.

66
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:07,066
﻿The way here was free,
﻿the return trip is double the price.

67
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,603
﻿Mrs. Benda doesn't mean it.

68
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,705
﻿She's just very exact.

69
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:16,775
﻿Girl, they're bigwigs.
﻿They're born to bully.

70
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,644
﻿I just want to do it all correctly.

71
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:22,681
﻿That's exactly their method,
﻿that you defend them in the end

72
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,283
﻿Stop. Don't say that.

73
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:25,784
﻿But that's the way it is.

74
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,655
﻿I’m glad to have any work at all.

75
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,697
﻿You are listed as accused now.

76
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:41,267
﻿This means, you don't have
﻿to make a statement.

77
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,969
﻿The police has the burden of proof,
﻿not us.

78
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,170
﻿When do I get out?

79
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:49,642
﻿made an appointment with the magistrate
﻿after the hearing, and if he complies...

80
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,043
﻿When do I get out of here?

81
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,845
﻿I know that man.

82
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,614
﻿Which doesn't mean he will comply.

83
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:58,417
- This way.
- ﻿One moment. Why this way?

84
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,452
﻿Where are you taking Mr. Nyssen?

85
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:02,721
- ﻿I demand an explanation.
- Roun﻿d the front.

86
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,791
- ﻿Through the entrance hall?
﻿- That's the instruction.

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,497
﻿I don't believe this.

88
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,299
- ﻿There he is.
- ﻿Step aside.

89
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,768
﻿Step aside, out of the way.

90
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,503
﻿Switch off your devices.

91
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,939
﻿- What are you accused of?
﻿- He is presumed innocent.

92
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:23,342
﻿I don’t believe this.

93
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,779
﻿None of these pictures must be published.

94
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,682
﻿Who arranged this?
﻿Who informed the press? Did you?

95
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,418
﻿We have freedom of the press
﻿in the German Reich.

96
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,920
﻿They led us through the main entrance
﻿on purpose

97
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,422
﻿This is a put-up job.

98
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:39,458
﻿Let’s get to the point.
﻿This is the analysis of the freight.

99
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,794
﻿You behave as if this was a trifle.

100
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:47,199
﻿For whom does Nyssen AG or rather you,
﻿Mr. Nyssen, order chemical warfare?

101
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,036
﻿Importing pesticides
﻿is neither banned nor limited.

102
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,839
﻿Please let your client speak for himself.

103
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,276
﻿For whom is the poison gas?
﻿Who is the recipient?

104
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,811
﻿I was duped.

105
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,647
﻿I ordered pesticides.

106
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,649
﻿I see.

107
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:05,451
﻿What for?

108
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,453
﻿For pest control.

109
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:15,527
﻿Nyssen AG deals with iron, steel.
﻿You produce heavy goods.

110
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,863
﻿My mother's corporation
﻿has nothing to do with this.

111
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,099
﻿No? I know your mother.

112
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:24,103
﻿She would be amazed at the things that are
﻿smuggled through the country in her name.

113
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,840
﻿We won’t make a statement, as long as you
﻿have Mr. Nyssen registered as accused.

114
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,744
﻿I just want to make sure
﻿Mr. Nyssen is willing to face the music

115
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,679
﻿for the people who are behind this.

116
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,248
﻿I'm taking my client
﻿to the magistrate now.

117
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:38,717
﻿He will let him go without batting an eye.

118
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:43,455
﻿The results of the analysis are
﻿unambiguous. Please sit down, solicitor.

119
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,699
﻿There is phosgene in those wagons.

120
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,802
﻿According to the Geneva Protocol
﻿and the Treaty of Versailles

121
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,704
﻿it's a banned chemical warfare agent.

122
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,842
﻿With this quantity you could wipe out
﻿all life in a city the size of Berlin.

123
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,778
﻿You will have to answer for this.

124
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:09,515
﻿No-one will let this kind of suspicion
﻿go without batting an eye.

125
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,554
﻿Right. Would you give us
﻿a minute in private?

126
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,008
﻿I'm outside the door if you need me.

127
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,826
﻿I know who people like you
﻿think of as pests.

128
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,763
﻿I also know what drives
﻿the men in your environment.

129
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:01,366
﻿But if I inform the allied gun control
﻿commission and the League of Nations...

130
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,235
﻿You won't do yourself any favours.

131
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,139
﻿You feel protected by your friends,
﻿do you?

132
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,274
﻿What makes you so sure
﻿you're not mistaken?

133
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,744
﻿I know lots of these men.
﻿For them you are nothing but a puppet.

134
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,213
﻿You're the puppet.

135
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:19,117
﻿The puppet of a democratic aberration
﻿which has taken hold of this country

136
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:24,356
﻿No.

137
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,426
﻿Nyssen, undress.

138
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,095
﻿Everything.

139
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,384
﻿I give you all of this

140
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,554
﻿The water, the clouds, the sun.

141
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:57,756
﻿And this shack.

142
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:03,195
﻿Sooner or later,
﻿it will all be expropriated anyway.

143
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,505
﻿Oh my God.

144
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:15,874
﻿The ferry!

145
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:19,945
﻿We have to go back
﻿or I won't make it for eight.

146
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,180
﻿You're home by eight. I promise.

147
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,117
﻿I have to go to work
﻿or they'll sack me. Fritz, please!

148
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:26,385
﻿You can trust me.

149
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:27,786
﻿I only mean you well.

150
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,022
- ﻿This is the last one.
- Yes. So?

151
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,358
﻿- I can't swim across.
- ﻿Greta. Do you trust me?

152
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,462
﻿Watch.

153
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,639
﻿Fritz?

154
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,875
﻿Hang on doll. Patience.

155
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,485
﻿Fritz?

156
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,259
﻿Almost ready.

157
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,094
﻿One sec.

158
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:20,606
﻿- You knew about this.
﻿- Here you are.

159
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,674
﻿- What?
- You've been here before.

160
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:25,077
﻿I had to arrange your return trip somehow.

161
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,323
﻿Yeah, the bread is old,
﻿but the beer is cold.

162
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,022
﻿There's the shore.

163
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:13,892
﻿Careful at the trees.

164
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:17,996
﻿Come on, Greta, come on!

165
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
﻿It'll be tight.

166
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:23,902
﻿You have my word, Greta.

167
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:26,972
﻿The next one is in two minutes.

168
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,241
﻿Otto. Have you been waiting long?

169
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,555
﻿Right, let's try these.

170
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,758
﻿- Barbituric acid derivative.
- What is it?

171
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,162
﻿For people like you it's pure nerve gold.

172
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:52,264
﻿Give me two more of those, please.

173
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,903
﻿Six to eight drops.

174
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,139
﻿It'll take a while
﻿until you find the right dose.

175
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,674
﻿Keep the change.

176
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,776
﻿Thank you. Bye.

177
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,275
﻿Tomorrow morning, 7am. Good night, Kruger.

178
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,820
﻿Hello?

179
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,021
﻿Coming!

180
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:56,361
﻿Good evening, Mr. Councillor.

181
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,863
﻿Miss Overbeck.

182
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,098
﻿Everyone is gone.

183
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,836
﻿- Your wife prepared some dinner for you.
- No, certainly not.

184
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:08,507
﻿Please fry these for me.

185
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:11,510
﻿I've been looking forward to them
﻿all week.

186
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:17,115
﻿And please get me a beer from the cellar,
﻿on the left, behind the coal.

187
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,384
﻿Thank you, Greta.

188
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,396
﻿- Nearly done.
﻿- What a lovely smell.

189
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,633
﻿I always get them from Scheunenviertel.
﻿It's the only place.

190
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,304
﻿Have you eaten, Miss Overbeck?

191
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:43,441
- ﻿Me? No, later, when you have eaten...
﻿- Would you keep me company?

192
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,277
﻿I'll get another beer.

193
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,216
﻿Here, they taste best right here
﻿in the kitchen. Come on.

194
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,690
﻿By the way, Greta.

195
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,427
﻿No word to anyone.

196
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:06,064
﻿We're surrounded by enemies of the state.

197
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,748
﻿You have a visitor.

198
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,954
﻿Ten minutes, no bodily contact.

199
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,001
﻿What's up?

200
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,544
﻿These are hard times for me.

201
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,614
﻿They'll get worse now.

202
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,617
﻿You have no idea how bad it is already.

203
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,753
﻿Yes, I have.

204
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,090
﻿I'm to blame.

205
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,830
﻿No, Svetlana, you're not.
﻿You're not to bl...

206
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,498
﻿Be silent and listen to me.

207
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,670
﻿You trusted me.

208
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,741
﻿I betrayed you.

209
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:26,378
﻿What are you talking about?

210
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,547
﻿I'm talking about the train.

211
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,220
﻿What do you know about the train?

212
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:39,057
﻿Everything.

213
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,495
﻿Come here!

214
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:48,667
﻿Get the coppers!
﻿Do you hear me? Come here!

215
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:54,673
﻿Come here already, come here!

216
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,941
﻿Are you ready?

217
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,410
﻿Yes, get the coppers, I need my stuff!

218
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:04,115
﻿In there? That's impossible.

219
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,650
﻿What kind of place is this?

220
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,319
﻿It's where the bigwigs go.

221
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:10,689
﻿First they talk and eat,
﻿then they dance and screw.

222
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,391
﻿Politicians, bankers, our bosses.

223
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,860
- ﻿Where is the film?
﻿- This will be trouble.

224
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:20,532
﻿Behind the restaurant,
﻿up the stairs, there are rooms.

225
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,171
﻿Where are the films stored?

226
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,340
﻿In the Armenian's room.

227
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:30,275
﻿Shit.

228
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:32,711
﻿- What Armenian? Who is he?
- Listen.

229
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,981
﻿We'll go home, get the official papers,

230
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,016
﻿and we'll come back tomorrow
﻿with a full team.

231
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:40,952
- ﻿Where's the room?
- Pas﻿t the bar,

232
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,356
﻿there is a hallway with a door
﻿on the other side of the room.

233
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,258
- ﻿Can I have my bloody stuff already?
- In that room...

234
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:48,893
﻿where are the films?

235
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:53,732
﻿There is a rock, a huge boulder,

236
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,500
﻿and all the stuff is in there.

237
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,535
﻿- A safe?
- Something like that.

238
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:03,842
﻿- And the Armenian has the key?
- ﻿No, it's in golden thingies,

239
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,145
﻿a kind of, I don't know, moons.

240
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:13,418
﻿No. don't go.

241
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,987
﻿No, don't go!

242
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:20,258
﻿Stay here, you arseholes. You promised!

243
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,130
﻿I'll go in first.

244
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,133
﻿You'll send him in after.

245
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:46,017
- ﻿Good evening, sir.
﻿- I have a reservation.

246
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:52,157
﻿How about you go in and kick up a fuss?

247
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:55,026
- ﻿When you come back, I'll give you this.
- No.

248
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,328
﻿But not before, and only then.

249
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,479
- Th﻿ank you.
﻿- You're welcome.

250
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:15,547
﻿Mocha, please.

251
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,714
﻿Coming right up.

252
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,021
﻿Madam, sir?

253
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:27,225
﻿Right, off you go.

254
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:44,776
﻿Forget it, man.

255
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,312
﻿- Get the maitre.
﻿- Like hell I will.

256
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,815
﻿Tell him,
﻿the Armenian is expecting me.

257
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:58,590
﻿Wait.

258
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,962
﻿You are crazy my child
﻿you have to go to Berlin.

259
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:10,468
﻿Where the crazies are,
﻿that's where you belong.

260
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:28,586
﻿What is it, Franz?

261
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:31,356
﻿Evening, Edgar. I have something for you.

262
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,901
﻿I... found something out.

263
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:46,571
﻿Something... big.

264
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,876
﻿It's about heaps of money.

265
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:55,280
- ﻿But I want a share of it.
- Is that all?

266
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,520
﻿Hey!

267
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,692
﻿My valuable life time is ticking by, and I
﻿don't know what for. So get to the point.

268
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:12,597
﻿The police are channelling off weapons
﻿from their storehouse.

269
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:06,251
﻿What I said about the weapons
﻿and the police, it's true, I swear.

270
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:07,385
﻿What is this?

271
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,388
﻿I know the storehouse.
﻿I can take you there.

272
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:15,093
﻿I don't need your connections
﻿with the police.

273
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:18,129
﻿I own the police.

274
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:34,812
﻿Don't show your face here again.

275
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,454
﻿Don't touch your gun.

276
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:18,289
﻿Don't turn around.

277
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,058
﻿I'll shoot you on the spot.

278
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,007
﻿To the window.

279
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:39,510
﻿The curtain. Down.

280
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:52,590
﻿Spread it.

281
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,405
﻿The inspector from Cologne.

282
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:11,843
﻿Put the films on the fabric.

283
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,445
﻿- All of them.
﻿- Forget it

284
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:33,030
﻿Do it.

285
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:49,180
﻿- Shit, you bastards.
﻿- Why are you back already?

286
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:50,882
﻿- Shit!
- Where is Rath?

287
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:52,283
﻿They'll kill us all

288
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,286
﻿- Pull yourself together.
﻿- I want to get away. Away!

289
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,256
﻿- Give me my stuff already!
- Shut up.

290
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:03,728
﻿Stay here. Hey! Stay here!

291
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:05,930
﻿Get a move on.

292
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,635
﻿Boss, is everything alright?

293
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:13,471
﻿Boss?

294
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,043
﻿Yes, everything is fine.

295
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:24,615
﻿Get lost.

296
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:31,923
﻿How do you want to get out of here?

297
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,724
﻿Together with you. Off we go.

298
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:54,412
﻿Gereon Rath. We know everything about you.

299
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,983
﻿We know where you live, where you work,
﻿when you sleep, when you shit,

300
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,985
﻿- we know your pub, your father...
- Shut up!

301
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:03,287
﻿...your sister-in-law,
﻿your nephew, everything.

302
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:05,823
﻿Keep going.

303
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:07,992
﻿Yukatan.

304
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,130
﻿Move it, go on.

305
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:27,805
﻿Get down!

306
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,648
﻿Stop! Knock it off!

307
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:58,970
﻿No-one shoots again.

308
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,211
﻿Drop your guns.

309
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,780
﻿Don't overdo it, boy.

310
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:11,849
﻿Tell them to drop their guns.

311
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:13,484
﻿Go on.

312
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:16,754
﻿Drop the guns.

313
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,125
﻿I said, drop the guns!

314
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:30,101
﻿Pick it up.

315
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:44,982
﻿Keep playing.

316
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,743
﻿Stay calm, mate. Stay calm.

317
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:19,383
﻿Go to the car over there.

318
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,500
﻿Right, what will you do with him?

319
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,972
﻿Get lost.

320
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:17,907
﻿Get out.

321
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,183
﻿Here. Take this.

322
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,722
﻿Go some place.

323
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,227
﻿It's best if you disappear for a while.

324
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,238
﻿Do something with it.

325
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,448
﻿You really are something.

326
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:05,889
﻿What do we do with the films now?
﻿There are politicians in them.

327
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,691
﻿It's a kind of life insurance.

328
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,894
﻿We'll watch them.

329
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,497
﻿Come on.

330
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,666
﻿Let's go.

331
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:31,815
﻿I know him.

332
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,050
﻿He's... he's a city councilman.

333
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,660
﻿I even know his wife.

334
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:49,199
﻿Oh, wonderful.

335
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,101
﻿Everybody who's anybody is in this.

336
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,677
﻿How many more do we have?

337
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:03,146
﻿It's the last one.

338
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,335
﻿PUBLIC TELEPHONE

339
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,841
﻿Please give me Cologne, 13-0-8.

340
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,182
- ﻿I'm listening.
- It'﻿s me.

341
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,250
﻿Gereon.

342
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:49,819
﻿I've got the film.

343
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,490
﻿- All of it?
﻿- Yes.

344
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,526
﻿Negative and positive.

345
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,561
﻿Destroyed.

346
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:01,764
﻿You destroyed everything there and then?

347
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,334
﻿Gereon?

348
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,735
﻿Of course.

349
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:10,907
﻿Thank you, my son.

350
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,444
﻿When are you coming back?

351
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:20,817
﻿I won't come back.

352
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:11,934
﻿Sure?

353
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:12,694
﻿If you want to close my place down,
﻿today's the wrong day.

354
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,808
﻿Bruno, I have to ask you something.

355
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,346
﻿Where did you get my medicine from?

356
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:35,350
﻿From your girl.

357
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,487
﻿The little cheeky one. Charlotte.

358
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:44,426
﻿Look at it this way.

359
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,430
﻿A guy like me has to make sure
﻿he knows who is looking over my shoulder.

360
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,499
﻿But that's water under the bridge.

361
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,686
﻿What's that in English?

362
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,422
﻿Sex and crime.

363
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:37,979
﻿Edgar.

364
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:41,082
﻿I can see you're very upset.

365
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,218
﻿I get it.

366
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:49,024
﻿I'm really very sorry this happened.

367
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:56,331
﻿I'm very grateful to you.
﻿for acting so prudently.

368
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,168
﻿I owe you my thanks.
﻿Forever, and you know that.

369
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,205
﻿That's how capacities complete each other.

370
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:08,410
﻿- Boss?
﻿- Yes?

371
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:09,678
﻿We've got them.

372
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:12,180
﻿- Where?
- At the Pepita Bar.

373
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,105
﻿Cheers.

374
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:10,905
﻿- Where is he?
- ﻿They're sitting over there.

375
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,487
...﻿we will
﻿further enhance this state of relaxation

376
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:35,023
﻿which is flowing
﻿through your entire body now

377
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:39,461
﻿even more, by you opening
﻿your eyes once very briefly

378
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:40,929
﻿and closing them again.

379
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,467
﻿When you close them, you will enter
﻿an even deeper state of relaxation

380
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,539
﻿Open your eyes.

381
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,774
﻿Now.

382
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,977
﻿Good.

383
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:58,747
﻿Close your eyes,

384
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,783
﻿but don't try to fight it.

385
00:41:03,886 --> 00:41:05,520
﻿I'll count backwards now.

386
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:07,655
﻿One hundred...

387
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:09,457
﻿What happened? Can you hear me?

388
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:10,759
﻿Can you hear me?

389
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,727
﻿- Where did you get my medication from?
- From your girl.

390
00:41:12,828 --> 00:41:15,864
﻿- Can I ask you a favour?
﻿- You don't have to. I get it.

391
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,599
﻿- Ninety-nine...
﻿- You lied to me.

392
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,198
- ﻿I didn't.
﻿- No?

393
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,935
﻿Ninety-eight...

394
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:23,772
﻿Ninety-seven...

395
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:15,256
﻿Hey, Mr. Rath.

396
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:17,759
﻿Hello?

397
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,462
﻿Wake up.

398
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,438
﻿Gereon.

399
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,957
﻿What happened?

400
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,860
﻿What's the matter with you?

401
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:02,504
﻿Where have you been all night?

402
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:06,975
﻿Shall I open it for you?

403
00:43:16,252 --> 00:43:17,252
﻿Get lost.

404
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:20,288
﻿- What's wrong?
﻿- Get lost!

405
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:23,258
﻿- I'll get help.
- I don't want to see you again.

406
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:24,726
﻿Get lost!

407
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:51,119
﻿Dearest Helga,

408
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,023
﻿my thoughts have been churning
﻿in my head for days and weeks,

409
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,093
﻿of me, of us.
﻿They're almost falling over each other.

410
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,764
﻿But one of them has caught on
﻿and become solid.

411
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:07,268
﻿I can't live this secrecy anymore,
﻿I don't want to live it anymore.

412
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:10,805
﻿You say, you can't start
﻿from scratch in Berlin.

413
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,409
﻿I have to understand that.
﻿even though I find it hard.

414
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,444
﻿But I can't return to Cologne, either.

415
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:19,981
﻿Back to a life which shirks the truth.
﻿hides from it.

416
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,718
﻿Forgive me. Gereon.

417
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,492
﻿No

417
00:44:32,305 --> 00:45:32,461

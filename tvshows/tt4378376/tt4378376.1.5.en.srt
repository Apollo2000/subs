00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,666
﻿It is our duty
﻿to build a bulwark against anarchy.

3
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:18,035
﻿They shot them down
﻿like sparrows off the roof.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,570
﻿Hang on, no-one saw that.

5
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,807
﻿The blood is not even dry yet
﻿and you're already covering it up.

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,176
﻿Don’t you recognise me anymore?

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,310
﻿Greta!

8
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,546
﻿Must have been under a car.

9
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,081
﻿Doesn’t look like an accident.

10
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,984
﻿He wasn't a tough guy.
﻿I realised that too late.

11
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,520
﻿What else does your landlady
﻿know about this Kardakov?

12
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:36,788
﻿Allegedly, he's on tour.

13
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:38,923
﻿They were all killed because of you.

14
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,725
﻿They are all dead!

15
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:43,427
﻿I wanted to ask if you
﻿have looked into the previous tenant.

16
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:46,998
﻿Kardakov's lover
﻿lives at Meraner Strasse, number seven.

17
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,599
﻿I'm meeting him.

18
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,169
﻿Put me through to the Soviet embassy.

﻿Go on.

33

﻿Sveta, where are you?

34
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,909
﻿We need to go.

35
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:41,746
﻿What's with the masquerade?

36
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,047
﻿What's going on?

37
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:46,183
﻿They’re coming after us.
﻿They're already on the stairs.

﻿Svetlana I beg you, come on!

39
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,755
﻿They’ll shoot us right away.

40
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:55,192
﻿Not us. You.

﻿You bastard!

42
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,393
﻿That bastard sliced open my hand!

﻿Done.

45
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,162
﻿- Give it to me.
- No!

46
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,564
- ﻿Let go.
﻿- Stop!

47
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,166
- ﻿Give it to me!
- No!

48
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300

﻿Morning.

53
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,353
﻿Where were you last night?
﻿I didn't find you.

54
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,889
﻿I thought you weren't coming back.
﻿I had no idea where you had gone.

55
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,725
﻿Have you slept?

﻿Come on, then.

57
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,171
- ﻿Berta, where's the Widow?
- Downstairs.

58

- ﻿May I interrupt?
﻿- You already have.

59
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,350
﻿I won't be long. This is Greta.

60
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,886
﻿- So?
- Comes highly recommended.

61
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,697
﻿I'm interested.

62
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,600
﻿She should take a shower.

63
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,970
﻿The showers at the Palace
﻿are out of order, hence the request.

64
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,339
﻿Vocal chords are in working order, yeah?

65
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,874
﻿Hello, Madam.

66
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,676
﻿Don't you Madam me.

67
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,579
﻿You may well be a beauty,
﻿but I can't see what's underneath.

68
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:21,549
﻿- Can we borrow from the wardrobe?
﻿- You do that anyway.

69
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,284
﻿Come on.

70
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,789
- ﻿Impress me, children.
- We Will.

71
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,798
﻿You get three marks per visit.
﻿You'll be able to take a room tomorrow.

72
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,402
﻿And you can borrow the clothes.
﻿You just have to return them.

73
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,871
﻿You have to wash them, but...

74
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,040
﻿you can take what you like.

75
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:50,978
﻿Greta?

76
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,659
﻿I can't do this.

﻿But Greta, you're beautiful.

78
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,532
﻿But I can't do this.

79
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,568
﻿But why not?

80
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,872
﻿I promise, it's not that bad.
﻿You can choose the guys.

81
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,808
﻿You don't like them, you rebuff them.
﻿That's how it works.

82
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,357
﻿Is it inflamed?

83
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,159
﻿A little.

84
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,232
﻿It's OK.

85
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,801
﻿We'll find something for you.

86
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,137
﻿Yes.

87
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,572
﻿Come here.

88
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,109
﻿Everything will be alright.

89
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:57,779
﻿My Gretchen.

90
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,368
﻿Lignose.

91
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,815
- ﻿Stefan.
﻿- Charlotte.

92
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:11,352
﻿- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

93
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,387
﻿I'm looking for a file right now.

94
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,792
﻿But this is
﻿Detective Sergeant Wolter's desk.

95
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,027
﻿Yes, and I'm his assistant.

96
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,165
﻿What are you doing here?

97
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,371
﻿I'm supposed to deliver something,
﻿but only in person. Where is he?

98
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,874
﻿Wolter? Somewhere in the building.

99
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,311
- ﻿Alright, I'll come back later.
- Sure.

100
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,115
﻿Oh, is the invitation still valid?

101
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,618
﻿Sunday at 11? The first bath?

102
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,020
- ﻿At your club, I thought.
- Oh.

103
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,955
﻿Yes, of course.

104
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,591
﻿At the entrance. I'll take you in.

105
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,227
﻿Nice.

106
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,445
﻿I tried everything. More is not possible.

107
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:20,288
﻿I'd ask at the film lab
﻿where they store the negatives.

108
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,590
﻿They do?

109
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,593
﻿See the right-hand bottom corner,
﻿near the perforation?

110
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,461
﻿It's cheap material.

111
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,899
﻿The film's positive, the snippet you
﻿found, with which it was developed.

112
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,501
﻿- So?
- The material

113
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:36,103
﻿was imported from Yugoslavia, from Zagreb.

114
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,373
﻿I asked around. If I may?

115
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,442
﻿Of course.

116
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:45,246
﻿The only film lab
﻿where they sometimes use Rodacor is Geyer.

117
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,448
﻿- Where is it?
﻿- In Neukölln.

118
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:48,649
﻿It's a big shop.

119
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,652
﻿- Does that help you?
- Yes.

120
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,955
﻿Thank you for your efforts.

121
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,363
﻿Yucatan.

122
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:21,582
﻿Hello, I'd like a Cologne number.
﻿13-0-8. Thank you.

124
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,404
﻿Helga, it's me.

125
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,139
﻿- Gereon.
- ﻿Can you talk?

126
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:48,042
﻿Yes, of course. Did something happen?

127
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,379
﻿I just wanted to get in touch.

128
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,781
﻿I had a strange dream.

129
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,284
﻿Of Anno.

130
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,022
﻿I mean, of his Trakehner horse.

132
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,058
﻿Yes.

133
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,028
﻿Gereon?

134
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:08,662
﻿Yes?

135
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,366
﻿I miss you so much.

136
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,168
﻿Why don’t you come here?

137
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:16,971
﻿Come to Berlin.

138
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,840
﻿But I can't just do that.

139
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,043
﻿No-one would give a damn about us.

140
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,979
﻿- How do you mean?
- I mean...

141
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,915
﻿It would be nice to have you here.

142
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,186
﻿You mean, you and I
﻿and two beers at Tiergarten,

143
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:36,090
﻿at night dancing at Resi's
﻿and breakfast at Krumme Lanke?

144
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,927
﻿"Everyone needs to see Berlin."

145
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,097
﻿Everyone needs to see Berlin.

146
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:45,566
﻿Oh, that would be nice.

147
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,135
﻿But it's not that simple.

148
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,104
﻿Yes.

149
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:53,841
﻿You’re right. It was a silly idea.

150
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,978
﻿I have to go now.

151
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:03,984
﻿Have you seen this?

152
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:04,985
﻿200 DEAD?

153
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,569
﻿Murderers! Murderers!

154
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,971
﻿Murderers! Murderers...

00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,045
﻿BLOODY STREETFIGHTS
﻿200 DEAD?

156
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,982
﻿And this is
﻿what happened to us in Oranienstrasse.

157
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,985
﻿The official version.
﻿About the two ladies.

158
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,860
"﻿We were shot at from various sides.

159
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:50,297
﻿Some of the communists were shooting
﻿at myself and Detective Rath."

160
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,365
﻿Are you serious?

161
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,601
﻿A hand needs to be washed by a hand.

162
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,936
﻿If you want to take, you have to give

163
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,207
﻿The top dogs are under a lot of pressure.

164
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,516
﻿FIGHT WITH KPD
﻿DOWN WITH POLICE KILLERS

165
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,419
﻿Comrades.

166
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:16,690
﻿Workers were shot down like dogs.

167
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,095
﻿- Flats were ransacked!
﻿- You can add your own style.

168
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,697
- ﻿Children abused!
﻿- I'm no man of words.

169
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:24,965
﻿By the men

170
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,102
- ﻿behind the walls of this building here.
- God, her again.

171
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,975
﻿I myself witnessed
﻿how they attempted to frame our fighters

172
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,979
﻿for a murder by the police.
﻿Of two innocent women!

173
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:45,052
﻿And the chief of police
﻿tells the public to keep cool.

174
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:51,692
﻿"Keep cool" in this situation
﻿is the most inappropriate of all slogans.

175
00:16:54,162 --> 00:17:00,067
﻿For the blood of our comrades is seeping
﻿away in the cobblestones of our streets.

176
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:03,037
﻿Shed by those murderers in uniform.

177
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,078
﻿We need to put an immediate stop
﻿to this agitation.

178
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,815
﻿Workers' blood is flowing in Berlin!

179
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,818
﻿We don't keep cool.

180
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,421
﻿We're at boiling point!

181
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,826
﻿I will have the square cleared.

182
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,761
﻿Karl...

183
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:31,165
﻿we need to tread carefully,
﻿not exert more pressure.

184
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:34,368
﻿Otherwise the situation will escalate.

185
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:38,105
﻿Should we give them more time
﻿to stage a storming of the Bastille?

186
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,140
﻿We're not the Bastille.

187
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,209
﻿The Lord Mayor Böss!

188
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:43,978
﻿Gentlemen.

189
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,915
﻿They have gone completely wild out there.

190
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,484
﻿Why don't you take a seat, Lord Mayor?

191
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:55,623
﻿What are you planning to do?
﻿The entire city is in turmoil!

192
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,426
﻿We have initiated
﻿a number of action steps.

193
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:02,162
﻿By tonight
﻿we'll be in total control again.

194
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,564
﻿What are those steps?

195
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,866
﻿A curfew after dark,

196
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:09,136
﻿in all affected neighbourhoods.
﻿Street-facing windows need to be closed.

197
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,171
﻿Civilians are banned
﻿from carrying weapons.

198
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:16,076
﻿Noncompliance can mean
﻿that our officers will open fire.

199
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,612
﻿- That's not very...
﻿- Not very what?

200
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,783
﻿Our own party organ
﻿mentions up to 200 dead.

201
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,585
﻿That is false information.

202
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,488
﻿- Is it?
- The hospitals report fewer casualties.

203
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,225
﻿And this?
﻿"Execution by police bullets."

204
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,129
﻿It's the two Kreuzberg women.
﻿They're martyrs already.

205
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:38,198
﻿How do you want to interpret this?
﻿Self-defence?

206
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:43,037
﻿We have a couple of witnesses from vice,
﻿they're writing a report

207
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:45,706
﻿which will shine
﻿the right light on things for us.

208
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,378
﻿Maybe there is a way
﻿to turn the mood around.

209
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:53,447
﻿Which is?

210
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,050
﻿We keep learning that
﻿it's all a question of interpretation.

211
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,324
﻿No-one is writing "The demonstrators were
﻿armed" or "we, the police were attacked."

212
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,226
﻿But we’d need proof.

213
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,697
﻿An injured policeman.
﻿Something unambiguous.

214
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,699
﻿Yes.

215
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,701
﻿That's right.

216
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,706
﻿Murderers! Murderers!

217
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,382
﻿Inspector, this is the way out.

218
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,322
﻿Violence is the midwife
﻿of every new society.

219
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,227
﻿This is what Marx is teaching us.

220
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:45,132
﻿And those times are violent, comrades

221
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,603
﻿For each of our dead comrades...

222
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:50,971
﻿Can I become a member?

223
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,806
﻿Sure, register here, comrade.

224
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:57,344
...﻿we should liquidate one of the
﻿representatives of this oppressive regime!

225
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:03,117
﻿That's the only language
﻿those people understand.

226
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:06,220
﻿Murderers! Murderers...

227
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,863
﻿Alright, call a press conference.

228
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,198
﻿Very good. Yes.

229
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,620
﻿Flown the nest. Both of them.

230
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:43,157
﻿- When do you expect them back?
﻿- Do I have to tell you?

231
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:46,627
﻿I can take you back to the station
﻿where we'll write a report.

232
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:49,863
﻿I have no idea when they're back.
﻿It's always different.

233
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,964
﻿They're artists.

234
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,203
﻿- Do you have the key to the flat?
﻿- Not right now.

235
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,172
﻿- He's got it.
﻿- Kardakov?

236
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:01,175
- Yes.
﻿- When was he here?

237
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,609
﻿Last night.

238
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,846
﻿- What?
- Yes. He had forgotten his key.

239
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,382
﻿And he didn’t return mine, of course.

240
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:12,619
﻿- So maybe he's in?
- I thought you already rang the bell.

241
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,156
﻿I'll go upstairs and knock, OK?

242
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,759
﻿Sure, I'll wait.

243
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:20,961
﻿Second floor?

244
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,177
﻿Miss Detective?

245
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:48,856
﻿- Nothing. Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

246
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:28,161
﻿Someone up there?

247
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,252
﻿Hello?

248
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:57,084
﻿- To the Holländer.
﻿- Yes, Mr. Trechkov.

249
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,631
﻿That's her.

250
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,900
﻿Hello, miss.

251
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,635
﻿Do you have your service card?

252
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,973
﻿There is no Johann König here.
﻿Do you have a company name?

253
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,742
﻿König Film Production.

254
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,646
﻿König Film Production.

255
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:34,915
﻿I don't have that.

256
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:36,483
﻿Nothing at all? No?

257
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:41,388
﻿What about Krajewski, Franz?

258
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:45,125
﻿Yes, here.

259
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:49,463
﻿- Are you Mr. Krajewski?
- No﻿, I'm his deputy.

260
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:52,966
﻿Only this gentleman
﻿can collect the material.

261
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:57,270
﻿Alright. Who is the technical supervisor
﻿of this order?

262
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:10,650
﻿Film 701, Sternberg,
Mrs. Dietrich 195, take 3.

263
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:15,722
﻿Listen, you can't just...

264
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,391
﻿You should have been a genius.
﻿One more time.

265
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,262
﻿Mr. Meyer, I'm sorry. I tried to stop him,
﻿but he just walked in.

266
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,164
﻿What's going on, Meyer?

267
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,967
﻿- That's impossible.
﻿- I'm sorry, Mr. Director.

268
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,306
﻿What are you thinking? Is this piano
﻿playing? Am I to sing to that crap?

269
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,609
﻿That's OK for the wash tub, but not here.

270
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,278
﻿Who's the lady?

271
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,480
﻿That's...

272
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:44,551
﻿Dietrich.

273
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,753
﻿Dietrich.

274
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:49,489
﻿Marlene Dietrich, you cretin.

275
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:54,928
﻿What do you want?

276
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:56,763
﻿I'm with vice.

277
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,265
﻿I want to talk to you.

278
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,400
﻿Here or at the station.

279
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,602
﻿Meyer, are you quite done?

280
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,471
﻿I haven't stolen my time.

281
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:05,906
﻿For God's sake!

282
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,909
﻿Please put me through to Cologne, 13-0-8.

283
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,747
﻿- Hello?
﻿- It's me.

284
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:17,384
﻿They only ever made one copy
﻿of each of König's films.

285
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,653
﻿Are you sure?

286
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:23,623
﻿- Yes.
- And the negative?

287
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:27,928
﻿They're not storing the negatives there.
﻿The courier always took them.

288
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,397
- ﻿Can you get a hold of the courier?
- Yes.

289
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:35,702
﻿You know I guaranteed that we would solve
﻿this problem before the elections.

290
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,370
﻿I'm aware of that Father.

291
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,172
﻿Alright, keep me posted.

292
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,943
﻿- Krajewski?
- Hasn’t been here yet.

293
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,903
﻿TOWARDS SEESTRASSE
﻿WEDDING

294
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,171
﻿Train to Wedding, board now.

295
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,644
﻿I don’t have any news.

296
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:52,412
﻿But I do.

297
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,347
﻿I went to the film lab.

298
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,850
﻿Train to Wedding, please stand back.

299
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,389
﻿Stand back!

300
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,360
﻿He's a copper!

301
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,463
﻿A copper, comrades. A murderer!

302
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:14,467
﻿Hey, you. Traitor of the working classes.
﻿Get lost.

303
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:17,771
- ﻿We don't want any
- Poli﻿ce pigs...

304
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,123
﻿And this

305
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:42,963
﻿And this.

306
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,499
﻿And many more.

307
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:50,804
﻿What do you want me to do?

308
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,672
﻿Nothing.

309
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:54,941
﻿Absolutely nothing at all.

310
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:58,044
﻿But one day...

311
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,246
﻿this could change.

312
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:06,419
﻿Kardakov is outside.

313
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:09,322
- Who?
﻿- The violinist.

314
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,525
﻿- What does he want?
﻿- I don't know.

315
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:19,799
﻿He's messing up my car.
﻿He's not paying, either.

316
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,106
﻿Mr. Kardakov, what do you want from me?

317
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,676
﻿I have something for you.

318
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:33,279
﻿I didn't hear you.

319
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:39,419
﻿Gold. The gold of the Sorokins.

320
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:49,029
﻿- What? On my behalf?
﻿- You'll come and collect her?

321
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:53,299
﻿- And where?
- Section 14, Charlottenburg.

322
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,307
﻿Thank you.

323
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:07,247
﻿I know, those were dishonest methods.
﻿But I have neither name nor rank to lose

324
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:09,315
﻿- I get to make mistakes.
- Mistakes.

325
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:13,119
﻿Pretending to be police
﻿and breaking into a flat is not a mistake.

326
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,888
- ﻿What is it?
﻿- It's worse.

327
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:17,957
- ﻿You lied to me.
- I d﻿id not.

328
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,994
﻿- No?
- You thought I was Böhm's assistant.

329
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,430
﻿I just responded to your wish.

330
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,667
﻿Besides, I found something.

331
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,336
﻿This bullet.

332
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,040
﻿- The colleague at the station said...
﻿- He's not your colleague.

333
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:38,144
﻿I'm sorry. Your colleague said
﻿it is 6.35 calibre.

334
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,684
﻿Detective Inspector. Mr. Rath!

335
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:46,753
﻿Don't be like this.

336
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,322
﻿It's alright.

337
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:55,228
﻿By the way,
﻿Alexey Kardakov was there last night.

338
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,631
﻿Where, in Berlin?

339
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,967
﻿In Sorokina's flat.

340
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,937
﻿He had forgotten his key,
﻿said the caretaker.

341
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:09,776
﻿- So he really didn't leave the city.
- Looks like it...

342
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:12,445
﻿- Come on.
﻿- Where to?

343
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,515
﻿We'll take a closer look
﻿at what's in the suitcase.

344
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:18,985
﻿Let me do this.

345
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:23,523
﻿Come on.

346
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,142
﻿And this?

347
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:44,244
﻿Have you heard of this?

348
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,379
﻿Trechkov.

349
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,216
﻿Kardakov and Sorokina
﻿play with Ilya Trechkov.

350
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,218
- I know him.
- ﻿Who is he?

351
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,022
﻿A famous bandmaster.
﻿He plays with Uncle Jim at Holländer.

352
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:59,526
﻿But usually with a different band.
﻿On Saturdays.

353
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,261
﻿That's today.

354
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:05,098
- ﻿That's great, we'll go.
- We?

355
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,201
﻿Why should I take you?

356
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:10,603
﻿Because I know where Holländer is
﻿and you don't.

357
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,438
﻿And no-one else you know does.

358
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:15,642
﻿- And if they knew they wouldn't tell you.
- Oh yeah?

359
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,677
﻿Yes, you’re the police.

360
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:22,115
﻿Are you eating this?

361
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:34,027
﻿Ortgies, 6.35 calibre.
﻿What does that tell you?

362
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:37,363
- ﻿Would be fitting for Kardakov.
- Why?

363
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,668
﻿It's a "weapon for the opera". Used
﻿by people who don’t know how to shoot.

364
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,437
﻿Musicians, artists, and such like.

365
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,978
﻿So, tonight, 9pm at Holländer.

366
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:56,983
﻿Nine? No point in going there
﻿before midnight. More like 1 or 2am.

367
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:02,655
﻿- Alright, midnight then.
﻿- Friedrichstrasse station. It’s nearby.

368
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:09,629
﻿I'm with Weltbühne.
﻿I’m an accredited journalist. Excuse me...

369
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:10,997
﻿I don't believe this.

370
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:15,435
﻿Hello, neighbour.

371
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:18,671
﻿Mr. Katelbach. What’s going on?

372
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,441
﻿Your presidentsky
﻿is trying to save his honour.

373
00:34:21,508 --> 00:34:23,776
﻿Like, if the reds shoot, so can we.

374
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:28,047
﻿I'm afraid we’re missing half of it.
﻿You wouldn't happen to know a back door?

375
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,516
﻿Gentlemen,
﻿welcome to this press conference.

376
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:35,154
﻿We called it to shed the right light on
﻿some things.

377
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:36,656
﻿- Excuse me.
﻿- Excuse me.

378
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,759
﻿Excuse me. The gentleman is with me.

379
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,227
﻿We must hold up the facts.

380
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:45,999
﻿It wasn't the police who incited the
﻿riots, but the communist associations

381
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,936
﻿who, without any respect of state order,

382
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,873
﻿called for an attack on the police forces

383
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:58,678
﻿who were there for de-escalation.

384
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,782
﻿Let me introduce one of our heroes to you,

385
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:06,119
﻿whose brave commitment for law and order

386
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:09,656
﻿received a hail of bullets from
﻿trigger-happy Bolsheviks in thanks.

387
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:11,524
﻿Constable Fritz Dörr.

388
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,264
﻿A true hero, him?

389
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,600
﻿Lies!

390
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:21,901
﻿Boom.

391
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:24,737
﻿Great.

392
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:27,407
﻿On behalf of the Fatherland: Thank you.

393
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,508
﻿Great.

394
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:49,295
﻿WANTED: CARETAKER SECRETARY
﻿CLEANING PERSONNEL

395
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:51,397
﻿MECHANICS GUARDSMEN
﻿DOG HANDLERS ARCHIVISTS

396
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,933
﻿Hello. I have an application.

397
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,868
- ﻿Criminal assistance.
﻿- Department?

398
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:57,003
﻿Murder.

399
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:59,505
﻿Do you have your certificate of conduct?

400
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:02,108
- ﻿I'll hand it in later.
﻿- Put it in there.

401
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:07,113
﻿APPLICATIONS

402
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:17,890
﻿Housemaid wanted.

403
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,926
﻿State councillor Benda.

404
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:30,236
﻿- Is this the exact wording?
- Yes.

405
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,404
﻿Very good.

406
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,241
﻿Any other new findings?

407
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,945
﻿Unforeseen risks?

408
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:41,614
﻿I'm invisible.

409
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,282
﻿I'm sure of it.

410
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,886
﻿You must never be sure of anything.

411
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,723
﻿Of course.

412
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,293
﻿You know how sensitive this affair is.

413
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:58,398
﻿At some point the decisive clue
﻿will present itself.

414
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:01,768
﻿We must make sure
﻿we won't miss the moment.

415
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,070
﻿I know, Mr. Councillor.

416
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:10,977
﻿- You're doing a good job, Stefan.
- Thank you.

417
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:15,581
﻿But strike the word "security"
﻿from your vocabulary.

418
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:16,749
﻿Yes, sir.

419
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,743
- Excuse me.
﻿- Golly! You look good.

420
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,246
﻿How charming! Come.

421
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,068
- ﻿Evening.
﻿- Evening.

422
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,642
﻿Bellissima! How you light up our house.

423
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:20,146
﻿Shall we go powder our nose?

424
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,281
﻿I'll be right back.

425
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,794
﻿Then I always only think of уоu

426
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:40,833
﻿Then I always think of you

427
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:45,738
﻿I tell myself

428
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:50,676
﻿My rose, stay and never forget me

429
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,158
﻿Inspector?

430
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:11,998
﻿Mr. Gräf

431
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,035
﻿- I didn't expect you here.
﻿- I didn't expect you, either.

432
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:20,006
﻿Excuse me.

433
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:21,908
﻿Good evening.

434
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:25,311
﻿- Amazing as always.
﻿- Same goes for you.

435
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,079
﻿Hello, darling.

436
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,248
﻿Long time no see. Everything fine?

437
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,384
- ﻿Yes. And yourself?
- Good.

438
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,619
﻿I'll have what he's having.

439
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,155
﻿Lemonade for the lady.

440
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,392
﻿What? With a shot, please.

441
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:40,927
﻿- And you?
﻿- Thanks.

442
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:42,795
﻿I have to go back to my family.

443
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,163
﻿Inspector.

444
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,911
﻿Is that Trechkov? On stage?

445
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,382
﻿Yes, that's him.
﻿We'll meet him in the break.

446
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:11,157
﻿Shall we?

447
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,064
﻿Oh, Kardakov.

448
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:21,901
﻿He's wasting his talent, the moron.

449
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:25,638
I hate him.
﻿He's so gifted you have to hate him.

450
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,308
﻿I told him, you are our real star.

451
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:32,311
﻿Your crazy violin is of the devil.

452
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,880
﻿And he goes off to play revolution.

453
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:37,750
﻿I hate him. I hate that fortress.

454
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,820
- ﻿The Red Fortress, right?
﻿- They're crazy.

455
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,222
﻿They actually think
﻿they could topple Stalin.

456
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:46,158
﻿The whole thing is a ghastly idiocy.

457
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:51,564
﻿The leader, Trotsky, is down in Turkey,
﻿wasting the lives of other people.

458
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,833
﻿- I hate him.
- What about the countess?

459
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,868
﻿- Ms. Sorokina?
﻿- Oh, her.

460
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:58,671
﻿She's made it all worse.

461
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,641
﻿She's turned his head.

462
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:04,377
﻿Then she ran off with him.

463
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:06,879
﻿I hate her.

464
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:09,315
﻿Where could this Kardakov be?

465
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,152
﻿I swore I would keep it to myself, but...

466
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,989
﻿discretion is not my passion.

467
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:21,761
﻿In Köpenick.

468
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:26,065
﻿At Wormsstrasse.

469
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,501
﻿There's some kind of basement.

470
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,003
﻿In there is a printer's.

471
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,639
﻿And?

472
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,009
﻿It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress.

473
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:52,324
- ﻿I love that piece.
- So do I.

474
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:55,061
- What?
﻿- Want to dance?

475
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:56,629
﻿Are you serious?

476
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:15,281
﻿Are you married, by the by?

477
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:19,085
﻿But going steady?

478
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:20,319
﻿It's not that simple.

479
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:23,823
﻿Love is not simple.
﻿It's very complicated.

480
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:26,225
﻿Or our Sigismund wouldn't have
﻿embarrassed himself.

481
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,828
- ﻿And you?
- Me?

482
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:31,630
﻿Go steady? Spare me.

483
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,567
﻿Why do people see that differently,
﻿but not in Berlin?

484
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:38,003
﻿We're just a bit faster than the rest.
﻿Of the fair people.

485
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:40,406
﻿Always a quick answer,
﻿even if it isn't one.

486
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,508
﻿A quick answer is better
﻿than slow silence right?

487
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:44,076
﻿And always the last word.

488
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:46,078
﻿No.

489
00:43:33,426 --> 00:43:34,627
﻿What time is it?

490
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,963
﻿I'll take you home now.

491
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:39,698
﻿No.

492
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,500
﻿But I have to run.

493
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:42,868
﻿No back talk.

494
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,838
﻿This is most kind, Mr. Rath, but...

495
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:47,540
﻿I have plans.

496
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:50,309
﻿See you tomorrow.

497
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:55,080
﻿Home after all?

498
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:05,224
﻿do I get paid by someone for this?

499
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,562
﻿For my work?

500
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:13,432
﻿I have no idea.

501
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:16,302
﻿How do you mean?

502
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:20,806
﻿We've only just started.

503
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:23,909
﻿Alright. Bye.

503
00:44:24,305 --> 00:45:24,505

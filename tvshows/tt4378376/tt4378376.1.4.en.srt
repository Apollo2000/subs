﻿Shit.

116
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:05,923
﻿Is there a doctor around?

117
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,563
﻿Number 61, across the street.

118
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,163
﻿Take cover, get down!
﻿They're shooting everywhere!

119
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,903
﻿Let me out. Let me out now!

120
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:28,243

﻿You'll want to go out into the warm air,
﻿right?

128

﻿The pretty boy
﻿will be back with a doctor.

129
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:15,823
﻿And in three weeks' time
﻿you'll see each other.

130
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:17,823
﻿You'll go dancing.

131
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,593
﻿At the blossom festival in Werder.

132
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:30,973
﻿There's a woman bleeding out
﻿across the street. Number 71.

133
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,503
﻿Bullets lodged in her back.

134
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,613
﻿Therese, you carry on.

135
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,403
﻿A sad occasion, doctor.

136
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,843
﻿It's never been very nice to see you.

137
00:11:07,473 --> 00:11:09,343
﻿Doctor, I'm glad you're here.

138
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,683
﻿You found just the right one.

139
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,553
- Why?
﻿- What happened?

140
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:18,153
﻿Doctor for the poor. Member of the KP,
﻿council member for Kreuzberg.

141
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:20,393
﻿They were shot down like sparrows.

142
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,323
﻿By whom? The police?

143
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:25,893
﻿- Hang on, comrade. Nobody saw that.
﻿- How would you know?

144
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,563
﻿We were there.
﻿We were nearly killed ourselves.

145
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:29,763
﻿But you weren't.

146
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,563
﻿We wouldn't shoot innocent women
﻿off balconies.

147
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,803
﻿The blood is not even dry yet
﻿and you're already covering it up.

148
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,673
﻿What are you doing here?
﻿You're a vice copper.

149
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:43,183
﻿You're a police officer?

150
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,223
﻿Doris.

151
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:53,923
﻿A refill.

152
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:57,663
- ﻿Good God, that's a right batch.
- Right enough.

153
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:00,063
﻿We're sitting in a gold mine.

154
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:02,163
﻿How long was it?

155
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,263
﻿Eleven hours this time. That's 8.80 Marks.

156
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,903
- ﻿You'll get it.
﻿- And Gräf's autograph.

157
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,003
- ﻿You need what?
﻿- Signature.

158
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,403
﻿Oh, right. I'll do it later.

159
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:13,743
﻿- But do it.
﻿- Yes, I will.

160
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,373
﻿Go home, ladies.

161
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:19,313
﻿All birds have flown the nest.
﻿There’s no-one here to give you work.

162
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:22,013
﻿There is.
﻿A recording clerk for murder.

163
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,883
﻿It's an autopsy. So no-one
﻿who's prone to fainting, OK?

164
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:30,193
﻿So, who dares to do it?

165
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,823
﻿It's better than nothing.

166
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,793
﻿I'll do it.

167
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,763
﻿I’ll pick it up later, OK?

168
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,633
﻿Fine.

169
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:49,043
﻿This is my train, my goods
﻿which I ordered and have paid for.

170
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,983
﻿If German customs don't release
﻿the goods immediately,

171
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,383
﻿this will have consequences,
﻿you dilettante.

172
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,953
﻿You think that's easy.
﻿But the Russians gave us hell...

173
00:12:58,023 --> 00:12:59,153
﻿The train is from Russia.

174
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:02,923
﻿The Russians loaded it.
﻿Don't give me that rubbish. Wegener.

175
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,563
- ﻿Tell me what's going on.
- ﻿I’m afraid it's the Russians.

176
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,663
- Told you.
- ﻿What about them? What do they want?

177
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,493
﻿They want to check the freight.

178
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,033
﻿Until this is resolved

179
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:16,303
﻿the Soviet Union has a legal claim
﻿on the contents of the train.

180
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:18,843
﻿How is this possible?

181
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:21,143
﻿They suspect we were smuggling something.

182
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:23,983
﻿From Russia, here?

183
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,853
﻿I'm sure we can clear this up.
﻿Come on, let’s check the details.

184
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:33,393
﻿Now I have to justify myself because
﻿some old Communists claim something.

185
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:38,823
﻿Hello, Mr. Nyssen.

186
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,363
﻿Have you met? The People’s Deputy Trokhin
﻿from the Soviet Embassy.

187
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,503
﻿Hello.

188
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:47,673
﻿Mr. Nyssen, please don't misunderstand
﻿our intervention.

189
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:51,003
﻿We don't want to stop the exchange
﻿of goods between our countries.

190
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:55,313
﻿- But you are doing just that.
- ﻿There is one wagon on this train

191
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,083
﻿which has a different freight
﻿than the others.

192
00:13:58,753 --> 00:13:59,983
﻿Just one single one.

193
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,083
﻿What does it contain?

194
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:06,023
﻿My government
﻿hasn't authorised me to tell you.

195
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:08,993
﻿At the moment, it's only a suspicion.

196
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,993
﻿All this fuss because of a suspicion?

197
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,563
﻿- Yes.
- Do you know what this freight is worth?

198
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:17,003
﻿Each day that the train sits here
﻿costs a fortune.

199
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,633
﻿If suspicion is not enough for you,

200
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:23,073
﻿you can go to the police.

201
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:28,473
﻿Which wagon is it?
﻿Just tell us the wagon number.

202
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,183
﻿l am here to find that out.

203
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,553
﻿Here, sign this.

204
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,063
﻿So you get your things back.

205
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,773
﻿So, which one is it?

206
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,073
﻿No-one knows.
﻿The freight documents have disappeared.

207
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:00,443
﻿What? Why?

208
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,243
﻿There was an incident
﻿when the train arrived.

209
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,283
﻿The driver ran off with the papers.

210
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,083
﻿I beg your pardon?

211
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,823
﻿Can't the wagon
﻿not be identified right here?

212
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:13,593
﻿- How do you want to do this?
﻿- We look into them.

213
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:19,463
﻿The wagons contain highly toxic
﻿pesticides. We can’t check them here.

214
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,863
﻿Somewhere, you can open them up.

215
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,033
﻿Yes.

216
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,033
﻿At our facility in Zossen.

217
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,003
﻿We've got a shed for such purposes

218
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,043
﻿Take the wagons there.

219
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:34,443
- ﻿You have the necessary skilled workers?
- Yes, of course.

220
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:35,843
﻿But not before Monday.

221
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:38,343
﻿Very well. Organise it.

222
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:41,283
﻿We will be present at the check.

223
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:04,803
﻿Seriously, this is number 12,
﻿number 13, and it's only midday.

224
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:07,303
﻿She's on you like a tick.

225
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:10,443
- ﻿You can't stop me from being there.
- Yes, yes.

226
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:12,743
﻿What in God's name is going on?

227
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:14,873
- ﻿I can tell you that.
- ﻿No, you won’t.

228
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,983
﻿Ah, it's Ms. Stalina in person.

229
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,053
﻿In the name of so-called democracy,
﻿innocent people are executed.

230
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:23,483
- ﻿Stop the slander.
﻿- These two women

231
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,553
﻿were shot by out-of-control police.

232
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:28,353
﻿You paint the enemy where you want him.

233
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,563
﻿Shoot first, ask second,
﻿that's how it works here

234
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,733
﻿- when workers exercise their rights.
﻿- You know nothing about this.

235
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:37,403
﻿You're turning a blind eye on everyone
﻿who is openly breaking the law.

236
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:39,833
﻿What law did they break exactly

237
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:41,033
- A﻿gitator.
﻿- Cover-upper.

238
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,833
- ﻿Subversive.
﻿- Murderer!

239
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:44,543
﻿- Bruno!
- That's enough.

240
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:48,013
﻿Put them up here. Left-hand corner.

241
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,943
﻿That's where they belong.

242
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:55,053
﻿For crying out loud.
﻿Put them in the centre of the table then.

243
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:56,583
﻿Hang on.

244
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,583
﻿I have no use for you in here, doctor.

245
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:01,953
﻿I won't leave these people
﻿alone with the victims

246
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:05,023
﻿No, please. How am I supposed
﻿to work with all that racket?

247
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:06,463
﻿I'm staying.

248
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,793
﻿This is my dissecting room

249
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:11,703
﻿and I decide who gets to dissect with me.

250
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,233
﻿And it's not you.

251
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,603
﻿Look, it's the doctor for the poor.

252
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:24,143
﻿Traffic police, what are you doing here?

253
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,543
﻿Lunch break. It’s so cosy here.

254
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,123
﻿Why are you bringing
﻿a broad to an autopsy?

255
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,153
﻿Seriously, do you have to?

256
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,593
﻿Everyone else is busy.

257
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,923
﻿Why do you have two bodies?

258
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,263
﻿None of your business.

259
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:43,263
﻿Bruno, why don't you go to the canteen
﻿and order a burger?

260
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:47,033
﻿They taste like the smell in here.

261
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:50,873
﻿So, what does our canal swimmer tell us?

262
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:54,943
﻿Am I the autopsy express?
﻿This is rush hour traffic today

263
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,983
﻿But judging by his skull I'd say

264
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,213
﻿he looks like Slavic.

265
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:02,913
﻿Maybe Russian.

266
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:15,033
﻿That man was a Russian.

267
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,033
﻿At least he spoke Russian.

268
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,433
﻿I see. And who are you?

269
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,543
﻿Gereon Rath,
﻿special investigator from Cologne.

270
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:29,073
﻿What does a Cologne special investigator
﻿know about a body from a Berlin canal?

271
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:31,143
﻿That man broke into my flat last night.

272
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,813
﻿At Elisabeth's place?
﻿Did he steal anything?

273
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,013
﻿What did he want?

274
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:38,823
﻿Something from the previous tenant,
﻿a certain Mr. Kardakov.

275
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:43,393
﻿When he tried to escape, he was pushed
﻿into a car and threatened with a gun.

276
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:46,493
﻿- What make?
- Could have been a Tatra.

277
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,863
﻿Sounds like a Russian affair.

278
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,503
﻿Maybe.

279
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,503
﻿His hands didn't look like this yesterday.

280
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:57,973
﻿What happened?

281
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:03,583
﻿Massive contusions.
﻿Must have been under a car.

282
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:04,983
﻿Doesn't look like an accident.

283
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:09,753
﻿I beg your pardon.

284
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,753
- So...
﻿- You mean this was done to him?

285
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:16,593
﻿Well, the injuries look even, don't they?

286
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:21,293
﻿Girl, did you just learn to talk yesterday
﻿or why are you waffling away? Get out.

287
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:25,233
﻿What about your previous tenant,
﻿what was his name?

288
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:27,233
﻿I said get out!

289
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,343
﻿Kardakov. That's all I know.

290
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,013
﻿My landlady didn't know him very well,
﻿either, but I...

291
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:38,013
﻿You can confirm this guy is Russian?

292
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,383
- Yes
﻿- Very well.

293
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,953
﻿Let's write that down. Case closed.

294
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:47,753
﻿Your students can turn this Bolshevik
﻿into burgers or something.

295
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:51,093
﻿Excuse me, but this man
﻿may have been tortured.

296
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:55,933
﻿In Berlin, the Russians off each other
﻿around the clock. Each for their own.

297
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,933
﻿One is a Trotskyite, the other Leninist,

298
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,933
﻿Stalinist, anarchist or even tsarist.
﻿It's too confusing.

299
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:03,673
﻿The more of them are gone,
﻿the better for us.

300
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:06,543
﻿I'll address the autopsy report to you,
﻿Detective Sergeant?

301
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:10,313
- You ﻿can stuff it.
- ﻿Goodbye, Mr. Criminal.

302
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:13,413
﻿If we had a special squad
﻿for each dead Russian...

303
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:16,653
﻿What's this?

304
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,193
﻿No idea. A four?

305
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,973
﻿A ten-pack of Overstolz.

306
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,913
﻿- One-fifty.
- And, I'll have a newspaper.

307
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,583
﻿Thank you.

308
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:51,523
﻿BLOODY RIOTS
﻿IN KREUZBERG AND WEDDING

309
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,523
- For you, lady?
﻿- A two-pack of Havana Gold, please.

310
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,053
﻿That's 1.50 now.

311
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:57,823
﻿You smoke cigars?

312
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:01,393
﻿Oh. It's for the boss.

313
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,933
﻿I don’t envy you.

314
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,933
﻿Oh, he's not always like this.

315
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:12,473
- ﻿You mean, he’s actually a nice guy?
- No.

316
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,313
﻿But sometimes he's less gruff.

317
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:20,353
﻿Well, then.
﻿We can ignore the odd murder.

318
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:23,313
﻿I don't like it, either.

319
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:31,293
﻿That man was scared.

320
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:35,193
﻿He wasn't a tough guy.
﻿I realised that too late.

321
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:37,003
﻿You want to investigate?

322
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,303
﻿It's not that simple.
﻿It’s your department.

323
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:46,143
﻿No-one would ask questions
﻿if you did some research.

324
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:48,513
﻿My boss would ask.

325
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:51,583
﻿He doesn't have to know.

326
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,583
﻿- Cigarette?
﻿- Thank you.

327
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:00,393
﻿For better times.

328
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:07,693
﻿Alright. So what else does your landlady
﻿know about this Kardakov?

329
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:09,733
﻿You remembered the name.

330
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,933
﻿I’ve got two ears.

331
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,003
﻿So?

332
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:19,873
﻿Allegedly, he's on tour.
﻿But he didn't take his suitcase.

333
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:22,343
﻿Interesting.

334
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:25,383
﻿I have to go.

335
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:27,713
﻿I'll be in touch.

336
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:28,953
﻿Alright.

337
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,053
﻿And thank you again.

338
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:34,823
﻿For the other day.

339
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,673
- Traitor!
﻿- What is going on?

340
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,273
﻿- You'll pay for this.
﻿- Why weren't you at the station?

341
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:30,743
﻿You're asking me?

342
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:34,883
﻿They were all killed because of you.

343
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,913
- ﻿They're all dead!
﻿- What? Who?

344
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:41,093
﻿Nadia, Nikolayev, Sergey,

345
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,963
﻿Misha,Yuri, Vladimir...

346
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,763
﻿They are all on your conscience.

347
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:51,163
- ﻿Where is the damned knife?
- It was Boris.

348
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,263
﻿The train driver betrayed us.

349
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:56,203
﻿He wanted it all for himself,
﻿to take the gold to Paris.

350
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:59,603
﻿He fled and left me there.

351
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:01,843
﻿I’ll kill you, you whore.

352
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:04,083
﻿And I was arrested.

353
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:05,643
﻿Look.

354
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:10,523
﻿From the police.

355
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:18,393
﻿Where is the gold?

356
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,393
﻿The gold is there.

357
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,833
﻿I was in the wagon. I saw it myself.

358
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:30,903
﻿Lyosha, please believe me.
﻿The train is at the station.

359
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:35,373
﻿Dearest, nothing is lost yet.
﻿Please believe me.

360
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,343
﻿My love.

361
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,723
﻿Did you really think I could betray you?

362
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:52,723
﻿Look at me.

363
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:58,203
﻿I could do something like this?
﻿You really thought

364
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,933
﻿Yes?

365
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:01,733
﻿Yes.

366
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:21,523
﻿They killed them all.

367
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:25,993
﻿They killed them all.

368
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,863
﻿Forgive me.

369
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:58,363
﻿I'LL SEW ANYTHING
﻿WORK WANTED

370
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:01,133
﻿SHOEMAKER
﻿LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT

371
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,833
- ﻿Can you watch this for me?
- Sure.

372
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,813
﻿Don’t you recognise me anymore?

373
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:20,383
﻿Kinderland holiday in '22.

374
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:23,513
﻿Greta!

375
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:27,953
﻿Greta Overbeck
﻿from Gröningshusen on Darss?

376
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,463
﻿What are you doing in Berlin?

377
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:36,993
﻿I... I'm on my lunch break,
﻿are you hungry?

378
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,433
﻿Me? No, thanks, I've eaten.

379
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:42,873
﻿Come on, it's on me.

380
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:45,343
﻿I only came here because of him.

381
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:48,743
- I see.
- ﻿Anyway, suddenly Alfons disappeared.

382
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:50,513
﻿Simply gone.

383
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,513
﻿Somehow I've heard this story before.

384
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,353
﻿My parents had warned me of him.

385
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:03,753
﻿And the only one I met through Alfons
﻿was an older gentleman.

386
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:06,623
﻿A famous author, I won't tell you who.

387
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,593
﻿Go on.

388
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,103
- ﻿No.
﻿- Yes.

389
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,773
- ﻿That one?
- Yes.

390
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:21,073
﻿He helped me at first.

391
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,983
﻿Then he asked me
﻿if I wanted to do his flat for him.

392
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,713
﻿Very gently, like. In a fatherly voice.

393
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,753
﻿Two days later I was back on the street
And I'm still there.

394
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:35,993
﻿No-one takes on a maid
﻿without a first-class recommendation.

395
00:28:36,623 --> 00:28:38,323
﻿Would you know something?

396
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,993
﻿Maybe. Yes.

397
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,503
﻿At least you had a bit of luck.

398
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:50,703
﻿Charlotte Ritter, what was it again?
﻿Criminal assistant?

399
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:58,743
﻿Correct. And if I put some work into it,
﻿I can even become an inspector.

400
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,583
﻿With the murder squad?

401
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:02,483
﻿That'll be six pennies.

402
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,953
﻿Some of the guys are pretty strange,

403
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:06,883
﻿but my boss trusts me blindly.

404
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:14,733
﻿And do you get to see the...
﻿those that were murdered?

405
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:16,863
﻿The murder victims? Of course.

406
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,003
﻿I'm always first on the scene,
﻿me and the detective sergeant.

407
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:23,903
﻿Gruesome stuff sometimes.
﻿Recently we had one with no head.

408
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:26,943
- ﻿The axe was still there.
- No.

409
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:30,013
﻿We found the head later.
﻿You won't believe where.

410
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,713
﻿Where?

411
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,683
﻿Excuse me.

412
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:42,423
﻿Oh, it's one o'clock already.

413
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:44,393
﻿I have to run

414
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:47,593
﻿But listen, are you up
﻿for going dancing later?

415
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,233
﻿Alright.

416
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,673
﻿At Moka Efti, Friedrichstrasse, 9pm

417
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:00,403
﻿I'm glad you're here.

418
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:16,153
﻿Department A,
﻿murder and grievous bodily harm.

419
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:22,763
﻿Miss Isolde, did you
﻿do the two transcripts I asked for?

420
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,803
﻿Please go downstairs
﻿for your money.

421
00:30:26,873 --> 00:30:27,903
﻿Hello.

422
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:30,433
﻿This is really scary.

423
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,043
﻿Miss Isolde. What is it?

424
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:34,873
﻿I have a question.

425
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:38,383
﻿How do you become a criminal assistant?

426
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:41,053
﻿- Did you finish school?
﻿- Elementary school.

427
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:44,383
﻿I'd say write an application.

428
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,723
﻿- Vicky, the Huber file.
﻿- Just like that?

429
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:49,623
- To w﻿hom?
﻿- The female police.

430
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,863
﻿- Who else?
﻿- Female police?

431
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:54,863
﻿What do they do?

432
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:58,863
﻿They question and deal with sexual
﻿and vice offences of minors.

433
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,273
﻿I want the murder squad.

434
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,643
﻿You want the murder squad?

435
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:10,883
﻿They don't have any women.
﻿Only as typists.

436
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,153
﻿Where do I get those application forms?

437
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:15,513
﻿Personnel office.

438
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,083
﻿Thank you.

439
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,323
﻿Forgive me, Sveta.

440
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:35,403
﻿They killed them all,
﻿in front of my eyes.

441
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,603
﻿All of them.

442
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:45,883
﻿Calm down.

443
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,983
﻿We’ll find a way.

444
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,993
﻿You have me.

445
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,163
﻿We'll get the gold.

446
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:07,003
﻿Trotsky will destroy Stalin.

447
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,603
﻿With our help.

448
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,003
﻿With our gold.

449
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:16,873
﻿Yes, the Russians met here a few times.

450
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:19,143
﻿His organisation is called "Red Fortress".
﻿Thanks.

451
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:23,513
﻿For the best socialism ever.

452
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:28,493
﻿They were all fervent Trotskyites.
﻿Does that mean anything to you?

453
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:32,293
﻿It's a communist faction, against Stalin.

454
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,993
﻿They want to free their country
﻿from his yoke.

455
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,133
"﻿Stalin is the gravedigger
﻿of the revolution."

456
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:42,733
﻿You speak Russian?

457
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:46,403
﻿It's essential if you're interested
﻿in the giants. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.

458
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:49,943
﻿I personally think
﻿Gulanin is underestimated.

459
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:52,013
﻿It was wrong to forget about him.

460
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:57,623
﻿Through my room! Thank God I wasn't there

461
00:32:57,723 --> 00:33:00,993
﻿Yes, good thing you weren't there
﻿and I had to deal with him on my own.

462
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:03,753
Please, Ms. Elisabeth,
﻿I didn't mean it like that.

463
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,723
﻿I’m sure you would have driven him away.

464
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,633
﻿That's right.
﻿with the stench of my un-aired room.

465
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:19,303
﻿Bloody May! Police! Bloody May! Police!

466
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,113
﻿Don’t touch the car, get back!

467
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:29,413
﻿Murderers!

468
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,683
﻿Charlotte! This way!

469
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:44,133
﻿Is this great?

470
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,903
﻿Look at this

471
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,633
﻿Can I try it on?

472
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,013
﻿Thank you.

473
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:34,283
﻿Go on, take it.

474
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,553
- ﻿Can you afford this?
- No.

475
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,293
﻿You are wanted.

476
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:47,023
﻿Where?

477
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,263
﻿He's already here.
﻿First department on the left.

478
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:52,933
﻿I'll explain later. Won't take long

479
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,303
﻿What about you?
﻿Don't tell me you're a virgin.

480
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,143
﻿No, I'm Capricorn.

481
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:11,283
﻿- Where's the Widow?
﻿- I'm the substitute.

482
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:13,053
﻿What do you want from her?

483
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:16,193
﻿- I've got someone for her.
- ﻿She'll be back tomorrow morning.

484
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:17,253
﻿Thanks.

485
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:32,443
﻿What? Have you never seen
﻿a man in an armchair?

486
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:35,413
﻿I'm not available for detective
﻿sergeants.

487
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:36,573
﻿Don't worry.

488
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:39,843
- ﻿I only do standard dances.
- Forget it.

489
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,413
﻿I'm not a whore.

490
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,823
﻿You’re not registered, that's true.

491
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:49,993
﻿What’s that supposed to mean?

492
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:54,863
﻿It means you'll look at paragraph 361/6
﻿of the criminal code.

493
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:58,703
﻿Then you'll know you have to register...

494
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:01,133
﻿for your job here.

495
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,573
﻿You'll register with us.

496
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,103
﻿With the vice squad.

497
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,243
﻿I just happened by.

498
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:10,943
﻿That's also a solution. Smart child.

499
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:14,413
﻿But you don't want me
﻿to take this place apart, right?

500
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:19,283
﻿You'd be back on the street,
﻿hunting for punters.

501
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:22,723
﻿Let’s deal with this just the two of us.

502
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:27,423
﻿Right now.

503
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,933
﻿Go on, let's dance.

504
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:35,173
﻿Come on now.

505
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,703
﻿No.

506
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,283
﻿Excuse me, miss.

507
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:57,693
﻿Your dress is fantastic.
﻿Do you want to dance?

508
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:04,433
﻿Miss, are you accompanied?

509
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:09,133
﻿Is that it?

510
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:12,103
﻿Not quite.

511
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:17,113
﻿You and the posh Cologne guy...

512
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:20,843
﻿I saw you flirting with him already.

513
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:27,083
﻿That gentleman is a bit too curious
﻿for my liking.

514
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:29,823
﻿What's that to do with me?

515
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:34,463
﻿Find out what he's looking for.

516
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:36,363
﻿Why should I do that?

517
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:40,203
﻿Because otherwise all this will be
﻿in your certificate of good conduct.

518
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,773
﻿That’s not clean, anyway.

519
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:50,643
﻿But it has to be if you want
﻿to keep working for the police.

520
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:56,153
﻿Can you do something about that?

521
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,223
﻿I could have a look.

522
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:22,313
﻿I have this letter, it's in Russian
﻿Can you tell me what it says?

523
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:32,653
﻿won't tell you the intimate conversation
﻿between my flatmate and his lover.

524
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:35,123
﻿I'm afraid you'll have to.

525
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,623
﻿Because you'll arrest me if I don’t?

526
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,123
﻿That's right.

527
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:45,303
﻿Alright, if you insist.

528
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:47,933
﻿Ready?

529
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:52,743
﻿Darling, please pick up my dress
﻿from the cleaners.

530
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:55,043
﻿Kisses, S.

531
00:38:57,913 --> 00:39:00,983
﻿Svetlana Sorokina. Who is she?

532
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,853
﻿Kardakov's lover, like I said.

533
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:06,423
﻿He went round her place a lot.

534
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:09,293
﻿As you know
﻿Mrs. Behnke doesn't like lady visitors.

535
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:11,663
﻿I don't like the ladies that visit you.

536
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,263
﻿What about family?

537
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:18,363
﻿Where would that get us?
﻿They have hotels for that.

538
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:25,403
﻿Behnke speaking. One moment, please.

539
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,013
﻿Mr. Rath? It's for you.

540
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,443
﻿The chief of police.

541
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:34,653
﻿Rath.

542
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,283
﻿It's me.

543
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,653
﻿Who?

544
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:40,683
﻿I wanted to ask if you have
﻿looked into the previous tenant.

545
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,223
﻿That’s what you're calling for?

546
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,023
﻿I wanted to take advantage
﻿of the office phone.

547
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:49,863
﻿If there is anything to do,
﻿I have capacities.

548
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,933
﻿Actually, I have something for you.

549
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:55,673
﻿Kardakov's lover
﻿lives at Meraner Strasse.

550
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:59,443
﻿Number seven.
﻿Svetlana Sorokina. Write it down.

551
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:03,013
﻿- Consider it done.
- ﻿Go check it out tomorrow, OK?

552
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:05,943
﻿Do you know the Aschinger inn?

553
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,253
﻿Is the earth round? Yes, of course.

554
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:11,353
﻿I'll meet you there
﻿for lunch tomorrow, 1pm.

555
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:13,123
﻿Yes, fine.

556
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:14,323
﻿Goodbye.

557
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:25,133
﻿I'm meeting him.
﻿Tomorrow at 1pm at Aschinger's.

558
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:28,703
﻿Good.

559
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,203
﻿And where will we meet?

560
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:32,103
﻿Here, of course.

561
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,383
﻿Come on.

562
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:50,053
﻿At least 200 dead.

563
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:51,863
﻿I can't imagine that.

564
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,893
﻿I don't believe
﻿Mr. Rath has anything to do with that.

565
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:58,463
- ﻿But he was on duty today.
- ﻿Samuel, enough of that, OK?

566
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:04,703
﻿Well, what will we do
﻿with the rest of the evening?

567
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:26,323
﻿- Are you together?
﻿- No, they're mine.

568
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:27,463
﻿Good.

569
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,463
- ﻿Are you alone?
- Yes.

570
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,263
- ﻿No children?
- No.

571
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:34,203
﻿I'm sorry, we're full up.

572
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,503
﻿Only women with children for tonight.

573
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:28,253
﻿Hello?

574
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:33,563
﻿Put me through to the Soviet embassy.

574
00:42:34,305 --> 00:43:34,869

1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,840
Breathe very calmly.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
Breathe in... and out.

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,640
Don't try to put your
thoughts into order.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
Just let them go.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,800
And breathe in very deeply...

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,640
and out.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,160
And when I say "now" you
will open your eyes.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Now.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
Yes, close your eyes again.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,760
Good. Good.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,040
And now delve twice as deeply into
your relaxed state than before.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,000
Take your time.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
I will now take you back...

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
to the source.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
To the source of your fear.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,000
I... will guide you...

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,360
step by step.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,480
Step by step...

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
all the way to the
source of your fear.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
To the truth.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
You are in Cologne.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
In your hometown.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,560
It is the summer shortly
before you are drafted.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
There is your father.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
You long for the war so much,

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,080
you're dying to finally go away
and leave everything behind you.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
There is the woman you love.

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,360
But something keeps
you apart from her.

29
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,320
NOVORZHEV, SOVIET UNION
1496 KM TO BERLIN

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,800
To the right. Come on!
Come on, move!

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
What do they want?

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
- Clothes.
- Don't hurt us.

33
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Don't worry. Your clothes.
Uniform. Then no harm.

34
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,720
- We do nothing. Just clothes.
- On your knees!

35
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,880
- NEUKÖLLN, BERLIN APRIL 29, 1929.
-53 A.M.

36
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
You got the runs or something?

37
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,200
It's packed in there.

38
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Go on, open it.

39
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,200
Maria, you come
out of the stable

40
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,680
and look at the lights of Bethlehem
with chaste eyes. Where the bird is.

41
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,560
And now Archangel
Gabriel, please.

42
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,920
Maria, turn around now,
I can't see anything.

43
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
More this way.

44
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,400
Frieda, you're receiving the
Redeemer, I can't see that.

45
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,560
Give it some more. Paul, faster.

46
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
Turn around some more,
I can't see anything.

47
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,920
Vice squad.

48
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,880
This is a raid! Show is over.

49
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
form an orderly row,

50
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
pack away your genitals and
keep your mouths shut.

51
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
We have to take all this.

52
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,000
Every photo, film,
can, everything.

53
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,680
You're in charge. We
mustn't lose any detail.

54
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,440
You with the trumpet, stand here.
On the double.

55
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
You two, pack everything
into the car.

56
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,920
- And who are you?
- The carpenter.

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,920
- Who's that supposed to be?
- Jesus' father, of course.

58
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Look, God's also in it.

59
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,880
And the Virgin Mary, the boy with
the curly hair, everyone's here.

60
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Mr. König.

61
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,560
Paragraph 118. Art is free.

62
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
You will have to prove
I'm not an artist.

63
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,640
A rat is what you are.

64
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,280
And you're a bluebottle. Can't
ever get rid of you, huh?

65
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,680
Too much shit stuck on you.

66
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,120
No offense, but we can't let
him get away with that.

67
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,640
We're not done here.

68
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,320
Won't be long, they're almost done
with the holy couple. Look, sweetie.

69
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Closing time.

70
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
I know you.

71
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,160
Get them all out of there.

72
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Come on out.

73
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,240
You'll shoot me up here

74
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,520
and let my colleague
downstairs get you?

75
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,120
- The fat guy won't get me.
- Sure he will. He's got a gun.

76
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,880
- A bigger one than that toy of yours.
- Toy?

77
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Thanks.

78
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,960
Maybe you do things
differently in Cologne,

79
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,160
but here in the capital it's a good
idea to draw your weapon first.

80
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,120
Yes, I'm afraid it fell
down the shaft back there.

81
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,400
I'll let Willi know, you'll
have it back tomorrow.

82
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Right, you nitwit.
Say thank you.

83
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,080
- What?
- I can't hear you.

84
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Thank you.

85
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
And do you know what for?

86
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,600
I just saved your arse from
being tried as a cop killer.

87
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,680
You've still got the attempted
cop murder going for you,

88
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,680
apart from the filth
with those little boys.

89
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,120
- But I didn't do...
- You speak when I ask you a question.

90
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
But...

91
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,160
Maybe this bullet
was never fired.

92
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,440
And somehow you
got away up here.

93
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
You know what I mean, right?

94
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Right.

95
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,080
And now introduce yourself to my
colleague from Cologne. Name?

96
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
- Krajewski.
- Beg your pardon?

97
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,960
- Krajewski, Franz.
- Rank and regiment?

98
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Private, infantry,

99
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,600
second Hanseatic, w...

100
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,840
- Pardon?
- West front.

101
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Residence?

102
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,680
In the ruins on Hermannplatz.
I see. I get it.

103
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,000
Now listen. Erwin
in the kiosk...

104
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,080
at the underground station.
He's our guy.

105
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
You'll report to
him at 12 sharp.

106
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,960
And when we ask you a question
then, you'll have the answer.

107
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,080
Come on, you trembler.

108
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Pull yourself together.

109
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Where's Lotte?

110
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,760
Lotte? Where have you been?

111
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,640
Everywhere.

112
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,280
Haven't you slept at all?

113
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
- No.
- And right off to work?

114
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,600
I don't know how you do it.

115
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
But you know the deal. If you
sleep you miss being awake.

116
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,320
And I have to be on watch.

117
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
What about here?

118
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,000
Paradise.

119
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Leopold?

120
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,600
<i>Your eyes are magnets</i>

121
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,320
<i>And they beam like the stars</i>

122
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,600
Your kisses

123
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
Connecting wires

124
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,680
Between Earth and Heaven

125
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
A little technique A little love

126
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,640
A little bliss and a little pain

127
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,200
They are the engine
of the machine

128
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,880
And busy is the stupid heart

129
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
- Left pocket.
- Did you bring something?

130
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Yellow.

131
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
I haven't got that one yet.

132
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
What's this?

133
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,720
Nothing. Just a bruise.

134
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,240
Can you bring me my stockings?
The fine ones, please.

135
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
It's no big deal, Toni.

136
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,520
What's with that bloody noise?
And where is the rent?

137
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,400
- On the table.
- No. Half is missing.

138
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,080
I'll have it tonight.

139
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
Hey, watch it!

140
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
Who can piss with a hard-on?

141
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
- Why don't you touch it?
- You pig.

142
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Lotte!

143
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,880
Lotte! We need 20.
Schröder will kick us out.

144
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,600
Tonight, I promise.

145
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Lotte?

146
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,240
Here, a little souvenir of your
exciting time in the capital.

147
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,880
- Where do you know that guy from?
- Krajewski?

148
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,560
Believe it or not, he
used to be one of us.

149
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
A police officer.

150
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,680
He honestly thought he could just
go back to working after the war.

151
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,000
A trembler.

152
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
One day, he's at an operation.
There's a huge shoot-out...

153
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,120
and that chicken can't
get a grip on himself.

154
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,360
They kicked him out.

155
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
No honors for him.

156
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,320
Get out of my way, you ninny!

157
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Don't.

158
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Stop it.

159
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,480
I'm going to the police, no lie.
Wanna come?

160
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,960
At the front, those
chickens folded in droves.

161
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,720
Now you just have to breathe on
them and the waterworks open.

162
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,600
I was in Belgium.

163
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
And France.

164
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,240
What about you?

165
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,680
Only the final game.
The Siegfried Line.

166
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,320
They're broken automatons...

167
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,480
no more.

168
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
And broken automatons
belong on the landfill.

169
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Apparently.

170
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,080
POLICE HEADQUARTERS "RED CASTLE",
ALEXANDERPLATZ, MITTE, BERLIN

171
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
- Morning.
- Excuse me.

172
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,640
- Excuse me, we're waiting too.
- I've been waiting for an hour, too.

173
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,040
- Chewing gum?
- I'll take it. Thanks.

174
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,360
- Has old Reckwitz been here?
- Good morning, Councillor.

175
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,680
Once. Not much going today. -Hello.
- Hi.

176
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,056
- Morning, Jänicke.
- Good morning, Mr. Gräf.

177
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,240
What a load.

178
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,280
- Morning, girls.
- Good morning, Inspector.

179
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,240
- Who's the dressy guy?
- There she is.

180
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,960
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

181
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,320
So, we need 12 transcripts...

182
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
I'll do it!

183
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,120
37 notices of annulment for B.

184
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you.

185
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,960
- 90 citations for H.
- Here.

186
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,160
- And then we need someone who knows...
- Me.

187
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
French?

188
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,480
- Miss Amelie, of course.
- Thanks.

189
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,880
Right, ladies,
that's it for now.

190
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,240
You're very welcome to wait but I
doubt there'll be much more today.

191
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
See you tomorrow.

192
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,080
Yes, there is something else.

193
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Cataloguing the photography
archive of the homicide squad.

194
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Here!

195
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,440
- I'd like the lady with the green hat.
- You.

196
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,120
Thank you. Miss Ritter?

197
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Right?

198
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
- The Buddha wants...
- Who?

199
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,440
Gennat, the chief of
the homicide squad.

200
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,480
Gennat wants to create
a catchword register

201
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,760
with descriptions of all murder cases
of the last 13 years. Like this:

202
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,360
Crime scene, murder weapon,

203
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
condition of the body.
Everything, really.

204
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,640
- And you want me to...
- You describe what you see,

205
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,920
and in a systematic way.

206
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,120
Take this, for example. Axe
murder, split skull, amputation.

207
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,520
The pictures are organized by case. On
the back are the date and case number.

208
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,308
Catchword register.

209
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,680
Correct. Later on, we
can look for parallels.

210
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,496
Like if someone uses the same weapon
several times or a perpetrator...

211
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,320
You took all the pictures?

212
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,560
Upstairs there are
three times as many.

213
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,800
One mark an hour, I'll
sign off tomorrow morning.

214
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Thanks.

215
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,520
Do you know all the stuff Inspector
Rath has collected about you...

216
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,080
in the last few weeks
since you left Cologne?

217
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
Let's talk about him.

218
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,800
Let's hear it. What
kind of guy is he?

219
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,880
You want me to tell you
stuff about your colleague?

220
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,840
He knows you, so you know him.

221
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,960
What's in it for me?

222
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
For you? A kiss.

223
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
Wait...

224
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
you've got something there.

225
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,240
Come on, spill.

226
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,840
His father is the right hand of Cologne's
Lord Mayor. High brass police.

227
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,920
I know that, mate.

228
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,800
He's ambitious.

229
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Dogged. A ferret.

230
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,960
I know.

231
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,320
Goes to church, prays,
believes in God.

232
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes, I know all that.

233
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,800
But what don't I know?

234
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,560
How would I know what you
don't know, Chief Inspector?

235
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
Why is he with the vice squad?

236
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,880
- What?
- Why not something decent?

237
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Murder, corruption...

238
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,600
secret police?

239
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,320
- Inspector? The interrogation records.
- Thank you.

240
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,880
- Can I do anything...
- Thanks.

241
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Right, where's Wolter?

242
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,520
- He's interrogating König.
- What?

243
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
<i>What...</i> What do you want?

244
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,880
I want to know what's
between you two.

245
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,240
And what he wants from you. Don't tell
me he's just here because of your filth.

246
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,000
He's a Catholic. They don't
like this kind of stuff.

247
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,440
Oh man!

248
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,160
You're almost begging to go to
prison as a child shagger tonight.

249
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,800
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

250
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,280
Who are you talking about?

251
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,000
Gereon Rath?

252
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,280
We were just talking about you.

253
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
Good thing you're here.

254
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,240
I just wanted to
take a quick pee.

255
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,040
I'll deal with this.

256
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,440
You know what I'm looking for.

257
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,240
Where is the film?

258
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,880
Just tell him to pay.

259
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,760
He won't pay. That's
why I'm here.

260
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,120
He will pay.

261
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
Get the paramedic.

262
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Yes, sir.

263
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,040
And come to me when he can
be interrogated again.

264
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,160
INSTITUTE FOR SUGGESTIVE
THERAPY ADLERSHOF, BERLIN

265
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,720
Franz, how are you?

266
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
- Do you want to give us another try?
- Yes, please.

267
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
Are you off the drugs?

268
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,400
- No, doctor, but I...
- Those are the rules, Franz.

269
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
We got caught this morning.

270
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
And?

271
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,760
They've got König.

272
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
He didn't destroy the film.

273
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,760
Why not? I explicitly
told him to.

274
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
He tried to make some
money with the film.

275
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,560
On his own account.

276
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
That's not good, Franz.

277
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,800
BORDER STATION TAUROGGEN
1046 KM TO BERLIN

278
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,880
FRONTIER OF THE GERMAN REICH

279
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Stop.

280
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,920
What's your freight in there?

281
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,520
All pesticides.

282
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,280
- Documents.
- What?

283
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
We must check the
freight documents.

284
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Yes.

285
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,120
- He wants to see the freight papers.
- We'll just drive on.

286
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Are you nuts? Calm down.
I'll handle this.

287
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,640
- Alright?
- Do it.

288
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,480
The <i>Reichswehr</i> .

289
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
What's going on? Why did
you stop the train?

290
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,640
We're doing our checks, Major.

291
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,240
- Let the train through.
- Major, according to our regulations...

292
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,016
The train is running by
order of the <i>Reichswehr</i> .

293
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,400
It says that here, but someone has
to sign off the freight documents.

294
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
I need the full name.

295
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,080
That is Major General Seegers.

296
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,600
IMPORT LICENSE GRANTED

297
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Have a safe trip.

298
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,400
Let's go.

299
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,800
<i>Uncle just passed the border.
Gift on its way to Berlin.</i>

300
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Sveta.

301
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,480
It all went well.

302
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,760
You are my hero.

303
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,960
Alexey.

304
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,720
That's untypical.
Sandor is never late.

305
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Times change.

306
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,240
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your brother's reliability has waned.

307
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,680
More precise, please.

308
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,960
You deliver 35,000 bottles
of arrack per year.

309
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,080
I supply the entire city,
you remain silent,

310
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,520
I pay you well, we
could all be happy.

311
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,760
- But?
- There have been complaints

312
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,520
about the quality of the alcohol.
More and more often.

313
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,120
Then I had them investigate

314
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,400
and made an interesting
discovery.

315
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,000
What is this? I don't drink
arrack with my octopus.

316
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Right?

317
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,560
Your good, thoroughly honest
and very punctual Sandor

318
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,480
simply swapped your fine
brew for cheap booze.

319
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,760
Did he think I wouldn't notice?

320
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,280
Did he think the fine tongues
of our guests would fail?

321
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,000
Even though the tongue
is the most sensitive

322
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,680
and has the best blood supply
of all human sensory organs.

323
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,160
Where is Sandor?

324
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
What's with the whimpering?

325
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,920
Mr. Kardakov, please.

326
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,680
One, two, one, two, three.

327
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Thank you.

328
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,600
The tongue...

329
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,440
is unique.

330
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,560
A small miracle of nature. Which
is why it is also a delicacy.

331
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,920
Where is my brother?

332
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Dr. Schmidt is outside.

333
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,400
Enjoy your octopus, Mr.
Gosztony.

334
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Doctor.

335
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
I don't want to waste
your valuable time.

336
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
Oh, please. How can I help?

337
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,360
I have been told that our mutual friend
is doing business for his own account.

338
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
König?

339
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
König.

340
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,720
He put one film aside.

341
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,800
The man is endangering
our entire operation.

342
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
I'll deal with it.

343
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Good.

344
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,640
THIRD ACT

345
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,160
Hey, busy bee.

346
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
A beer after work?

347
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,800
I've still got work to do.

348
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,080
Suit yourself. See you tomorrow.

349
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Listen, Bruno.

350
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,720
Why did you start without me?

351
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,200
Sometimes that's better.

352
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
Tomorrow we'll swap.

353
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Fine with me.

354
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,160
Here's the file. For
your interrogation.

355
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,640
Clocking off time.

356
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,680
- I'm sorry.
- I beg your pardon.

357
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,160
I think those are yours.

358
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,200
Yes, thanks.

359
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
This must be yours.

360
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,080
- This should be yours.
- Yes, many thanks.

361
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,560
I hope you're with vice.

362
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,000
And I hope you're with
the homicide squad.

363
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Goodbye.

364
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,496
EVERYONE ONCE IN BERLIN THE
WORLD CITY OF ORDER AND BEAUTY

365
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,800
Everyone once in Berlin.

366
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,760
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Rath.

367
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
I have mail for you.

368
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,600
It looks like I need to stay longer.
Thank you.

369
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,640
- You were due to leave tomorrow, correct?
- Correct.

370
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,640
I'm afraid we have a union group from
Leverkusen coming. First of May.

371
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,400
- The workers' fight day. You know.
- I'd take the broom cupboard.

372
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,920
I'm really sorry. We're fully booked
until the weekend. All rooms.

373
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Thank you.

374
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,280
<i>My dearest Gereon,</i>

375
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,880
<i>Today it's been exactly four
weeks since you left Cologne.</i>

376
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,440
<i>Slowly it's beginning
to feel like those days</i>

377
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,640
<i>when you two and your
brother went to war</i>

378
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>and the days were
creepingly becoming longer.</i>

379
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,760
<i>You said in yesterday's letter that
you're about to solve the case.</i>

380
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,760
<i>That keeps me up at night.</i>

381
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,640
<i>Promise you'll be careful.</i>

382
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,680
<i>Berlin's streets are rougher
than anywhere else in the Reich.</i>

383
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,760
<i>Even though I know
you'll be back soon,</i>

384
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,440
<i>I can't conceal the fact
that my heart is afraid</i>

385
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,480
<i>when I switch off
the light at night</i>

386
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,880
<i>and try to wrestle a little
bit more mercy out of God</i>

387
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
<i>so that nothing may happen to
you in this big, strange city.</i>

388
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,000
<i>With greetings and kisses.
Yours, Helga.</i>

389
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,680
<i>P.S. Moritz also sends his regards
to the capital of the Reich.</i>

390
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Good evening.

391
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,720
Want a shot with that?

392
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Thank you.

393
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,816
WORKERS! STEP FORTH AND FIGHT
FOR A FOURTH INTERNATIONAL

394
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
AND THE WORLD REVOLUTION

395
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,680
- Hi, Sergey. Everyone here?
- Everyone's here.

396
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,480
Comrades.

397
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,840
A few hours ago I received a
message from our comrades at home.

398
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,640
The train crossed the
border this morning.

399
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,680
It's coming straight to Berlin!

400
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,880
Long live the Fourth
International!

401
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,280
Down with Stalin!

402
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,480
Long live our comrade Trotsky!

403
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,440
Long live the Red Fortress!

404
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,360
- Reinvent the world in a better way.
- No less!

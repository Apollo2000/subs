﻿What now?

88

﻿How would I know?

93
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,206
﻿Do you think I remember

﻿Who's the other woman?

95
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,576
﻿Martha Konopatzki.

96
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,706
﻿But there's no point asking for her,
﻿she went back to Pomerania.

97
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,776
﻿Where was that picture taken?

98
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,846
﻿I don't know. Somewhere in the west.

99

﻿- Address?
﻿- I don't have it.

100
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:56,786
﻿But you were there.

101
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,216
﻿We were taken there at night.

102
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:03,526
﻿With hats on our heads which they pulled
﻿down so much we couldn't see nothing.

103
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,696

104

﻿Alright, the red nag.

108
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:26,116
﻿It was hanging on the wall staring at us.

109
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,546
﻿There, you see?

110
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:46,666

00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,646

114
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,986
﻿ - Hello.
﻿ - Hello.

115
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:15,496
﻿- Oh, it's the big cast today.
﻿- Comrades, men.

116
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,326
﻿The president of the police.

117
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,606
﻿Hello. August.

118
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:32,076
﻿Yes, alright. Alright!

119
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,816
﻿Alright. At ease.

120
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,286
﻿You all know what this is about.

121
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:41,326
﻿There is lots of trouble
﻿awaiting us on 1 May.

122
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:45,556
﻿More than a dozen
﻿Communist associations have announced

123
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,696
﻿that they will go against the ban
﻿on demonstrations.

124
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:53,766
﻿This could lead to a chain reaction.

125
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,006
﻿We have to be determined to stop it.

126
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:02,246
﻿Radical forces from all directions
﻿have been trying for years

127
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:05,946
﻿to undermine our state
﻿and bring chaos to our streets.

128
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:09,486
﻿But we must protect
﻿the citizens of our country

129
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:13,886
﻿and our democratic constitution!

130
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,966
﻿Therefore, first of all...

131
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,736
﻿Our present crews are backed up

132
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,466
﻿with forces from Spandau and Zehlendorf.

133
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,936
﻿These will be deployed in Kreuzberg,

134
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:36,176
﻿Neukölln, and in Wedding.

135
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,976
﻿That's where all the rascals live.

136
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:43,316
- Operation leaders are Reiser...
- Present.

137
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:47,416
﻿Blaschewski. Boglau and Wolter.

138
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:51,086
﻿You'll get your equipment
﻿from the armoury.

139
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,496
﻿- Hi, Erwin.
﻿- Mr. Wolter.

140
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,336
﻿Mauser 98, 100 pieces of ammunition.

141
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:05,536
﻿Next.

142
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:08,306
﻿Hey, Willi, 100 bullets?

143
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,976
﻿That's like in the war!

144
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,846
﻿Would you prefer this one?

145
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:18,186
﻿MP28, brand-new.

146
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,986
﻿Of course I prefer this one.

147
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:23,486
﻿The General is in town.

148
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,756
﻿Wants to talk to you.

149
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,306
﻿No.

150
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,576
﻿- Hello, Inspector Rath.
﻿- I need an enlargement.

151
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,216
﻿A very large enlargement.

152
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,786
- ﻿Is that possible?
- Yes.

153
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:54,456
﻿Of what exactly?

154
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,906
- ﻿Here you are.
- Doris.

155
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:18,346
- ﻿Just wanted to say bye.
- ﻿Will you relieve me?

156
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,446
﻿What is it?

157
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:27,216
﻿Compare cases, systemise them,
﻿they call it a catch word register.

158
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,226
﻿Wow, you've hit a gold mine.
﻿You'll need weeks for this.

159
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,496
﻿But I can't do it.

160
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:39,366
﻿All day long in the basement,
﻿you wither like a primrose.

161
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,866
﻿I don't mind.

162
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,776
﻿You do it for me then.

163
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,746
﻿I'll give you 70 Pfennig an hour.

164
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:50,876
﻿Ninety.

165
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:54,216
﻿Eighty. Last offer, or I'll do it myself.

166
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:57,086
﻿Deal.

167
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,426
﻿Very well, Mrs. Ritter.

168
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,896
﻿Have you heard of the French disease?

169
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,296
- You what?
﻿ - It's a bacterial infection.

170
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,166
﻿transmitted through mucosal contact.
﻿Also called Great Imitator.

171
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,766
﻿You mean the rash?

172
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,806
﻿Doesn't have anything to do with that.
﻿I’ll prescribe an ointment for that.

173
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,216
﻿So what’s wrong with me?

174
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,386
﻿Syphilis.
﻿You must have heard of that, right?

175
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,926
- ﻿Do you have changing sexual partners?
- I beg your pardon?

176
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,456
﻿At my age?

177
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,366
- Did you have changing sexual partners?
- No, I Didn't.

178
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:47,966
﻿I’ve only ever had one in my life.

179
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,036
﻿Maybe it was the beasts.

180
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,846
﻿I worked the slaughterhouse for 30 years.
Now they don't want me because of this...

181
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:58,376
﻿It's only transmitted from human to human.
﻿Affairs?

182
00:17:58,616 --> 00:17:59,946
﻿Are you kidding?

183
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:03,486
﻿The Department of Health
﻿demands that all cases be documented.

184
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:06,716
﻿The state wants to know what its citizens
﻿are up to. So, any love affairs?

185
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,026
﻿Could have been a while ago.

186
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,656
﻿One.

187
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:18,766
﻿One's enough.

188
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,336
﻿Name?

189
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,706
﻿He's dead.

190
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,546
﻿Will it go away?

191
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:30,776
﻿No.

192
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,016
﻿You should go see a doctor, Mrs. Ritter.

193
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,516
﻿You should shut your face,
﻿Mrs. Cziczewicz.

194
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,486
﻿That one time?

195
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,896
﻿It was over 20 years ago.
﻿it can't be possible.

196
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,296
﻿This disease
﻿has a very long incubation period.

197
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,396
﻿Twenty years, you say?

198
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:54,796
﻿There she is.

199
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,106
﻿What's wrong?

200
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,106
﻿Mum went to the doctor.

201
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:04,846
﻿And?

202
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,146
﻿Bad weeds grow tall.

203
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,686
﻿Don't say that

204
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:10,816
﻿A rash, nothing else.

205
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,516
﻿You have to get some ointment for me.

206
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,126
- ﻿What did he say exactly?
- Who?

207
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:17,556
﻿Why, the doctor.

208
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,326
﻿I went to see Völcker.

209
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:25,136
﻿That I have reddened skin, she said.
Due to the germs.

210
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:28,366
﻿I don't know, nothing special.
﻿And now enough of that.

211
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,806
﻿But you won't get better
﻿in that damp slaughterhouse.

212
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,836
﻿That's why they didn’t want me anymore.

213
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,846
- ﻿I could go to the slaughterhouse.
- No way.

214
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,546
﻿He should go find work.

215
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:44,446
﻿But no broad's work at the slaughterhouse.

216
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,586
﻿He couldn't get any maggots out
﻿with these paws.

217
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:49,386
﻿why doesn’t the girl go
﻿if I can't find anything?

218
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,956
﻿Are you all right in the head?
﻿Toni goes to school.

219
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,126
﻿That's what we go to work for.

220
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,466
﻿Calm down. I'm still here. I'll be fine.

221
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,536
﻿Look at the tramp.
﻿Always a tenner in her pocket.

222
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,536
- You what?
﻿ - Wonder where she gets them from.

223
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,976
﻿What did you say?

224
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:14,076
- ﻿Come on, say it again.
- Lotte!

225
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:15,846
﻿- Calm down.
﻿- Go on the game

226
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,886
﻿and then act like a shame bush?

227
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,456
- Go earn some money...
- Stop!

228
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,296
- ...﻿or keep your filthy gob shut!
- Are you nuts?

229
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,696
﻿That's enough!

230
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,596
﻿I'll kill you!

231
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:34,866
- Bastard!
﻿- Leave her alone.

232
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,806
﻿Stop it!

233
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,376
﻿Look.

234
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,286
﻿Bloody broads!

235
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,456
﻿- Am I the only one...
﻿- Nuts or what?

236
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,056
﻿...who has any common sense?

237
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,696
﻿- Your husband's a scallywag.
- ﻿So? At least I only have one.

238
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,836
﻿Over there, Café Josty.

239
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,546
﻿You'll wait for me in the car

240
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,416
﻿Caretaker! I'm sorry.

241
00:21:57,486 --> 00:22:00,156
- Forgot my key.
﻿ - Kardakov, you gave me a fright.

242
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:03,486
- ﻿Come on in.
﻿- Thank you.

243
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:12,996
﻿Sveta?

244
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,016
﻿Svetlana?

245
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:09,426
﻿A planned thing... Assassination...

246
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,396
﻿National affair...

247
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:20,036
﻿Foreign Minister Stresemann...

248
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,366
﻿Right, Jänicke. Drive me home now.

249
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,116
﻿Emmi.

250
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:14,376
- Bruno, I...
﻿ - Don't worry It's OK

251
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,516
﻿You rest.

252
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,416
﻿I'll take care of it.

253
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,996
﻿Lotte. Lotte!

254
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,876
﻿I used to sit by your bed.

255
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:46,476
﻿So?

256
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,416
﻿You were different then.

257
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,746
﻿Is that all?

258
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,356
﻿We used to treat each other differently.

259
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,256
﻿Yeah, before Erich.

260
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,396
﻿I didn't choose him.

261
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:03,596
﻿You didn't have to marry the creep because
﻿of the brat and get knocked up again.

262
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,136
﻿You can talk

263
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,896
﻿You’ve just been lucky so far.

264
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:10,136
﻿I took care, Ilse.

265
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,336
﻿Look at yourself.

266
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:15,576
﻿You're sitting in a dump,
﻿you've locked yourself in.

267
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:20,276
﻿What a smug bitch you've become.

268
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:42,336
﻿He's going into the restaurant.

269
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,456
﻿Stay calm.

270
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:43,026
- ﻿I... to Kardakov
- Get out!

271
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,096
- ﻿He's my friend.
﻿- Get out right now!

272
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,496
﻿I'll call the police.

273
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:51,206
﻿Wait! No, don’t do that. Alexey Ivanovich!

274
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,476
﻿- Help!
﻿- Quiet!

275
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:56,876
﻿Help!

276
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:05,816
﻿- Thank you.
﻿- Already full?

277
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:09,226
﻿I can’t eat any more.
﻿It was really very good.

278
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,396
﻿My Emmi has always been a great chef.

279
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,266
﻿I have relatives in Cologne.

280
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,596
﻿- You do?
 - My cousin married an innkeeper.

281
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,536
﻿Of a famous inn. Der Bier-Esel.

282
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:25,676
﻿Oh, really? Thank you.

283
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:29,506
﻿Mussels and beer.
﻿My father used to be a regular there.

284
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,746
﻿His old man will be
﻿Cologne's next Chief of Police.

285
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:35,276
﻿If all goes well.

286
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,656
﻿Are you going steady?

287
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,456
﻿- Pardon?
﻿- Married?

288
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:44,856
﻿No.

289
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,926
﻿Leave him alone, Emmi.
﻿He's had a tough day.

290
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,426
﻿Bruno never tells me about his work.

291
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,136
﻿It's better that way, Emmi dear.

292
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,436
﻿Believe me.

293
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,606
﻿Please excuse me. I'm going to bed.

294
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,846
﻿Again, thank you very much.

295
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,786
﻿You're welcome.

296
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,986
- ﻿Good night.
﻿- Good night.

297
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,426
- ﻿Sleep well.
- Yes.

298
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,266
﻿Right, my friend.

299
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,666
﻿Let’s do some straight talking.

300
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:35,976
﻿Why did Benda want to talk to you alone?

301
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,606
﻿What do you mean?

302
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:41,776
﻿Come on. I've been in this business long
﻿enough. Don't beat about the bush.

303
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,386
﻿What do you want, Bruno?

304
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:47,216
﻿I don’t want to be the fool in the dark.

305
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,386
﻿I won’t tell you.

306
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,026
﻿Alright.

307
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:00,296
﻿But I will tell you that you have the
﻿honour of accompanying me tomorrow.

308
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:01,696
﻿Where to?

309
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,106
﻿Kreuzberg.

310
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,816
﻿First of May. The Reds want to demonstrate
﻿and we'll stop them.

311
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,346
﻿Yes. Special operation.

312
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,986
﻿Comb houses, search flats for weapons.

313
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:22,656
﻿Pure Harassment.
﻿The real dirty work.

314
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:27,426
﻿- Maybe have a shot after all?
- ﻿No, thanks. Doesn't go with that.

315
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,126
﻿With what?

316
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,396
﻿With stupid questions.

317
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,836
﻿I'd like to know what you're about.

318
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:50,386
﻿Dear Helga, thank you for your letter
﻿which I received yesterday.

319
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:54,256
﻿It is good to know
﻿that everything is alright at home.

320
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,986
﻿Here, it's not that simple.

321
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:00,026
﻿I don't want to alarm you...

322
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,126
﻿but I still can't tell you for sure
﻿when I'll come home.

323
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,866
﻿Unforeseen incidences have stopped me

324
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:12,806
﻿from speedily fulfilling my tasks
﻿for the foreseeable future.

325
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,476
﻿If I look
﻿at the hustle and bustle around me.

326
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:22,846
﻿I think of our dream, and I feel
﻿a kind of hope I hadn't known before.

327
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:26,486
﻿The hope that
﻿we will find a way out of this secrecy,

328
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:29,856
﻿out of this secretiveness.

329
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:32,186
﻿Well? Dance some more tonight?

330
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:34,856
﻿Not tonight.

331
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,096
﻿Maybe tomorrow, who knows.

332
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,366
﻿Maybe even here in Berlin.

333
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,266
﻿Please think about it.

334
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,606
﻿And say hi to the boy from me.

335
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:50,776
﻿With best regards, yours, Gereon.

336
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:55,746
﻿Is that Kardakov?

337
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:58,546
﻿No, it's not him.

338
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:04,756
﻿BERLIN DIRECTORY 1929

339
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,346
﻿He's still here.

340
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:30,946
﻿In your room.

341
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:12,926
﻿Is that you?

342
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,896
﻿What is this, Alexey? Where have you been?

343
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,696
﻿What are you doing here?

344
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,796
﻿What the hell is going on?

345
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:49,096
﻿Go on, let’s get him.

346
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:51,796
﻿Drive!

347
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,436
﻿Turn the car around!

348
00:33:56,666 --> 00:34:00,406
﻿Leave me alone! What do you want?

349
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:05,646
- ﻿What kind of people are you?
- Get in!

350
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,516
﻿- Let me go!
﻿- That's enough!

351
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,256
﻿Help me, help me!

352
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,786
﻿Help! Help me!

353
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,896
﻿Help me!

354
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:22,496
﻿You have to help me, please!

355
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,866
﻿Help me!

356
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:43,186
﻿Do you want one too?

357
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:45,046
﻿Yes.

358
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,226
- ﻿Have you seen the man before?
- I don't know.

359
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,126
﻿He may have been one of them
﻿when they were meeting here.

360
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,066
﻿Excuse me.

361
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:57,996
﻿Who?

362
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,166
﻿The Russians.

363
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,166
﻿Sometimes there were a lot of them.

364
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,736
﻿Then it got noisy.

365
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:12,076
﻿Politics. In your room.

366
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:15,776
﻿Who was in there before me?

367
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,646
﻿Kardakov was his name.

368
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:21,656
﻿He was a violinist, actually.

369
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:26,426
But when he really got talking...

370
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:35,436
﻿I didn't understand a word,

371
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,166
﻿but if he had said jump!

372
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,506
﻿I would have jumped.

373
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,276
﻿He had something...

374
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,946
﻿Sometimes it was uncanny.

375
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,416
- ﻿The suitcase in my room?
- Yes, it's his.

376
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,656
﻿Sorry, he meant to pick it up yesterday.

377
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:56,156
﻿I'll take it to the basement tomorrow
﻿and that one too.

378
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:00,826
﻿Where did Kardakov go?

379
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:04,666
﻿On tour, for six months.
﻿With a whole orchestra.

380
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:09,066
﻿On a cruise ship.
﻿All the way to the Bosporus, he said.

381
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,766
﻿But why did he leave his instrument here?

382
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,676
﻿A mysterious guy.

383
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:23,686
﻿Sometimes he told me...

384
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:28,056
﻿He was on the other side in the war,
﻿not on ours.

385
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,286
﻿They fell...

386
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:33,956
﻿Like bees in the freezing cold, he said.

387
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:40,296
﻿I once dreamt that it was him
﻿who shot my Helmut.

388
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,706
﻿And that the Lord sent him to me.

389
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,936
﻿What a lot of rubbish.

390
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:52,246
﻿Were you in the war?

391
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,446
﻿I followed my brother to the front.

392
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:00,116
﻿Then I came back alone.

393
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,256
﻿So you know what it's like.

394
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:09,426
﻿To wake up in the morning... alone.

395
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:13,266
﻿To hate the silence, and the birds too.

396
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,866
﻿All that false peace.

397
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:19,976
﻿My mother couldn't cope.

398
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,776
﻿For her, the wrong son returned home.

399
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:36,226
﻿I'll take the suitcase down tomorrow
﻿if you’ll let me.

400
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:45,826
﻿Good night.

401
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,296
﻿Good night.

402
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:30,546
﻿First clashes with the Berlin police
﻿have already been reported.

403
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:35,346
﻿At this hour, KPD activists are handing
﻿out flyers in Wedding and Kreuzberg.

404
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:39,046
﻿These say that the ban on demonstrations
﻿was lifted.

405
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:41,616
﻿This is not true.

406
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,686
﻿Tomorrow, on 1 May,
﻿demonstrations are still banned.

407
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:47,856
﻿- Can't you sleep?
﻿- How, with this racket?

408
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,266
...﻿likely that violence will escalate,
﻿emphasised Chief of Police...

409
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,636
﻿I'm sorry.

410
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,896
- ﻿Was the radio on?
- Yes!

411
00:38:56,136 --> 00:39:01,236
- What was on?
﻿- I don't know, something political.

412
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:05,406
﻿Oh please, let's listen to it.

413
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,946
﻿Do you have any idea how late it is?
﻿I have to be up early!

414
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:16,526
﻿Come on, I'll make you a sandwich
﻿and we'll listen to it together.

415
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,486
﻿You translate.

416
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,626
﻿Like in the old days!

417
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:33,506
...﻿emerge stronger from the election
﻿campaign so that they keep working

418
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,336
﻿for the best of our fatherland.

419
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:39,976
﻿Now you will hear
﻿Gustav Mahler's Rückert Lieder

420
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,886
﻿and I Am Lost To The World.

421
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,166
- Music.
﻿- With singing?

422
00:39:58,636 --> 00:39:59,966
﻿Well then.

423
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,506
﻿A woman is singing...

424
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:08,606
﻿I am lost

425
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:13,776
﻿To the world

426
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:25,926
﻿With which I had spoiled

427
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:28,856
﻿A lot of time

428
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:35,966
﻿For a long time

429
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:41,336
﻿It hasn't heard from me

430
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:11,306
﻿It may well think

431
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:16,376
﻿That I have died

432
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:36,626
﻿And it doesn't matter to me

433
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:54,676
﻿Alright now, fella.

434
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:58,446
﻿Tell us what your plan was.

435
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,056
﻿I don't know what you mean.

436
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,496
﻿Your plan? The Red Fortress.
﻿Your Fourth International.

437
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:10,726
﻿- What was your plan?
- ﻿I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:16,536
﻿I really don't know. I'm a railway worker.

439
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,606
﻿There is no point in lying.
﻿We know who you are.

440
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,576
﻿What did you want at Kardakov's place?

441
00:42:28,686 --> 00:42:31,946
﻿What does the Red Fortress plan?

442
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:38,826
﻿What's in Istanbul? What’s your plan?

443
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:42,056
﻿Talk. Talk!

444
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,026
﻿Why Istanbul?

445
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:51,466
﻿Trotsky is there. That much I know.
﻿But I don’t know anything else.

446
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,536
﻿I was supposed to meet Kardakov
﻿at the train. That's all.

447
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:56,706
﻿Kardakov is dead.

448
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:01,776
﻿But he was friendly enough
﻿to leave us this.

449
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,586
﻿The Red Fortress...

450
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:12,086
﻿sends a train to Trotsky,

451
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:13,696
﻿to Istanbul.

452
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:18,826
﻿Tell us why.
﻿Why are you sending him a train?

453
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,996
﻿Why to Istanbul? Talk!

454
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:26,676
﻿What’s on that train?
﻿What's in that wagon? Tell us.

455
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,176
﻿What?

456
00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:37,186
﻿A lot of gold.

457
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:39,146
﻿Gold? What gold?

458
00:43:39,556 --> 00:43:43,056
﻿The Kulaks' gold, stolen from the museums?
﻿What gold, my boy?

459
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:49,296
﻿It's the Sorokins' gold.

459

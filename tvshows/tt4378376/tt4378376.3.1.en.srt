1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,160
Previously on Babylon Berlin:

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,120
I will guide you to the truth.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
Gereon!

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,800
-Did you go to war?
-I followed my brother.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
I came back alone.
My mother never got over that.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,800
For her, the wrong son came home.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,880
Anno was officially declared dead.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,520
-And now?
-We're here if you want us to.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
Lotte? Where have you been?

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,880
Everywhere.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,200
-I want to join homicide.
-No women there.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,440
-I don't do detective sergeants.
-Don't worry.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,280
Let's settle the matter between ourselves.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,040
What's the matter with you?

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
Get lost!
I don't want to see you again.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,080
-Mr. Benda is not a murderer.
-He's the boss of the polit police.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,920
No! Fritz!

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,160
That Benda of yours, it was his people.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,720
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
Fritz, what are you doing here?

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,320
You're mistaking me.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,080
What's this, Daddy?

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,520
Do you recognise me?

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Anno?

25
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
Stop! What are you doing?

26
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,520
You can't go out there.

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Don't go out there! Stay inside, mate!

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,320
We want our money back!

29
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,200
FIVE WEEKS EARLIER
20 SEPTEMBER 1929

30
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,280
-Why so many rolls?
-I don't know.

31
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,760
-Morning.
-Didn't he...

32
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,920
-Morning. When did you get home?
-Morning.

33
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,840
Late. Didn't want to disturb you.

34
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
Don't get upset.

35
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,880
WOMEN'S PENAL INSTITUTION
BERLIN-FRIEDRICHSHAIN

36
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,120
REJECTED
REJECTED

37
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,360
You are very persistent in this matter.

38
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,200
It's my heartfelt wish, Madam.

39
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Greta Overbeck and I are close.

40
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
She doesn't give us that impression.

41
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,920
-Why ever not?
-It doesn't say that here.

42
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,280
She expressedly refuses to see anybody.

43
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,680
In particular DS Charlotte Ritter.

44
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm just an assistant detective.

45
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,440
It says DS here.

46
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,920
Well, I can't help you there.

47
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,960
You're not even related.

48
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Please sign here.

49
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,480
One more thing, Weintraub.
This is Mr Ulrich from police records.

50
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
What does the joker want?

51
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,800
Dactyloscopy.

52
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,520
-Fingerprints.
-Just a formality.

53
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
-For the discharge?
-For our files. Prophylactical.

54
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,400
Precautionary.

55
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Please.

56
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,480
Well then, show me how you do it.

57
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Thumb.

58
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,840
This is part of it.

59
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,760
GATE 2

60
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,520
Look at that, Stick-it-in Fuchs.

61
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
Welcome.

62
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,560
Well, well, well.

63
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,960
Clothes become people, huh?

64
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,560
Senor Walter.

65
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Cigarette?

66
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Here you are.

67
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
Vera?

68
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Mr. Weintraub.

69
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
Caught red-handed.

70
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,960
You know what? You go ahead.

71
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,440
-I'll go for a little spin with madam.
-They're all waiting.

72
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,720
All the more suspense.

73
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Come closer.

74
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Don't you worry.

75
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,280
I won't hurt you. Come on.

76
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,680
FILM STUDIOS NEUBABELSBERG
POTSDAM-NOWAWES

77
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,000
We'll repeat the stage part
of "We've long lost each other",

78
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,640
the third and fourth shot.
Let's get to work.

79
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,400
-Quiet, please.
-We're rolling.

80
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,400
-Sound.
-Sound is running.

81
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,720
-Roll it.
-89-15, take two.

82
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,760
And action.

83
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,320
I don't see where you are going

84
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,120
When there is silence, and loneliness

85
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,000
Is heavy on my mind, and there is

86
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
A wind of grief and sorrow blowing

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,840
You don't want to tell me where

88
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,520
Your travels lead your contrary self

89
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,800
Then I must painfully but with purpose

90
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,800
Ask the question you are posing

91
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
It was looming inside of me
for a long time

92
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,760
It was pressing inside of me
for a long time

93
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
The longing that I once had

94
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Indignation has displaced it now

95
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,920
We have long lost each other

96
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,480
We've grown apart in our hearts

97
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,880
We are the tail of yesterday's magic

98
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,400
And in our souls pain alone is burning

99
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,040
Yesterday is melting

100
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,760
Tomorrow is stony

101
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Hope is making way to doom

102
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,160
There's no world where we are still safe

103
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,600
And lonely I go who knows where

104
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,160
So much happiness was allotted to us

105
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,120
But now it's extinct in our souls

106
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,560
The long wait is followed by giving way

107
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,120
It's cold in my heart
I make no secret of it

108
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,440
We have long lost each other

109
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,760
We've grown apart in our hearts

110
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,880
We are the tail of yesterday's magic

111
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,120
And in our souls pain alone is burning

112
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Betty?

113
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh God.

114
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,560
What are you doing?

115
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,560
I'm sorry, my little flower.

116
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,000
First,
you have to do what you have to do.

117
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,160
And then...

118
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,400
...you can do what you want to do.

119
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,680
-Yes?
-This is Bellman.

120
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,360
There's been an accident at the studio.

121
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,560
-What kind of accident?
-I, I, I...

122
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,120
Stop the stammering, Bellman, talk.

123
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
Betty Winter is dead.

124
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
I'm coming.

125
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,880
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

126
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Hello.

127
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,160
Hi.

128
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
You'll have to hurry if you want
to read all these before your exam.

129
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,840
No, I'm just returning them
to the library.

130
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,320
May I?

131
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
-What's the exam?
-Forensics.

132
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
With Ulrich from the records department
and Gennat.

133
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,320
30 minutes with practical part, crime
scene analysis and securing of evidence.

134
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Not exactly my strengths, I fear.

135
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,040
You can do this.

136
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,600
-You think?
-Why yes, of course.

137
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,200
Did you go to prison this morning?

138
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,640
Yup. Greta doesn't want to see me.

139
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
She expressedly put that on record.

140
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,560
-The judgement is still out.
-I have to go.

141
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
Break a leg!

142
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,280
I didn't mean it like that.

143
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Hi, boss.

144
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,400
-What's up?
-Stay there, we have to go downstairs.

145
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,160
-Where to?
-Babelsberg film studios.

146
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,520
Buddha's order,
we're to go there immediately.

147
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
Betty Winter.

148
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
One of the greatest, what am I saying,
the greatest hope

149
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
we have on stage and in film.

150
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
-Had.
-Pardon?

151
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Well, now she's...

152
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,160
This is a huge tragedy.

153
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
And I only just met her.

154
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,960
-You mean personally?
-Less than a fortnight ago.

155
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,560
An autograph session in Babelsberg,

156
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,040
on Betty's birthday.

157
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,560
Studio shoot for her last film.

158
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,720
Demon of Passion.

159
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,040
-Doesn't that already exist?
-Only on stage.

160
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,120
But now a brandnew musical film,
with sound.

161
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,440
So you hear them talk, at the cinema?

162
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes, and not just talk. They also sing.

163
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
Incredible woman.

164
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,800
No wonder the Americans
wanted to lure her there.

165
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
Who was that again?

166
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,200
Her husband, Tristan Rot.

167
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,120
He plays the male lead in the film.

168
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,440
Her husband? I thought he was queer.

169
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,240
Yes, he is, but he loved her.

170
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Very much.

171
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,920
What's going on here?

172
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,240
Once again, the press was faster than us.

173
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Detective, what's going on here?

174
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,520
Do you know more
about the Betty Winter case?

175
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,680
CID, make way.

176
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,920
-No recordings.
-Article 118 of the Reich law:

177
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,960
-Every citizen has the right...
-But not now and not here.

178
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,320
-There is no censorship.
-That's enough.

179
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
Reinhold,
can't you do something? Please.

180
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,120
Close the gates.

181
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't touch anything.

182
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
-Homicide division, hello.
-Homicide?

183
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,880
But it was an accident.

184
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,960
-Who are you?
-Jo Bellman, I'm the producer.

185
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,960
It was obviously an accident.

186
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,440
I mean, we all saw it...

187
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,040
We're here to clarify this.

188
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,560
You stay with me.
Everyone else please wait off the set.

189
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,040
So, what exactly happened?

190
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,640
Case study no. 16. A lifeless body,

191
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,160
found in the early morning
by the family gardener

192
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,800
in the property's garage,
identified by the wife,

193
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
who called the police immediately.

194
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,160
All external circumstances
point towards suicide.

195
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,400
Miss...

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,720
-Ritter. Charlotte Ritter.
-Please, Miss Ritter. Ladies first.

197
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
What?

198
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,520
Explain the five steps of the procedure
to determine death,

199
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,920
Gennat method.

200
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,960
One, I get a first general overview
of the crime scene.

201
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,280
-Here?
-Exactly here.

202
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Please don't touch.

203
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Two, staff will look for evidence
and clues.

204
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,440
-How could this have happened?
-The lamp toppled

205
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
and the screw heads were torn out.

206
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,240
Where's the cable for the spotlight?

207
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,080
-It's here.
-Don't touch!

208
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,720
It's quite the weight, 10kW.

209
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,520
Boss, shall we start?

210
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,200
-Search the set for clues. Gennat method.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Gloves!

212
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,320
Very good, the gloves.

213
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
Each detail is tagged.

214
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,840
The spotlight
was fixed with these screws.

215
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,240
Completely intact.

216
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,600
Three, take pictures of the crime scene.

217
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,280
Four, witnesses are questioned.

218
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,440
My husband was with me all night.

219
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
One moment, Mrs Klopsch.
First the question, then the answer.

220
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
-Sorry.
-What's your name?

221
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,000
Tilly Brooks.

222
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
I see. Where are you from?

223
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
-Boston.
-Boston?

224
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,200
Can you tell me in more detail?

225
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,800
I didn't see anything,
I was looking the other way.

226
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,440
-What about the husband, Tristan Rot?
-Tristan?

227
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,880
I didn't see anything,
I was up on the rope.

228
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,200
-Rot wasn't here today.
-It was his day off, as far as I know.

229
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
Who's responsible for the lighting?

230
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,800
Peter Glaser, the gaffer.

231
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Where is he?

232
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,040
He only oversaw the set up. Then they
changed shift and he left with the others.

233
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Do you have his data on file?

234
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
-Of course.
-Where do you suspect fingerprints?

235
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,640
-Up there, on the balustrade.
-Correct. Take your time.

236
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,680
On the door handle,
on the steering wheel...

237
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Keep going.

238
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,120
-And on the hose on the exhaust pipe.
-Very good.

239
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,920
Detective, the incident was filmed
by this camera.

240
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,720
We need to have it developed
immediately.

241
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,680
I ventured to have that arranged.

242
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,920
Here you are.

243
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Peter Glaser's personal file.

244
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Very well. That's it from us now.

245
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,880
Mr Bellman.

246
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,920
The fifth and last step,

247
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,400
evacuation of the body and evaluation
of the results at headquarters.

248
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,360
Very good, Miss Ritter. Thank you. Next.

249
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,520
Detective!

250
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,880
We need you to sign
that it was an accident. Here.

251
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,960
You'll get it
once we've evaluated everything.

252
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,840
And if it was an accident.

253
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,600
In the lab,
the dactyloscopic examination showed

254
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,600
that the deceased's fingerprints
are not congruent with those

255
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,120
found on the hose on the exhaust pipe.

256
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,040
A comparison with the wife's fingerprints,

257
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,400
seen on the right here,

258
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,600
confirm the assumption
that this was no suicide,

259
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,720
this was an insidious murder
by the wife.

260
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Thank you.

261
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,680
And the motive?

262
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,160
-Revenge.
-Really?

263
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,280
Yes.
The husband had poisoned her lapdog.

264
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,760
-Miss Doris, please write...
-Hang on, not so fast.

265
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,240
Please switch it off again.

266
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,360
Miss Ritter, please explain in more detail
the differences of the fingerprints.

267
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes, the...

268
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,480
The grooves are different.

269
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,960
The grooves?

270
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,680
Well, the dorm...

271
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,280
The dormal papillae.

272
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,240
-You mean the dermal papillae.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

273
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,360
The dermal papillae
are different in all people.

274
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,400
Yes, well, every child knows that.

275
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,480
But how do the images
of the dermal papillae differ?

276
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,720
The basic form.

277
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,720
By their basic form. There are
three basic forms and the minutes.

278
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,680
Minutes is what the clock has.

279
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,880
They are called minutiae, deduced from?

280
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,720
Latin for?

281
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,880
Minutiae.

282
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,320
Latin for detail.

283
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,200
Alright. But maybe
you can give us the basic forms.

284
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
Well, there are whorls,

285
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
and...

286
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
And?

287
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,480
Whorls and...

288
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Esther?

289
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,360
Walter is here.

290
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,120
About time.

291
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,480
Looks like
you've been expecting someone.

292
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,920
Welcome back.

293
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
Oh, my favourite pests.

294
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,560
What do I see there?

295
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
Well, look at that.

296
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,920
Where do these come from?

297
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Thank you.

298
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,400
Edgar.

299
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,880
Welcome home.

300
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
I need to show you something.

301
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,040
-What, right now?
-Yes.

302
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,880
We'll go to Moka Efti.

303
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,600
Won't take long.

304
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,800
No, wait.

305
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,640
I'll take that myself.

306
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,560
See you later, guys.

307
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,160
STOCK EXCHANGE
BERLIN-MITTE

308
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,760
Every single sector is joining in.

309
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,920
Each segment we banked on did well.

310
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,240
Some of them in two-digit percentages.

311
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,560
Mrs Nyssen, the ralley is going up.
The Dow Jones is at a historic high.

312
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,120
Prosperity for everyone.

313
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,960
The history of world finance
is re-written.

314
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
A few months ago,
no-one would have believed

315
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,480
that every American chimney sweep,
each German employee could have stock.

316
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
Our fund is banking on growth.

317
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,280
Particularly for large-scale investors
like you.

318
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,320
Mr Ahrensen, the trust is interested
in the new offer of your consortium.

319
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,800
This is encouraging.

320
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
What sum?

321
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,880
BUSINESS STATISTICS

322
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,080
45 million American dollars.

323
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
The economy is growing.

324
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
It's going uphill all the time.

325
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,760
Prosperity for everyone.

326
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
Do you believe that?

327
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I beg your pardon?

328
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,200
You see, Wegener, I am someone
who is seeing a mad-doctor.

329
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,920
He says he's a "psychotherapist".

330
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,600
But I say he's a mad-doctor.

331
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,560
I see him
because I was peculiar as a child.

332
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Never played with the others.

333
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,280
I would have liked to but...

334
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
I didn't really know how.

335
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,600
Anyway...

336
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,720
He says I'm manic, my mad-doctor.

337
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,680
That's when you want to do and achieve
a lot very fast at the same time.

338
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,880
Off the cuff,
without practice or skills.

339
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,320
You could say megalomaniac.

340
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,840
And he says I'm depressed.

341
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,880
That's when you don't want to do
or achieve anything at all.

342
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,400
Except maybe die or... just lie in bed.

343
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,840
And those two phases, the manic and
the depressive, they alternate with me.

344
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,920
My mad-doctor is supposed
to anticipate the changes and...

345
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,920
...to adjust my medication accordingly.

346
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
Right now, for instance, Wegener,

347
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,840
a manic phase is coming.

348
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,680
And do you know

349
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,400
how to recognise a manic phase?

350
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,120
You suddenly grasp
all the interdependencies.

351
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,640
What we see right now
is a mania at the stock market.

352
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,680
Something is inflated here.

353
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,880
Wegener, that Ahrensen guy
and his Jewish business finance,

354
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,960
they are nothing but a state-subsidised,
international criminal gang.

355
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,800
We'll put a stop to their game.

356
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,520
And we'll get our money back
and our country.

357
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,280
With their means.

358
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,920
We need to get a hold of the client lists
of the large banks.

359
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,120
I want to know if the small investors
really all fall for this scam and...

360
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,960
And how much they actually know
about this.

361
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm sure it's possible
to procure those client lists.

362
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,600
But illegal.

363
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,880
Yes, we're turning criminal now,
Wegener.

364
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,960
The mail!

365
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

366
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Curtains.

367
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
It's heavy.

368
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
Here, let me help you.

369
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,840
Thank you.

370
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
You're welcome.

371
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
-Ok. Bye.
-Bye.

372
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,200
First he acts all friendly
and gives me a "you'll be fine" look,

373
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,840
and then he fails me.

374
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,160
-Because of the minutes?
-Minutiae.

375
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,360
-Can't you take the exam again?
-In a year.

376
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,760
What do I do without
investigatory powers for one year?

377
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,120
Now I'm not allowed
first access at crime scenes.

378
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,880
And Doris told me all male candidates
passed and they were a lot worse.

379
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,040
-So you need to be better.
-I am better!

380
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,240
They simply don't want any women
in the department.

381
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
I do.

382
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,480
Charlotte, stop it.

383
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
You're still an assistant detective.

384
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,200
Even without the crime scene permit.

385
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,120
And I need your alert mind now.

386
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Are you coming?

387
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Where to?

388
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,800
We're going to the pictures.

389
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,160
You have to learn to distinguish between
relevant and irrelevant questions.

390
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,440
Is it irrelevant
if you know what minutiae are?

391
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,560
The young woman established
the circumstances of the crime perfectly.

392
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,600
And then you threw her off track.

393
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,840
I asked for simple technical knowledge.

394
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,120
It's your credo, Criminal Counsellor.

395
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,800
The biggest secrets are hidden
in the smallest of details.

396
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Precision is important in our work.

397
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,600
But pettiness is harmful.

398
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,760
This is where we disagree, Mr Ulrich.

399
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Mr Gräf.

400
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Go ahead.

401
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,720
Appalling.

402
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,800
Can we see the last part again?

403
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,720
I can only show you all of it.

404
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,800
But we have a cutting table.

405
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Ok.

406
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,160
Well, I never.

407
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
How did this happen?

408
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,920
Someone tampered with the water pipe.

409
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
It was a proper explosion.

410
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
-So it wasn't an accident?
-No.

411
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,440
Who would have done that?

412
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,400
I don't know yet.

413
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,120
There's more bad news.

414
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Betty Winter.

415
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,000
No accident, either.

416
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,400
What makes you say that?

417
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,320
I tidied the place
before the cops arrived.

418
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,120
The spotlight had been tampered with.

419
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
-Who knows about this?
-No-one...

420
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,120
...saw anything.

421
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
-No-one.
-Is that clear?

422
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Sawed through?

423
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Walter, there was something fishy
about the production from the start.

424
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,320
Right away, a fire in props storage.

425
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,440
One week later,
a crane falls onto the set.

426
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,560
The next day,
someone steals the camera off the truck,

427
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
and then...

428
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,600
...two weeks later,

429
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,640
there's a murder.

430
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,320
Who is behind that? What do you think?

431
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Walter, we invested a lot of money,
you hear? A shitload.

432
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
How much of ours is in there?

433
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
One million.

434
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,800
And a second million from the bank.

435
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,680
Screw me.

436
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,400
If the cops find out that it wasn't
an accident, we'll be left with the costs.

437
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,600
I think we'll have to visit some people
in the near future.

438
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,320
Stop. There.

439
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Her.

440
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,000
What is she doing?

441
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,000
What is she looking at?

442
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,160
-Do we know who it is?
-Tilly Brooks.

443
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,920
That name doesn't ring a bell.

444
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,040
The lady's name is Mathilde Spielmann.

445
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,280
Tilly Brooks must be an alias.

446
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,120
-Do you have her address?
-Yes.

447
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,480
I'd like to question her.

448
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,160
-I'll visit her.
-Or I.

449
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,840
Or both of you?

450
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,800
Yes, boss.

451
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,560
Oh, I'll take that now.
I'm going to the lab now, Mrs... Rath.

452
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,920
-Do I have to do anything else?
-The nurse wrote down your appointment?

453
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
Yes.

454
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
That's it? No examination?

455
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,200
No. We'll inject a mouse
with your sample.

456
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
If there is chorionic gonadotropin
in your urine,

457
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,400
the animal's ovaries will react
with ovulation within the next 72 hours.

458
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,760
Come back later this week
for an appointment with Dr. Zondek.

459
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Ok.

460
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,920
Next, please.

461
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Finished your work, miss?

462
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Where's Toni?

463
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Toilet.

464
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,640
And, has he been in already?

465
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,840
-Who?
-The day sleeper.

466
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,800
Oh, him. Yes, just now.

467
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
Just now?

468
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,120
He's supposed to be out by seven.

469
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,320
He's got the day, we have the night.
It's in the lease.

470
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,200
It's nearly eight now.

471
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,160
You can discuss it with the man himself.

472
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,920
But I don't know him.

473
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
What? Still haven't seen
your fellow tenant?

474
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Not so far, no.

475
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,960
Give it to me, moron.

476
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,480
There you are.

477
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Come on.

478
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,240
Oh, he's left a mess again, that idiot.

479
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
Typical.

480
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,200
Just drops everything.

481
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Alright.

482
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,560
He should read it, that swine.
House rules.

483
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,320
At least he has a gramophone.

484
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Right, now we'll put everything
in his bed linen.

485
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,720
Through all of history

486
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,440
A breeze of emancipation is blowing

487
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,720
From human beings to infusoria

488
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,040
Woman wants to be on the throne
everywhere

489
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,560
From the Amazons to the girls of Berlin...

490
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,400
Look at this. Disgusting thing.

491
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,720
Throw it away!

492
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,760
What men can do

493
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,800
We've been doing for a long time

494
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,080
And maybe a whole lot more

495
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,640
Out with the men in the Reichstag

496
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,800
And out with the men in the Landtag

497
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,440
And out with the men in the manor house

498
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,960
We'll turn it into a woman's house

499
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,960
Out with the men in existence

500
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,600
And out with the men who are still here

501
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,520
And out with the men who are over there

502
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,240
They should already have gone

503
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,680
Yeah, out with the men in the den

504
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
And into those places with the women

505
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, there you go.

506
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,920
Truth is a treacherous beast.

507
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,920
Our alliance with the past is diffused
by our desire to form versions

508
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,680
and variations of our experiences.

509
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,000
But there are no versions of the truth.

510
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
The truth is singular.

511
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,080
There is a subject across from me today,
let's call him Siegfried.

512
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
The challenge is to demonstrate with him

513
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,880
how much man tends to get tangled up
in lies and self-deception,

514
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,560
solely because of his desire
to have everything he experiences

515
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,920
and which seems incomprehensible
make sense.

516
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,640
Siegfried, are you ready?

517
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Yes.

518
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,200
Focus. Don't waste any time
for your answers.

519
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,120
The more time an answer has
to follow a question,

520
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,280
the less room there is for the truth.

521
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,280
So answer my questions
immediately now.

522
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Yes.

523
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
-Do you love the ocean?
-Yes.

524
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,840
-Do you love mountains?
-No.

525
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,880
-Do you love cigarettes?
-Yes.

526
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,560
-Have you ever killed a human being?
-Yes.

527
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,400
-When did you kill them?
-In the war.

528
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,040
And in civil life?

529
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,600
-Yes.
-Do you love your father?

530
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Yes.

531
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,920
Do you love your father?

532
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
Yes.

533
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
-Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

534
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
-You distract. Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

535
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,360
Your tears are distracting.
Why are you crying?

536
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Because...

537
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,320
-...it hurts.
-Correct.

538
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,200
-You feel the pain because you lied?
-Yes.

539
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,560
-You redirected it into tears?
-Yes.

540
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,440
Speaking the truth will conquer your pain.

541
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Yes.

542
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,120
Do you love your father?

543
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,200
I hate him.

544
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,440
-Do you desire other women?
-Yes.

545
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,080
-Do you desire the woman you live with?
-Yes.

546
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,000
-No.
-If not, why not?

547
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,640
-I don't know.
-If not, why not?

548
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,760
-I don't know. I don't know!
-If not, then why not?

549
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,960
-Because I am lying to her.
-Why do you have to lie to her?

550
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,760
Because he's demanding me to.

551
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,640
-Who is he?
-My brother.

552
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,320
Where is your brother?

553
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,280
Where is your brother?

554
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,800
My brother is dead.

555
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,080
-Is that the truth?
-Yes.

556
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,440
What is demanded of you?

557
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,560
To tell the truth.

558
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,360
Why do you lie
to the woman you live with?

559
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,280
-I don't lie to her.
-That's right.

560
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,160
-Where is your brother?
-He is dead.

561
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,280
-Do you lie to the woman you live with?
-No.

562
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,640
You see?

563
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
But...

564
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,360
...I'm losing her.

565
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,920
-You're not losing her.
-Yes, I am.

566
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,840
-You're not losing her.
-She's leaving, I'm losing her.

567
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,520
You can't lose her.

568
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Why?

569
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,400
Because she's not yours.

570
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,240
-Repeat this.
-She's not mine.

571
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,560
You can't lose anything
because you don't own anything.

572
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
I own nothing.

573
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,520
You're not afraid
because you can't lose anything. Say it.

574
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,320
I'm not afraid...
because I don't own anything.

575
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,120
You have embarked on a journey,

576
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,080
Siegfried, on a journey to the light.

577
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,480
Do you understand what I'm saying?

578
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,160
Yes.

579
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,320
Do you want to guide us,
from the darkness to the light?

580
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Yes.

581
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,560
Do you want to guide us
from the darkness to the light?

582
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Yes.

583
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,760
The truth to the light?

584
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,760
-To the truth, to the light.
-To the truth,

585
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,320
to the light.

586
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,800
To the truth, to the light.

587
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,240
To the truth, to the light.

588
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,200
To the truth, to the light...

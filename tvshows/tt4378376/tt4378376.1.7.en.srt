00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,744
﻿Previously on Babylon Berlin...

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,880
﻿You owe me a report for the first of May.

3
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,281
﻿I'm working on it.

4
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:18,218
﻿They only ever made one copy
﻿of each of König's films.

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:21,588
﻿You know I guaranteed that we would solve
﻿this problem before the elections.

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,790
﻿Bruno?

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:23,857
﻿I need your help.

8
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,259
﻿I have to find Krajewski.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,460
﻿He's the key.

10
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:30,397
﻿If you need anything, look, this is
﻿what I have for you when you sing.

11
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:31,965
﻿I need something stronger.

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,935
﻿I thought it was just the thing
﻿for you shaking chickens.

13
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,337
﻿By the way, Kardakov was there last night.

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,807
- ﻿Where, in Berlin?
﻿- In Sorokina’s flat

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,309
﻿They killed them all because of you.

16
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,778
﻿They are all dead!

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,548
﻿At Wormsstrasse.
﻿There’s some kind of basement.

18
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,684
﻿It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress.

19
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,820
﻿Let the train pass.

20
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,622
- According to our...
﻿- It runs by order of the Reichswehr.

21
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:57,991
﻿Someone needs to sign off
﻿the freight papers.

22
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,661
﻿It's Major General Seegers.

23
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:04,498
﻿One of the wagons
﻿contains a different freight.

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,966
﻿We can't examine them here.

25
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,435
﻿There must be somewhere
﻿where they can be opened.

26
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,137
﻿You have the necessary staff?

27
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,839
﻿Were you at the front line?

28
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:16,643
﻿I've seen this a thousand times.
﻿Looks much like a gas attack.

29
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,680
﻿Gas!

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

31
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,483
﻿Did the paper get wet? Please iron it.

32
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:04,224
﻿- Greta, the coffee, please.
﻿- Right away, Mrs. Benda.

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,879
﻿Thank you.

34
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,520
﻿Yes, thank you.

35
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,792
﻿No. Here.

36
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,233
﻿Greta, and the eggs...

37
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,135
﻿go there.

38
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:49,937
﻿And five minutes, please.

39
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,139
﻿Mr. Councillor?

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,807
﻿Madam?

41
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,142
﻿Yes?

42
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,279
﻿I wanted to say thank you
﻿for employing me.

43
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,216
﻿Yes, no problem.

44
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,621
﻿And the children?

45
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,156
﻿I'll go right away.

46
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,226
﻿We shouldn't be waiting for them,
﻿but the other way around.

47
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,265
﻿Greta? The door, please.

48
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,873
﻿Good morning.

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,445
﻿Schwarz is my name, from pathology.
﻿I urgently need to talk to the councillor.

50
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,847
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,303
﻿Today I speak about
﻿the phenomenon of war neuroses.

52
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:33,307
﻿In common parlance also known
﻿as shell-shock or bomb-shell disease.

53
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:37,778
﻿External characteristics
﻿are an extensive loss of physical control,

54
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,514
﻿muscle spasms in all extremities

55
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:44,217
﻿Uncontrollable convulsions
﻿in the head and face area.

56
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,020
﻿The symptoms of those
﻿former front line soldiers,

57
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:52,359
﻿who have the gruesome fate of their
﻿generation written into their bodies,

58
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:55,996
﻿are witness of the most
﻿disturbing experiences in the field.

59
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,000
﻿The body punishes the soul

60
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:04,137
﻿for all the impositions of the war
﻿by rebelling.

61
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,375
﻿Experts also insinuate

62
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:12,546
﻿that the majority of those cases
﻿are simulators

63
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:16,316
﻿or cowards who use some sort
﻿of medical fringe phenomenon

64
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:19,519
﻿to evade their responsibility to society.

65
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,622
﻿We must object to that vehemently.

66
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:25,125
﻿My studies from the past seven years show

67
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:29,029
﻿that those affected
﻿actually suffer with a mental disorder.

68
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,201
﻿Let me give you a concrete example.

69
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:41,141
﻿Private Krajewski,
﻿32 years of age on arrival.

70
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:48,015
﻿At my institute, we use a new three-step
﻿procedure I have developed.

71
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:53,587
﻿The first step is sedation of the patient
﻿with barbituric acid derivative

72
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:59,359
﻿and put into a hypnotic state
﻿by means of suggestion.

73
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,228
﻿Hypnosis!

74
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:05,232
﻿In hypnosis, we take the patient back...

75
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,801
﻿to the source of his trauma.

76
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,871
﻿To the horrors of war.

77
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:16,076
﻿The images of his memory go as deep

78
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,612
﻿as what we call the subconscious.

79
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,848
﻿We? Who is we?

80
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,518
﻿Is there an above-conscious, too?

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,357
﻿In the second step of the treatment
﻿we conduct projective tests

82
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,993
﻿according to the method
﻿of Professor Rohrschach.

83
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,795
﻿- Rohrschach? Poppycock.
- Yes.

84
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,598
﻿With their help we localise
﻿the disorder exactly

85
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,669
﻿and slowly approach
﻿the patient's consciousness.

86
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:47,908
﻿Only now, the third and decisive phase
﻿of our treatment begins.

87
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:51,711
﻿The patient's trauma
﻿is directly addressed.

88
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,048
﻿When he is fully conscious.

89
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,153
﻿A conversational therapy can make
﻿the treatment a lasting success.

90
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,089
﻿That's humbug!

91
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,825
- ﻿What do you mean, success?
﻿- Where will this lead to?

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,861
﻿Electricity, mister.

93
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,330
- ﻿Muscle spindles. Heard of that?
- Dr. Schmidt

94
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,799
﻿The way I see it,
﻿the problem is long solved

95
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:17,871
﻿because those affected have either died or
﻿the symptoms disappeared over the years.

96
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,040
﻿- That's true!
﻿- Stop this!

97
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:24,678
﻿Yes, but the closed institutions are
﻿bursting with those ill-fated comrades.

98
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,980
﻿I'm talking of a thousand, 10,000 men.

99
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,015
﻿But it's good if they’re all gone.

100
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,650
﻿Gentlemen.

101
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,919
﻿The brain is an organ, not a poetry book.

102
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:34,721
﻿Many of them are war heroes.

103
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,856
﻿Heroes!

104
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,292
﻿- That's outrageous!
- Systematically removed from our midst,

105
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:43,130
﻿from our everyday life,
﻿because they remind us of a disaster

106
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:47,134
﻿which is being glorified
﻿by certain circles in our country!

107
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,936
﻿They are washouts!
﻿They sully the reputation of our army!

108
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:53,039
﻿- They are cowards and shirkers!
- Enough of this!

109
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,676
﻿Dr. Schmidt, you're a disgrace
﻿for our profession.

110
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,548
﻿- Pseudo science!
﻿- You are untenable!

111
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,950
﻿Strange methods!

112
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,786
﻿What a quack.

113
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:11,691
﻿SEVERIN PHARMACY

﻿...the construction sites,
﻿millions of visitors,

115
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,732
﻿the Jews, the hacks. And the prices!

116
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,934
﻿And all the broads are ugly.

117
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,068
﻿The bad food.

118
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,371
﻿The worst food ever.

119
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,374
﻿The worst beer, and the poverty.
﻿And rashes

120
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,510
﻿and scabies and...
﻿Am I right or am I right?

121
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,612
﻿I quite like it here.

122
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,949
﻿You're crazy, my child

123
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:40,387
﻿You have to go to Berlin, where the
﻿crazies are, that's where you belong

124
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:43,957
﻿Thank you.

127
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,627
﻿Dr. Schmidt sends me.

128
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,997
﻿From now on, this is the medicine
﻿for the patient who just left.

129
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,174
﻿Barbituric acid derivative.

130
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,278
﻿For the first step of the procedure.

131
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,071
﻿Ready, steady, go.

132
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:10,710
﻿So Kardakov just pretended
﻿to be a musician?

133
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,114
﻿No, I don't think so, but right now
﻿he's mainly doing revolution.

134
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,518
﻿Lights off, knife out.

135
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,390
﻿Right. Here.

136
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,392
﻿Thank you.

137
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,266
﻿Because of the black lungs
﻿you think he's a railway worker?

138
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,268
﻿That's right.

139
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,838
﻿- Well deduced, Toni.
﻿- Let me see.

140
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,709
- ﻿Where did you get the stamp from?
- Borrowed it.

141
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,578
﻿Looks genuine, doesn’t it?

142
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,384
﻿It says "police".

143
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,622
﻿No-one will look closely.
﻿As long as it's official.

﻿Use your clever head in school, Missy.

00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,695
﻿You're daft.

147
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,531
- ﻿Can't I come along?
﻿- To the freight yard?

148
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,800
﻿Have you lost your mind or something?

﻿- König shot himself.
﻿- But not of his own accord.

00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,384
﻿We'll be back.
﻿In the meantime, think about it.

﻿BERLIN-KREUZBERG

158
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:23,610
﻿Vessel AB-32-21, positive for phosgene.

159
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,247
﻿OK, let's pack up
﻿and go over to 64.

160
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,456
﻿- Hello.
- Hi.

161
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,325
﻿You look like someone who could help me.

162
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,496
﻿Well then. I'll help you.

163
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,665
﻿See? I said that.

164
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,801
﻿- Yes, me too.
- Good.

165
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,170
﻿Here's my all-important question.

166
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,206
﻿Go on then

167
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,375
﻿How many trains per week
﻿arrive here from Russia?

168
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:59,746
﻿I'd say two or three

169
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:02,949
﻿When did the last one arrive?

170
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,618
﻿Three days ago,
﻿the one with the big bang yesterday.

171
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,821
﻿Big bang.

172
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,056
﻿That's right.

173
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:14,794
﻿Hey, Werner.

174
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:18,598
﻿- Who's she?
﻿- Madam here is...

175
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,833
﻿With the press.

176
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,102
﻿- The juicy press?
﻿- Sо to speak.

177
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,604
﻿Berliner Illustrierte.

178
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:27,674
﻿You don't say. My wife reads that.

179
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,611
﻿- Do you have ID?
- Yes.

180
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,283
﻿Alright.

181
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,853
﻿I heard one of the wagons exploded.

182
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,522
﻿Oh, don't. That's just what I needed.

183
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,326
﻿Thank you, Fuchse. Got a light, too?

184
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,194
﻿Thank you.

185
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,397
﻿Some moron opened the hatch and...

186
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,871
﻿Like my kettle. That was some whistle.
﻿Took out some of our boys.

187
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:00,206
﻿And ever since...
﻿you can see for yourself.

188
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,975
﻿And inside?

189
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:07,213
﻿There are a couple of experts
﻿from Nyssen AG, examining the wagons.

190
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,282
﻿Who are the coats?

191
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,118
﻿They're all Russians.

192
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,288
﻿Secret service or I don’t know.

193
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,658
﻿They've been here
﻿since that thing exploded.

194
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,094
﻿It was a Soviet train.

195
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,962
﻿Can I take a look inside?

196
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,831
﻿Miss.

197
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,733
﻿You're something else.

198
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,635
﻿That's why I'm here.

199
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,870
﻿So that no-one takes a look.

200
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,516
﻿What? Yesterday?

201
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,520
﻿I don't believe it.

202
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,658
﻿How could that have happened?

203
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,995
﻿This should never have happened.

204
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,034
﻿Are you sure
﻿the Russians weren't involved?

205
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,039
﻿Yes. I read about it.
﻿A chemical accident.

206
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,082
﻿Alright.

207
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,084
﻿I agree.

208
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,119
﻿Let's do that.

209
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,489
﻿Alright.

210
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,692
﻿Let them examine the wagons, and...

211
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:30,363
﻿Let them examine the wagons, and if they
﻿find something they want be my guest.

212
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,133
﻿Yes. I'll calm down. Yes.

213
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,537
﻿I agree. Excellent yes.

214
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,046
﻿Excellent. Yes.

215
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,151
﻿Goodbye, Wegner.

216
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,257
﻿Good morning.

217
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,997
﻿And what happens in your life
﻿after five o’clock?

218
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,498
﻿Nothing special.

219
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,200
﻿We could see about that.

220
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,335
﻿I'll think about it.

221
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,337
﻿Who dares wins.

222
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,373
﻿I'll think long and hard about it.

223
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,074
﻿Careful, miss.

224
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,111
﻿That boy is dangerous.

225
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,446
﻿Doesn't have his nickname for nothing.

226
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,781
﻿Which is?

227
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,050
﻿Stick-it-in Fox.

228
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,219
﻿Come on now.

229
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,189
﻿Nice guys.

230
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,892
﻿The two of us.
﻿that would have been something.

231
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,061
﻿Yes. What a pity

232
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,130
﻿Well, then.

233
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,154
﻿Dismount!

234
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,555
﻿Spread out!

235
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,690
﻿On the double.

236
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,592
﻿Move it!

237
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,994
﻿Faster, faster!

238
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,034
- Open the gate.
﻿- Yes, but...

239
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,769
﻿Open the gate!

240
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,674
﻿Stop. No admittance.

241
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,009
﻿Search him.

242
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,111
﻿Search everyone!

243
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
﻿Line up, everyone!

244
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,350
﻿Search those two.

245
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,554
﻿Go on, faster

246
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,823
﻿Everyone at the table, stand up.
﻿On the double!

247
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,125
﻿Move. Form a line here.

248
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:41,894
﻿Search everyone.

249
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,196
﻿Hand over your guns.

250
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,297
﻿What is this?

251
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,799
﻿I'm guessing you're responsible for this?

252
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,636
﻿What makes you think that?

253
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,539
﻿Benda, Berlin police, first division.

254
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,776
﻿Left pocket. My diplomat's ID.

255
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:00,379
﻿Disarm everyone.

256
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,596
﻿That's all of them.

257
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,498
﻿Are these registered?

258
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,168
﻿Very well.

259
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,771
﻿You can collect them tomorrow
﻿at police headquarters,

260
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,539
﻿on presentation of an owner's card.

261
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:31,410
﻿Right, gentlemen.
﻿How kind of you to do our work for us.

262
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,180
﻿Let's see your analyses.
﻿What's in the wagons?

263
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,453
﻿Rath.

264
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,655
﻿- It's me.
﻿- What is it?

265
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,558
﻿I'm at Anhalter freight yard.
﻿You should come here.

266
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,161
﻿I told you I won’t get you out again.

267
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,930
﻿- No, this is different.
﻿- Different how?

268
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,933
﻿I found a trace. The dead Russian.

269
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,401
﻿What?

270
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,137
﻿That's it for now, Mr. Trokhin.

271
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,042
﻿Then we will see if this is still
﻿a Soviet domestic matter.

272
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:07,647
﻿This matter will surely,
﻿how do the Germans say?

273
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,182
﻿create some internal waves.

274
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,050
﻿That will be unavoidable.

275
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:12,652
﻿...no unusual events.

276
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,353
﻿I'll be expecting a detailed report.

277
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:19,926
﻿Mr. Councillor,
﻿the chemists did spot checks.

278
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,094
﻿So far only on three wagons.

279
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,764
﻿Let us go in.

280
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,634
﻿How did you get here?

281
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,271
﻿How did you know about this?

282
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,639
﻿I'll tell you later.

283
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,174
﻿How many wagons are there?

284
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,211
﻿- In total, 13.
- Stop.

285
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,279
﻿- No admittance.
﻿- I'm with the club.

286
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,416
- ﻿Three spot checks are enough for now.
﻿- Still. Restricted area. Sorry.

287
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,751
﻿Rath?

288
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,553
﻿Rath!

289
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,522
﻿Mr. Councillor.

290
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,662
﻿- What are you doing here?
﻿- We followed a trace.

291
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,399
﻿The driver of this train
﻿was probably murdered.

292
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,635
- Pardon?
- ﻿His body was found in the Spree river.

293
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,737
- ﻿In the Landwehrkanal.
- Right.

294
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:06,639
﻿Who is she?

295
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,808
﻿This is Miss Ritter, typist.

296
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,777
﻿Mr. Councillor? Could you come here?

297
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,313
﻿I want to know more. Ride in my car?

298
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,648
﻿Yes, sure.

299
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,318
﻿All samples tested positive for phosphene.

300
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,420
﻿- Do I come along?
- ﻿That's enough for us.

301
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,055
﻿- Cordon everything off.
- No.

302
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,658
﻿Come along.

303
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,661
- ﻿Early evening, at Aschinger?
- Half six.

304
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,696
﻿- I should be able to make that.
- Fine.

305
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,850
﻿Juicy press.

306
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:56,389
﻿What I'm telling you now
﻿is highly confidential.

307
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,326
﻿In those sheds
﻿there are 13 cases of treason,

308
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,895
﻿due to the illegal import
﻿of warfare agents.

309
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:06,565
﻿Contraband from the Soviet Union.
﻿It’s been increasing for years.

310
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,001
﻿What exactly are they smuggling?

311
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,071
﻿At first, it was conventional weapons
﻿in small numbers.

312
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,307
﻿Then it became bigger and bigger.

313
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:19,111
﻿Anti-aircraft guns, tanks, heavy guns.
﻿And now... poison gas.

314
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,947
﻿That's new

315
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,149
﻿Who is the importer of all that?

316
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,319
﻿Have you heard of the Black Reichswehr?

317
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:28,321
﻿Just some rumours.

318
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,756
﻿Secret military.

319
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,959
﻿Irregular combat units.

320
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,797
﻿They are using a network of stooges
﻿for their camouflage transports.

321
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,966
﻿At least two dozens, always different.

322
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,201
﻿But behind them is always
﻿the Black Reichswehr.

323
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,072
﻿But it's hard to prove
﻿if that group doesn't officially exist.

324
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:49,508
﻿Well, the body
﻿of the railway worker does exist.

325
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,811
﻿Maybe that's a clue that will help us.

326
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:55,281
﻿This case could be
﻿of the highest importance for us.

327
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,354
﻿You must stay on it, Rath. I need any clue
﻿that can help me narrow down the suspects.

328
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,791
- ﻿Who ordered this delivery from Russia?
- Alfred Nyssen.

329
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,294
﻿- The steel corporation?
- Yes.

330
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:11,731
﻿One of their puppets, I guess.

331
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:14,934
﻿We'll take a closer look at him next.

332
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,773
﻿The aim of these people is nothing less
﻿than the destruction of our democracy.

333
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,197
﻿So?

334
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,785
﻿Like I said,
﻿the Willi Schulze case has priority.

335
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:09,755
﻿You two go round the neighbours,
﻿Norbert, you go to Rote Katze.

336
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:13,692
﻿Oh, and at the El Dorado,
﻿there's a new gambling team.

337
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,295
﻿We'll plant Johannes there.

338
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,066
﻿Clear as mud? Off you go, vice squaddies.

339
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:24,637
﻿Just in time, my friend.
﻿Are you busy tonight?

340
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,572
﻿We're having a little party.

341
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,975
﻿I want to introduce you to someone.
﻿Guest of honour.

342
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:31,710
﻿We start at seven.

343
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,080
﻿- That's nice, Bruno. But...
- No.

344
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:37,116
﻿You have to mingle a bit.
﻿You'll go mad in here.

345
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:07,980
﻿There you are, finally.

346
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,250
﻿We have a date.

347
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:22,795
﻿Would you?

348
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,066
﻿Thanks. Didn't Wolter tell you
﻿that you can bring me?

349
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,340
﻿Thank you.

350
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:45,551
﻿Well then?

351
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,957
﻿Wormsstrasse, Köpenick.

352
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,498
﻿Where is he?

353
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,968
﻿What now, is someone else coming?

354
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,538
- ﻿I don't know, actually...
﻿- I need the table.

355
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,509
﻿Oh, there he is.

356
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,346
﻿Stefan.

357
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:19,652
﻿Charlotte, what are you doing here,
﻿all alone?

358
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:23,756
﻿I was waiting for you.
﻿We've got something planned. Аre you free?

359
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,291
﻿The two of us?

360
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:26,792
﻿Yes. The bill!

361
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,296
﻿A little excursion, to Köpenick.

362
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,032
﻿Gentlemen, excuse me.

363
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:37,469
﻿Major Scheer asked for absolute darkness
﻿for his demonstration.

364
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,979
﻿Mauser K-97, officially banned.

365
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,551
﻿Comrades, Captain Wolter
﻿and I have the honour

366
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,222
﻿of introducing the prototype of Zieldrei
﻿to you this evening.

367
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,858
﻿Why darkness?

368
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,596
﻿This model is an absolute world's first.

369
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:07,566
﻿By powder alloying the vision lines
﻿with radioactive radium

370
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:11,570
﻿it was possible to develop a functioning
﻿rifle scope for darkness.

371
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,872
﻿For the first time ever...

372
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:17,676
﻿it is also possible to deploy a sniper...

373
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:21,547
﻿in the dark.

374
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,153
﻿From what I understood
﻿at the freight yard,

375
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:32,925
﻿there was poison gas in the train,
﻿I mean in the wagons, not pesticides.

376
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,727
﻿And poison gas is banned.

377
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,063
﻿So Benda confiscated the train.

378
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:41,066
﻿And the railway worker whom
﻿they found dead in the Landwehrkanal...

379
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,568
- ﻿Good evening.
﻿- Evening.

380
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,573
﻿He drove the train to Berlin.
﻿He's part of that organisation.

381
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,810
﻿They call themselves Red Fortress.

382
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,250
﻿PRINTER'S

383
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,588
﻿Funny, it looks deserted.

384
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,957
﻿- How do you know all this?
﻿- I investigated.

385
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:06,425
I see.

386
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:21,273
﻿- Charlotte, what are you doing?
﻿- Why? There’s no-one here.

387
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,109
﻿Look, the putty is not dry.

388
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,115
﻿Are you nuts?

389
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,650
﻿Here's the key.

390
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,486
﻿- We can't just walk in there.
- Yes, we can.

391
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,127
﻿As clean as when it was delivered.

392
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:20,232
﻿- Why do they renovate the place?
- No idea.

393
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,372
- ﻿What would the chief inspector do now?
- Wolter?

394
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:30,142
﻿Lock up the guy who gave him the clue
﻿and then go for dinner.

395
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,580
- ﻿And Rath, what would he do?
- Stay silent.

396
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:38,550
﻿And then do this with his eyebrows.

397
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,819
﻿No, seriously.

398
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:47,926
﻿Charlotte?

399
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:50,229
﻿Pull that lever there.

400
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,013
﻿- A print king.
﻿- You what?

401
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:11,016
﻿That's what they call sheets
﻿that are stuck in the press.

402
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,217
﻿I see.

403
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,253
﻿What does it say?

404
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:17,923
﻿It’s a railway paper. AB-3-2-2-1.

405
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,427
﻿Istanbul.

406
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,462
﻿Istanbul?

407
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,166
﻿What does the Red Fortress
﻿want to do with poison gas in Istanbul?

408
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:35,574
﻿- Nice of you to come.
﻿- Here, potato salad.

409
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:36,775
﻿Great, come in.

410
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:42,080
﻿Gereon, the men are upstairs at Scheers'
﻿The flat above us.

411
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,082
﻿- OK.
- See you later.

412
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:45,784
﻿Thank you.

413
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,893
﻿The railway line from Ypres to Comines.

414
00:29:54,961 --> 00:30:00,466
﻿On May fifth 1918, at 8:45am,

415
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:05,137
﻿the second attack of the 30th infantry
﻿division, led by General Heisen.

416
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,976
﻿Heavy artillery on the other side.

417
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:13,545
﻿The Brits respond with barrage fire.

418
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,749
﻿Hand grenade thrower troops.

419
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:22,221
﻿Only Battle Battalion 31
﻿reaches the group of hills.

420
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:24,823
﻿Colonel Seegers is in command.

421
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:29,027
﻿Our men in the crossfire
﻿between Zwarteleen and Zillebeke.

422
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,629
﻿The enemy ring is blown up.

423
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:35,000
﻿The height is conquered and handed over
﻿to the division's chief commander.

424
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,070
﻿At exactly 7:51pm.

425
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,380
﻿Comrades.

426
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,486
﻿Today we commemorate the many
﻿who were killed in action.

427
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,025
﻿Rahn,

428
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,628
﻿Müller, Zangert,

429
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,664
﻿Wiedemann, Fischer,

430
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,502
﻿Behnke, Michaelis, Kohn.

431
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,772
﻿Killed in action for Germany.

432
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,508
﻿Honour to their memory.

433
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,378
﻿Winkelmann, Hase.

434
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,813
﻿Röhler, Kuhnert,

435
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,483
﻿von Dülmenau, Rosen.

436
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,252
﻿The German army.

437
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,255
﻿Unbeaten in the field.

438
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,293
﻿- Who betrayed us?
﻿- Social democrats.

439
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,970
﻿I once had a comrade

440
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,907
﻿You couldn't find a better one

441
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:54,413
﻿The drum beat to the fight

442
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,017
﻿He was marching my side

443
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:08,026
﻿Keeping up the pace

444
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:13,198
﻿A bullet came a-flying

445
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:17,369
﻿Is it meant for me or you?

446
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:22,341
﻿He is torn away

447
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:27,012
﻿He's lying by my feet

448
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,721
﻿As if he was a piece of me

449
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,229
﻿Retreat!

450
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,002
﻿Retreat!

451
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,089
﻿Gereon!

452
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,159
﻿Gereon...

453
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,362
﻿He’s lying by my feet

454
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:54,599
﻿As if he was a piece of me

455
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:59,071
﻿As if he was a piece of me

456
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:16,588
﻿Right, comrades.

457
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,424
﻿Please come downstairs now.

458
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,894
﻿Emmi and the ladies
﻿have prepared some snacks.

459
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:23,895
﻿Come.

460
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,839
﻿Arndt, you did that really well.

461
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,407
﻿Father taught it to me.

462
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:37,242
﻿Yes, but you recited it

463
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:40,178
﻿With dignity,
﻿and appropriately for the occasion.

464
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:42,681
﻿At ease.

465
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,786
﻿Nyssen AG is one of the biggest steel
﻿producers in the Reich.

466
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,422
﻿We’ll be causing a storm.

467
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:53,358
﻿Alfred Nyssen personally
﻿ordered this shipment.

468
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,461
﻿He must face the law for this.

469
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,363
﻿The evidence is overwhelming.

470
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,299
﻿Those people hate social democracy.
﻿They hate the Jews.

471
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,602
﻿We are both their personal enemies, Karl.

472
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,871
﻿Arresting Alfred Nyssen
﻿gives us the opportunity

473
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,839
﻿to fight for the strength of the republic.

474
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,708
﻿Alright, fine with me.

475
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,580
﻿Ready for the storm?

476
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,184
﻿Yes, this is the chance
﻿we've been waiting for.

477
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,420
﻿I wish you much success.

478
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:25,190
﻿Good night, the president.

479
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,500
- ﻿Miss Overbeck?
﻿- Mr. Councillor?

480
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,643
﻿I don’t have to tell you
﻿that everything you hear in this house

481
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,944
﻿is highly confidential.

482
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,345
﻿No, I know that.

483
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:51,683
﻿This includes the visitors
﻿we have here, right?

484
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:54,553
﻿Yes, sir.
﻿Madam has explained everything to me.

485
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,289
﻿Very well.

486
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:17,943
﻿Sebald? This is Benda. Please arrange
﻿for Alfred Nyssen to be arrested.

487
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,018
- ﻿Very soon.
﻿- I agree.

488
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,056
﻿You are beautiful, Lieschen.
﻿I'm so happy she is going out again.

489
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:32,357
﻿But I am going out.

490
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:35,160
﻿You're a beautiful woman
﻿and much too young to...

491
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:36,361
﻿Emmi, please.

492
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:39,764
﻿And this dress looks great on you.
﻿Don't you agree?

493
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:42,200
- Yes.
- ﻿See? The inspector can see

494
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,702
﻿that it looks great on you.

495
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,439
﻿- I don't get that impression from you.
- That's a pity.

496
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,775
- ﻿We hardly ever see you at home anymore.
- Work...

497
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:55,180
﻿And I thought you were on the run, you're
﻿out the door so fast in the morning.

498
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:59,284
﻿Excuse me. I wanted to introduce you
﻿to someone who knows a Rath in Cologne.

499
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,152
﻿There are quite a few Raths.

500
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,723
﻿One of 22nd infantry, army group west.

501
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:09,194
﻿Oh. Please excuse me, Emmi, Mrs. Behnke.

502
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,270
﻿He's still unattached.
﻿I asked him the other day.

503
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,640
- ﻿Is he really?
- Yes.

504
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,344
- We﻿ can do it like that.
﻿- Major General, Inspector Rath.

505
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,582
- Ou﻿r colleague from Cologne.
- ﻿I'm honoured. Pleased to meet you.

506
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:34,152
﻿Good evening. The captain told me
﻿you knew someone named Rath?

507
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,256
﻿Yes, I came across a Rath in Emerdingen,
﻿when I was forming my cadre.

508
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,825
﻿- Anno Rath?
﻿- Possibly.

509
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,463
﻿A jolly fellow. He could do a standing
﻿jump on to any table, and he did, too.

510
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,266
﻿- That's my brother.
﻿- Charming, funny.

511
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:53,104
﻿When he entered a room, it didn’t take
﻿two minutes for everyone to talk to him

512
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:57,242
﻿or about him. He was admired without envy.

513
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:02,147
﻿And the wenches, as far as there were any,
﻿ran after him in droves.

514
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,883
﻿I know what you're talking about.

515
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:09,120
﻿Where is your brother now?

516
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:12,991
﻿Retreat!

517
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,427
﻿Are you deaf? Retreat!

518
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,162
﻿My brother is still alive.

519
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,750
﻿Gereon?

520
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,620
﻿Gereon!

521
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,792
﻿Gereon!

522
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:42,013
﻿Thank you, Gereon.

523
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,715
﻿Thank you.

524
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,754
﻿Get up!

525
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,823
﻿Come here, there are two more.

526
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,525
﻿Get up!

527
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:56,461
﻿Get up!

528
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,664
﻿Come here, you bastard

529
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:03,835
﻿Come, I said.

530
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:05,937
﻿No! Anno!

531
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:13,378
﻿I was captured.

532
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,514
﻿I was forced to leave Anno behind.

533
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:21,519
- Capt﻿ivity
﻿- For three months.

534
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:24,522
﻿And no trace of your brother?

535
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:30,428
﻿Dozens of tracing requests,
﻿war welfare Red Cross, everywhere.

536
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,266
﻿He is secretly holding the line,

537
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:40,472
﻿which we will return to as soon
﻿as we get back what belongs to us.

538
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,515
﻿Alfred Nyssen?

539
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,416
﻿Come with us.

539
00:41:26,305 --> 00:42:26,592

1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,961
Good riddance,

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,671
you interfering fool.

3
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,762
Huh. The Black Knight
with the White Face, more like.

4
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,727
- Damn it!
- What is the meaning of this?

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,313
I could ask you the same question.

6
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,231
This inquiry is to be conducted by me.

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,276
The man's a knight,
and a knight will decide who killed him.

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,654
That is the Queen's decision, not yours.

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,074
My Grey Riders will be investigating.

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,419
This isn't over.

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,555
Father, I swear...

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
Shut up, you turd-witted buffoon.

13
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,727
It wasn't our fault.

14
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,105
It was Tiuri. He broke the vigil.

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,940
Is this true?

16
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,444
Um... The Black Knight's squire
came to the door.

17
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,612
Tiuri answered it.

18
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,571
He went with him.

19
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,242
- Where is Tiuri?
- We don't know. He never came back.

20
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,168
What's wrong with you?

21
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,921
How many times
are you going to try and kill me?

22
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,342
All right!

23
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,053
Get him!

24
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,263
Wait!

25
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,307
Hyah!

26
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,559
Go! Go!

27
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,616
Slow down! You're going to get us killed.

28
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,998
You're going too fast. I can't hold on!

29
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,082
Slow down!

30
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,163
We've lost him.

31
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,829
- Father.
- Tiuri?

32
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,707
Hey. Hey. What is it?

33
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,461
- What's happened?
- The Red Riders!

34
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,864
They came for the Black Knight.
Now, they're coming for me.

35
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,150
What are you talking about?
Why aren't you at the chapel?

36
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,216
I broke the vigil.

37
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,802
The Black Knight's squire
came to the door last night.

38
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,566
He said he needed help,
so I went with him.

39
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,639
It's not possible.
The Black Knight is in Eviellan.

40
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,723
No, he's here.

41
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,518
The Red Riders killed him.

42
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,857
He gave me this, this letter.

43
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,526
He said I had to take it to King Favian.

44
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,987
He said the fate of both kingdoms
was at stake.

45
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,782
Which way did he go?

46
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,328
You have to hide.

47
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,088
Don't come out, whatever happens.

48
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,719
Show yourself!

49
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,097
I know you're up there.

50
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,852
You dare enter my home uninvited?

51
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,313
In search of a fugitive, yes, I do.

52
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,649
- What fugitive?
- Your son.

53
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,777
He killed the Black Knight.

54
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,072
I couldn't kill the Black Knight,

55
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,782
let alone my son.

56
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,369
You will tell me where he is
and what he's done with the letter.

57
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,245
What letter?

58
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,039
He stole a letter from the Black Knight.

59
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,417
My son
has never stolen anything in his life.

60
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,421
And what concern of yours
is a letter of the Black Knight?

61
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,466
- I'm not here to answer your questions.
- I don't care what you're here for.

62
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,303
And I will not have you drawing me
or my family

63
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,223
into whatever dark games
you and your friends are playing.

64
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,058
You dare accuse me?

65
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,727
Until I know what this letter is,
and who it was from,

66
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,147
and what Viridian's Red Riders
are doing in Dagonaut,

67
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,107
then yes, yes, I do.

68
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,651
You spoke to him.

69
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,194
I knew it!

70
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,156
Where is he? Where's Tiuri?

71
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,741
Leave, Fantumar.

72
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,243
I won't tell you again.

73
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,790
How many times did I tell you?

74
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
You can clothe them in the finest silk,

75
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,795
you can teach them the finest manners,

76
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,590
but you'll never wipe away the stench

77
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,427
of the Eviellan scum
that they will always be.

78
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,949
Take him. Take him!

79
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,343
For as long as I've known you...

80
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,388
you've looked down at me.

81
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,308
Well, now...

82
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,601
it's my turn.

83
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,119
Burn it.

84
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,996
Burn it to the ground.

85
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,761
Father.

86
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,271
You must not get involved in this.

87
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,273
Leave the letter.

88
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,484
Save yourself.

89
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,531
I want you to live, Tiuri.

90
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,496
That's all I've ever wanted.

91
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,026
What do we do?

92
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,203
We could just leave Tiuri
to the Red Riders.

93
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,330
He'll be no match for Jaro's men.
They'll find him.

94
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,831
And then what, you fool?

95
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,000
That jumped-up cutthroat
will waste no time

96
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,252
telling Viridian how I lost the letter

97
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,838
and couldn't recover it
on my own territory.

98
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,091
No, we have to get it back ourselves.

99
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,051
But how, my lord?

100
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,844
Come on.

101
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,063
Perhaps my idiot son
can be of some use after all.

102
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,998
Having a bad day?

103
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,634
It's about to get a lot worse.

104
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,729
Much obliged.

105
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,362
I'm afraid that makes this...

106
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
goodbye.

107
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,617
Do you wanna shut your eyes?

108
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,453
Better if you shut your eyes.

109
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,715
It's gonna be horse steaks for dinner.

110
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

111
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,943
Get after them!

112
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,196
Ardanwen!

113
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,698
Bloody horse!

114
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,953
You're definitely crazy.

115
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,582
But I'm actually starting to like you.

116
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,963
You want us to find Tiuri?

117
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,847
And bring him back to Dagonaut.

118
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,218
Dead... or alive.

119
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,846
He doesn't mean that literally.

120
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,848
Although...

121
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,641
<i>dead...</i>

122
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,228
would be preferable.

123
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,523
This... This doesn't seem right.

124
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,067
What do you owe that Eviellan brat?

125
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,361
He betrayed all of you!

126
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,530
What's in it for us?

127
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,199
Bring that murdering fugitive back
to face justice,

128
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,618
and I guarantee...

129
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,580
you will receive the knighthoods...

130
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,666
that you've been denied.

131
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,584
You... You can make that happen?

132
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,629
Why should we believe you?

133
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,712
Look at me.

134
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,133
Do know how many wars I've fought?

135
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,846
Do you know
how many tournaments I've won?

136
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,598
Um...

137
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,394
Eh... None.

138
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,607
And yet I stand before you the richest,
most powerful knight in the kingdom.

139
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,733
You know why?

140
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,778
Politics.

141
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,697
That's my weapon.

142
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,823
I provoke.

143
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,533
I tease.

144
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,909
I trap.

145
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,745
And you lie too, don't you, father?

146
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,915
He's amazing at lying.
Mother and I can never...

147
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,792
The point is...

148
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,626
in the end...

149
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,462
I always get what I want.

150
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,133
You will too...

151
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,802
if you bring me...

152
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,387
Tiuri.

153
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,546
How is that possible?

154
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,538
Hyah!

155
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,248
Keep going!

156
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,251
He's out here somewhere!

157
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,764
They've passed.

158
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,141
Where are you going?

159
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,111
No.

160
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,541
That's the wrong way.

161
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,074
Unauwen is this way.

162
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,669
I hate this bloody horse.

163
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151

164
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,620
♪ <i>Outrode the villain Tiuri ♪</i>

165

166
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,665

171
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,429
That's it.

<i>♪ The one they called Jussipo

173
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,100
Arman!

174
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,063
That's a nine-crown lute.

175
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,355
I told you to shut up.

176
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,439
So what?

177
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,860
So my father sent us on this quest,
and that means I'm in charge.

178
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,612
No, it doesn't.

179
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,988
Who asked you, toad-snot?

180
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,991
Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Help me!

181
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,829
If that oaf's put
so much as one dent in it,

182
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,331
he's paying for a new one.

183
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,502
Funny enough...
Of course, it couldn't...

184
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,504
It couldn't matter less,
least of all to me,

185
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,381
but I actually believe
in purely technical terms...

186
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,717
Do you ever actually finish a sentence?

187
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,094
Right. Um...

188
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,057
- My point being...
- Don't worry. It's fine. Panic's over.

189
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,937
Actually...

190
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,730
sounds a little better.

191
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,857
<i>♪ Sounds a little better ♪</i>

192
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,984
Stop singing, Jussipo.

193
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,528
How are we gonna catch Tiuri

194
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,655
if he can hear us coming
from half a mile away?

195
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,738
We're working here.

196
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,535
Can't take any more of this pig swill.

197
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,828
Fine.

198
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,248
It's your loss, Iona!

199
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,087
Mistrinaut...

200
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,215
sitting between two great nations,

201
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,009
divided by a vast mountain range,

202
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,345
and just one trading route between them,

203
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,140
a route to which our town
is the very gateway...

204
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,645
- Father?
- Your speech isn't worth much, snowdrop,

205
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:10,023
but we might be able to flog this painting
for a few bob.

206
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,009
How can you have so little vision?

207
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,904
For 500 years,
that road through the mountains

208
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,573
filled this town with gold,

209
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,199
and it can do so again.

210
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,577
That road has been lost for generations.

211
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,412
No, I can find it.

212
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,790
Look. Look at these maps.

213
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,060
There's a whole valley
that's not even been chartered yet.

214
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,086
- According to this...
- For the last time,

215
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,131
there is no road through the mountains.

216
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,466
And the wedding is still on.

217
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,638
- Verily, madam, your beauty is...
- Oh, sit down!

218
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,640
Right, yes.

219
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,979
Look, all I need is a horse big enough
to make the journey

220
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,731
and supplies for a month.

221
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,566
A modest investment.

222
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,069
Lavinia, you are the cream in my milk.

223
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,279
You always have been.

224
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,781
And I love the fact that you have dreams,

225
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,742
but dreams don't pay bills.

226
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,912
Look at that.
That is all that we have left:

227
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,540
a meager trade in wanted men,
bail, and reward money.

228
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,793
Right now,
that trade has never been thinner.

229
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,257
I mean, the last decent murderer
we had in here was two months ago.

230
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,175
We're broke.

231
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,928
And that is why you're getting married.

232
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,058
We have to restore the trade route.
Otherwise, Mistrinaut is doomed.

233
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,351
See you at the church.

234
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm doomed.

235
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,107
Ugh.

236
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:57,047
It's not a complicated point I'm making.
What I'm saying is the richest knights,

237
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,300
the most famous knights
aren't necessarily the best knights. Huh?

238
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,720
They're just the knights that work hardest
at getting their stories out.

239
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,765
That's all I'm doing... with this song.

240
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,769
I'm not waiting 100 years
for some toothless bard to immortalize me.

241
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,586
Is it him?

242
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,670
Shh!

243
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,782
- What?
- Whoa!

244
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,576
You really scared the bejesus out of me.

245
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,244
Almost poo'd me britches.

246
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,621
What are you doing here?

247
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,707
What do you think I'm doing here?
No way I'm missing out on this.

248
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,460
Your brother followed us from Dagonaut?

249
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,088
Made it in two days.
You boys left a trail a mile wide.

250
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,799
But, man, you are good. Like real knights.

251
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,511
That dagger throw, Foldo!
What was that, like 40 yards?

252
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,890
And, Arman, great crossbow work, big guy.
You almost took me ear off.

253
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,769
And, Iona... God's bones!
You are quick. I'm mean wolf-quick.

254
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,492
Every move I made,
you were totally on me.

255
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,106
Why are you still talking?

256
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,316
Why is any sound coming out
of your mouth at all?

257
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,943
I was kind of good on the crossbow...

258
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,026
Oh, shut up.

259
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,571
You're in so much trouble.

260
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,508
- What are you doing?
- Putting you on your horse.

261
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,842
- You're going home.
- No, wait.

262
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,076
No...

263
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,285
I'm not discussing this.

264
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,429
- Really?
- Really what?

265
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,789
Sending him back
through those woods, alone?

266
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,666
He's just a ten-year-old boy.

267
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,625
I'm almost 11.

268
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,169
Is this a quest we're on
or Madam Twanky's Sunday School?

269
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,533
Anything could happen out there.

270
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,422
Good.

271
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,050
Foldo's got a point, though.
What if I go and die? Mum would kill you.

272
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,803
Be better if he died.
You'd just slow us down.

273
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,265
I'm faster than Jussipo. I beat him
every time we race around the abbey.

274
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,348
You do not.

275
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,559
And I sing better too.

276
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,186
Mother says his voice
sounds like a cat in a bag.

277
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,729
Go, Piak.

278
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,064
Please, please, Jussipo!

279
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,609
I'll make this work. Think about it.
Real knights have squires, right?

280
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,404
To clean their armor,
to carry their weapons,

281
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,489
to water their horses. I can do that.

282
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,452
Please, don't make me go home.
Please! Please! Please! Please!

283
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,043
Yes.

284
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,467
Stop doing that.

285
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,217
Sorry.

286
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,413
Clip-clop.

287
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,794
Try not to kill anyone while I'm inside.

288
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,869
Good morning.

289
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,667
I was wondering
whether you served food at all.

290
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,800
You're a big fella, aren't you?

291
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,177
You'd get me over the mountains.

292
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,293
That your horse outside?

293
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,211
Uh...

294
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,716
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

295
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,427
In a manner of speaking?

296
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,762
Where did you grow up?
The courtly romance?

297
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,098
You're too young to be a knight.

298
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,224
Much too small.

299
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,308
No offense.

300
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,686
So, what?

301
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,769
A Novice?

302
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,940
Novices don't ride horses like that.

303
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,651
I think perhaps I should be going.

304
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,279
Yet this cloth's expensive.

305
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,157
And that's silk braid.

306
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,285
So you're from money.
Am I right, or am I right?

307
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,488
Thank you for your help,
but I really should be going.

308
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,707
Good luck out there.
You're certainly going to need it.

309
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,670
There are more cutthroats and murderers
in that street than broken cobbles.

310
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,154
I'll bet good money you won't make it
past the first doorway,

311
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,294
let alone to the town gate.

312
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,010
Is there another way out of town?

313
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,722
Now that I think about it, there is.

314
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,350
Wait here.

315
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,060
And don't speak to anyone.

316
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,145
I'll check it's clear
and then come back for you.

317
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,697
- Verily, madam, your beauty is...
- Sit down.

318
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,825
Uh, why aren't you dressed?

319
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,870
We have to be at the chapel by matins,
or we'll miss the bloody priest.

320
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,830
Oh, forget the chapel. The wedding's off.

321
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,376
The wedding's what?

322
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,835
Let me handle this.

323
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,172
The wedding is not off,
and we are not having this argument again.

324
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,676
The Eviellan boy who murdered
the Black Knight with the White Shield

325
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,220
is downstairs right now,

326
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,514
and there's a 50 crown bounty on his head.

327
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,684
Wedding's off!

328
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,111
How could you do this?

329
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,194
Grow up, boy.

330
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,245
People like you may not need
to make a living,

331
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,682
but people like us have no choice.

332
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,575
Everyone has a choice.

333
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,203
Says the rich fool riding around
with his thumb up his backside

334
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,080
expecting the world to do him a favor.

335
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,458
Isn't she a sweetheart?

336
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,419
Now...

337
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:38,466
come here, you gorgeous,
Eviellan murderer, you.

338
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,684
So who posted the reward?

339
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,602
Squire named Balin.

340
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,355
But the money is from a Sir Fantumar.

341
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,314
Never heard of him.

342
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,358
But if he's already offering 50,

343
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,152
he's worth a lot more.

344
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,778
You can't send me back there.

345
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,948
Relax, young fella.
I'm not sending you anywhere.

346
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,456
I'm just selling you to someone who will.

347
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,835
See, this Sir Fartalot puts a price
on your head,

348
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,295
but you're probably worth more.

349
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:19,758
So we shop you...
around the local bounty hunters,

350
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,468
see if one of them wants to buy you.

351
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,094
Then we pocket the cash.

352
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,512
They add a markup

353
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,266
and do their own deal with Farty-pants.

354
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,811
I'll get word to Godwin and Hasley.

355
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,400
What exactly is this?

356
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,069
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

357
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,239
Oh, really?

358
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,575
Ow!

359
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,586
You don't put something in one of these

360
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,297
unless it's really valuable.

361
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,936
After all these years,

362
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,688
tomorrow we cross that river...

363
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,733
and we're on home soil at last.

364
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,654
Unauwen will welcome you, Prince Viridian.

365
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,908
The letters?

366
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,786
Five have been delivered.

367
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,081
We're waiting word on the sixth.

368
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,708
The scout...

369
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,920
the one they call Jabroot...

370
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,462
send him to me.

371
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,040
Going somewhere, snowdrop?

372
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,252
What's it to you?

373
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,338
We're not having this conversation again,
are we?

374
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,010
What happened to your hand?

375
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,346
Uh, yeah. Have a look at this.

376
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,433
Belongs to our Eviellan guest.

377
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,102
Such a bladed box suggests to me

378
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,355
that someone has gone to great lengths
to secure its contents.

379
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,816
Now, you are the best lock picker I know.

380
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,776
Can you open it?

381
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,529
Don't know. Maybe.

382
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,698
Leave it with me.

383
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,452
Why don't I think
that's gonna happen, hmm?

384
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,955
We'll work on it together, later.

385
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,334
I mean, you're not going anywhere,
remember?

386
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,470
Okay.

387
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,810
Don't worry about the boy.
Your future's brighter with me.

388
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,981
Ah!

389
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,069
Piece of cake.

390
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,668
Proceed.

391
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,762
Well, Jabroot?

392
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,348
Seventeen Shaman, my lord.

393
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,809
And their families.

394
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,231
Terrible price to pay.

395
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,360
But one that had to be paid
to finish this war.

396
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,492
Speak.

397
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,870
The numbers don't tally.

398
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,207
We checked the graves. Two were missing.

399
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,044
Who?

400
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,045
We don't know yet.

401
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,343
One of them might be a Shaman.

402
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,471
Again, my lor...

403
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,186
The journey...

404
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,897
has begun, Jabroot.

405
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,946
The prophecy is in motion.

406
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,116
So if there's another Shaman...

407
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,287
or a child with Shaman's blood
running through its veins...

408
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,793
I must know.

409
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,273
Red Riders.

410
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,724
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in here!

411
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Ristridin.

412
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,064
It's you.

413
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,398
What have you done, boy?

414
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,482
Nothing.

415
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,070
If this is you doing nothing,
I dread to think of you doing something.

416
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,239
- Is there news of my mother?
- Your mother is fine.

417
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,075
It's the people your mother runs into
I'm worried about. Come on.

418
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,619
- I'm taking you home.
- No.

419
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,578
Tiuri?

420
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,998
We have to get the Black Night's letter
to King Favian. Except I don't have it.

421
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,543
Right now, the Mayor has it.
We'll get it back from the Mayor

422
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,586
and head to Unauwen
before the Red Riders get it.

423
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,923
You're babbling, boy. The Red Riders
are with Prince Viridian in Eviellan.

424
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,259
No, it was the Red Riders
who killed the Black Knight.

425
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,886
Now they're chasing me.
They want his letter.

426
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,639
This makes no sense.

427
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,143
Does the idea of me killing
the greatest knight in Unauwen make sense?

428
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,021
I scarcely made it through the trials.
You of all people know that.

429
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,192
If what you say is true, it'll come out
when the Queen questions you.

430
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,276
Now, let's go!

431
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,279
Ristridin, please.

432
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,281
There's no time for this.

433
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,127
Hi...

434
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,629
Morning, barkeep.

435
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,842
We're, uh, looking for a boy,
about yea high,

436
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,761
dark hair, shifty features,
riding a stolen horse.

437
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,638
Seen him in here?

438
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,184
Hmm. I'll, uh...

439
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,187
make it worth your while.

440
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,357
Four jars of mead, please.

441
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,277
Oh, I'm not allowed to drink mead.
Mother said...

442
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,195
I'll have his.

443
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,906
My apologies for the idiots.
Mead all around.

444
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,783
You want stew?

445
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,166
- Uh, maybe we'll pass on the stew.
- Yes on the stew.

446
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,418
Uh, five, please.

447
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,423
Will you lot shut up
and let me handle this?

448
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,549
You'll get us all killed.

449
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,393
Only thing that'll kill us here
is that stew.

450
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,013
Uh... Oh!

451
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm most terribly sorry.

452
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,354
And here it comes.

453
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,111
God's nails!

454
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,407
Watch your backs, all of you!

455
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,839
Hyah!

456
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,425
Hup! Hyah!

457
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,094
Do something.

458
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,724
Oh!

459
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,458
Um, guys?

460
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,880
Now what?

461
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,341
Well, the boy was an appealing cake,

462
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,260
I admit, but, uh...

463
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,595
We still have the cherry on top.

464
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,328
Thank me later.

465
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,332
Tiuri? Tiuri!

466
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,168
Cut them off!

467
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,759
Hey!

468
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,802
Hey!

469
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,402
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing here.

470
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,781
The only reason you came back for me
is 'cause you need me to ride my horse.

471
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,745
And you need me
to get yourself out of here.

472
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,871
So that makes us even.

473
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,506
Now she's the one person
you could have killed.

474
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,426
What's all that?

475
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,929
- My bags.
- Are you joking?

476
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,473
Does it look like I'm joking?
Help me. We have to go.

477
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,641
No one's going anywhere

478
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,559
until I get that letter back
from your father.

479
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,233
- You stole it from him?
- Obviously.

480
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,901
What kind of a family is this?

481
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,904
First, we find my road.

482
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,448
I'm going to Unauwen.

483
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,909
And that letter is coming with me.

484
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,412
When we find it,
you can take it to Unauwen...

485
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,914
which is to the west. It'll be faster.

486
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,000
Give it to me.

487
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,215
Fine.

488
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,342
I carry the letter. You ride the horse.

489
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,844
You two, check the barn!

490
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,389
Let's go!

491
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,653
We'll lose them in the alleys.

492
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,746
Can we just agree...

493
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,040
never to come back
to this place ever again?

494
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,085
Go right! Go right!

495
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,379
- Was that...?
- Tiuri?

496
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,756
- Out of the way!
- Whoa!

497
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,721
Let's go!

498
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:22,897
That way.

499
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,023
Go!

500
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,198
There they are.

501
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,117
Told you I'd get us out of here.

502
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,260
Have we lost them?

503
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,221
I think so.

504
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,817
What are those?

505
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,737
Red Riders.

506
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,994
Swim, little fishy, swim.

507
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,633
- We'll never outrun them.
- We don't have to.

508
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,719
If we make it to that cut in the hills,
we can lose them in the ravine.

509
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,648
The Red Riders.

510
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,150
They are here.

511
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,903
The boy might be telling the truth.
We have to help him.

512
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,405
Twos, right wheel!

513
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,829
Draw swords!

514
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,803
Hyah!

515
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,604
Go. I believe you, Tiuri.
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

516
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,038
What are you waiting for?
Take the letter and go!

517
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,087
Ristridin.

518
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,385
Tiuri.

519
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,973
You have...

520
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,142
to help...

521
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,726
him.

522
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,386
- This can't be happening.
- They killed the Grey Riders.

523
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,282
- What about Tiuri?
- What about Tiuri?

524
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,784
Ristridin said we should help him.

525
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,368
He was dying. He probably
didn't know what he was saying.

526
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,812
But he charged the Red Riders.

527
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,655
- So what?
- He saved Tiuri's life.

528
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,564
So what?

529
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,441
So why would he do that for a traitor?

530
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,252
- Who asked you?
- Don't shout at my brother.

531
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,956
- You shout at your brother all the time!
- Because he's my brother!

532
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,574
It doesn't matter what Ristridin said
or what he did.

533
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,369
Right now, help him or kill him,
we have to find him first.

534
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,291
Maybe...

535
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,962
we should have a conversation about that.

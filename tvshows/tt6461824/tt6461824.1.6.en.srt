1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,070
I can handle chaos.

2
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:04,046
Your time in Oakland
would suggest otherwise.

3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:05,796
<i>Previously on "The Crossing"...</i>

4
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:07,968
Here's a quick primer...
all these people here

5
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,007
are from the future.

6
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,652
I think it's happened before.

7
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,343
There was an earlier migration.

8
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,719
I didn't have a choice.
She knew who I was.

9
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:21,317
She knew where we were from.

10
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,652
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

11
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:25,121
Then maybe you can be of use to us.

12
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,290
Why exactly are they keeping you
up at the camp?

13
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,324
It's complicated.

14
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:30,393
Your daughter...
She has Mantle's Disease.

15
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:31,794
Let me help you create the treatment,

16
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,329
and then I can take it back to Leah.

17
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:37,233
Your mom needs you to fight.

18
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,302
<i>Martin. Look, I know it's been a while,</i>

19
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:40,803
but I need some legal advice.

20
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:43,139
Didn't you learn anything
from the Doucette case?

21
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:44,574
<i>Put your family first this time.</i>

22
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,578
_

23
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,616
Bosco Monroe.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,918
Wanted on two counts
of possession with intent.

25
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:58,680
We supposed to know this guy?
I've never seen him before.

26
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:00,656
That's 'cause he just blew in from L.A.

27
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,825
Got a C.I. says he's crashing here.

28
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,694
You and Cory take the front.
We'll take the back.

29
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,579
Let's go.

30
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:10,499
How much you want to bet
Sarge gets a kickback

31
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,291
on this bust from a rival dealer?

32
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,870
You're kidding, right?

33
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:17,173
Yeah, yeah, breaking balls.

34
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,507
- Don't do scissors.
- Don't do rock.

35
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,344
You always do scissors. That's so cute.

36
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,512
You're up.

37
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,561
- Oakland PD!
- Is that a hollow-core door?

38
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,930
This neighborhood's not known
for its quality materials.

39
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,334
Hey, Cory, I don't know about...

40
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:59,315
Central, this is 184 Alpha!

41
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,683
I need a bus!

42
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:01,851
9-85!

43
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:03,519
Repeat... 9-85!

44
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,920
82nd and MacArthur!

45
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:07,048
I need a bus now!

46
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,559
Hey, Cory, Cory, Cory,
stay with me, bud.

47
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:13,594
Hey, bud, come on.

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,897
Hang in there.

49
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,197
<i>- Jude...
- Just stay with me, buddy.</i>

50
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,033
<i>Jude...</i>

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,102
<i>Jude?</i>

52
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,271
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

53
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:25,174
Any idea how long this trip
of yours is gonna take?

54
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,677
Depends on what I find out.

55
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,845
A-And you really think
that this guy can help, huh?

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,614
I mean, it's...
not exactly like the Feds

57
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:33,516
have been our friends lately.

58
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,885
Look, Emma said that she thought
that there were people

59
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,521
at a high level covering up
this early migration.

60
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:41,016
If that's true,
then we need highlevel access,

61
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,692
and Martin's got it.

62
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,361
And you really trust this guy, huh?

63
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:45,394
<i>Yeah.</i>

64
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,697
I mean, he's the only one I trusted...

65
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,632
the last time.

66
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>How'd that work out?</i>

67
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:56,451
Uh, look, I-I'll check in later.

68

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,819
So, you're saying
that Leah is completely healed.

70
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,651
It looks that way.

71
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,464
Her fever's gone, her vitals are strong,

72
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:23,999
and she's eating again.

73
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,935
Well, if she's not contagious, I mean,

74
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:28,070
- she can come back here with us.
- Not just yet.

75
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,139
I've arranged to have her
taken to a hospital in Portland

76
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:31,741
for a full work-up,
and after she's cleared,

77
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,442
then she can come back.

78
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,745
How did you do it?

79
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,114
Her body's created
a very strong immune response.

80
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,735
It wasn't me, it was her. She beat it.

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,051
No one beats Mantle's.

82
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,188
She's here, isn't she.

83
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,257
Who?

84
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,092
Leah's mother.

85
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,129
- You said she treated her before.
- I'm sorry.

86
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:56,132
I really can't discuss the
particulars of her treatment.

87
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,602
The important thing, Rebecca,
is that she's going to be okay.

88
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:05,978
Whatever you think you know,
whatever you saw...

89
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,931
you can't trust them.

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,741
Apex.

91
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,698
I need to talk to Agent Ren right now.

92
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,259
She's not here. You can talk to me.

93
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,569
We were led to believe that we'd
be getting out of here soon.

94
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,238
- You are.
- Then why is there a fence going up?

95
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,042
Is it to keep people
from coming in or going out?

96
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,508
It's for your protection.

97
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,176
Caleb, there's nothing to worry about.

98
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:16,679
A secure perimeter
is standard procedure.

99
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,280
Are we gonna have a problem?

100
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,852
No.

101
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,820
No problem.

102
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,393
<i>How much you want to bet

<i>on this bust from a rival dealer?</i>

104
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,732
Cory found out about Doucette's
little trafficking ring,

105
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:40,506
so Doucette set up
a fake bust to get rid of Cory.

106
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:44,033
Shane Doucette is a decorated veteran.

107
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,110
Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,492
Commendations
from the Neighborhood Watch

109
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,211
to the State Assembly.

110
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,914
- He's also your commanding officer.
- Yeah, good for him.

111
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:53,916
It doesn't change the fact
that it was a setup.

112
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,452
Look, Doucette wanted
to keep Cory quiet.

113
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,113
He issued a bogus warrant,

114
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,155
hired a disposable junkie to do the hit,

115
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,523
and then he pumped eight rounds
into him at the scene

116
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:03,673
to close the loop.

117
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,227
There's strong indications
that Doucette's unit's

118
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,988
running something out of Eastmont.

119
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,898
Jude found evidence
Cory was compiling against him

120
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,566
before his murder... forged reports,

121
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,167
transfer receipts, and surveillance

122
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,569
of more than one shakedown.

123
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:14,670
Why would they be that sloppy?

124
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,439
Because they've been getting
away with it for so long.

125
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:20,509
It's... It's a good case, sir.

126
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:23,379
We just need someone like Jude
to step forward.

127
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,584
I'm not in the business
of dissuading officers

128
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:31,253
from testifying, but I need you to know,

129
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:34,448
if we move on this,
word will eventually get out,

130
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:37,870
and it'll pull most of the force
down on you.

131
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:40,886
Sergeant Doucette in particular.

132
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,371
Look...

133
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,152
my partner was murdered,

134
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,871
a murder arranged by another cop.

135
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,675
If anybody's got a problem with
me seeking justice for Cory,

136
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,310
they can go to hell.

137
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,485
- You're switching seats on me, man.
- Martin.

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
No, same table, man.

139
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,825
Jude, Jude, Jude...

140
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,194
Thank you.

141
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,783
Do you know why the universe is kind

142
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,609
and there's hope for us all?

143
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,566
Tell me.

144
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,831
They still have country-fried steak

145
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,675
with biscuits and gravy on this menu.

146
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,968
That's why.

147
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:25,025
You look good, Jude.

148
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,076
- Small-town life.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,713
Kicking pain pills
probably didn't hurt, either.

150
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:32,314
So, over the phone,
you said you're still dealing

151
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,984
with the fallout
from that shipwreck up there?

152
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,910
Yeah.

153
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,886
Yeah, I've been working with a DHS agent

154
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,156
by the name of Emma Ren.

155
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,849
She's gone missing.

156
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,929
And I think her superior
had something to do with it.

157
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,164
- Her superior?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,001
Guy by the name of Lindauer.

159
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,949
The Deputy Under Secretary?

160
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,771
DHS is holding a group of people

161
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,774
against their will
in a camp outside my town.

162
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,209
Emma didn't like it.

163
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,578
Lindauer wanted her gone.

164
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,114
First of all, I'm with
the U.S. Attorney's Office now.

165
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,915
Exactly. You can help me build a case.

166
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,550
I'm telling you this as a friend...

167
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,186
don't jump into a volcano again.

168
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,123
Martin, there's a federal agent missing

169
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:16,225
and a group of Americans being detained

170
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,293
against their will
by the U.S. government,

171
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:20,829
a government that you and I
both represent.

172
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:27,172
I've got a major trial
about to kick off.

173
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,906
All I can do is send up
a couple of flares,

174
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,775
see if anyone's heard anything,

175
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,277
see if we can start
putting something together.

176
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,691
I'll take it.

177
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,114
Right now, I'm trying
to determine if you are

178
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,973
the bravest man I know or the stupidest.

179
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:45,054
I ask myself that all the time.

The Stones.

190
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,594
<i>Right.</i>

191
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,629
You're really good.

192
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,098
Do you play any other instruments?

193
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:32,367
A little piano. My mom taught me.

194
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:35,771
She always wanted
there to be music in the house.

195
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,372
Can you teach me?

196
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,008
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

197
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,491
If I ever get to see you again.

198
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,114
<i>So, um, how do we make that happen?</i>

199
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,285
Hey.

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,054
I need to talk to him.

201
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,091
Marshall.

202
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:59,294
Is there anything
in your media about us?

203
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,463
<i>No.</i>

204
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,725
What about people in town? Do they know?

205
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,134
Most people think you guys came off

206
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,301
a Russian research vessel

207
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,003
<i>that shipwrecked off the coast.</i>

208
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,405
Caleb, did something happen up there?

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,674
Yeah, there's a lot more security.

210
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,401
Fences, guards.

211
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,480
<i>- Let me talk to him!
- Hey, hey, hey!</i>

212
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,815
Caleb. Gabe here.

213
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,049
- It's a cover-up.
- Gabe?

214
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,885
No, he's good. He's a friend.

215
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,685
<i>No question.</i>

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,088
We can help, but we need evidence.

217
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,556
What kind of evidence?

218
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,092
Photos. We have to expose
this to the public.

219
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,027
<i>Send us something, anything.</i>

220
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,137
He's right. You can use the phone.

221
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,207
Give me about an hour.

222
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:43,172
I'll be back.

223
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,506
South perimeter's got weak spots.

224
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,347
Man, people are gonna freak.

225
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,367
Gut-check time.

226
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,770
We're about to bitch-slap
Homeland Security,

227
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,205
and they ain't gonna like it.

228
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,240
So?

229
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,641
So, if we do this, we're in it.

230
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,725
Deep. Is she worth it?

231
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,710
That's impossible.

232
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,122
Did anyone follow you?

233
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,427
No.

234
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,091
You said you had photos.

235
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,260
Yes.

236
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,666
She looks good.

237
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,735
Can you move her?

238
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,138
I'm sending her up to
Portland General this afternoon.

239
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,006
- 3:00.
- Any guards?

240
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Just me.

241
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:42,191
And if I should happen
to go outside for a walk

242
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,450
and find her gone when I get back...

243
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,447
I should hope she was in good hands.

244
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,073
Helping me puts you in danger.

245
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,286
Why are you doing this?

246
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,155
Maybe I wish my mom
fought as hard for me

247
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,323
as you've fought for Leah.

248
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,463
Have you ever healed anyone else
with your stem cells?

249
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,148
Just Leah.

250
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,968
Portland General.

251
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,562
Call me when you get there.

252
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,559
_

253
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,405
We have reason to believe
that a camera phone

254
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,006
has made its way onto the premises.

255
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,375
Now, as you all know,
communication devices

256
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,744
are not permitted inside the camp.

257
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,863
These are Homeland Security regulations

258
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,816
that my team and I
are required to enforce.

259
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,552
So if anyone knows anything,
if you've seen

260
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,188
an unauthorized person with a phone

261
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,490
or have the phone in your possession,

262
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:06,360
please come to us, no questions asked.

263
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,744
Something going on?

264
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:26,325
We're conducting a search.

265
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,617
Oh. So this isn't a social visit.

266
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,252
I'm afraid not.

267
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,721
I have to search the cabin.

268
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:42,696
What are you looking for?

269
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,583
Contraband. A phone.

270
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,606
Oh.

271
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,804
What happens if you're caught with one?

272
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,274
Do you lock us up?

273
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:55,776
Like we're criminals?

274
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,745
I don't make the rules, Hannah.

275
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,713
Right.

276
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,474
So what now, pat down?

277
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,183
A strip search?
Should I take my clothes off?

278
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,324
Don't do that.

279
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,960
Don't act like you haven't
been keeping things from me.

280
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,601
Sorry.

281
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,417
Hello, Kurt.

282
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,754
What are you doing here?

283
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,623
I need your help.

284
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:44,758
I tried to help you before,
and you vanished.

285
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,192
Where'd you go?

286
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,155
What have you been doing since
we pulled you out of the water?

287
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,997
It's better that you don't know.

288
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,967
I need documents, passports.

289
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,972
And what makes you think
I can help you with that?

290
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,465
_

291
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,778
That's in the past.

292
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,219
_

293
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,119
I do know one guy.

294
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,722
But you're gonna need money,
a lot of it.

295
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,590
That won't be a problem.

296
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,180
Hey, hi.

297
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:27,901
Hi.

298
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,453
Come on in.

299
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,648
Thank you.

300
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,145
Wait. You redecorated.

301
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,815
Yeah. Little bit.
Just ready for a new look.

302
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,129
Ah. Help sell the place, too.

303
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,744
Mm-hmm.

304
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,238
Ollie, your dad's here!

305
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,757
When were you thinking
on doing that, the move?

306
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,592
You know, the plan was
that you and Oliver

307
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:54,762
- would be in Portland already.
- I know, Jude.

308
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,364
Just, uh, wondering.

309
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,833
So, um, what's this case you're on?

310
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,402
Uh...

311
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,770
Missing persons.

312
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,630
Connected to a couple other things.

313
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,489
Well, I'd tell you to be careful.

314
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:12,540
But I've told you that before
and you didn't listen, so...

315
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,149
I should've.

316
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:19,086
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

317
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,687
Hey.

318
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,743
So, uh... is, uh... Oliver in bed?

319
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,895
Mm-hmm. About an hour ago.

320
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:30,030
- An hour ago?
- Yep.

321
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:31,732
Really?

322
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,070
Don't move.

323
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,119
- Jude...
- Hmm?

324
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,215
How did it go today?

325
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:50,308
It's a go.

326
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,053
The investigation?

327
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,256
Yeah, I go in tomorrow
to give my statement.

328
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,125
Okay.

329
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,562
Do other cops
know that you're testifying?

330
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,931
Like our friends?

331
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,432
Well, I hope not.

332
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,284
There's a chance?

333
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,003
Yeah, there's always a chance.

334
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,640
Okay. And then, would we be safe?

335
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,943
Of course.

336
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:18,846
Look, I love that you're an optimist,

337
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,915
but can you please just tell me
what we might be looking at?

338
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,350
As a family?

339
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:26,214
We'll be looking
at doing the right thing.

340
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:32,562
Cory was killed right in front of me.

341
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:36,570
Another like 6 inches,

342
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,109
and then it would've been me.

343
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,258
Doctor said one every 12 hours.

344
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,104
How many is that today?

345
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,706
Um...

346
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,941
I got shot.

347
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:50,010
And it hurts.

348
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,391
- Dad!
- Oh, dude!

349
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,786
- How you doing?
- Good.

350
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,171
- You ready?
- Yeah.

351
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:02,423
- Let's do it.
- Bye, Mom.

352
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,857
Okay. Have fun.

353
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,726
All right, here's what I was thinking...

354
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:16,367
_

355
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,140
_

356
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,921
_

357
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:25,784
_

358
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:28,916
Where you from?

359
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,251
Does it matter?

360
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,830
She doesn't look right to me, Kurt.

361
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:35,963
I have money.

362
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,858
Where'd you get it?

363
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:39,092
The bank.

364
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,363
Bank. That's good.

365
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:47,691
And you wouldn't happen
to be a cop, right?

366
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,070
I don't have time for this.

367
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,964
What's the...

368
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,947
Open it.

369
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,135
Where did you get that?

370
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,308
I told you.

371
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,779
What in the world?

372
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,529
That can't be good.

373
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,954
So, did you hear anything from Marshall?

374
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:33,407
No.

375
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,410
The way the guards talk,
the Internet seems to be

376
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:40,541
people's sole preoccupation,
so it should spread fast.

377
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,495
What?

378
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:48,426
Well, maybe a fence
isn't such a bad thing

379
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,560
if it can protect us from Apex.

380
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,896
I mean, what if she comes for her?

381
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,606
You okay?

382
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,509
Yeah.

383
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,444
All right.

384
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,460
Do you know how many goals
Ronaldo scored

385
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,189
in Champions League?

386
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:30,010
- Uh, 36,000?
- No.

387
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,490
Hey, shoes off.

388
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,366
94.

389
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,969
That's 11 goals ahead of Messi.

390
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,982
Yeah, well, Messi's played less games.

391
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,475
He'll catch him. Hey.

392
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,101
Go wash up.

393
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:52,891
So, uh... Oliver said that you
signed him up for soccer.

394
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,258
That seems like
an odd thing to do to him

395
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:57,430
if you're gonna be moving soon.

396
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,141
Unless you're not moving soon.

397
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,532
I met someone.

398
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm not trying to keep you
from your son, Jude.

399
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,178
This is the first time in three years...

400
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,113
that I've been... I've been happy.

401
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,315
And Oliver's happy. He has friends here.

402
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,683
He has school.

403
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,268
I moved...

404
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:29,635
to another state to take the heat off

405
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,908
so that you and Oliver
would be safe from threats...

406
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,088
And now those threats are gone,

407
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:36,829
so why should we just uproot our lives?

408
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:39,737
Because that's what we agreed to!

409
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:43,354
You want to know the truth, Jude?

410
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:46,980
The real threat wasn't Shane Doucette.

411
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,722
It was you.

412
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:04,357
Hey, baby.

413
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,160
Hi, baby.

414
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,964
He's supposed to only
call me that at work.

415
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:14,901
What's going on, Sergeant?

416
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,614
My wife made an extra casserole.

417
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,845
Quaint, huh?

418
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,833
Thought I'd do the brotherly
thing and bring you some,

419
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:26,287
see how your arm's doing.

420
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,460
That's nice.

421
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,031
Like I was telling Amy...

422
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:34,726
we're all here for you.

423
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,117
The entire unit.

424
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:40,352
You need anything, just ask.

425
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,564
'Cause family looks out
for one another, right?

426
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,936
We are family...

427
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,071
aren't we, Jude?

428
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:54,451
Yeah. Of course.

429
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,592
Enjoy the casserole.

430
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:08,306
Jude...

431
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,852
It's okay.

432
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,645
No, it's not.

433
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:14,184
I'll call my guy at Internal Affairs

434
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,911
and tell him what just happened.

435
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,465
I knew Cory.

436
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,277
He was my friend, too.

437
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:24,198
He wouldn't want this for us, Jude.

438
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:26,039
What are you talking about?

439
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:27,607
He wouldn't want you and me

440
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,308
and our son to feel unsafe.

441
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,518
Are you telling me
I should drop the case?

442
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,588
This isn't just about Cory.

443
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,812
This is about
every honest cop out there.

444
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,718
Huh? Well, okay.
What do you want me to do?

445
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,937
Stick my head in the sand?

446
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,427
And... And let Doucette
and the rest of his crew

447
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:49,829
keep chopping down this city?

448
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,331
Okay, what happens to the next guy

449
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,734
who goes up against them like Cory did?

450
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:57,263
You're that next guy.

451
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,044
Don't you understand?

452
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,794
I'm not gonna hide from this.

453
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,478
Then I'm taking Oliver.
We're gonna go stay with my mom.

454
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:09,315
Oh, please, Amy, geez.

455
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:14,320
It's your family or this case.

456
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,814
Say hi to your mom.

457
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,340
- Yeah.
<i>- Good news.</i>

458
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:36,509
I got a guy from Justice
who wants to talk.

459
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:37,844
Says he might have something for you.

460
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,307
<i>You got a pen?</i>

461
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:43,128
Yeah.

462
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,393
Dr. Forbin, thank you for coming.

463
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,862
I hope it wasn't an inconvenience.

464
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,564
No, not at all.

465
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,566
They call this a cortado.

466
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,450
It's Spanish. Wonderful. You want one?

467
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:06,111
No, thank you. Caffeine and I
don't really mix.

468
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,603
You've done amazing work.

469
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:09,564
Clearing the camp of that contagion.

470
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:12,044
That little girl owes you her life.

471
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,380
Well, she's stronger than she looks.

472
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,335
I'm not a scientist, so there's, uh...

473
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,583
it's probably not worth me asking,

474
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,485
but how did you treat her?

475
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,554
Well, thanks to Agent Ren
and your staff,

476
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,388
Leah was isolated immediately.

477
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:25,258
I then used a combination of potent,

478
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,493
broad-spectrum antivirals.

479
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,953
That seemed to do the trick.

480
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:33,070
Well, I'd like to thank you
for your service.

481
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,601
And if there's ever anything
the Department can do

482
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,204
to return the favor, do let me know.

483
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,038
Sir, there's more to be done...

484
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:44,243
Leah's follow-up,
research that could be benef...

485
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,047
That is one area where I'm sorry
to say I can't be of help.

486
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,082
Your research all belongs
to the government now,

487
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,552
and your services
are no longer required.

488
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:55,254
I'm sure you understand.

489
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:17,449
- Name?
- Sophie Forbin. I work here.

490
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:20,686
My lab is here.
I have to get to my research.

491
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,949
I'm sorry, ma'am. You're listed
here as restricted.

492
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,627
- No access.
- Well, I was just here this morning.

493
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:26,452
If I could just get inside,
five minutes...

494
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,588
- I can't allow it, ma'am.
- Damn it, just listen to m...

495
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:32,158
Are you okay?

496
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,075
- Yeah?
- Caleb, i-it's me.

497
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,611
Is everything all right on your end?

498
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:54,480
No. They're doing
spot checks for phones.

499
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:56,616
<i>Pictures must have got
the attention of DHS,</i>

500
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,251
'cause they're spinning
the entire story,

501
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,286
changing it, calling it a hoax.

502
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,462
What does that mean?
What are they saying?

503
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,118
Caleb.

504
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:06,696
Give me the phone.

505
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,679
<i>Hello?</i>

506
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,126
Caleb?

507
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:14,797
<i>Hello?</i>

508
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:24,655
Where'd you get it? From a guard?

509
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,009
I'll answer your questions
after you answer mine.

510
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:32,124
Why are we being fenced in
and hidden away?

511
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,017
You're being protected, not hidden.

512
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,628
Then why can't I have a phone?

513
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:37,261
Why can't we talk to people?

514
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,550
Those are our rules.

515
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:43,442
Take the phone.

516
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,590
Roy, the phone, now!

517
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,496
Let the man talk.

518
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,433
Listen, we've done everything
you've asked of us.

519
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,825
And Agent Ren, she assured us

520
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,895
that we were on a path to citizenship.

521
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,224
Now she's gone, and walls are going up.

522
00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:03,983
It's not what you think.

523
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:05,952
Look, this is not a prison.

524
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:08,644
You make promises,

525
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,846
but you don't have
the power to keep them.

526
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:13,269
You're just another one
of their lapdogs.

527
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,537
You want to be a good dog?

528
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,396
Here.

529
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:26,439
Go fetch.

530
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,793
Fall back.

531
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,387
Everything's fine, folks.

532
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,685
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Just go about your day.

533
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,856
You can go back to your cabins.

534
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,616
It's fine.

535
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:14,286
<i>Is that a hollow-core?</i>

536
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,607
<i>I don't know about this.</i>

537
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,793
- Is she there?
<i>- No.</i>

538
00:30:53,827 --> 00:30:55,619
Something happened. They cut me off.

539
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,502
I couldn't get into the camp,
I couldn't get to Leah.

540
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,002
Reece...

541
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,248
It's okay.

542
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,600
I should've known it'd go like this.

543
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,365
Reece, where are you? I'll come to you.

544
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,366
I need to see you.

545
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,201
- I got to go.
- <i>Reece, please.</i>

546
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,470
What your cells did for Leah,
it was miraculous.

547
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,372
I know... I know I don't have
a right to ask,

548
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,040
but if I could just get
another sample...

549
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,110
I told you... no blood,
no organic materials.

550
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,811
You're a cure, Reece.

551
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,781
You're the answer to every
illness, every human defect.

552
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,607
I mean, do you have any idea
how many lives you could save?

553
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,887
Not 50 years from now, not 200, today.

554
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,390
I'm not here to save anyone else's life.

555
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,491
I just want Leah.

556
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,593
You could save my life.

557
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,556
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,794
Just don't say it.

559
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm sorry, Jude. No indictment.

560
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:31,576
Someone is protecting him.

561
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:35,590
Maybe next time, huh, brother?

562
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:37,282
- Yeah, maybe.
- All right, you be good.

563
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:38,360
Yeah, hey.

564
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:39,928
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

565
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:41,596
Stop it! Hey, man!

566
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,933
- Next time!
- Come on! It's not worth it! Stop.

567
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:47,269
Okay. Sorry.

568
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:48,337
Okay. Sorry.

569
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:49,926
We can appeal. Let's appeal, okay?

570
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:53,008
No, we can't, we can't. He made a deal.

571
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,643
We lost, Jude.

572
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,219
It's over.

573
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,061
You blew off the meeting.

574
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,310
Something...

575
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,013
just didn't feel right.

576
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:23,388
All I did was run information
up the chain.

577
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:28,151
In the meantime, I did
some checking into Lindauer.

578
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,412
He's some sort of prodigy.

579
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:32,214
Scary smart.

580
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,423
He only joined DHS nine years ago,

581
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,165
and that is an awfully fast track.

582
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,522
Former systems geek.

583
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:43,938
Threat assessment,
emergency preparedness.

584
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,028
Apparently, he has a real knack
for "predictive modeling."

585
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:49,331
They say that he could spotlight issues

586
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:50,899
almost before anyone else
knew they were issues,

587
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:51,933
almost like he could...

588
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:54,069
Tell the future.

589
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,837
Exactly.

590
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:00,128
And this...

591
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:02,797
is where we say goodbye, Jude.

592
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,247
Take care of yourself, though.

593
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,384
I hope I never see you again.

594
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:13,388
Thank you.

595
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,232
Hello?

596
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,818
<i>Sheriff Ellis? Craig Lindauer.</i>

597
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:30,865
I understand you've been asking
questions about me.

598
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:31,907
A few.

599
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:34,371
<i>I wish you would've
just come to me first.</i>

600
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:38,780
Well, let's just say
that your department

601
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,590
has been less than inviting.

602
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:44,738
Why don't you give me
a chance to remedy that?

603
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,449
I can come to you.

604
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:54,621
Batton Inlet Bridge, 10:00.

605
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,165
Okay.

606
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,000
I'll see you there.

607
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:26,431
Sophie.

608
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,133
I'm afraid I don't have good news.

609
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,641
I know.

610
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,770
I can see.

611
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:54,890
What is it?

612
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:57,559
Something wrong with the documents?

613
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:59,661
I need something else.

614
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:01,171
Hey. You got a sec?

615
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:03,967
Yeah, sure. Come... Come on in.

616
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:11,041
I admire the way
you handled yourself today.

617
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,243
We all did.

618
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:14,511
Except none of that would've happened

619
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,718
if you didn't sell me out.

620
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:19,682
Me?

621
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:21,084
Y-You think <i>I</i> said something?

622
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,153
Oh, I know you did.

623
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,389
As sure as I know
that's alcohol on your breath.

624
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:29,059
What I don't know is why.

625
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,665
So what? You, um...
You came here to torture me?

626
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:36,933
Is that it?

627
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:39,369
You know, back home,
each man in our unit,

628
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:42,672
they developed their own
method for flushing out rats.

629
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:44,174
Me?

630
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,211
I always looked for two things.

631
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:53,083
And when I confirm those things,
<i>then</i> I torture.

632
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,018
Come on, man.

633
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:57,020
This is crazy.

634
00:37:57,054 --> 00:38:00,356
You come here in the middle
of the night to accuse me?

635
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,977
Who the hell do you think you are?

636
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,393
It wasn't me.

637
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:07,147
One. Snitches tend to get
defensive when they are accused.

638
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:09,965
Because I didn't do it!

639
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,401
You want a rat, why... why...

640
00:38:11,435 --> 00:38:14,037
why don't you go ask that guy Paul?

641
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,371
I've seen him hanging around the camp.

642
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:16,538
He's schmoozing all the agents.

643
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,642
Yeah, two... they deflect blame.

644
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:22,348
Point at others to save themselves.

645
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,381
Okay, I did it! I did it! I did it!

646
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,984
I've been giving information to a guard.

647
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:31,035
He told me the phone
was a serious thing.

648
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:33,385
I didn't... Well, I didn't want
that to jeopardize

649
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,465
my chances of getting out again.

650
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,061
Don't... Don't hurt me.

651
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,931
You know what?

652
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:47,303
All right. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

653
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,506
I'm gonna make you a deal.

654
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,108
But you got to keep this quiet, okay?

655
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,510
Because you're right.

656
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,756
We don't want to jeopardize
our chances here, right?

657
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,947
Yes! Exactly. Thank you.

658
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:00,183
So, here's the deal...

659
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:03,019
I agree not to kill you...

660
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:05,955
and you agree not to tell anyone
who did this.

661
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,924
Did what?

662
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:10,167
Shh!

663
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:39,022
License and registration.

664
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,825
I'm a government agent
with Homeland Security.

665
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,726
License and registration, sir.

666
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:45,761
I don't have it with me.

667
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,306
I'm happy to show you my credentials.

668
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,565
Keep your hands where I can
see them, please.

669
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,783
So, your driving was, uh,
a little erratic back there.

670
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,166
You weren't texting, were you?

671
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:58,074
No, I wasn't texting.

672
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:10,220
This is a nice car.

673
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,941
And you know what? I-I'll bet in like...

674
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:16,244
180 years,
they're still driving Caddies.

675
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:18,328
Sheriff Ellis, I presume.

676
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,375
Nice putting a face to the name, huh?

677
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,233
Lindauer.

678
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:27,604
You smell that, Deputy?

679
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,726
I do. Alcohol.

680
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:32,083
- Yeah.
- How 'bout that?

681
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:34,544
Ask you to step out of the vehicle, sir.

682
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,261
We need to search your vehicle.

683
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:39,782
Okay.

684
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:42,252
How's about we keep those hands
where I can see them, okay?

685
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,254
Right up here.

686
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,343
Oh.

687
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,396
Look what I found.

688
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:54,530
With the, uh, serial number shaved off.

689
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:57,283
I procured it in the course
of an investigation.

690
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:59,456
I just haven't had a chance
to voucher it yet.

691
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:01,549
- I don't buy it.
- Me neither.

692
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,418
Hands behind your back, sir.

693
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,614
Hands behind your back now.

694
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:11,559
This really the play
you want to make, Sheriff?

695
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,494
Get your ass in the car.

696
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,363
Let's go.

697
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:33,155

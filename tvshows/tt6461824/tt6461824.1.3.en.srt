1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:02,015
<i>No one expected to arrive</i>

2
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:03,561
<i>in the water, beneath the surface.</i>

3
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,773
<i>Previously on "The Crossing"...</i>

4
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,375
We were running away.

5
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,256
- From what?
- The war.

6
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:11,699
- But there's no war.
- There will be.

7
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,801
We're not the first ones to comes here.

8
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:15,136
How long have you been here?

9
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,371
Longer than you think.

10
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:18,606
Come on, Marshall, what did you do now?

11
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,942
I guess you weren't able to
bring anything from home?

12
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:23,044
This locket, but I lost it in the ocean.

13
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,779
Apex took over the government.

14
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,614
They hunted us like animals.

15
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,217
They were genetically engineered
killing machines.

16
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,652
<i>They created a virus.</i>

17
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:34,122
I just want my daughter.
She can't be away from me.

18
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:35,849
This is Mantle's Disease.

19
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,160
No!

20
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,796
Tell me you got an update.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,197
Still no body.

22
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,602
You said she was hit.

23
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:23,271
"A likely kill shot." Your words.

24
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:25,607
You want to drag the harbor,
Craig, be my guest.

25
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,376
This is Apex. If there's no
body, assume the worst.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,712
You're gonna need more contractors.

27
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:33,681
Local emergency calls will be
filtered through intercept.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,314
Anybody sees anything,
we'll be first responders.

29
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,470
We'll go door-to-door if need be.

30
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,367
Sounds low-profile.

31
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:41,770
I know what my job entails.

32
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,273
Unlike you, I've actually killed them.

33
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,975
Well, that was a long time ago...

34
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:50,178
She's alone.

35
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:51,413
Wounded.

36
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:53,548
And I've whipped up a little something

37
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,417
that should give me an advantage.

38
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,651
All right, this might be a lead.

39
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:59,221
Infrared is picking up a heat
signal in the Western Ridge.

40
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,897
I'm scared.

41
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,466
Hey, what does being a mommy mean?

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,535
That you're always gonna be
there for me.

43
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,903
That's right.

44
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,885

46
00:02:58,563 --> 00:02:59,681
Morning.

47
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:00,715
Hey, Jude.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,951
Just getting out the toys
for the open house.

49
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:05,487
Figured it'd be busy with all
the, you know, stuff that's...

50
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,539
Hey!

51
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:09,263
You must be Oliver.
I heard a lot about you.

52
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,098
Ollie, this is Nestor.

53
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,969
Don't let the beard fool you.
He is in fact an actual deputy.

54
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,270
- It's true.
- Hi.

55
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,940
Hi. You look like you're gonna
be a heck of a sheriff one day,

56
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:21,542
just like your dad, huh?

57
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,644
I'm not a big fan of guns.

58
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:29,717
Well, they've got plenty of other jobs

59
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,619
that don't require the gun.

60
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,488
Desk jobs and so forth.

61
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:36,557
Dispatch. You could do that, you know?

62
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,591
You got to wear that headset all day,

63
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:39,427
you're talking into that,
your ear gets sweaty.

64
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,461
It's not the best job in the world.

65
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,963
Hey, Ollie, there's a bathroom
around the corner.

66
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,698
Why don't you use it before we go?

67
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,836
Hey, we got to take him to the range.

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,805
Hey, did we get any calls yesterday

69
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,974
about any suspicious activity
down at the shipyard?

70
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,912
No. I-I saw in the duty log

71
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,036
that there was some heavy air traffic.

72
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,095
Figured it was probably the Air Force

73
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,990
just scrambling some choppers
out of Lewis-McChord.

74
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,532
Probably some kind of drills.

75
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,836
Do me a favor, if you hear anything,

76
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,538
get any calls, get me on my cell.

77
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,173
Yes, sir.

78
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,908
Anything you want to bring me in on?

79
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:17,378
No, just...

80
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,213
if you get any calls, let me know.

81
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,214
Yeah.

82
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:21,882
We'll be at Harborfest.

83
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,884
Yeah, no, yeah.

84
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,019
Have fun.

85
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,821
Yeah, and kick Marshall.

86
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,857
All right. Wake up.

87
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,560
I requested a late checkout.

88
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:35,696
The guy you got into it with
declined to press charges,

89
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,531
so you're good to go home.

90
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,935
You got to stop doing this, Marshall.

91
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,737
Come on, these tourists
come for Harborfest,

92
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:45,606
they blow in like they own the place.

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,075
It's not about some tourist.

94
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:54,615
It's 10 years since the accident.
And I am sorry,

95
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,185
but you can't keep living in the past.

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,019
You have to start
thinking about your future.

97
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,190
Maybe I don't have one.

98
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:19,737
Who else knows
about the earlier migration?

99
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,538
No one.

100
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,312
You don't have to do this.

101
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,748
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

102
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:34,585
You need to understand
that here, in this time,

103
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,120
you have no power.

104
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,755
You have no freedom.

105
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:41,492
You have no life,
except the one I give you.

106
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,928
I understand.

107
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:45,329
Good.

108
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,766
Then maybe you can be of use to us.

109
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:55,539
The best thing is just to be patient.

110
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,041
The guy I talked to?

111
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,932
He said talking about where we're from

112
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,811
is not helping our cause.

113
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,880
They think we're crazy.

114
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:06,483
And they don't let crazy people
just walk around...

115
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:09,186
Crazy people get locked up.

116
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,555
Hey, what's this?

117
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,991
He was out of the camp yesterday.

118
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,526
He talked with someone in charge.

119
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,694
They're ready to help.

120
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,297
There's money available to us,
places to live, even jobs.

121
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,199
Did <i>you</i> see these places?

122
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,635
Just pictures.

123
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,806
If you want a life here,
do exactly what they tell you,

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,841
and say as little as possible.

125
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:54,698
Where'd you get those?

126
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,001
Oh, I found them.

127
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,406
Yeah, well, they don't hide who you are,

128
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,775
if that's what you were hoping.

129
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,410
Do I know you?

130
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,581
No, but I know you.

131
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,019
And I know what you did
back in Metolius.

132
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,556
If these settlers found out,

133
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:24,261
I don't even want to think
about what they'd do to you.

134
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,665
But...

135
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:33,070
maybe we can work something out...

136
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,276
...so that doesn't happen.

137
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,795
Hi, Roy.

138
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,630
Hey. What's going on?

139
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,634
Can I ask you something?

140
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:06,570
Do you know how long
we're gonna be here?

141
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,139
I'm not a part of those conversations.

142
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:11,008
But I meant what I said,
if there's anything

143
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,277
I could do for you to make
things a little easier...

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,845
You could get me out of here.

145
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,451
I can't do that, Hannah.

146
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,786
That would be breaking the law.

147
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,455
There are serious penalties.

148
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,523
Yeah, it's okay. I understand.

149
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,296
Is there anything else going on?

150
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,764
No.

151
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,432
No, it's fine.

152
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,134
I just... I shouldn't have asked.

153
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:46,710
Hey, hey.

154
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:49,646
All right, here it is.

155
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,819
All right, this is it.

156
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,654
What do you think?

157
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,889
What is it?

158
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:01,758
Harborfest. It's a tradition.

159
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:05,195
Come on, man. It's gonna be fun.

160
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,397
There's, like, games and music.

161
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:09,733
There's a guy who juggles salmon...

162
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,137
and all kinds of junk food.

163
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,838
Don't tell your mom.

164
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,007
I thought we were gonna go fishing.

165
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,742
- Just you and me.
- Yeah, we are.

166
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,311
I just thought I'd show
you the town first.

167
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:25,249
So...

168
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:26,817
what kind of junk food?

169
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,820
Yeah, now we're talkin'!
Come on, let's go.

170
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,030
Do you think she'll like it?

171
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,266
Dad.

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,168
Yeah, I'm coming.

173
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:19,269
The trail is taking her back
toward the town.

174
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:21,772
If she gets to the general population,

175
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,740
this becomes a lot more difficult.

176
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,477
So we're gonna stay south by southwest.

177
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,413
So keep her cordoned off.

178
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:33,417
Amount of blood she's lost,
she's lucky to be on her feet.

179
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,419
You underestimate this target,

180
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,188
she will be the last thing
you see on this earth.

181
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,959
Move out.

182
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:58,742
You really punching out?

183
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:01,645
There goes your double overtime,

184
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,813
just floating away.

185
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,649
Yeah, heading back to the hotel.

186
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:09,575
If I don't get some sleep,
I'll be useless.

187
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,021
What use are you now?

188
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:13,086
This isn't exactly Guantanamo.

189
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,485
Give these kooks some colored pencils,

190
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,759
and they take care of themselves.

191
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,982
Hell, I'll take all the shifts.

192
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,164
You're a real patriot.

193
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,313
Come on.

194
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,215
What is this?

195
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:21,913
Hey.

196
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,765
Emma, hi. How's the girl?

197
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,399
Not good. High-grade fever,

198
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:28,123
fatigue, some respiratory distress.

199
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,603
<i>I'm sending in a specialist.</i>

200
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:30,967
She's gonna develop a screen,

201
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:32,439
make sure we don't have more carriers.

202
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,874
<i>I got ahold of the Sheriff.</i>

203
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:36,350
He wasn't too happy.
I can't say I blame him.

204
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,988
I expect he'll fall into line.

205
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:39,689
I reported on his location

206
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,658
because I thought you were gonna
give me the leeway

207
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,193
to meet with him alone.

208
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:46,997
No, you reported on his location
because it's your job.

209
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,866
Is there something
you aren't telling me?

210
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,701
I told you I didn't want him involved.

211
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,502
You had to go and "make him an asset."

212
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,572
So I dealt with the situation.
I made the call.

213
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,375
<i>And do your job or I'll find
someone else to do it.</i>

214
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:04,147
If we do exactly what they say,
take care of ourselves,

215
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,306
you know, don't say anything
about what's going on here,

216
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,360
what happened before,
where we came from...

217
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,722
Director Lindauer.

218
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:14,758
Good morning.
Sir, I'm Dr. Sophie Forbin.

219
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,526
I appreciate you meeting me in person.

220
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,929
<i>My specialty is quarantine measurements,</i>

221
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,864
screening methodology,
vaccine production.

222
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,002
If HSI needs a virologist,
I'm eminently qualified.

223
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,548
Director Lindauer. I'm Dr. Forbin.

224
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:44,588
Your paper in the <i>Journal</i>
<i>of Microbiotic Virology.</i>

225
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:45,956
Nice work.

226
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,624
Shall we?

227
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,188
I was one of six co-authors
on that paper.

228
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:53,297
My sources tell me you did
the bulk of the research.

229
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,766
Anyway, let's skip
your curriculum vitae.

230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,201
You've been vetted, I'm impressed.

231
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:02,406
May I ask what, if anything,
you've heard about Thorn Beach.

232
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,243
The shipwreck?
Only what I saw on the news.

233
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:07,778
Dozens of fatalities.

234
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,415
And 47 survivors.
English-speaking, coherent...

235
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,384
though they seem to be victims
of some sort of mass delusion.

236
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,886
Brainwashing, perhaps?

237
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,788
Trust me, you'll understand

238
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,057
when you hear where they claim
to have come from.

239
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,993
What does that have to do with me?

240
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,795
One of them's displaying symptoms

241
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,797
of an unidentified virus...
A little girl.

242
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,631
She's dying.

243
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,166
Has she been isolated?

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,802
Yes. I need you to prepare a diagnostic,

245
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,011
see if anyone else has been infected.

246
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,833
You need me to stop an outbreak?

247
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,177
I need your utmost discretion.

248
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,014
You report only to me until we
know more about this thing.

249
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,348
I don't want to start a panic.

250
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:46,683
Absolutely.

251
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,952
When do I start?

252
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,555
You just did.

253
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,834
Baker team. Stand by.
I think I got something.

254
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,405
Myers, sound off.

255
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,007
Where is my daughter?

256
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:48,211
<i>Myers.</i>

257
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,591
I'll take it from here.

258
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,093
Dr. Forbin.

259
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:04,647
Emma Ren.

260
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,702
Sophie, please.

261
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,064
Shouldn't these people be in quarantine?

262
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,033
We believe we isolated the patient

263
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,935
before she became contagious.

264
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,236
How could you know that?

265
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,373
These people have experience
with the virus.

266
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:20,143
I was told this was an
unidentified pathogen.

267
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,177
It's complicated.

268
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:24,080
Look, if you want answers,
I'll get them for you.

269
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,149
Whatever it takes
to help this little girl.

270
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:28,952
Agent Ren, I reviewed
the patient's lab work.

271
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,988
I've never seen this kind of
rapid onset before.

272
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:35,058
She's experiencing acute
distress, prostration,

273
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,794
exanthema, early signs
of brain inflammation,

274
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,996
and I don't know how it's transmitted.

275
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,031
Forgive me if I sound harsh,

276
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,466
but I wasn't brought in here
to save a little girl.

277
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,136
I'm here to prevent a pandemic.

278
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,173
This Thorn Beach thing is crazy, right?

279
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,175
The story is they were all dead,

280
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,977
but Kara's brother
works for the Coast Guard,

281
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,079
and he said that they
pulled a bunch of people

282
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:58,415
out of the water... alive.

283
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,817
What the hell do you think is going on?

284
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,486
Well, in the words of
my great-grandpa Lonny...

285
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:06,623
if you can't do anything about
it, don't worry about it.

286
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,762
What the hell is this?

287
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:17,610
It's a... Nerf basketball hoop.

288
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,669
It's an earring, Marshall.

289
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,371
Is it?

290
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,972
Who was here last night?

291
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,674
No one.

292
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:28,812
Go to hell.

293
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,693
There you go. All right, remember.

294
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,895
Be the ball.

295
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,198
Dad, what does that even mean?

296
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,597
It doesn't have to mean anything.

297
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:51,995
It's "Caddyshack." Now come on, focus.

298
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,163
Be the ball.

299
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,006
Ah, close. So close. So close.

300
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,242
We're gonna have to try that one again.

301
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,644
This time, skip the weighted bottles.

302
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,381
Loosen up. You got to loosen up.

303
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,549
Way too tight. Got it?

304
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,085
Okay, focus.

305
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,054
You got it. Do it.

306
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:15,258
Yeah! What? Are you kidding me?

307
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,093
Yeah. What do we get?

308
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,862
- What do we get?
- The gray shark.

309
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,864
Of course. Nice!

310
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,099
It was so close.

311
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,934
Thank you.

312
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,737
Nice job!

313
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,632
Excuse me, is there transport?
Is there...

314
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,542
Hi.

315
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,877
Yeah?

316
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,447
I was wondering if you could help me.

317
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,555
With what?

318
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,256
I don't really know this place.

319
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:52,759
You lose your tour group or something?

320
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,561
Yeah.

321
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,364
Maybe you could show me around?

322
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,667
Private tour's gonna cost you.

323
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,602
I don't have any money.

324
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,071
- It was a joke.
- Oh.

325
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,447
You hungry?

326
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,655
Here.

327
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,598
Wow.

328
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,233
That's amazing.

329
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:37,470
So, uh, where you from anyway?

330
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,810
Um... it's called Metolius.

331
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,947
Yeah? I went river rafting
out there once.

332
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,716
There's like 12 people in that town.

333
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,585
It's growing.

334
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,554
Where are you from?

335
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,072
Right here.

336
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm gonna leave soon, go to L.A.

337
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,988
It's time.

338
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:02,324
I don't think you should do that.

339
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,559
And why not?

340
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,828
Maybe you're meant to be here.

341
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:09,040
Are you ready to rock, Port Canaan?

342
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:11,733
One, two, three, four.

343
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,104
There's so much music here.

344
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,610
Okay.

345
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,350
You wanted to see me?

346
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,585
Hey, Thomas.

347
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,320
Have a seat.

348
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:40,328
So how was your visit with
my colleague, Mr. Lindauer?

349
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,464
It was good. Nice guy.

350
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,933
Sounds like the conversation
you and he had

351
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,135
was different from the
conversation you and I had.

352
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,272
Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you.

353
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:51,673
There's no excuse.

354
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:55,177
It's okay. Everybody makes mistakes.

355
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,779
But just so I'm clear...

356
00:21:57,814 --> 00:22:01,883
what you told me about
the earlier migration...

357
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:03,685
<i>that</i> was a lie?

358
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,886
Yes.

359
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,822
That's a pretty unusual one.

360
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:08,723
I was trying to get attention.

361
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,559
I was scared.

362
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:12,460
You were scared of what?

363
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:15,564
You know, this... this whole situation.

364
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:17,833
I wanted to feel important.

365
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:22,871
Which is it? You were scared
or you wanted to feel important?

366
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:29,811
Uh... both.

367
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:32,147
Now, who wants to be my next deputy?

368
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:35,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

369
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:37,485
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

370
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,921
Hey, it's not all blasting
sirens and chasing bad guys.

371
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:41,923
Although we do that. But you know what?

372
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,893
You're gonna have to take
a pledge to protect and serve,

373
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:48,830
and then you get a badge
and some cool toys.

374
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:49,931
So who's in?

375
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:52,534
Me!

376
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,103
All right, wait.
We'll get one right here.

377
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:56,838
All right, here you go.

378
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:58,607
Hey, Dad, can I wear your hat?

379
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:01,691
There you go.

380
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,034
Can I have one?

381
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,381
All right.

382
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,550
Hey, take over for a second, will you?

383
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:09,851
Excuse me.

384
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:12,954
What do you want?

385
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:14,589
Is there somewhere we can talk?

386
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:17,425
I'm sorry, you're too old
to be a junior deputy.

387
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,760
Look, dude...

388
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:21,296
I think it's happened before.

389
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,230
What?

390
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:25,734
There was an earlier migration
of refugees.

391
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:28,136
- When?
- I don't know.

392
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,071
But I know there's some people
at high levels that do.

393
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:31,973
The same people that dropped
a Blackwater convention

394
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,308
on the shipyards, I suppose.

395
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:34,142
- Yes.
- Yeah.

396
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:36,544
Why are you coming to me with this?

397
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:39,915
You're the only person I can trust.

398
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:41,549
Wow.

399
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:44,052
Listen, if there were others,
they left a trace.

400
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,787
Witnesses. Something.

401
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,940
If you went into town
and checked the records...

402
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:49,958
- No, I can't help you.
- This is important.

403
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:53,261
Hey, you got a boss
who's keeping secrets,

404
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,430
corruption at the top... Been there.

405
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:57,032
No desire to go back.

406
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:01,503
Someone see Agent Ren out.

407
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,939
Hi, Leah. It's okay.

408
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:06,641
I'm a doctor. My name is Sophie.

409
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:09,911
I have a real important question to ask.

410
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:13,081
Do I look stupid in this suit?

411
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:16,184
I know I do.

412
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,353
It's so hot as well.

413
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:20,989
Do you mind?

414
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:23,992
You know, I was studying
your blood work,

415
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,795
and I saw something that surprised me.

416
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:29,698
The way your body is
reacting to the virus,

417
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:31,933
it's like it's already fought it.

418
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,970
Have your received treatment
for these symptoms before?

419
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,938
From my mom.

420
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:38,940
Your mother gave you medicine?

421
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:41,876
She <i>was</i> the medicine.

422
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,702
Are you in charge?

423
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:32,069
N-No.

424
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,529
He's back with the vehicles.

425
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,445
Excuse me. Are you Rebecca?

426
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:53,881
Leah was staying with you, right?

427
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,150
I'd like to ask you some questions.

428
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:57,951
You're wasting your time.

429
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,712
She can't be saved.

430
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:02,539
That's what I thought at first.
Now I'm not so sure.

431
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:06,795
Look, I don't know who you
people are, and I don't care.

432
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,964
But if you have insight into this virus,

433
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:09,999
you have to talk to me.

434
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,935
That little girl is in there
fighting for her life.

435
00:26:14,504 --> 00:26:15,938
What do you want to know?

436
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,573
I think she's fought this before,

437
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,875
aided by some type
of treatment, an antiviral.

438
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,877
- There's no treatment.
- She said her mother

439
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,979
used to give her medicine,
made by her blood.

440
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:25,548
The way Leah talks about it,

441
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:27,483
it sounds like her mother was immune.

442
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,585
No one is immune. Only...

443
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,587
Only what?

444
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:35,491
She's a sick little girl.

445
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:37,326
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

446
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,495
If you know something, please tell me.

447
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,321
I have to tell you, they were very nice.

448
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:07,323
They showed me around.

449
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:11,493
I had this sweet liquid
made of combined fruit.

450
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:13,362
They call it a smoothie.

451
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:18,834
And more importantly,
I established some contacts.

452
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,002
For the outside.

453
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:23,639
You know, to have a head start
once we get out of here.

454
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,641
That's amazing.

455
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:37,553
Tell you what, let's stay in contact.

456
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,188
Happy to help.

457
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:40,589
Okay.

458
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,297
Hey, tell me something.

459
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:51,667
Did they... they tell you
how long we'd be in this camp?

460
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,636
A couple weeks.

461
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,204
Really?

462
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,006
'Cause I just saw them unloading

463
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,308
a couple <i>months'</i> worth
of food out front.

464
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:01,410
The men I talked to
said we'd be out soon.

465
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,479
I took that to mean a couple weeks.

466
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:06,248
Huh. I thought you
talked to just one man

467
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:07,650
in a windowless room.

468
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,920
I got to explain myself to you?

469
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,088
I'm just asking.

470
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:15,190
And I answered your question.

471
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,095
You want to go looking for problems?

472
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,664
I'm sure you'll find them.

473
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,700
But I guarantee you'll be
the last guy out of this camp,

474
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:26,702
if at all.

475
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,307
We love you, Port Canaan!

476
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:14,033
Whoo!

477
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:18,253
I've never heard a band like that.

478
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,489
Yeah, they're okay.

479
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:22,758
I mean, I don't think the Stones
are real worried.

480
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,126
Stones?

481
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,463
You need to get out more.

482
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,231
Maybe you can take me.

483
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:34,670
Y'know, you should be more careful.

484
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,004
What do you mean?

485
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,639
A girl who looks like you?

486
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:39,508
You shouldn't trust someone like me.

487
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,744
Some random guy you just met in a crowd.

488
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:47,750
You're more than that.

489
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:50,652
I was meant to find you.

490
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:56,325
They said you were a good man,
someone I could trust.

491
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,594
They said if I found you I'd be okay.

492
00:29:58,628 --> 00:30:00,696
Is this a joke?

493
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,698
Are you kidding me?

494
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:06,034
Come on, we're going.

495
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,136
Hey.

496
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,337
Hey!

497
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,638
Don't even try it.

498
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:15,010
- Don't. Let it go.
- What the hell, Sheriff?

499
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:16,712
- He can't just take her.
- Yeah, he can.

500
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:19,448
And he better. Right now.

501
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,016
Come on.

502
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,656
Everything's all right.
Everything's under control.

503
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,791
Misunderstanding.

504
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,129
Come on.

505
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:38,147
Baker team, sound off.

506
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,504
Baker team, sound off.

507
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:47,843
Drop your weapon.

508
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:49,945
I'm not gonna ask you again.

509
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,716
Drop to the ground.

510
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,522
High-frequency sonic discharge.

511
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,257
In case you were wondering.

512
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,859
We can't pick up that frequency.

513
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:07,029
But an Apex? Scrambles you up good.

514
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,570
Welcome to the Long Peace, swan.

515
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,775
Haven't seen one of you in 10 years.

516
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,777
Don't worry.

517
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,714
...I look forward to making up
for lost time.

518
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:35,451
How many more are there?

519
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,515
I'm the only one.

520
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:39,366
I don't buy that.

521
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:42,155
You splash into the ocean,
survive undetected...

522
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:44,964
you should be long gone...
but you stuck around. Why?

523
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:46,365
Why would you stick around

524
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,868
unless there was something
that you wanted?

525
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,905
Or someone?

526
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,375
And when I find out who it is
that you stuck around for,

527
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:58,944
I'll put a bullet in their head.

528
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:25,572
Thank you.

529
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:33,712
There you go, buddy.

530
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,886
So what do you think, Ollie?

531
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,955
Not that bad up here, huh?

532
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,894
You all right?

533
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,699
Hey. What's going on?

534
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:54,469
What did I do wrong?

535
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,006
Nothing.

536
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,242
Then why did you move away from me?

537
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:23,464
Remember we talked about my job
being complicated?

538
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:24,966
I didn't tell you everything

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,968
because I thought you were too young,

540
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:29,804
but I'm gonna tell you now...

541
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:35,710
...because I don't want you
thinking for one second

542
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,746
that any of this is your fault. Okay?

543
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:47,321
When I was a police officer in Oakland,

544
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:51,092
some people were upset
that I arrested them.

545
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:57,498
And I had to leave so that they
would stop making threats.

546
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:03,905
I moved away to keep you safe,

547
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:09,510
because you are the most
important thing in my life.

548
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:14,916
Are you safe now?

549
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,821
I am, and so are you and so is your mom.

550
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:24,258
Hey, you know, you guys are gonna be

551
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:25,793
moving to Portland soon.

552
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,195
That's always been part of the plan.

553
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:28,763
Has she talked to you about that?

554
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:31,199
Okay. Well, that's gonna happen.

555
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:34,302
And then you're gonna be
like 30 minutes from me.

556
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:36,637
So we can get back on schedule

557
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,507
of seeing each other all the time. Okay?

558
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,446
Hey, look at me.

559
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:49,050
I love you.

560
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:58,860
I will do anything for you.

561
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:02,964
Anything.

562
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,891
_

563
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:37,031
<i>HSI Field Office, Seattle Seaport.</i>

564
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,166
I need information

565
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,002
on the Tamanowas detainment
facility in Oregon, please.

566
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:44,539
<i>I'm seeing no record of any
operation under that listing.</i>

567
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:48,876
Then do a global search
of the entire Pacific Northwest.

568
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:53,381
Key words... detainment,
vetting, quarantine.

569
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:56,517
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am. No match.</i>

570
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,688
I have 47 detainees of unknown origin.

571
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:03,291
I have 75 government-sanctioned staff.

572
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:05,226
<i>Ma'am, may I have your badge number?</i>

573
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:22,788
- Why are we stopping?
- Oh, are you talking to me now?

574
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:26,120
And why should I talk to you?

575
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:28,122
You're taking me against my will.

576
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:31,091
I know the camp's not perfect,
but it's safe.

577
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,258
You're protected there.

578
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,281
Everyone at that camp...

579
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,974
they either hate me now
or they're about to.

580
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,442
Why?

581
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:45,609
Hannah, what's going on?

582
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,490
Come on.

583
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,350
Where are we going?

584
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:58,573
You need to get in the back of the truck

585
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,642
so I can sneak you back into the camp.

586
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,579
No questions, no consequences.

587
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:07,148
Come on.

588
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,168
Hey, Hannah.

589
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:31,439
How's it going?

590
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:34,509
What are you doing in my cabin?

591
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,878
Come on.

592
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:40,114
Can we get past all this
wide-eyed disbelief

593
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:43,785
and just get to where we're
gonna end up eventually...

594
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:45,053
Good friends.

595
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,087
Get out.

596
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,623
Now.

597
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,891
I'll scream.

598
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:51,759
Yeah? And then what?

599
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:54,228
A bunch of people come running over,

600
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,431
ask what's going on,

601
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:58,933
I tell them what I know.

602
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:02,403
You used to be an Apex collaborator.

603
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:09,444
Maybe I'll tell it
to that big guy, Caleb.

604
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:11,546
Did you see the tattoo on his wrist?

605
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,549
It's an Alpha-Zulu insignia.

606
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,453
Do you know what they used to do
to people like you?

607
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,090
Horrible stuff.

608
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,725
Don't touch me.

609
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:31,933
You don't seem to get it.

610
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:35,693
While you're in here,

611
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,602
I own you.

612
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:17,111
No one has ever survived Mantle's.

613
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,447
No one is immune.

614
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:23,184
No one except...

615
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:25,019
Apex.

616
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:27,522
What is Apex?

617
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,573
Yeah!

618
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,368
Yeah.

619
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:03,524
There it is!

620
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,567
Dad, what was that?

621
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:14,934
You stay right here, okay?
I won't be long.

622
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,907
What's going on?

623
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,776
Watch out. Back it up.

624
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,411
Back it up!

625
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,963

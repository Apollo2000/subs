1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,898
No one expected
to arrive how we did,

2
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:05,018
in the water,
beneath the surface.

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,388
Something went wrong.

4
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:09,178
Previously on "The Crossing"...

5
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,388
She's breathing!

6
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:12,218
- There's one here! I got him.

7
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:13,798
- Little one over here!
- Hey, hey, hey!

8
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:14,848
You're okay.

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,888
Where'd they come from, Jude?

10
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:17,178
I don't know.

11
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,088
We were running away.

12
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,548
- From what?
- The war.

13
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:21,548
But there's no war.

14
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:22,968
There will be.

15
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:26,678
You listed a date of birth
almost 150 years from now.

16
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:28,088
They took over
every government.

17
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:29,798
- Who?
- Apex.

18
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:32,588
Man's next evolution.
They can do things we can't.

19
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:35,388
My mom kissed me,
then she was gone.

20
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:38,008
You got any money? Better empty
your pockets just to be sure.

21
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,178
- Who did it to him?
- Said it was a woman.

22
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:41,548
I'm the sheriff!
I'm dealing with this!

23
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,428
- You have no authority here!
- I said...

24
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,298
Heightened
cognitive function,

25
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,888
fast-twitch
muscle development.

26
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:51,348
We got to keep them sequestered
until we find out the truth.

27
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,678
We're not the first ones
to come here.

28
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,348
How long have you been here?

29
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:56,848
Longer than you think.

30
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,218
Who were you looking for
in the hangar?

31
00:00:58,218 --> 00:00:59,848
My daughter.

32
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:13,048
We're close.

33
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,008
Control said there could be
up to 30 Commons here.

34
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,258
Be ready.

35
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,638
Mantle's disease.
Shame they never found the cure.

36
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:21,138
Such an ugly sound.

37
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,008
It's scared.

38
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,258
It's weak.

39
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:31,638
Look. When we get to the beach,
you stay in the car.

40
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,048
I do all the talking.

41
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,548
I don't want a repeat
of the plane hangar

42
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,758
or with the mugger
on the dock, okay?

43
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:58,388
They must've taken them
somewhere.

44
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:02,758
Look, wherever it is,

45
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:05,678
I'm sure it's a lot more
comfortable than this beach is.

46
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:08,218
You don't understand.

47
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,008
She can't be away from me.

48
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,758
I do understand.
That's why we're here.

49
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:16,258
I know what it's like to be
apart from your kid.

50
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,798
We've come so far.

51
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,718
I can't lose her now.

52
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,348
Look.

53
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:37,718
I need to know I can trust you.

54
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,678
I just want my daughter.

55
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:46,088
Alright.
Let's go find her.

56
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,048
Don't!

57
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,798
I'm starting to worry about you.

58
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,678
I'm gonna take care of you.

59
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:24,718
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

60
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,008
We didn't know
if we'd survive the trip.

61
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:44,548
We weren't even sure what
we'd find once we got here.

62
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:46,888
If we got here.

63
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:50,678
We just knew staying behind
would be a death sentence.

64
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:56,348
Apex was determined to
exterminate us... all of us.

65
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,718
They burned centuries
of human history to the ground.

66
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,218
Destroyed everything
we've ever known.

67
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,798
They stole our freedom.

68
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,888
They hunted us like animals.

69
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,508
They were genetically
engineered killing machines

70
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,798
without an ounce of compassion.

71
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:18,008
And the only safe place for us
was a world without Apex.

72
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:21,468
So we had no choice
but to try and find it.

73
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,138
Did you all
know each other?

74
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,428
No, we were strangers.

75
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,468
It was whoever was lucky enough

76
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,888
to hear the whisper
of the threshold.

77
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:34,178
I don't even know how many of us
made it through...

78
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,588
or where everybody landed.

79
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,508
How many other camps
are there like this?

80
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,968
Where's everybody else?

81
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,548
Uh, this is the only camp.

82
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,928
How many... died?

83
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,348
400 people died in the water.

84
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,678
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,548
Huh.

86
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:06,848
Our whole lives,

87
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,468
all we've known is loss.

88
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:17,718
You would think
it'd be easier to accept.

89
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,888
Would it be possible
to arrange a memorial?

90
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:31,258
They shouldn't be forgotten,

91
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,928
even if they were strangers.

92
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,968
I'll see what I can do.

93
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:56,798
It's beautiful, isn't it?

94
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,428
Mm.

95
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,178
It's so quiet, though.
I-I couldn't sleep.

96
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,548
I think there's
something going on.

97
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,388
There's more guards around now,

98
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,088
and I heard
they're taking saliva.

99
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,388
Why?

100
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:17,888
It's how they used to read DNA.

101
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,008
They can have mine
if they want it.

102
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:23,218
Besides, I like
having more guards.

103
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,928
It feels safe.

104
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,258
Hi.

105
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,718
I brought you some fruit.

106
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,218
I'm not hungry.

107
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,798
You have to eat something.

108
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,548
You're gonna disappear.

109
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:51,348
We drove so far.

110
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,968
How will she find us?

111
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,758
My mom.

112
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,548
Sweetheart...

113
00:07:58,548 --> 00:08:02,048
I'm so sorry, but your mom...

114
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,638
she's gone.

115
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:09,428
Alright, I got to
make some phone calls.

116
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,968
See if my deputies know
anything.

117
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,798
Just, uh, don't go outside.

118
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,548
Stay away from the windows.

119
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,798
Hey, bud.

120
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,468
Hey, Dad.
Do I need boots?

121
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,298
For... what?

122
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:33,508
Fishing.
I don't have any boots.

123
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:35,218
No, no, no.
No, we're good.

124
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:36,428
Y-You're alright.

125
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,388
Okay.
See you tomorrow, Dad.

126
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,048
Can't wait to see your house.

127
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,008
Yeah, me too, bud.

128
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,388
Um, but, hey, uh...

129
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:49,508
Uh... it might not actually be
here at my house, okay?

130
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,428
Is it not a good time
to come visit?

131
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:54,008
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a great time.

132
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,588
What, are you kidding me?

133
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,798
I just, um, I-I-I'm working on
something special.

134
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:02,798
Okay? But we are definitely on
for tomorrow.

135
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:06,888
So, I'll, uh... I'll give you
a call tomorrow, okay, bud?

136
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,718
Okay. Bye, Dad.

137
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,888
Alright. Bye.

138
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:15,388
To clarify...

139
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,968
I help you get your daughter,

140
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:20,638
you get out of my town
and my life.

141
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:21,638
Yes.

142
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:22,888
Okay.

143
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,088
What? What is it?

144
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,888
Someone's here.

145
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,588
Stay out of sight.

146
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:38,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

147
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,548
Got any of that cold brew?

148
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,048
Dog kept me up all night.

149
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,638
Not a good time.

150
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:45,718
It's always a good time
for cold brew.

151
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,548
Right?

152
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,678
You got somebody in there?

153
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,508
- No.
- Hey, listen.

154
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,968
As the unmarried man
in this particular situation,

155
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,848
you are duty-bound to report
any sort of erotic escapades.

156
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:58,008
- Nestor.
- In detail.

157
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,008
Why are you here?

158
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:03,298
Well, the hospital called.

159
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,968
Sounds like the Feds are asking
questions of our mugger.

160
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:07,678
- Give me a minute.
- Alright. Tell her I said hi!

161
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,928
I got to go.

162
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,678
This could give me
a lead to Leah.

163
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,588
- I'll go with you.
- I got this, okay?

164
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,388
This is what I do.
I'll find her.

165
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:21,388
Besides, people
are looking for you.

166
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,548
It's not safe.
Just... Just stay here, okay?

167
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,258
If you can get the
majority of the people isolated,

168
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,388
then we can reach
the road at the end.

169
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:37,928
Um, I'll catch up
with you later.

170
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,798
Sheriff, good morning.

171
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:41,638
Yeah, it was.

172
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:44,178
Until I found out you were
talking to my prisoner.

173
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,888
Looks like Marvin
had a rough night.

174
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:49,508
Marvin has been robbing people
for the last two months.

175
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:51,798
So whatever he got, he deserved.

176
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,348
Sounds like he "got" the woman

177
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,758
who put my agent
in the hospital,

178
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,718
but I'm guessing
you already know that.

179
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:58,508
I thought we agreed
to share information.

180
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,798
We didn't, actually,
but feel free to start

181
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,638
by telling me where you,
uh, took the survivors.

182
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,798
I can't.

183
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,298
Right. Good talk.

184
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,888
She's looking for something,

185
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:12,428
and I don't think she's leaving
until she finds it.

186
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:16,508
She's a danger to your
town, that's what you said.

187
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,428
Or maybe she just came here
for a better life.

188
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:22,388
Sheriff.

189
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:26,048
I need to show you something.

190
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,508
Apex.
They took over the government.

191
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,678
They took over every government.

192
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:35,718
They wanted to wipe us out,
so they created a virus...

193
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,638
Mantle's Disease.

194
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:43,718
It killed everything
it touched. Whole cities.

195
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:45,548
Tens of millions of people.

196
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:48,088
If you knew
someone who was infected,

197
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,138
- you had to leave them.
- You had to run.

198
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:54,218
Apex wasn't affected
'cause they engineered it

199
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:55,928
so they would be immune.

200
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,508
They could walk
into any infected area

201
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:00,468
and just take out
the resistance.

202
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:03,138
They wanted this planet
for themselves.

203
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,928
And now they have it.

204
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:10,548
Do you believe this?

205
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,388
"Believe" is a strong word.

206
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,218
But I'm a lot closer than I was.

207
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,388
Look, can we just work together?

208
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,218
Yeah.

209
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,508
She's headed your way.

210
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,678
- I'm on her.

211
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,588
You need to reconsider.

212
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,718
Harboring a Common is a crime,
and rightly so.

213
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,638
Look at her.

214
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,798
Is she that different from us?

215
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,928
The state paired
us to provide one another

216
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,638
with counsel
and emotional support.

217
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,718
Now I am counseling you now...
you cannot keep her.

218
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,428
She will be discovered.
If that happens...

219
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,798
No one needs to know.

220
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,548
Why are you doing this?

221
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,848
I have love for her.

222
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:39,928
We could petition the department

223
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,218
for a procreation waiver
and get...

224
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,928
I'm not giving her up.

225
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:18,138
I want us doing everything
in our power to locate this woman.

226
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,298
We are. We have
undercover agents in town,

227
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:21,678
we're monitoring police bands,

228
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,258
and I had a productive
conversation with the Sheriff.

229
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,048
I don't want him involved.

230
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,218
He's involved
whether we like it or not.

231
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,178
It's to our advantage
to make him an asset.

232
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:31,758
What are you worried about?

233
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:34,088
I'm worried about the prospect
of us having to explain

234
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,798
how we lost
a potential terrorist.

235
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,508
Terrorist.

236
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,798
So you don't believe
in the Apex thing?

237
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,718
What do you think?

238
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:44,758
Then why are we DNA testing
the whole camp?

239
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,678
Genealogy. We need to establish
where these people are from

240
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,718
before figuring out
where they can go.

241
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:52,678
And what about the survivor
I sent you... Thomas?

242
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,968
Has he said anything more
about the earlier migration?

243
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,388
Nothing credible.

244
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,798
His story fell apart
in about 60 seconds.

245
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,678
So I should expect him
back soon?

246
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,888
No. I need a little more time
with him.

247
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:09,178
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

248
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,258
I wish I could.

249
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:15,928
So everything we did
to change the future,

250
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:18,638
everything we sacrificed...
it was for nothing?

251
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,548
Honestly, all that's
beyond my scope right now.

252
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,388
I've got more immediate
concerns.

253
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:25,298
Why even bother?
We all need to disappear.

254
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,348
That's Eve's decision.

255
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,638
Well, have you heard from her?

256
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:29,678
She lands in two hours.

257
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,468
How many people survived?
I heard 40.

258
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,428
47.

259
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:37,388
It gets worse.
An Apex got through.

260
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:40,928
Where is it?

261
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,178
My team's working on it.

262
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:43,548
I'll have details soon.

263
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,758
No games. No torture.
You're just gonna kill it.

264
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,218
No.

265
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:50,548
There will be torture.

266
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:53,088
There absolutely
will be torture.

267
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:55,718
Get me a location.

268
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,468
- Hey, Jude.
- Martin.

269
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:15,138
I saw your press conference
yesterday.

270
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,178
What is going on up there?

271
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,218
Yeah, I don't know yet.
Uh, look.

272
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,468
I know it's been a while,
but I need some legal advice.

273
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,138
Okay.

274
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,258
Look, I-I'm dealing
with this woman

275
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,138
from, uh... out of state.

276
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:29,678
S-She just wants to get back
with her daughter.

277
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,928
She may or may not have
a criminal background.

278
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,178
I-I can't say for sure.

279
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:37,848
My question is, I-if I...
if I reunite them,

280
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:41,848
am I on the hook for anything
she might do once I bow out?

281
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,138
Stop, stop, stop.

282
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,848
Not another word.

283
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,048
Look, Jude. Did...

284
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:52,138
Didn't you learn anything
from the Doucette case?

285
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:54,348
Yes, of course I did.

286
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,048
Look, I'm not...
I'm not testifying

287
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,428
against anyone here, okay?

288
00:16:58,428 --> 00:16:59,928
She's got a kid.

289
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,968
And so do you!

290
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:05,048
Whatever the hell
you're doing, just remember...

291
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:07,008
put your family first this time.

292
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:17,258
Oh, come on, Marshall.

293
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,678
What'd you do now?

294
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:21,468
Allegedly I hit a guy.
I don't know.

295
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,798
What do you mean,
you don't know?

296
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:23,968
I wasn't there.

297
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,548
You weren't there?

298
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,718
I need to borrow you
for a minute.

299
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:28,678
Welcome back, Marshall.

300
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,428
Sheriff.

301
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,088
Shut the door.

302
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:36,718
Okay, here's the deal...

303
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:38,548
Before you say anything...

304
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:41,258
I followed that...
that Agent Ren

305
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,678
like you asked me to.
And, um...

306
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,348
I stayed with her

307
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,088
'til she turned on that road
right there...

308
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:49,388
that service road.

309
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:54,088
Now, I couldn't hold the tail
because there was another Fed

310
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,388
that was parked
over that ridge right there,

311
00:17:56,388 --> 00:18:00,428
but she was headed
straight for...

312
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,048
this.

313
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,258
- What is that?
- Camp Tamanowas.

314
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,678
I may or may not have
lost my virginity there.

315
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:08,928
Summer camp?

316
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,848
Yeah. Now, they shut it down
about ten years ago,

317
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,348
but there's room for 50 people
there, easy.

318
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:15,718
I'm telling you, I t-think

319
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,718
this is where
they took the survivors.

320
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,798
What are you doing?

321
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:26,218
It's none of our business.

322
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,048
I thought you wanted to know
where they were.

323
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:30,678
I don't. Not anymore.

324
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,718
Close the door on your way out.

325
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,848
How long has she had the rash?

326
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,888
12 hours. Maybe less?
But there's no fever.

327
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,758
That's when it gets bad, right?
When there's a fever?

328
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,968
That's right.

329
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,928
Can you help her?

330
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,258
Why are you trying to save
a Common?

331
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,588
I believe the price includes
no questions asked.

332
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,048
The Mantle's is in her blood.

333
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,928
I can't get it out, but maybe
I can help her body fight it.

334
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:38,138
If I use your blood,
your immunology...

335
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,798
maybe there's a chance.

336
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,138
Hey, baby girl.
It's gonna be okay.

337
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:48,048
Just hold on, okay?

338
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:49,928
It's gonna be okay.

339
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,588
What now?

340
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:13,718
I think I'm looking
at your Chevelle.

341
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,138
That's impossible.
The engine's dismantled.

342
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,218
Well, it looks just like it.

343
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,928
Wait. What was
the plate number?

344
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,968
Driver of the car,
exit the vehicle.

345
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:07,562
Dispatch, this is Bat-2-1.

346
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:10,232
I got a runner heading north
on Pinehurst. I'm in pursuit.

347
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:01,732
Hey.

348
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,352
I'd offer to help you unpack,

349
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:04,772
but this looks like
a one-person job.

350
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,232
I guess you weren't able to
bring anything from home.

351
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:12,562
Piece of jewelry.
This locket.

352
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,642
I-I lost it in the ocean.

353
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,142
Oh.

354
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,682
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

355
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,432
Hey, welcome back.

356
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:33,892
What'd you learn in town?

357
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:35,472
Don't mug an Apex.

358
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:38,932
How we doing with the DNA tests?

359
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,682
Uh, good.
Just got one to go.

360
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:44,312
She was sleeping all day.
Didn't want to wake her.

361
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:02,732
She hasn't eaten since
we arrived.

362
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:04,312
She doesn't want to do anything.

363
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:06,312
I'm worried about her.

364
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:10,272
Rebecca, she's not yours
to worry about.

365
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:12,812
We don't know
what's gonna happen here.

366
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:17,392
She just reminds me so much...

367
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:19,312
I know.

368
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:24,972
Excuse me.

369
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:28,312
Could we, uh... could you bring
Leah to the office?

370
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:39,682
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:41,602
I put her in the garage
for prints.

372
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:44,182
There's not a scratch on her.
Keys were left in the column.

373
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:46,272
Did you see which way she went?

374
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:47,352
No.

375
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,312
Alright. Thanks.

376
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,772
Emma Ren.

377
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:06,022
Hello?

378
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,812
Put him in the tank, Nestor.

379
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,312
- I got my eye on him.
- Do it now.

380
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:27,972
You were supposed to
wait for me.

381
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:29,062
I needed some things.

382
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:33,772
You stole my car.

383
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,432
I fixed your car.

384
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,892
Besides, I was
gonna give it back.

385
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,102
What's in the bag?

386
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:40,732
Supplies.

387
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,432
Give it to me.

388
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:52,732
Come on.

389
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,562
Did you find out
where they took Leah?

390
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,312
Really?

391
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:03,972
It's for protection.

392
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:06,102
Once I get her back,
I can't take any chances.

393
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,102
Do you know where she is or not?

394
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:10,522
I do.

395
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:12,272
But I'm not going to
take you to her

396
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:14,812
unless I know you've been
straight with me

397
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:16,682
about who you are
and why you're here.

398
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:22,062
I'm here because
I made a promise to Leah.

399
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:30,312
Good job.

400
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:31,602
You get a prize for that.

401
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:32,682
A prize?

402
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:34,182
Mm-hmm.

403
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:36,732
When I was a kid,
my mom took me to a doctor

404
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,522
who had a whole chest of candy.

405
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,102
After every visit,
I got to pick one piece.

406
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:44,732
And two if I had to get a shot.

407
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,272
Gummies!

408
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,062
Uh-huh.

409
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:56,352
Is there something wrong
with your arm?

410
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,232
No. It's fine.

411
00:25:58,232 --> 00:25:59,812
Let me see.

412
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:02,312
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.

413
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:08,682
Oh, my gosh.

414
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,232
What is it?

415
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:13,892
Rebecca?

416
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:17,972
What is it?

417
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:20,182
This is Mantle's disease.

418
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,892
Over there.

419
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:36,972
Let's get her inside.
Clear the infirmary.

420
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,732
She needs to be isolated.
Contact Lindauer.

421
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:39,932
Tell him we need the CDC.

422
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,142
How much longer?

423
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:46,312
Only five more miles.

424
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:58,682
Do you think she'll like it?

425
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,732
I don't know.
She like pigs?

426
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,472
I don't think she's seen many.

427
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:08,102
Well, those are all the rage,
so I'm sure she'll love it.

428
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:16,852
The Commons have made
rapid progress

429
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,732
on the device that
can bend time... allegedly.

430
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,022
- Time travel?
- Correct.

431
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:23,062
This rumor has floated
around before,

432
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:24,932
but my informant
swears that it's real.

433
00:27:24,932 --> 00:27:27,182
I should have more intel
tomorrow.

434
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:29,812
Excellent work, Agent Reece.

435
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:32,312
- Will that be all?
- Not quite.

436
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:34,892
A matter has come
to our attention

437
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:37,642
involving a severe breach
in regulation.

438
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:39,952
Is there anything
that you'd like to confess?

439
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:46,732
I have always been and remain
loyal to the state.

440
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,602
We've had every reason
to believe so...

441
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,352
until today.

442
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:02,682
I told you it was
a matter of time.

443
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,932
At least now the secret is out.

444
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,472
Let them take the child,
put it out of its misery,

445
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:08,812
and we can move past this.

446
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,392
Please.
Let me explain.

447
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,022
Agent Reece,

448
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:18,022
the act of harboring
an undocumented Common child

449
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:19,392
is tantamount to treason.

450
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:21,472
Violation of state code
is punishable

451
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:23,272
by immediate transfer to
reeducation facilities.

452
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:25,772
Do you comply?

453
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,472
Yes or no.

454
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,562
I comply.

455
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:43,972
Then I hereby sentence you
to immediate...

456
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,432
Aaaah!

457
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:54,022
Why would you...

458
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,272
I had... I had no choice.

459
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,432
You had a choice.

460
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:09,272
Please don't do this.

461
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:11,472
They will find you.

462
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:13,312
You know they will.

463
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:27,892
This is it.

464
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,472
They're keeping them here?

465
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,312
No, this place is empty.

466
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:36,682
I asked that Leah
be brought here.

467
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:39,812
Neutral ground.
No other police, okay?

468
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,312
You look nervous.

469
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:00,602
Just feel a bit exposed
out here.

470
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:02,602
Maybe we should wait inside.

471
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,352
Give me a weapon.

472
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,602
You don't need a weapon.
You are a weapon.

473
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:10,852
Fine.

474
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,062
Yeah.

475
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:28,732
Used to build all kinds
of sailing ships

476
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:30,182
in here in the 1800s.

477
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:33,472
During Prohibition
it was mostly rumrunners.

478
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,142
Keep telling the Mayor

479
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:38,392
that she ought to turn it
into a museum, but...

480
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:43,392
I just feel like some history
should be preserved.

481
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,432
Yeah. Watch your step.

482
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,812
Yeah.

483
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:53,102
Oh, all the way through here.

484
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:56,562
And we can see them coming.
No surprises.

485
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:03,732
Listen to me!

486
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:04,772
Ahh!

487
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,602
I don't want to hurt you.

488
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,432
I want to believe
you're telling the truth

489
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:11,932
and that you're only here
for Leah.

490
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,972
But you left out
some of the more...

491
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:17,602
colorful genocidal admissions
from your story.

492
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:19,022
I have to weigh that!

493
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,142
Get me out of here!

494
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:22,972
You're wasting bullets.

495
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:24,472
Door's eight inches of...

496
00:31:25,472 --> 00:31:27,432
Hard Maple.

497
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,562
I trusted you.

498
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,892
You told me
about Mantle's Disease.

499
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,852
But you left out the part

500
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:46,392
that Apex, your people,
created it.

501
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:48,272
I had nothing to do with it.

502
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:54,102
I'm sorry.

503
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:56,602
But we're gonna
have to do this my way.

504
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:00,312
You're gonna suffer for this.

505
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:08,732
Sheriff?

506
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:10,772
I've got her.
The Apex, Reece.

507
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:14,772
What?

508
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,562
I don't know much longer
I can hold her,

509
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:17,392
so you need to get here.

510
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:19,272
Only you.

511
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,022
I've secured her in a location
about 25 miles from you...

512
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,852
Camp Tamanowas,
if I'm not mistaken.

513
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:28,062
Yeah, that's right.
I know where they are.

514
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:30,472
The three of us, we're gonna
talk about this

515
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:33,892
on neutral ground because I, for
one, am losing my objectivity.

516
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,102
How do I know I can trust you?

517
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:37,472
I know where they are,
so you do something stupid,

518
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:40,272
I go public.
We clear?

519
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:43,232
Send me the location.

520
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:45,602
Okay.

521
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:03,352
Mom, why do we have to go?

522
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:06,772
You always said it's not safe
for me to be outside.

523
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:09,472
I know I did.
But things change.

524
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:12,392
I found a place
that's better for us.

525
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,272
Safer.

526
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,602
Where you don't
have to hide anymore.

527
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:19,312
There's gonna be kids
that are just like you.

528
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:21,772
And the best part?
We get to be together.

529
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:23,312
Is it far?

530
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:24,772
It's very far.

531
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:26,522
But it won't take long
to get there.

532
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:28,022
What's it called?

533
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,852
It's called the Long Peace.

534
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,142
And doesn't that sound nice?

535
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,522
You know you mean
everything to me.

536
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,352
I love you so much, baby girl.

537
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:46,352
You're everything to me, too.

538
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:59,102
Nice work, agent.
Keep me apprised.

539
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,932
We've got a location
on the Apex.

540
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,642
Alright.

541
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,432
What?

542
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:41,732
No.

543
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:44,472
No!

544
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,392
No!

545
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:57,022
Oh!

546
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,352
- Ahh!

547
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:58,894
It was hard to run
with a child.

548
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:01,264
And we knew they would come
for us eventually.

549
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:02,974
They did.

550
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:05,184
Apex spared children sometimes.

551
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:08,934
Children who excelled in
certain fields of study.

552
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,344
No one knew
what they were used for.

553
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:14,184
Labor. Experiments.

554
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:18,224
Our daughter... they took
her while we slept.

555
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:22,844
I don't sleep much anymore.

556
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,474
It was my husband's idea
to come here.

557
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:27,844
We heard that someone
had discovered something...

558
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,844
a way to bend time.

559
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,304
This is incredible.

560
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:34,934
And there's hours more.

561
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:37,394
I mean, this is...

562
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:39,394
And they're all saying
the same thing.

563
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:41,934
Essentially.
It's almost like it's scripted.

564
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,394
So, what, you think
it's some kind of hoax?

565
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:47,014
A hoax would suggest
it's harmless.

566
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,894
You think they're dangerous.

567
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,474
I think it's possible.

568
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,724
Well, if that's the case,
we should loop in Harris.

569
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,344
Bureau's gonna want to see this.

570
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:57,934
John, I think that's premature.

571
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:02,144
You're already overseeing
50,000 asylum-seekers

572
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,804
in a hundred detention camps
across the U.S.

573
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,264
Let me take this off your plate.

574
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:07,844
That's a lot of responsibility.

575
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:10,724
It's 47 people.
It's a drop in the bucket.

576
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:13,224
Let's keep it off the books,
no outside interference.

577
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,514
Give me this,
and I'll get you the truth.

578
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:20,104
Fine.

579
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:21,724
The camp's yours.

580
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,264
It's done.

581
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:41,224
The refugees are secured.

582
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:44,394
I'll put together a plan on what
to do with them in the future.

583
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,514
There is no future for them.

584
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,344
No one can ever know
they're here.

585
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,554
Ever.
There's too much at stake.

586
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:38,724
Yeah?
- Jude, I've been trying

587
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,844
to reach you all night.
Are you okay?

588
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:43,054
Are you serious?
No, I'm not okay, Emma.

589
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:44,514
I trusted you.

590
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:48,184
We had a deal, and then SEAL
Team Six drops out of the sky.

591
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:50,304
Before you know it,
I'm being gassed,

592
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,514
and I wake up 20 miles away
in my car.

593
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:54,934
What happened at the shipyard,
that was not my call.

594
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,474
What happened to Reece?
The suspect.

595
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:01,344
By the time I arrived,
the site was locked off.

596
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:04,844
I was told she resisted arrest.

597
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:07,554
The strike team
had to employ lethal force.

598
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:11,144
Jude, I really need
to talk to you.

599
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:13,764
I'm done talking.
My kid's coming today,

600
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:17,184
and I'm gonna be as far away
from you as possible, okay?

601
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:31,644
Hey, little man!
- Daddy!

602
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:34,104
Hey!
Ohh, I missed you.

603
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:37,804
I like your house.

604
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,844
Yeah? Your mom tell you
to say that?

605
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:16,554
Uh, excuse me.

606
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,804
How far to Port Canaan?

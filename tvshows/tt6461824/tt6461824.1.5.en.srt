1
00:00:00,803 --> 00:00:02,709
<i>Previously on "The Crossing"...</i>

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:04,811
Here's a quick primer...
all these people here

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,833
are from the future,

4
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:07,592
and Emma's boss sucks.

5
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,045
I told you, I didn't want him involved.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,233
<i>Do your job.</i>

7
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:11,692
I think it's happened before.

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,208
There was an earlier migration.

9
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,267
How long have you been here?

10
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:15,643
Longer than you think.

11
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:17,845
Apex... they took over the government.

12
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,713
They can do things we can't.

13
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,717
Your daughter...
She has Mantle's Disease.

14
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,252
Let me help you create the treatment,

15
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:26,187
and then I can take it back.

16
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,988
I'll come by the station
tomorrow morning.

17
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:30,591
<i>We'll talk then?</i>

18
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:38,566
Mine's the only number stored on it.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,401
She opens it up, she calls,

20
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:42,336
and we figure out what's
really going on up there.

21
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:44,839
Hannah?

22
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:46,040
Who is this?

23
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,047
<i>Having swept
the primaries in Ohio, Texas,</i>

24
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,016
<i>Rhode Island, and Vermont,
John McCain has officially...</i>

25
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,418
<i>This is a tragedy...</i>

26
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:59,019
<i>♪ They call me "hell" ♪</i>

27
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:00,754
<i>♪ They call me "Stacey" ♪</i>

28
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,729
<i>♪ They call me "her" ♪</i>

29
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:04,276
Is it something you eat?

30
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:06,434
<i>♪ That's not my name ♪
♪ That's not my name ♪</i>

31
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:07,624
- Yes.
<i>- ♪ That's not my name ♪</i>

32
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,601
Is it these overpriced leftovers
I'm going to throw away?

33
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,859
- No.
- <i>♪ They call me "quiet" ♪</i>

34
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:13,143
Is it the fish we caught last week?

35
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,869
Hey. No helping.

36
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:17,137
Is it the fish you caught last week?

37
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:20,608
<i>- ♪ That's not my name ♪</i>
- Yes. Cheaters.

38
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,276
<i>♪ That's not my name ♪</i>

39

40
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,387
Dad!

41
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:07,788
What'd you do now?

42
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,157
Nothing. I just need to talk to you.

43
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,759
Can I talk to you?

44
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,828
Yeah. Okay. Talk. You got five minutes.

45
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:17,364
I remember people in the road.

46
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,532
The night of the accident.

47
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,868
Look, I know I always said
the whole thing was a blank

48
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:23,504
and I didn't see anything
or anyone, but...

49
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,306
I remember it now.

50
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,041
There were people in the road.

51
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,810
They came out of nowhere.
That's why my dad swerved.

52
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:31,812
Th-That's why we crashed.

53
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:34,481
I was the first one on the scene.

54
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:38,319
We searched that whole area,
and we saw no sign of anyone.

55
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:41,655
I'm telling you, they were out there.

56
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,691
You father's been telling
that story for years.

57
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:46,694
Every bartender in town
knows it by heart.

58
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,395
It's no wonder it's playing
tricks with your mind, you know?

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,396
I know what I saw.

60
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,798
10 years after the fact,

61
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,700
it just hits you
like a bolt of lightning?

62
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:53,734
How do you explain that?

63
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:54,969
I don't know.

64
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:59,807
He had too much to drink with dinner.

65
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,409
He did not mean to hurt anyone,
but he did.

66
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,711
It was an accident, Marshall.

67
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,383
Marshall.

68
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,720
Marshall?

69
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,657
Marshall? Are you okay?

70
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,731
Lisa?

71
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,834
Lisa? No.

72
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:30,938
Ohh. Oh, God. No.

73
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:32,072
- Lisa?
- Mom!

74
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:34,775
No. No, God.

75
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,077
We should do something.

76
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:39,713
There's nothing to be done.

77
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:40,881
Oh, God!

78
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:42,082
Oh.

79
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,060
_

80
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:53,227
You okay?

81
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,428
Yeah, I think so.

82
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,266
Is this it? Did we make it?

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,403
The sticker on the car said 2008.

84
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:03,404
Close enough.

85
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,607
We have to go. Hurry up.

86
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,977
- Help!
- The people in the car.

87
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,645
No one can know we're here.

88
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:17,618
Help!

89
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:32,767

90
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:40,074
Did you get it?

91
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,442
Okay, I want you to call again.

92
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,543
I called 10 minutes ago.

93
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,978
If anything changes,
they'll contact me immediately.

94
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,313
Let's just focus on
making the treatment.

95
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,247
Yeah, well, we should have
been done by now

96
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,516
instead of wasting time
looking for a lab.

97
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,784
If I'd known I was gonna be a hostage

98
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,819
when I left for work yesterday morning,

99
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:52,911
I would have made better plans.

100
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,822
You're not a hostage.
You offered to help.

101
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:57,803
Really? So I can just walk away?

102
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,926
Didn't think so.

103
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,835
<i>You've reached Emma Ren.
Please leave a message.</i>

104
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,271
Hi. This is Jude. I'm at the office.

105
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,508
Just making sure you're still coming by.

106
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,144
Yeah?

107
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,812
Hey. Did you have fun with Oliver?

108
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,848
Yeah.

109
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,649
No drama getting him back?

110
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:23,784
What?

111
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:26,987
With the ex. Sometimes it's more
like a hostage exchange.

112
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,122
Oh.

113
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,624
No. Amy and I are... on good terms.

114
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:31,959
Good.

115
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:33,327
It's all very cordial.

116
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,863
Well, that sounds... healthy.

117
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,065
While you were fishing, I, uh,

118
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,701
followed up on the individual
who showed up at Harborfest.

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,236
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,670
The dead guy.

121
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,172
Yeah, I see that.

122
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:47,808
Didn't have any luck ID'ing him,
so case is still open.

123
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:48,909
All right. I'll take it from here.

124
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:53,080
Great. And, uh, oh, uh,
there's a Fed here to see you.

125
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:54,148
Agent Ren?

126
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,984
No. Agent Foster. I put him
in the conference room.

127
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,258
Hi. Agent Foster?

128
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:07,895
Sheriff. I think we met
at the Thorn Beach operation?

129
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:09,910
Right.

130
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:10,964
What can I do for you?

131
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,599
Well, I understand you've been, uh...

132
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:15,169
consulting with Agent Ren
about that situation.

133
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,104
That situation?

134
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:18,872
Oh, you mean the fact
that you're running

135
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,875
that top-secret detainment camp
up in the mountains?

136
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,410
Yeah.

137
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,946
I was wondering if you'd seen
or spoken with Agent Ren

138
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,115
in the past 24 hours.

139
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,449
No. Why?

140
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:30,851
Well, no one's been able
to make contact with her

141
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,619
since last night.

142
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:34,922
And you're coming to me with this?

143
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,957
Yeah, well, I'm sure it's nothing.

144
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:38,692
- What?
- Sorry to have taken up your time.

145
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,794
Yeah. If I hear from her,
I'll let you know.

146
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:41,895
Yeah. I appreciate that.

147
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,030
Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,711
I get it. You're angry.
I didn't have a choice.

149
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,779
The hell you didn't.

150
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:01,081
Agent Ren blindsided me.

151
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,251
She knew who I was.
She knew where we were from.

152
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:05,703
So, you tell her a story.

153
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:06,954
You don't put a bullet in her chest.

154
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,589
I did tell her a story.

155
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,324
My husband is unstable.
He joined a cult.

156
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,992
He broke my heart. She wasn't buying it.

157
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,927
She was a federal agent, Eve.

158
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,965
You should have told me
Paul was with them.

159
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,902
Had I known he was your husband,
I would have.

160
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:23,503
Is he all right?

161
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:25,105
He's fine.

162
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,441
And I will make sure he stays that way.

163
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,481
I never told him anything
before we left.

164
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,083
I never suggested otherwise.

165
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,193
Is this it?

166
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,095
Everyone who could make it here
on short notice.

167
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,099
Well, it's good to see everyone.

168
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

169
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,102
What the hell happened?

170
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:56,603
No one else was supposed
to come through.

171
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,005
The access was gonna be destroyed.

172
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,139
Apparently, it wasn't.

173
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,774
It doesn't matter how they got here.

174
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:03,777
The fact that they're here
at all means we've failed.

175
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,112
We didn't change the timeline.

176
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,653
You're all looking at this as a failure?

177
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:13,987
I see an opportunity.

178
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:21,395
Now, we know... Our plan
to stop Apex didn't work.

179
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:24,498
It's time to think bigger.

180
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,166
Much bigger.

181
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:33,203
_

182
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:37,385
Mr. Lindauer, what a pleasure.

183
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,660
Oh, thank you, Senator.

184
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,504
If it weren't for you,
my entire staff and I

185
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,924
would be buried alive in the
rubble of the Finley building.

186
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,734
I'm just an analyst, sir.
It was a team effort.

187
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,649
You stopped the attack
before it happened.

188
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:49,951
I dabbled in predictive analysis.

189
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:52,587
Uh, this time, it paid off.

190
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,990
Well, would you accept a promotion

191
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,826
more graciously
than you accept a compliment?

192
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,894
A-Absolutely, sir.

193
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,664
Then I'll make some calls.

194
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:12,774
You look pleased with yourself.
Homeland position come through?

195
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:15,510
The trick is not to appear too eager.

196
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,145
Stay humble, do the work...

197
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,481
And having a crystal ball helps,
though, doesn't it?

198
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:22,417
Or at least a few shards of one,
to have an advantage.

199
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,921
You hear from Jake?

200
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:29,624
He's still analyzing data,
running simulations.

201
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,426
Once we're all embedded,
he'll lay out the plan.

202
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,094
What are you doing in D.C.?

203
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:35,664
Tech conference.

204
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:38,133
At least your job has some nobility.

205
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:41,436
Being a venture capitalist, in
my mind, isn't exactly heroic.

206
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,837
It's eyes and ears and influence.

207
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:46,508
And money. That's how
this is gonna work.

208
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,942
After everything we've seen,

209
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:50,812
making people rich seems a little...

210
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:53,281
frivolous...

211
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,717
like a betrayal of all
the people we left behind.

212
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,387
Well, you're, uh,
adjusting to life, aren't you?

213
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,556
New husband, new baby...

214
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,826
Not so new. Aaron's already walking.

215
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,528
And they don't feel like a betrayal,

216
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,130
if that's what you're suggesting.

217
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:11,566
They remind me of what I'm doing here

218
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,702
and of the monsters
that we have to stop.

219
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,640
Uh, Agent Ren has
an open-ended reservation.

220
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:20,809
She seems like a really nice woman.

221
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,110
You know, ever since Harborfest,

222
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:25,380
my son can't wait to be
one of your <i>real</i> deputies.

223
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,583
He slept with that badge
pinned to his PJs last night.

224
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,685
And he handcuffed me to the
breakfast table this morning.

225
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:32,821
This is it, here.

226
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,661
Emma?

227
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:51,373
Hello?

228
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,090
I wonder if she was having problems

229
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,625
with the Internet in the room.

230
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,693
Why?

231
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:15,530
Oh, I-I saw her using
the desktop in the lobby.

232
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:17,699
She was using a public computer?

233
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah. You can...

234
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:22,637
You can check your room status,
pool hours, room-service menu.

235
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,740
You can surf the Internet,
too, but it's slow.

236
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,442
Not too many people
use it anymore, actually...

237
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:29,744
not since smartphones.

238
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,782
Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna need
to borrow that computer.

239
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,890
So, what happened?

240
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:43,324
What?

241
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,093
The phone. The girl.

242
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,828
Did she get it? Did she call?

243
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:47,562
Nope.

244
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:48,696
Should have used a slingshot.

245
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:51,332
A stupid hawk probably cracked
the SIM card or something.

246
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,936
No, the phone worked.
It just didn't get to Hannah.

247
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,739
When it finally rang, there was
some guy on the other end.

248
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,408
Who was I? How did I know Hannah?

249
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:01,776
Why did I send the phone?

250
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,844
Was it a guard?

251
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:04,913
I don't think so.
He wouldn't give me his name.

252
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:08,583
W-Wait. You didn't give him
your name, did you?

253
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:09,617
No.

254
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,587
All right, I might have.

255
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:14,856
But... But it was a stupid idea
in the first place.

256
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,792
Hey, Gerry.

257
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:21,629
I was hoping to buy you a cup of coffee.

258
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,801
We'll talk about the thing later.

259
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,303
Don't answer it again.

260
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,884
What are you doing here, Dad?

261
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,686
Nestor called.

262
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,854
What, about your warrants?

263
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:48,957
About you. About the trouble
you're getting yourself into.

264
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,792
He's worried about you. So am I.

265
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,293
You're too smart to be
hanging around this town

266
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,662
with no job and no future.

267
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:55,697
What are you still doing here?

268
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,198
I don't know.

269
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,672
It's not much, but it's enough
to get you started.

270
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:09,377
Get out of Port Canaan
and put your life back on track.

271
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:12,647
Did Nestor say anything else?

272
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:15,517
He said you were confused
about the accident.

273
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,186
Not confused.

274
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,889
I remembered something.

275
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:24,526
There were people in the road,
just like you said.

276
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,362
What does it matter?
Your mother is gone either way.

277
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,063
You were telling the truth.

278
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,734
I was drunk. I was driving too fast.

279
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,270
I killed my wife.

280
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:36,704
I could have killed you.

281
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,940
It wasn't your fault.

282
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:40,542
I've spent the last 10 years

283
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:43,511
trying to justify
what happened that night.

284
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,915
I used it as an excuse
to destroy anything good

285
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,416
left in my life.

286
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,886
Don't make the same stupid mistake,

287
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,756
or you'll end up like me...

288
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,090
someone you hate.

289
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,628
Let it go.

290
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,705
You're sure about this?

291
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:14,609
My bone marrow has the highest
concentration of antibodies.

292
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:16,210
How often do you treat her?

293
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:18,746
Every couple years.

294
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:21,883
It's never reoccurred this fast.

295
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,818
I've been to a half-dozen
hot zones on the planet,

296
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:26,154
and I've never seen anything
this aggressive.

297
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:30,725
I'm guessing the mortality rate
is 90%, maybe higher.

298
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,595
Your immunity is remarkable.

299
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,730
I guess I'm just lucky.

300
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:38,466
From what I understand, it's not luck.

301
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,801
It's a function of genetic upgrades

302
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:43,304
specific to a certain people...

303
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,672
Apex?

304
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:53,815
Are you immune to all viruses,
or is it ju...

305
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,950
Wait. Wait. Let me
give you the anesthetic.

306
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,196
So, you don't feel pain?

307
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,430
I feel it.

308
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,942
I admire your tolerance.

309
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,980
I guess it would be a bad idea
to completely eradicate

310
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,949
any capacity to feel pain...

311
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:30,718
I am not here to satisfy your curiosity.

312
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:31,819
I'm here to save my daughter.

313
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:32,920
And once we have done that,

314
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:35,023
you will forget everything
that you know about me.

315
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:36,858
Do you understand?

316
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:41,718
_

317
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,541
Sorry I'm late. Family emergency.

318
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:52,338
Uh, okay. Uh, this took
a little longer than expected.

319
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,350
I needed the information set
as accurate as possible,

320
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:57,380
and let's just say a lot of stuff

321
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,006
didn't make it into the history logs.

322
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,137
But with the intel that
you've all provided,

323
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,606
we can now move forward with our plan.

324
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,108
But this model I have formulated,

325
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,946
it is a work of art... guaranteed.

326
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,450
There are 27 names on our list.

327
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:17,587
Each target is a direct conduit
to the invention,

328
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:21,924
advancement, or rise of Apex.

329
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,160
<i>We all value human life.</i>

330
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,728
<i>None of us are monsters.</i>

331
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:26,877
<i>But you must remember,</i>

332
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,962
<i>these individuals are not innocent.</i>

333
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,249
<i>Each of them is, in some way,</i>

334
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:33,970
<i>responsible for the rise of Apex.</i>

335
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:36,339
<i>Each of them is somehow responsible</i>

336
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:39,242
<i>for the destruction of the human race.</i>

337
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:44,647
<i>We are executing 27 individuals
to save billions of lives.</i>

338
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:45,848
<i>200 years from now,</i>

339
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:49,085
<i>Apex has nearly wiped us
from the face of the Earth.</i>

340
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,187
<i>We can't let that happen.</i>

341
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,624
<i>We must stop Apex from ever existing.</i>

342
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,692
<i>Do not let your resolve waver.</i>

343
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,095
<i>Do not let fear consume you.</i>

344
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,298
<i>The survival of the human race
depends on us.</i>

345
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:05,835
<i>Failure is not an option.
Failure is death.</i>

346
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,671
<i>This mission is everything.
Never forget that.</i>

347
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:12,441
There was nothing on the drive,

348
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,010
so I checked the browser history.

349
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:15,444
- Yeah.
- Mostly tourist stuff...

350
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,513
restaurant reviews, boat rentals.

351
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:20,316
But I also found daily hits
on a public file-storage site.

352
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,184
Those sites are very easy to hack.

353
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:24,687
I'm not sure Agent Ren
was trying to keep this hidden,

354
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,655
to be honest.

355
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,391
Wait, like, she wanted
someone to find it?

356
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:31,227
She didn't <i>not</i> want someone to find it.

357
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,896
One folder is full of research
about Port Canaan.

358
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,065
Online newspaper articles,
police blotters,

359
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:40,836
weather reports, maps, and
mostly from around 10 years ago.

360
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:41,871
Well, that's...

361
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,205
very specific.

362
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,174
The other one is a series of memos...

363
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,076
personal observations and recollections.

364
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,078
Some of them contain
transcripts of interviews.

365
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:52,348
One is a profile of a Homeland
Security agent named Lindauer.

366
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,558
I'm gonna need you
to print this all out for me.

367
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,932
Sorry about that. Just got your message.

368
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,200
Come on in.

369
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:14,203
- Shut the door.
- Sure.

370
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:17,039
What's going on?

371
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:21,243
I don't really know,
to be honest with you.

372
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,179
You remember Agent Ren?

373
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:26,682
Yeah. The one running the Russian camp.

374
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:29,418
Yeah. Um...

375
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:32,788
she came by the other day,
asking for my help,

376
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:35,291
looking into something.

377
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,559
I'm getting a bad feeling

378
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,262
that something may have happened to her.

379
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,430
Okay. Based on...?

380
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:52,241
Those people at the camp
aren't from Russia.

381
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,780
And...

382
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,116
I didn't go fishing
with Oliver yesterday.

383
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,554
Sit down.

384
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,256
I need to tell you some things.

385
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:12,128
So, here's the deal.

386
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,441
Hey, how's the little girl
with the virus?

387
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:27,143
Hanging on by a thread.

388
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,445
Forbin is chasing down some
kind of experimental treatment,

389
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:33,182
but I don't think there's much
time left for a miracle.

390
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,117
I heard this one almost didn't
make it through the night.

391
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,185
It's amazing she survived at all,

392
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,187
considering the amount of
seawater she aspirated.

393
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,855
She should be at Portland General.

394
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,658
They have better facilities.

395
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,127
None of the refugees are allowed
to leave this camp.

396
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,829
Orders from the top.

397
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:57,273
- Here's an ice pack.
- How long is this gonna take?

398
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,486
4 minutes and 23 seconds.

399
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,149
I can take it.

400
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,154
Do you ever get hurt?

401
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,355
Of course.

402
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,025
You never have marks.

403
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,960
Well, everyone has marks.

404
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,962
It's just...

405
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:23,199
mine go away faster.

406
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:26,202
When I grow up, will I be like you?

407
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:28,337
No.

408
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,605
You're gonna be better.

409
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,678
How did she end up with you?

410
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,346
I know... no more questions.

411
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,151
It's just that she's not
your biological daughter.

412
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:45,755
I'm not judging.

413
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,857
My mom left me on the steps of a church

414
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,559
when I was 6 months old, so, you know,

415
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:53,295
biological connections
don't really mean much to me.

416
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:58,968
Her parents died.

417
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,872
She was so tiny.

418
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,343
I had never heard something
cry like that.

419
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:12,848
Our children, they don't cry like that.

420
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,216
So, I took her with me.

421
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:19,421
I wasn't supposed to have attachments.

422
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:25,027
But once she was with me,
I just couldn't give her up.

423
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,595
Even after I found out she was sick.

424
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,366
Were you a soldier?

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,967
Jude said something about...

426
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:34,403
being made to fight.

427
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:36,672
I have regrets, but saving Leah
isn't one of them.

428
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:43,612
This is Sophie.

429
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:47,082
<i>Dr. Forbin, Leah's condition
is deteriorating rapidly.</i>

430
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,385
<i>Her fever is 104.
Her breathing is labored</i>

431
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,153
<i>and we're seeing swelling in the brain.</i>

432
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:52,955
Give her another dose
of the broad spectrum.

433
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:54,690
I'll be there as soon as I can.

434
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,330
You told me she was stable.

435
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,632
You have been stalling this entire time.

436
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,402
What, she dies and
the pandemic dies with her?

437
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:08,470
No.

438
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:10,940
Are we surrounded?

439
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,508
Is this another trap?

440
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,010
No. It's not a trap. I swear.

441
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,712
We will get to her in time.

442
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,349
You came all this way.

443
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:23,185
She deserves the life you want for her.

444
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,530
No.

445
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:36,765
Sugar is not gonna make this
suddenly make sense.

446
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:43,372
Look, if, uh, you got any questions...

447
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:44,506
I got it.

448
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,946
Those refugees are not from Russia.

449
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,315
They're from the future.

450
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,951
200 years in the future.

451
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:58,854
And... And one of them is
a... like, a ninja mercenary

452
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:03,459
that they call Apex,
who kidnapped Oliver.

453
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,728
And Agent Ren, who a-apparently
has gone missing,

454
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:08,364
she believes that there were
other, uh, you know,

455
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:11,467
future people that came earlier...

456
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:14,336
10 years ago... to Port Canaan.

457
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:17,473
And that her boss, Mr., uh, Lindauer...?

458
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,407
Yeah.

459
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:21,143
...knew about it,
and he's covering it up.

460
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:22,211
Did I get all that?

461
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:23,078
Yeah, I'm playing catch-up here,

462
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,013
so let me know if I missed anything.

463
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:26,215
Look, it's not that I didn't trust you.

464
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:29,551
It's just... I wasn't sure
I believed it myself, okay?

465
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,521
And once I did, I... it...

466
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:39,028
I should've told you sooner.

467
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:43,432
I know this place is
small potatoes to you, Jude...

468
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,534
but I'm good at my job.

469
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:49,872
I notice things in... in a way
that other people don't.

470
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:50,906
I know.

471
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:55,244
Yeah.

472
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,881
So... she talked to
other people at the camp

473
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,317
who claim there were
other time travelers.

474
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,253
Yeah.

475
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,590
Paul and Thomas.

476
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,494
There'd have to be a machine.

477
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,099
Time travel.

478
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:22,071
I mean, you got to... you got to
get from where you are to...

479
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:23,572
to out in the water out there.

480
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,709
Yeah, but I don't think they meant
to end up in the water.

481
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,045
Right.

482
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:36,118
Which means that the first ones
could have ended up on land.

483
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:38,220
Yeah.

484
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:40,456
What do you think that looked like?

485
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,091
You think they just
appeared out of thin air?

486
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,761
Like they weren't there,
and then, suddenly, they were?

487
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:47,563
Maybe.

488
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,244
We need to talk to Marshall.

489
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:58,846
All right, everybody.

490
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:02,454
Here's to a job well done.
A future without Apex.

491
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:04,166
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

492
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,639
Are you sure we are done?

493
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,173
How do you know we did it well?

494
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,541
Because I say so.

495
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,535
We made a better future.

496
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:16,537
And now, I'm gonna spend
the rest of my present

497
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:19,707
eating real meat and playing cards.

498
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:31,652
I think I'm gonna stay on at Homeland.

499
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:33,654
It can't hurt to maintain
eyes and ears, right?

500
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:40,695
Beaumont took care of him.

501
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,663
Your target only had a few extra months.

502
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:45,666
It won't make a difference.

503
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,236
Live your life, Craig.

504
00:25:57,546 --> 00:26:00,014
_

505
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,483
_

506
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:19,013
Yeah?

507
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:20,401
<i>Sir, migrants have been found</i>

508
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:21,969
<i>in the water just off Port Canaan.</i>

509
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:23,537
In the water? How many?

510
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,743
Wait. They say they're from where?

511
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:38,419
That's it, folks. Place your bets.

512
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,322
We got a problem.

513
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:48,793
_

514
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:55,098
_

515
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:31,672
This is... where it happened?

516
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,007
I used to lie awake thinking of ways

517
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,843
I could go back and change that night...

518
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:39,780
anything not to be here, on this
road, at that exact moment.

519
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:43,717
Or maybe everything happens
no matter what.

520
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:45,052
Maybe fate is fate.

521
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:48,889
I hate that idea.

522
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:51,992
So... you know that sublet
I told you about?

523
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,094
I have to start driving tonight.

524
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:56,664
Apparently, she's got turtles...
sorry, tortoises...

525
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:58,799
and she needs me there right away.

526
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,801
I guess they like to
dig out of their cage

527
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:02,369
and wander off or something.

528
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:07,708
If you want to reject the idea of fate,

529
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,577
you'll come with me to Los Angeles.

530
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:12,313
Because never in a million years
were you really gonna do it.

531
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,747
I was thinking about it.

532
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:16,317
You were stringing me along.

533
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:18,119
I know that fake nod and smile.

534
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:28,162
Okay. Let's go.

535
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,163
Seriously?

536
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:31,832
What am I still doing
in this town, anyway?

537
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:40,608
Okay. I, uh... I have to pick up
a paycheck and finish packing,

538
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:42,910
but I can be ready in... an hour.

539
00:28:42,944 --> 00:28:43,711
Great.

540
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,049
See you in an hour.

541
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:50,084
Okay.

542
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:03,430
There's a medical-waste
receptacle under the sink.

543
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:06,700
Nothing stays behind. No record
of my organic material...

544
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:07,935
no record of me.

545
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:15,075
You're not authorized to be here.

546
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,111
That card doesn't belong to you.

547
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:20,147
Right. Right. It's Professor Spencer's.

548
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,649
It's fine. I'm a colleague.

549
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,918
I have reciprocal privileges
at this institution.

550
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:25,786
I just spoke to Professor Spencer,

551
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,221
and he said he hasn't granted anyone

552
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,757
the authority to use
his access code or lab.

553
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,293
Place the bag and the key card
on the counter and step back.

554
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,002
Reece, no!

555
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,612
There are cameras out here.

556
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:48,573
Walk slow and act like
nothing's happened.

557
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,962
But they'll be able to
trace back that I was here.

558
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:53,735
Fine. Tell them you were my hostage.
Just blame it on me.

559
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,859
Call me as soon as you know.

560
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,377
She left you on the steps
because you were sick.

561
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:13,416
What?

562
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,820
I can hear your heart.

563
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:18,755
It doesn't beat the way it should.

564
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,725
That's why your mother gave you up.

565
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:42,912
What's her status?

566
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:46,624
Temperature is 104.
Blood pressure critically low.

567
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:48,350
Her organs are starting to shut down.

568
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,876
I was about to put her on a vent.

569
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:54,711
This is going to work.

570
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:59,265
This has to work.

571
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,778
Your mom needs you to fight.

572
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:43,036
<i>Hello? Marshall?</i>

573
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,841
Hannah?

574
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,326
- Yeah, it's me. Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:48,944
<i>It's amazing to hear your voice.</i>

576
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:50,646
Yeah. Yours, too.

577
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,148
How'd you find me?

578
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,116
<i>I'm pretty resourceful
when I put my mind to it.</i>

579
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:57,019
I-I just... didn't think
I'd hear from you after...

580
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:59,722
<i>Caleb, yeah. He's a little intense.</i>

581
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,502
But once I told him, you know,

582
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:05,294
about meeting you and how sweet
you were, he gave me the phone.

583
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:06,896
<i>So, he's just a big softie.</i>

584
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,031
I wouldn't say that.

585
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:13,202
So... why exactly are they
keeping you up at the camp?

586
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:16,005
<i>What did you all do?</i>

587
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,139
It's complicated.

588
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:20,076
I'll explain when I can. I promise.

589
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,078
You said I was someone
you could trust...

590
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,179
<i>...that you were meant to find me.</i>

591
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:26,415
So, you should be able to tell
me anything, right?

592
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,050
I have to go, okay?

593
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:30,052
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thank you, Marshall.

594
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:31,087
Wait. Hannah...

595
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:01,417
Hey.

596
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:05,254
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

597
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:06,315
Well, drop your nowhere bag.

598
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,074
I need you to come to
the station with me.

599
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,199
No thanks.

600
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:10,926
Hey.

601
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:11,994
I need you to come down to the station

602
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,463
and tell Jude everything
you told me this morning...

603
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:16,932
everything you remember
about those people in the road.

604
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,905
What good is a new plan

605
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:25,241
if you've got a camp full
of people who can expose us?

606
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,109
Jake, I-I have them under control.

607
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:29,311
You can't make 47 people disappear.

608
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:31,947
I can discredit them
as delusional enemy agents,

609
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,482
or I can just hold them indefinitely.

610
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:34,984
We do it all the time.

611
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:37,219
Besides, most of them have no knowledge

612
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:38,420
of a previous migration.

613
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:39,555
Most of them?

614
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,424
They did nothing wrong. Can we
at least acknowledge that?

615
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:46,262
I get it. But we're living under
stolen identities here.

616
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:50,166
We've committed fraud, treason, murder.

617
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,001
We can't take any risk
that's gonna further...

618
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:55,437
I said I have it under control.

619
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:57,540
And what about the mutant
flesh-bucket killing machine

620
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:58,569
who waltzed through with them?

621
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,677
You don't think that Apex-bitch
will come for us?

622
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:02,745
Look at what happened to Beaumont.

623
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,514
You know, this is your fault.
Your numbers were off.

624
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:10,252
My numbers were as close
to perfect as you can get.

625
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,354
This plan should have worked

626
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,356
if everyone followed my instructions.

627
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:16,492
Of course, all of that was dependent

628
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:18,360
on our arrival here being a secret.

629
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:22,965
So, if mistakes were made,
they were not mine.

630
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:26,202
The only mistake we made
was being too timid...

631
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:28,304
not taking a big enough swing.

632
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,105
I have a proposal to fix that.

633
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:35,845
Maybe there is no fixing it.

634
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,114
Maybe it was never possible
to change our future.

635
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:44,119
Look, I feel bad for the end of
the human race.

636
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:46,555
I-I really do.

637
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,691
But I'm never gonna see that
in my lifetime,

638
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:51,827
and neither are any of you.

639
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:54,196
I like my life.

640
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:58,634
It is everything I never knew
I always wanted.

641
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:04,707
So, um... good luck. Happy travels.

642
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:05,841
I'm out.

643
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:09,211
I don't think so.

644
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,739
It's like you said, Jake...
exposure's a risk.

645
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:22,075
Now, you can expose us.

646
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:26,704
So, if you're out, you're out.

647
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:33,727
Okay.

648
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,822
Okay.

649
00:35:41,628 --> 00:35:43,596
Anyone else?

650
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,498
Her heart rate is coming up.

651
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:58,397
Temperature's down to 101.

652
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:02,616
What kind of anti-viral works this fast?

653
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:05,207
How did you do this?

654
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:08,788
It wasn't me.

655
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:32,766
Hey, Leah.

656
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:37,083
Feeling a bit better?

657
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:51,858
What else could you heal?

658
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:55,101
That's what I remember.

659
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:57,779
How many people do you think
you saw on the road?

660
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,658
I mean, just, approximately?

661
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:02,113
I don't know. It was really dark.

662
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:04,677
Well, like, more than a dozen?

663
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,547
Maybe.

664
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:10,983
So, what, you guys believe me now?

665
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:13,249
Me and my dad?

666
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,209
We believe you.

667
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:20,214
So... who were they?

668
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:26,037
It's, uh... complicated.

669
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:29,873
Yeah, I've been getting that
a lot today.

670
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:37,253
_

671
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,502
I mean, it all kind of tracks, right?

672
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:44,171
Those people in the road...
It could've been them.

673
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:46,540
Maybe Agent Ren was onto something.

674
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:50,411
Maybe. We still have a long way
to go to prove it.

675
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:52,179
Hmm.

676
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,181
Hmm.

677
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,296
_

678
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,664
_

679
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:18,272
This guy.

680
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:20,741
He came right up outside
the car after it happened.

681
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:25,145
He saw my mother dying and walked away.

682
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,220
This guy...

683
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:34,421
he was there.

684
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,964
This says we need to capture
the Apex alive,

685
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:46,233
which I'm assuming is some kind of typo.

686
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:49,236
It's dangerous,
but it's a risk we have to take.

687
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,804
We have to harvest her genetic material

688
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,240
for this plan to work.

689
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:55,676
<i>Surgical strikes have failed.</i>

690
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,345
<i>It's time to obliterate
any possibility of Apex</i>

691
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,581
<i>ever coming into existence.</i>

692
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,149
That means we're gonna have to eliminate

693
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:03,984
anyone who carries the marker.

694
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,154
But this would mean that...

695
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:09,323
I know it's a radical plan.

696
00:39:09,357 --> 00:39:12,860
I didn't come all this way to give up.

697
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,596
What happened to you?

698
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,164
Coming here...

699
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,135
...living this life...

700
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,988
...I finally understand
everything we lost.

701
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:32,279
We have to find a way to get that back.

702
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:34,148
It doesn't matter what the cost.

703
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:37,818
But you understand...

704
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:42,623
how many people will have to die?

705
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:43,757
Yes.

706
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:48,729
In or out?

707
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,337
I thought you said
the patient was improving.

708
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,039
She was. Her lungs had cleared,

709
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,542
her magnesium levels
had dropped back to normal.

710
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:04,178
Then I found this rash on her neck,

711
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,656
like the little girl's.

712
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,885
No. This isn't Mantle's.

713
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,609
It's not even a rash.

714
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:18,735
I think it's a... brand.

715
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:23,497
She's been branded.

716
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,418
Oh, my God.

717
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,036
Who the hell are these people?

718
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:36,685

1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,520
You've failed. I'm here for Asriel.

2
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:09,080
I need to come with you.
Lord Asriel needs to die.

3
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,510
Iorek, the alethiometer,
my father will need it.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,710
We'll need the truth to defeat her.
I need to give it to him.

5
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,442
We're investigating the
disappearance of some

6
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:19,706
rather valuable objects.
Dangerous objects.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,750
And your husband's name keeps
getting brought up.

8
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,150
I have nothing for you.

9
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:26,449
That's not true.

10
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,752
I need an answer
on the alethiometer.

11
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,070
What did Grumman discover?

12
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:34,349
There. Can you see?

13
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:36,510
That's where my father is?

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,924
Your dad, I think he was involved
in something dangerous.

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,054
Dangerous?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,670
I don't care how you do it...

17
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:44,870
..I want the letters.

18
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,703
You have to leave, you have
to turn around and leave.

19
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,784
I did not send for you.

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,190
GROWLING
Asriel.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,735
Roger Parslow,

22
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:06,048
I am very pleased you came.

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,983
The alethiometer says that Lyra
has to make a journey.

24
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:15,294
One which I'm afraid includes
a great betrayal.

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,790
FATHER MACPHAIL OVER TANNOY: For
each and every one of you...

26
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:34,830
..going out to fight
this abominable foe....

27
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:39,838
..in the face of an attack on
everything we hold sacred...

28
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:45,750
..I implore you to channel
the Authority

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,230
in this time of need.

30
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,717
STELMARIA GROWLS

31
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,631
STELMARIA: The aurora is strong now.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,710
And the child's here.

33
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,225
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

34
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,434
STELMARIA: It's time.

35
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,291
I know.

36
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,257
SNIFFING

37
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,070
What is all this stuff?

38
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,263
FAINT CLICKING

39
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:28,055
I understand you arrived here
on Iorek Byrnison's back.

40
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,640
New king of the bears. I believe you
preferred the old one?

41
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:35,110
But you should be happy now
you're free.

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,459
How does a little girl acquire
the king of the panserbjorne

43
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,030
as a guardian?

44
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,599
It's been quite a journey
to get here.

45
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,607
That's not an answer.

46
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,205
And I don't remember
inviting you.

47
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,024
You don't want me here?

48
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:55,895
Left you where you were safe,
Lyra, at Jordan College.

49
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,534
Whatever you've brought me...

50
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,503
..I hope it was worth it.

51
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,050
Now, what is it?

52
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,843
I'll tell you...

53
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,230
..if you tell me why you...

54
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,190
..why you lied to me
about being my father.

55
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,430
I would have been so proud.

56
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,350
Why would you have been proud?

57
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,990
Because you're...

58
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,990
..Lord Asriel.

59
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,151
And you're MY father.

60
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,809
Your mother, she...

61
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,962
Do you know who your mother is?

62
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:52,119
Your choice in women is almost
as bad as your choice in bears.

63
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,834
I don't think we should
continue this conversation.

64
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:02,529
Why not?

65
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,805
Because it is getting sentimental.

66
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,423
Sentimental?!

67
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,022
And because I wouldn't like to.

68
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,274
Are you crying? It's unnecessary.

69
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,657
Lyra Belacqua, you are
stronger than that.

70
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,189
It's Silvertongue now.

71
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,228
You don't want my name?

72
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,866
Silvertongue feels like my name.

73
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,847
It was given to me by someone
who actually loves me,

74
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:28,269
which is better than
I can say for you.

75
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,891
This is why I'm here.

76
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,532
I brought you this and I saved Roger
and now I'll be on my way.

77
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,562
It's the middle of the night.

78
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,270
I'll leave in the morning, then.

79
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:48,436
ALETHIOMETER LID CLICKS OPEN

80
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,410
ALETHIOMETER LID CLICKS SHUT

81
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:00,287
You can keep the alethiometer.

82
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:01,950
I don't need it.

83
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,173
You don't want it?

84
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,489
I didn't say that.

85
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:09,864
Hm.

86
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:19,590
I looked after this.

87
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:23,110
All the way from Jordan College!

88
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,590
Fought the Magisterium, enlisted the
witches, fought the bears,

89
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,926
all to bring it to you,

90
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,270
and you refuse it?

91
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,207
Call yourself a father?

92
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,729
I think that's rather the point.

93
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,602
I've never called myself a father.

94
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,604
WHINING

95
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,790
Have you intruded for a reason?

96
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,349
The winds have changed direction.
DOOR CLOSES

97
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,944
We should pick up speed now.

98
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,970
We'll be there by morning.

99
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,455
The Authority must be on our side.

100
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,670
I wouldn't be so arrogant
as to claim that.

101
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,649
Hopefully, we shall prove
fast enough.

102
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,070
However fast we go,
Asriel will be waiting.

103
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,582
We have firepower and belief.

104
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,065
Two mighty weapons.

105
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,240
All he has is his own
distorted arrogance.

106
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:49,489
And his work.

107
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,891
Work you don't want others to
see, but...

108
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,324
..you really don't want
to see it yourself.

109
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,270
You want to see it?

110
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,911
I'm not frightened of it.

111
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,590
What did he do to you?

112
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,549
What power he still exerts!

113
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,070
You know nothing.

114
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,984
I knew you.

115
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,574
An ambitious young woman
with a good marriage,

116
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,329
well on her way to quite some
position,

117
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,168
and then that man came
along and you...

118
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:29,112
..melted in front of...
I did not melt.

119
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,979
You don't even claim
responsibility for your child.

120
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,873
Hm.

121
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,630
I suppose you consider
yourself without sin.

122
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,016
No-one can claim to be without sin.

123
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,317
So what is your sin,

124
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,030
I wonder?

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,997
Hm?

126
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:00,270
Lust?

127
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,591
Greed?

128
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:10,302
No.

129
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,750
It's envy.

130
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,586
You want what Asriel and I have -

131
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,990
a sureness of step, a conviction,

132
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,048
but you...you lack it.

133
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:28,346
I'm the best weapon
you'll ever have.

134
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,030
Has it given you an answer?

135
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,908
An alethiometer gives you
the answer you need,

136
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:34,653
not necessarily the answer
you desire.

137
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,092
Sometimes it's more of a riddle
than... What did it say?

138
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,653
The question I posed, very
precisely, is,

139
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,519
"What did Grumman discover?"

140
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,240
What did the damn thing say?

141
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,383
It said...

142
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:49,082
..there's a knife in a tower
surrounded by angels.

143
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:51,096
That's what he has discovered.

144
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:51,995
And?

145
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:54,845
His son will lead you to it.

146
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,990
But Grumman never married,
never had a son.

147
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,470
So I may need to ask
another question, or...

148
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:05,830
A son?

149
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,446
You're sure it said a son?

150
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,466
For that part, it gave me the levels
of the baby,

151
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,385
the angel and the
marionette symbols.

152
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,830
The answer was quite categorical.

153
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,676
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

154
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,881
Tell me, sir, does she have
everything she needs?

155
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:52,586
Hm? A brush for her teeth,
for instance.

156
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,114
Does she have a toothbrush?

157
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,609
I wouldn't be overly concerned.

158
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:01,420
Now that Iofur's dead, there
will be an airship of soldiers
on their way here.

159
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,856
But the Magisterium won't be our
only enemies for much longer.

160
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,402
You've found a bigger enemy?

161
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,518
THE enemy.

162
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:19,761
And now that Iofur's guards are
gone, I'm free to go after it.

163
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,564
I'm afraid I won't be here when
the Magisterium arrives.

164
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,978
I'm going to ask you
to make sure that Lyra is safe.

165
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,518
After all this time,

166
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,913
you don't want me with you?

167
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,529
It's not that. I need you here.

168
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,610
I'm asking you to protect
my daughter.

169
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:39,390
Will you say goodbye to her?

170
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,053
No. No, I have work.

171
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,590
It's the very least you could do.

172
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,330
HE SIGHS

173
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,239
PAN: We don't need Lord Asriel.

174
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,830
We'll leave in the morning at
first light.

175
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,463
Lyra. Are you there?
I am.

176
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,157
And you're not coming in.

177
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:40,031
I'll come in, walk in backwards
and sit backwards.

178
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,030
Fine.

179
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,430
Tell me if I'm going to hit
anything. You aren't.

180
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:57,190
You can sit down there.

181
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,823
So what have you got?

182
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:06,878
What?

183
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:09,651
To say. Why are you in the
bathroom?

184
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:10,675
Oh.

185
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,611
I just got spooked.

186
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:15,288
By what?

187
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:18,552
By your father.
What's he doing here?

188
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,828
He looked at you really angrily,

189
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:26,670
and then he saw me and he
calmed down immediately.

190
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,510
He looked at me like he was
a wolf or something.

191
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:36,863
My father...

192
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,630
Can we...call him your father now?

193
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,266
He knows I know.

194
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,350
Didn't go so well?

195
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:48,950
Not really.

196
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,425
You know what I think?

197
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,942
Parents are more trouble
than they're worth.

198
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:58,470
That's why I never bothered
getting to know mine.

199
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:01,630
Sensible.

200
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,673
You know, I always liked it,

201
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,577
that we were the same.

202
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:10,190
Orphans.

203
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:12,790
So if you want...

204
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:15,463
..we can pretend we are.

PAN SQUEAKS

206
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,005
You shouldn't have let him go.

207
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:48,177
I...didn't know he was useful
to us. You wanted the letters.

208
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,503
He is.

209
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,190
He's important.

210
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:56,630
Tell me what to do.

211
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,910
I don't see why I should
get you to do anything.

212
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,311
You mess up.

213
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,459
You ask for help.

214
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,990
I give you Thomas,
and you mess up again.

215
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,375
Hang on...

216
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,710
And I have to come myself.

217
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:17,950
Tell me...

218
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,230
..is there anything
that you can do alone?

219
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:24,714
Now, think...

220
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,224
..where this Will might be...

221
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,254
..what he might be doing.

222
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,412
The kid was a loner. My guess,
he's on the streets somewhere.

223
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,110
I'll look into it.

224
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,990
Get rid of the body.

225
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,399
Done.

226
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,458
And find the boy.

227
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:59,265

238
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:51,855
LYRA: Stop it!

239
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,729
He wasn't even surprised.

240
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,256
He wasn't even upset. He was just...

241
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,470
..annoyed at me.

242
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,804
It's probably not what he
really thinks.

243
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,510
You sure about that?

244
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,540
You can look at the
alethiometer.

245
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,510
Ask it how he really feels.

246
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,510
Does it know everything?

247
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,648
Does it know everything
that will happen to us?

248
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,416
I think so, but...

249
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,332
I think it will only tell me what it
wants me to know, so...

250
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,015
Then let's not use it.

251
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,695
So we just know what we
know, I suppose.

252
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,606
I mean, I'm not like you.

253
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,486
I would never have chosen to
leave Jordan. I know.

254
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:55,424
But now here we both are,
halfway round the world.

255
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,615
And I'm here because of you.

256
00:19:58,427 --> 00:19:59,700
And you're here because of me.

257
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,420
Cos we changed each other's lives.

258
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,093
I like the fact you changed my life.

259
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:09,912
Can't promise I won't stop
changing it.

260
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,792
BOTH: Cheers.

PAN SQUEAKS

00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,847
Shh-shh-shh-shh. Don't be
frightened.

265
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:03,983
Come.

266
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,998
ASRIEL: You once asked me
what Dust was.

267
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:19,492
The truth is, I don't know.

268
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,247
Why is the Magisterium
so afraid of it?

269
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,903
They're afraid of it
because they think it is sin.

270
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:30,056
Actual physical sin.

271
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,835
Raining down from the sky,
settling on humanity

272
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:37,392
and infecting our souls with evil.

273
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,510
To be fair, it's a terrifying
thought.

274
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:45,331
For the longest time, the
Magisterium completely ignored Dust.

275
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:46,950
But then it was discovered

276
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,661
that Dust only begins to settle on
humans going through puberty.

277
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,990
The connection was made to
Adam and Eve...

278
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,436
...and they labelled Dust
as original sin.

279
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,510
Original sin?

280
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:03,762
When did Eve's daemon settle?

281
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,124
When Eve ate the apple,
like the serpent told her to.

282
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,351
Well done.

283
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,057
And the serpent said,

284
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,982
"You shall not surely die,

285
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:16,029
"for the Authority doth know that on
that day that ye eat thereof,

286
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,378
"your eyes shall be opened,

287
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:21,933
"your daemons shall assume their
true form and ye shall be as..."

288
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:24,120
BOTH: "..gods, knowing good and..."

289
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,213
LYRA: "..evil."
ASRIEL: "..Dust."

290
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,472
You see?

291
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,035
They have been trying
to convince us for centuries

292
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:39,144
that we are born guilty.

293
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:42,976
And that we have to spend a lifetime
atoning for the crime

294
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,410
of eating an apple.

295
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:49,816
Is there any proof for this
heinous stain,

296
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:52,322
this shame, this guilt?
No, not at all.

297
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:57,390
We are to take it on faith, and on
the word of the Authority.

298
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:00,058
But Dust...

299
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,710
Dust is an elementary particle that
we can record, measure, study.

300
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,121
We can take photograms of it.

301
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:08,651
And it has given them what
they need -

302
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:11,388
a means by which to control,
to oppress,

303
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,231
to frighten, and to keep us
where they want us -

304
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,467
on our knees.

305
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,610
That's what my mother
thinks she's doing...

306
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,680
..cutting away our daemons.

307
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,510
Preserving our sinless souls.

308
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,350
You should have seen them.

309
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,790
Those who had their daemons
cut away.

310
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,493
They looked empty.

311
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,790
Did they try to cut you, Lyra?

312
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:55,556
She stopped them.

313
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,470
Your mother stopped them?

314
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,430
She didn't want to damage me.

315
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,527
Happy to damage others.

316
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,710
Is that a fact?

317
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:14,136
The thought of Pan
being cut from me...

319
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:22,197
I know.

320
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,310
The bond between human and daemon
is incredibly powerful.

321
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,832
Quite beautiful, really.

322
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:39,048
There's actually an immense release
of energy...

323
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,230
..when that link is severed.

324
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,463
What is the most important
question we can ask?

325
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
Where Dust comes from.

326
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,294
There you are.

327
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,802
The photograms you took...
The aurora.

328
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:07,390
You've seen Dust pouring into
this world from the aurora.

329
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,689
If light can cross that barrier
between the universes,

330
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,008
if Dust can,

331
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,964
if we can see that city up
there in the sky,

332
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,158
then we can build a bridge
and we can cross.

333
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:19,316
Cross to multiple worlds?
Why not?

334
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:21,484
Let's go to the source,
let's ask what Dust is.

335
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,800
Maybe we'll find out that it's
something else entirely.

336
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,470
Maybe we'll find out that it is
sin.

337
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,282
How do you like the sound of
that?

338
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,070
I... I don't know.

339
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,143
What I do know is
I've done my piece.

340
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:40,636
Lyra, what I can tell you is that
Dust is what makes

341
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:42,116
the alethiometer work.

342
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,010
Did you know that?

343
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,849
I doubt the Magisterium know that.

344
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,710
It works through Dust?

345
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:55,590
I brought you the alethiometer and
now I just need to take Roger home.

346
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:58,449
Did the Master ever actually
ask you to bring it to me?

347
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,449
It's yours.

348
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,670
You were never sent to me at all.

349
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:06,630
But I am glad you came.

350
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,590
You don't come from nothing, Lyra.

351
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,190
You're the product
of something extraordinary.

352
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,559
Goodnight.

00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:28,028
No, nothing. But maybe the police
know something.

Fra Pavel said a tower.

359
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:35,660
It must be the Tower of the Angels.

360
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:41,510
The legends are true.

361
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:46,510
But if they are...

362
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,910
..then this knife...

363
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,190
The boy will lead us to it.

What's going on?

370
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:44,094
You're awake. Good. Now, we have to
move very quickly.

371
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,792
The Magisterium are on their way.

372
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:47,418
My father said they wouldn't
get here.

373
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:48,987
He's already gone.
Where?!

374
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,622
Don't you worry.
I will get you somewhere safe.

375
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:55,837
Roger! Roger!

376
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,809
Where's Roger? Tell me, Thorold!
Where's Roger?

377
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:01,035
With Asriel.

378
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,502
What does he want with him?

379
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:06,168
Lyra... Lyra...

380
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:09,090
Energy.

381
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:10,744
Energy!

382
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,190
Lyra, I promised that
I would protect you.

383
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:16,430
Thorold, he's going to cut him!

Iorek, I need you!

Lyra!

389
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,990
What is it?

390
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:43,070
Follow the footprints! My father's
got Roger. We need to go!

391
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:45,543
Bears!
You're calling the bears?

392
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:49,013
I have a feeling we'll be
needing them. Climb on.

393
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,950
We'll need to move fast!

When's Lyra joining us?

00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:20,385
I told you,
she's coming with Thorold.

397
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,895
She'll be here soon. Come.

00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:04,743
There'll be traps everywhere.

402
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,472
Get the guards out of here.

403
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,044
No sign of anyone or anything.

404
00:31:32,661 --> 00:31:34,933
The guards have gone
to search the outside.

405
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,624
Plenty of people staying here,
though.

406
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,950
Some sort of...

407
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,030
..encampment in the living area.

408
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,150
Any sense of where he might be?

409
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,713
Or what he's been...

410
00:31:56,965 --> 00:31:58,430
..doing here?

411
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:12,157
Oh, Thorold, don't be ridiculous.

412
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:14,304
You won't hurt me.

413
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,270
I know you too well.

414
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,630
Plus, I'm unarmed.

415
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,129
He's gone up the mountain,
hasn't he?

416
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,764
What's he trying to do?

417
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,062
His numbers suggest
some kind of energy release.

418
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,110
This is Dust...isn't it?

419
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:38,068
Thorold...

420
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,622
..tell me who's with him.

421
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,638
What's he trying to do with Dust?

422
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,744
Flood us all with sin and darkness?

423
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,031
I know you have no respect
for the Magisterium.

424
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:58,470
But in the name of the Authority,

425
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:02,103
he who shines above us
and lights the way,

426
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,263
tell me what you know.

427
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,803
SIGHING: Thorold...

428
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,157
I should throw you to the wolves.

429
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,009
But I won't.

430
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,412
I'll tell them that Father
MacPhail is staying here

431
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,227
to analyse what we've found.

432
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,809
And then I'll take the troops
to pursue Asriel,

433
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:32,359
and then you will leave.

434
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,030
He's always been so reckless.

435
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:40,510
He's never treated any of us well.

436
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,590
You included.

437
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,050

And believe me when I tell you
that this is a war.

495
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,590
One that will free humanity forever.

496
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:08,529
Lyra!

497
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:17,302
LYRA: I can't do this, Pan!

498
00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:19,426
PAN: Come on, Lyra. You can.

499
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,360
LYRA: Just fly up
and see if you can see them.

500
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,230
We're nearly there.

501
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,470
They're just beyond the peak.

502
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:41,182
Asriel's put Roger and Salcilia
in a cage.

503
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,630
They look like the ones
at Bolvangar.

504
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:47,390
ROGER: No!

505
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,283
No!

506
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:50,398
ROGER SCREAMS

507
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,447
ROGER YELLS

508
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,795
Please don't do this!

509
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,873
Lyra will never forgive you.

510
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,115
SALCILIA: Roger, I can't get out!

511
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,414
What's going to happen to us?

512
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:18,912
No... No.

No...

517
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,510
Roger, I don't want to leave you!

SPEECH INAUDIBLE

520
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,396
HE BREATHES QUICKLY

521
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,541
If you've come to stop me,
you're too late.

522
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:50,366
Too late to stop the experiment,
yes, but not too late to stop you.

523
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,551
Oh, I am pleased that you
came, Marisa,

524
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:55,503
to see what I've done.

525
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,550
The Magisterium
will never allow it.

526
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,845
Oh, you don't understand.

527
00:45:04,212 --> 00:45:06,390
The Magisterium have
no power any more.

528
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:09,973
Not once the world sees
the possibility of all this.

529
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,182
It is the end of the Magisterium.

530
00:45:14,237 --> 00:45:15,590
After hundreds of years.

531
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:18,409
No more oppression.

532
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,142
No more abuse.

533
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:22,492
No more darkness...

534
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,325
..or suppression of knowledge.

535
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:30,430
You see that light?

536
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:36,055
That is the sun of another world.

537
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:38,879
Look.

538
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:41,644
Come.

539
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,133
Feel the warmth of it on your face.

541
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,830
It's extraordinary.

BOTH CHUCKLE

543
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,660
ASRIEL: There is no stopping it now.

544
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:05,015
My war was never just
with the Magisterium.

545
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:08,112
There is a far more
dangerous power out there.

546
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,878
Marisa, come with me.

547
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:16,350
Work with me.

548
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:21,609
Help me fight this war
and take on the Authority.

549
00:46:24,766 --> 00:46:28,070
Help me create a new
Republic of Heaven.

550
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,039
What better place
to make a new start?

551
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:38,257
A new start?

552
00:46:40,054 --> 00:46:41,867
You and I. Together.

553
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:45,634
We could take this universe apart
and put it back together again.

554
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,976
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, we couldn't...

555
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,550
Lie about whatever you want.

556
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:58,750
Lie about the Oblation Board.

557
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:01,470
The Magisterium.

558
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:05,390
Lie about the girl.

559
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,570
But do not lie about your
ambition...

560
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,590
..your work...

561
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:15,104
..or who you truly are.

562
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,365
You used to want to change
the world.

563
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:23,286
Then leave the Magisterium.

564
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:25,883
Come with me, and we will
change them all.

565
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,910
But our child is in this world.

566
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:35,390
And my place is with her.

567
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:37,865
That is not a lie.

568
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:40,865
You want that?

569
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:45,025
I want her with everything I have.

570
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:49,221
This is your journey, not mine.

571
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:51,462
Goodbye, Asriel.

But Salcilia's gone.

579
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:48,847
LYRA: I thought he wanted
the alethiometer.

580
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,927
I got it wrong.

581
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,665
I got it all...wrong.

582
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,105
We didn't mean this to happen.
But it did!

583
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,505
It did happen.

584
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:06,951
And I didn't get to say goodbye.

585
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,286
I didn't get to say I'm sorry.

586
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:16,289
And it's my fault.

587
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:20,677
It's all my fault.

588
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,538
I should never
have brought you here.

589
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,548
What do I do, Roger?

590
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,745
Help me, please.

591
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:41,126
We need to find Dust.

592
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:45,607
We thought it was bad,
because grown-ups said so.

593
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:48,484
What if it isn't?

594
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:50,745
What if it needs protecting?

595
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:53,985
You're saying...

596
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,118
..we could...

597
00:51:57,653 --> 00:52:01,253
..go and find Dust before he does?

598
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:04,345
Do you know what that means, Pan?

599
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:06,385
We'd be alone.

600
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,245
We've always been alone...

601
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:10,745
..apart from...

602
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,255
..Roger.

603
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:20,791
Do we just...

604
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,615
..leave him?

605
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:43,111
We've got to make sure
they don't win.

606
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:50,596
We've got to go, Roger.

607
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,064
All right?

608
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,958
Me and Pan...

609
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:01,593
...are going to go into the skies
and we're going to search for Dust.

610
00:53:02,288 --> 00:53:04,926
We will make sure
your death is not in vain.

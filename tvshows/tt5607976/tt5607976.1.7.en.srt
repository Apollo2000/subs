I did not send for you!

665
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:52,698
I did not send for you!

666
00:53:53,618 --> 00:53:56,097
You have to leave. You have
to turn around and leave!

667
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:57,938

- No.

669
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:06,337
No, you have to get out before...

00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:42,258
... make them some food.

679
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:44,498
Sir.

680
00:54:48,378 --> 00:54:49,738

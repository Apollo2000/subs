2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,680
HE GRUNTS SOFTLY

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,360
CAR DOOR OPENS

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,480
Best coffee in Oxford.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,336
No daemons.

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,096
Seems barbaric, doesn't it?

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,536
They have the appearance of freedom,

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,656
but the government's far more
corrupt than the Magisterium.

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,736
Twice as many shopping arcades,

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,216
half as many places of worship.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,216
It's a culture of consumerism,
not faith.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Prepare yourself, Marisa.

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,776
HE GASPS

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,120
Argh!

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,696
OK, so his house
was set back from the street,

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,640
and it had a driveway like this.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,336
Hm. What's that? The window.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,136
The window's really close
to Latrom's house -

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,856
that can't be a coincidence.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,320
PAN: Then we shouldn't use it.
It's too risky.

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,216
You'll have to cut a new window.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,960
If the worlds match up,
we can get even closer.

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,096
I bought this shortly after I sold
my first Muscovite collection.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
Shall we?

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,936
We know where the window is
in both worlds.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,496
So that'll help us find where to cut
through to Latrom's house.

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,976
And then, when we're in,

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,776
we should start by looking in the
room with all of the glass cabinets.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,456
The alethiometer must be there.

30
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,840
That's assuming
I can definitely cut a window.

31
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
BEEPING

32
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,136
DOOR LOCKS

33
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
Let me show you around.

34
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,016
So this is your big secret?

35
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,896
It must have taken you years
to build this collection.

36
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,456
This item brings me
particular pleasure.

37
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,776
I picked it up in Nova Zembla for
the price of a bread roll. Hm.

38
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Here, it's worth more than half
the vaults of Jordan College.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,776
Ah! HE GASPS

40
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,856
SHE LAUGHS PLAYFULLY

41
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
HE CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY

42
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,656
This is a piece of wall

43
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,056
that split the city of Berlin...

44
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Delightful as this... all is...

45
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,920
..how does it connect to Lyra?

46
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,376
KEYPAD BEEPS

47
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,440
DOOR UNLOCKS

48
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,960
Lyra will come here to do
the exchange.

49
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,096
And as you can see, my home
is fully monitored.

50
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,776
Real-time moving images.

51
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,936
When she arrives,
we can trade what I want...

52
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,760
..for what she wants.

53
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,136
When I found her,
she was trying to read it.

54
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,136
So you stole it from her?

55
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,800
In the knowledge
that it would draw her to me...

56
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,200
..for you.

57
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,640
Hm.

58
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,256
I'm not sure I can cut a window.
You can.

59
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,656
It's like Giacomo said -
become the tip of the knife.

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,320
Come on, you can do it.
I know you can.

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,176
WHISPERS: Is this your Oxford, Will?

62
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,776
It is.

63
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,296
Why are we whispering?

64
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,376
I don't know. SHE GIGGLES

65
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
Come on, let's do another one.

66
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,160
Will, you left the window open.

67
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,696
Wait, I know this street.

68
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
It's near the window in the park.

69
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,096
He's getting good at this.

70
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,616
He is.

71
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,960
Come on.

72
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,640
Lyra... Lyra, come and look at this.

73
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,640
Look, Pan was right.

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
The worlds do match up.

75
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,896
So that means if we cut a window
by the tower...

76
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,560
Then we cut into his house.

77
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,256
The alethiometer's right there.

78
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,776
And so is Latrom.

79
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,176
We should wait until it's dark

80
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,336
before trying anything
near the tower.

81
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,656
Will, we can't let him have
the alethiometer.

82
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,216
I know.

83
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,880
We will get it back.

84
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,360
MUSIC STARTS

85
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,216
The sound quality from these
speakers is quite something.

86
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,640
I can see why you like it here.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,040
You'd like it here, too.

88
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,896
I was considering
investing in a research project

89
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,880
that would certainly suit you...

90
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
..concerning elementary particles.

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,216
What do they know of that
in this world?

92
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,096
Enough to interest your daughter.

93
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
Sorry?

94
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,720
Carlo, can you make that stop?

95
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,376
MUSIC STOPS
Explain what you mean.

96
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,976
Lyra visited a woman called Malone.

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,056
She runs a small department
in a college.

98
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,360
What do you mean,
she runs a department?

99
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,256
Academia works a little
differently here.

100
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,360
She's investigating
the properties of dark matter.

101
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,760
Dust.

102
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,336
How far is the college from here?

103
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,536
You can't be thinking of going.

104
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,736
Carlo, Lyra hides things
from me instinctively,

105
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,016
and as her mother, all I want to do
is to keep her safe,

106
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,096
and the only way I can do that
is to know what she is doing.

107
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,096
I need to know what strange ideas
her mind is being filled with.

108
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,816
Fine.

109
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,360
But you're far too conspicuous
like that.

110
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
Hm.

111
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,336
I didn't know
what your preference would be.

112
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
Thank you, Carlo.

113
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,160
Would you mind?

114
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,840
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

115
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,416
DOOR CLOSES

116
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
SHE SIGHS

117
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,536
It is fundamental
that the people retain

118
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,936
the purity of their faith
in the Magisterium.

119
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,616
I can assure you, Your Eminence,

120
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,896
that though there are
some mutinous dissidents

121
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,576
advocating Asriel's
preposterous notions,

122
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
those men and - heaven help us...

123
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,496
..women...

124
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,176
..have been arrested and are under
the control of the Magisterium.

125
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,576
All except Mrs Coulter,
a former ally to Asriel,

126
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,456
who hasn't been seen since
your inauguration, Cardinal.

127
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,416
Perhaps it is time
the Magisterium issued

128
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,616
a firm public denial of the anomaly.

129
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,896
No, Father Graves.

130
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,536
We remind the people

131
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,336
that it is their faith
in the Magisterium

132
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
which will keep them safe
in these troubled times.

133
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
I beg your pardon, Cardinal.

134
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
Thank you.

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,456
A telegram from the North
informing me

136
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,496
that 24 of our Magisterium soldiers
at base camp

137
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,496
have been killed in cold blood
by the witches.

138
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,096
The bombing of their lands has led
them to retaliate.

139
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,760
We restored order!

140
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,456
Not before the witches travelled
through the anomaly.

141
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,256
FRA PAVEL: They've gone through?

142
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,880
Your Eminence,
we're losing control of the North.

143
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,816
We need more troops
around the anomaly immediately.

144
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,656
The witches could return, bringing
corrupting influences to our world.

145
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,416
Cardinal, a decision must be made.

146
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,016
We need to show strength
in the face of insurrection.

147
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,280
This tragedy...

148
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,520
..is not a setback.

149
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,800
It is a sign from the Authority.

150
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,176
The Authority has sensed

151
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,736
a lack of devotion among our ranks,

152
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,296
and for this treachery,

153
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,600
24 of our brothers have been taken
as martyrs.

154
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,576
Father Graves, your faith
is clearly marred

155
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,536
with the stain of doubt,

156
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,816
and doubt is an insult
to the Authority

157
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,080
which must be severely punished.

158
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,280
Will you escort him to the cells?

159
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,160
Yes, Cardinal. Your Eminence...

160
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,896
Guards!

161
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,136
This is absurd.

162
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,400
My devotion to the Magisterium
is absolute.

163
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
Cardinal...

164
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
Cardinal!

165
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Thank you.

166
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,880
Fra Pavel...

167
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,800
Would you consult your alethiometer
and find out where she's gone?

168
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Who?

169
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,096
Coulter!

170
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,176
She said she was going in search
of something valuable.

171
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,816
I want you to find out what it is.

172
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,040
I am relying on you.

173
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,376

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,840
HE WHINES AND WHIMPERS

175
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,056
Will I do?

176
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,376
You look wonderful.

177
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,480
Thank you.

178
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,920
You're determined to go?

179
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,256
If your daughter returns,
we may miss her.

180
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,560
And that's why you must stay.

181
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,816
Keys.

182
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,576
Your daemon...

183
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
..where is he?

184
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,496
Surely I'm not the first woman
you've witnessed

185
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,160
capable of self-control.

186
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,720
Have you never encountered witches
on your travels?

187
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,496
KEYS JANGLE

188
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080

195
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,216
Can I help you? Yes. Mrs Malone?

196
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,136
Doctor.

197
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,416
This is my private office.
Who let you in here?

198
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,216
Please forgive me.

199
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
I have heard all about your work,
and it sounds...

200
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,456
..absolutely fascinating.

201
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,376
Whichever private investor sent you,

202
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,336
you can read my work
when it's published.

203
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,016
No-one sent me.

204
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,576
Marisa Coulter.

205
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,936
I'm an experimental theologian.

206
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,936
I think you know my daughter... Lyra.

207
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,696
You're Lyra's mother?

208
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,080
I am.

209
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,976
Is she all right?

210
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,576
She's fine.

211
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,560
We're staying with friends
in Oxford. I'm taking her home.

212
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,136
She mentioned trouble at home.

213
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,816
It's been a huge misunderstanding.

214
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,360
She told me what happened,
and that is why I'm here.

215
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,656
I wanted to apologise to you
in person,

216
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,496
in case she was a nuisance.

217
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,536
She wasn't a nuisance
in the slightest.

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,216
I loved meeting Lyra.

219
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,216
It was the most interesting
conversation I've had in ages.

220
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,936
The ideas she has...

221
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,896
What ideas are those?

222
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,336
Well, about the morality
of dark matter,

223
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,176
or, um, what did she call it?

224
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,696
Dust.

225
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,416
Her grasp on quantum physics
is astonishing.

226
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,696
And the compass...

227
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,856
The alethiometer. Yes.

228
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,856
How she's able to understand it,
I have no idea.

229
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
It's extraordinary.

230
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,880
You must be so proud.

231
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,960
I am.

232
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,840
So it's experimental theology
you've been teaching her?

233
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,520
It's not a field of research
I'm familiar with.

234
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
Where would you say
theology comes to science?

235
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,040
Where does it not?

236
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,936
Sorry. Please sit.

237
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,536
Tell me about your work.
I have a million questions.

238
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,336
What was your doctorate in?

239
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,600
Have you published any papers
I might recognise, or...?

240
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,280
Sorry, I'll get you some coffee.
Hold on.

241
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,096
Oh, dirty cups. Sorry about that.

242
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,160

243
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,440

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,176

You must play the serpent.

248
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,320
You have been preparing for this
as long as you have lived.

249
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,320
You must make a journey
which starts at hornbeam.

250
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,000
Hornbeam...

251
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
Deceive the guardian...

252
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,440
..find the entrance.

253
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,696
Entrance to what?

254
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,576
You will be protected.

255
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
Protected from what?

256
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Save the girl...

257
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,576
..and the boy.

258
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,680
Your work here is finished.

259
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,776
We will not speak again...

260
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
DISTORTS AND FADES:
...in this world.

261
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,656
We start by cutting
into the cabinet room.

262
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,616
What if Latrom's
in the cabinet room?

263
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,376
You can't force him to give
the alethiometer back.

264
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,336
I wasn't thinking about forcing him.

265
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,536
You were. Oh, shut up, Pan.

266
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,176
I was going to say Latrom's
probably got it hidden

267
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,416
in a safe or something.

268
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,456
I could distract him
to give you more time to search.

269
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,696
You do the cutting,
I do the talking.

270
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,576
CHILD BAWLS

271
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,096
What's that?

272
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,136
CHILD: Oh, Tullio, please, no!

273
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,256
Don't leave! Why'd you leave me?!

274
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,856
No, no, no, Tullio!

275
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,856
The Spectres must have got him.

276
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,856
Come on, come back! Come on!

277
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,536
Oh, Tullio, no, no, no!

278
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,576
No! I'm so sorry.

279
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,056
You're sorry?! So you did this.

280
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,776
Look, look, I've lost people, too.
I know what it feels like.

281
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,176
Shut up!

282
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,136
Did you take the knife?

283
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,496
I never meant to hurt him.
It's not Will's fault.

284
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,336
He attacked us.
He was going to kill us!

285
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,616
But you admit it!
You did this to Tullio!

286
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,656
No!

287
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,216
Yes, you did. You did that
to Tullio. You did that!

288
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,576
You see what you did?

289
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,256
I'm so, so sorry. Please...

290
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,176
You see what you did?

291
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,336
I'm sorry.

292
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,760
The knife was the only thing
keeping the Spectres away from him.

293
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,120
They will get you.

294
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,776
He should've been the knife bearer,
not me.

295
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,616
The knife chose you.

296
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,376
But why?

297
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
Tullio stole the knife from Giacomo,
he tied him up.

298
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
He would've killed us all.

299
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,480
I never wanted to fight him.

300
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,176
I know, Will.

301
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,936
You had to, though.

302
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,520
If we could have got it without
fighting, we would.

303
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,720
"Now the serpent was more crafty
than any of the wild animals..."

304
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,680
Crafty? DOORBELL RINGS

305
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,640
Not in the lab? It's a miracle.

306
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,400
That's not what you think.
I'm not judging.

307
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,736
You aren't going back
to the convent, are you? No.

308
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,840
SHE LAUGHS OK, good. Um...

309
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,296
You were right, though,
about my life.

310
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,880
Something happened at work.

311
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,376
It means taking time away
from my research, so...

312
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,376
Finally! You really need a break.

313
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,856
Taking some time is a great idea.

314
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,016
We have friends with a cottage
in Devon.

315
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,456
Um...

316
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,136
I was considering somewhere

317
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,056
a little bit further than Devon.

318
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,496
Abroad?

319
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,736
I might just see
where life takes me.

320
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
I don't know yet.

321
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,920
Lyra, you ready?

322
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
It's time.

323
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,256
I can't see anyone.

324
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,456
Do you think Giacomo's still
in there?

325
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,096
Do you think the Spectres got him?

326
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
Don't think about that now.

327
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,200
I don't want to hurt anyone else,
Lyra, whatever they've done.

328
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,336
You don't have to.

329
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,296
You just need to cut us in there,

330
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,776
get the alethiometer and cut us out.

331
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,536
Hm? OK.

332
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,216
DOOR CLOSES

333
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,280
HE WARBLES

334
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,240
HE SQUEAKS

335
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,096
Yes. You were right!

336
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,136
To get to the basement,
we'll have to go lower.

337
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
Giacomo's rooms.

338
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
Come on.

339
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,936
What do they drink in this world?

340
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,520
That they do rather well.

341
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,680
How did you find Malone?
Impertinent.

342
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,960
Intelligent.

343
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,376
Free.

344
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,000
I found her arrogant,
like many women in this world.

345
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,736
Do you find me arrogant?

346
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,160
Of course not.

347
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,656
Take a breath, Marisa.

348
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,840
You're clearly upset.

349
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,696
Did you know,
when I was an honorary scholar,

350
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,496
I achieved the highest results
in our final examination,

351
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,696
but because I was a woman,

352
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,736
I was denied a doctorate
by the Magisterium?

353
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,840
I've written plenty of papers.

354
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,160
But they're only published
if I agree to let a man...

355
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,160
..take the credit.

356
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,136
What did Malone say to upset you
so much?

357
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,200
Hm.

358
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,040
Do you know who I could have been
in this world?

359
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,440
What do you remember...

360
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
..about the scandal
over my affair with Asriel?

361
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,976
He seduced you.

362
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,176
And then abandoned you.

363
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
Leaving me a grieving widow.

364
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,080
With a child out of wedlock.

365
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,896
Why are we talking about Asriel?

366
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,200
We're not talking about Asriel,
we're talking about me!

367
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,776
OK, I'll cut here. Wait, no.

368
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,656
We're in the middle of the room.
What if Latrom's there?

369
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,760
Yeah.

370
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,560
Come here.

371
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,816
We'll do it somewhere around here.

372
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,160
Make it really small.

373
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,816
He's in there.

374
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,160
He has the alethiometer.

375
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,776
I wish we could bash him on the head
and just take it.

376
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
I've got a better idea.

377
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,280
Why do you assume you're the first
person to have travelled here?

378
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,016
Why not?

379
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,456
If you found the window,
others could have.

380
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,640
But if you were...

381
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,400
..looking at what you've done...

382
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,520
..you wouldn't deserve to be.

383
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,256
That's a little unfair. Is it?

384
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,496
This place is full of ideas,
ideas our world is hungry for,

385
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
and yet you...

386
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,576
..you have spent your time
trading trinkets.

387
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,056
Give me some credit.

388
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,856
You've only seen a fraction
of what I've achieved.

389
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,416
I've built a company,
I've made a name for myself.

390
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,696
Oh, and were you hoping to add me to
your little collection of treasures?

391
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,880
I was hoping that this might be
a life you'd want to share.

392
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,440
My dear Carlo.

393
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,400
If you actually got me...

394
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,800
..you wouldn't begin to know
what to do with me.

395
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,600
SHE CHUCKLES PLAYFULLY

396
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,120
DOOR ENTRY RINGS

397
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,360
She's here.

398
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
Bring her down.

399
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,320
OK.

400
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,160
One, two, three, four...

401
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,776
Lyra!

402
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,816
HE CHUCKLES

403
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,536
Why don't you come inside?
Where's my alethiometer?

404
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,976
Where's my knife?

405
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,160
Will's got it. He's on his way.

406
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,080
Always close the window.

407
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,536
Why don't you come inside
and we can talk about this?

408
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,160
Will will be here any minute now.

409
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,080
SHE EXHALES

410
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,216
HE SCREECHES Agh!

411
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,280
WILL GRUNTS

412
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,880
Stay back. He's going to attack.

413
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,256
HE SCREECHES

414
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,776
Hello.

415
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
So you must be Lyra's new friend.

416
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,640
What?

417
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
Thank you.

418
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,040
Will! Lyra!

419
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,360
Lyra.

420
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,640
No... Lyra...

421
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,920
The door's locked.

422
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,616
You found it.

423
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,080
Don't come any closer. Stay back.

424
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,696
I thought we had a deal.

425
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,576
Sit down.

426
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,856
The deal's off.

427
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,096
I mean it! I'll cut this.
Just give me the knife.

428
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,496
Lyra!

429
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,040
Here. This is yours.

430
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,936
Take it.

431
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
And why would I trust you?

432
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,016
Stay back, I mean it.

433
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,336
Don't you dare. That carving is
of huge historical importance.

434
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,376
CARVING CLATTERS

435
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,056
I heard you could read it.

436
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,576
I'd love you to show me.

437
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,016
And then I can tell you more
about Dust, if you want me to,

438
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,736
and why Asriel did what he did
to your friend Roger.

439
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,560
I don't want to hurt you.
I've seen what the knife can do.

440
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,216
Lyra, you are special.

441
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,656
I know you don't believe me,
but I am only trying to protect you.

442
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,656
You can already read
the alethiometer.

443
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,296
I can teach you to use that power
in other ways.

444
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,296
Lyra! We need to get out of here.

445
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,176
Give me the knife
and you can leave...

446
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,336
Lyra, stay away from that boy.

447
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,016
Do you understand me?
He will do you nothing but harm.

448
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,800
Lyra, grab the alethiometer!

449
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
You are so like I was.

450
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,496
I am...

451
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,000
..nothing like you.

What?

458
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,136
How is she, your mother?

459
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,040
Awful to think what could happen
to someone so...

460
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,776
..vulnerable.

461
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,160
Argh!

462
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,856
Agh! Agh!

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,400

Lyra, we need to go!

470
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,400
Lyra, quick!

471
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,440

475
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,200
Hey.

476
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,136
Made you some coffee.

477
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,200
Thanks.

478
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Thank you, Will.

479
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
No problem.

480
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,400
Easy.

481
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,920
When I heard him hurting you,
I wanted to kill him.

482
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,560
So that was your mother?

483
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,720
I've never seen you
like that before.

484
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,600
She can seem so good sometimes.

485
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,096
And I want to believe it,
but I mustn't.

486
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,376
Once, she used her daemon

487
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
to hurt Pan, to hurt me.

488
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,760
I'm always scared something bad's
happening to my mum.

489
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,760
But never that she'll hurt me.

490
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,120
It may sound strange, but...

491
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,616
..I hope I'm not like either
of my parents.

492
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,880
It didn't feel good,
acting like she did.

493
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,800
I hope I'm like...

494
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,640
..Ma Costa...

495
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,776
..or Lee Scoresby.

496
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,440
Lyra, you don't need to be
like anyone else.

497
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,840
They'd be lucky to be anything
like you.

498
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,040
Well, now that we've
got this back...

499
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,720
..I will do nothing
but help you find your father.

500
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
Promise.

501
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,456
You offered her the alethiometer.

502
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,136
Well, you failed to tell me

503
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,000
that they had a knife
that could cut between worlds.

504
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,456
They're gone.
We can't go after them.

505
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,856
We have to. We can't.

506
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,720
The crossroad world
we passed through...

507
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,200
..is for the Spectres.

508
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,536
Spectres?

509
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,256
Until recently,
the knife was guarded closely,

510
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,496
impossible to get to.

511
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,176
Now the city is deserted,
plagued by Spectres.

512
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,816
They consume everything
that makes us human.

513
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,896
So is Lyra in danger?

514
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,800
The Spectres ignore children.

515
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,816
Tell me more.

516
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,760
They attack and kill adults
in seconds.

517
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,080
SOFTLY: Dust...

518
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,320
There's nothing to be done.
No human can survive there.

519
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,216
SHE CHUCKLES

520
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,720
You're wrong, Carlo.

521
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,520
Once you understand something...

522
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,360
..you can master it.

523
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
And we have no choice but to try.

524
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
Or...

525
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,016
..are you going to admit defeat

526
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,880
and let an adolescent take
that knife from you?

527
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,120
Hm?

528
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,800
Deceive the guardian...

529
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,360
OK.

530
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,800
OK...

531
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,376
This is private property.

532
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,376
Yes, I'm supposed to be here.

533
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,096
Where's your Latrom security pass?

534
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,640
Latrom security pass...

535
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,280
I left it at work.

536
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm sure you can make an exception.

537
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,656
No? OK, uh...

538
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,880
I'll just... I'll call Charles.

539
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,416
Mrs Coulter?

540
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,400
Yes. We were told to expect
you together.

541
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,816
He's on his way.

542
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Of course, Mrs Coulter.

543
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,400
Thank you.

544
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:23,424

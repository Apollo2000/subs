1
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:10,652
Mr Jopari, I've reason to believe
you're in possession of an item

2
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:12,572
that confers protection
on anyone who holds it.

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:14,012
A subtle knife.

4
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:15,855
You have this knife, do you?
No.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,031
But I want to find the person
who does.

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,492
You swear to put Lyra
under the protection

7
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:22,895
of that knife, I'll take you
wherever you need to go.

8
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:24,879
I'll gladly do that.

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,591
You must make a journey
which starts at Hornbeam.

10
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,575
Find the entrance.

11
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,879
Your work here is finished.

12
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,887
Save the girl and the boy.

13
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:39,983
The council have approved your
proposal and we shall launch the
airships.

14
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,823
The witches must be cleansed.

15
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:47,407
Lyra is indistinct because she
followed Asriel through the anomaly.

16
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,007
Will you join us?

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,463
The Magisterium will pay
for what they did to us.

18
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:55,023
A telegram
from the North informing me

19
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,415
that 24 of our Magisterium soldiers
at base camp

20
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:00,847
have been killed in cold blood.

21
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:07,695
We're losing control of the North.

22
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,852
Till next time.

23
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,023
The alethiometer - someone took it.

24
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:13,903
But we need it. Without that, we'll
never find my dad.I know!

25
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:16,975
I have something that's vital of
hers. She'll return.

26
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:18,959
Then she's mine.

27
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,135
Thank you.

28
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:22,479
Will!
Lyra.

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,212
Stay away from that boy.

30
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:27,855
Do you understand me?
He will do you nothing but harm.

31
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:34,772
Lyra, I've got it, come on!

32
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:51,855
Lyra!

33
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:56,143
It gives me some hope.

34
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:57,359
Lyra must be close.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,074

36
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,495
Angels.

37
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,172
It can't be.

38
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,052
They haven't made themselves visible
for thousands of years.

39
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:17,492
And the last time they were seen,
it was to make war.

40
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:22,255
Now that Asriel has thrown the
worlds apart, they are going to him.

41
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:27,823
If Asriel has angels on his side,
he can do anything.

42
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:31,172
This is the sign I needed.

43
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,735
You want to follow?
I will bring Asriel back,

44
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,975
and we will return to our world

45
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:41,263
and destroy the Magisterium
together.

46
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:59,732
We must find Lyra.

47
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:07,055
The fate of many worlds
may rest on you.

48
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:10,703
- You have a task ahead of you.
- Will?

49
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,412
Will?

50
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,783
His hand is worse.

51
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,412
I'm not sure we can help him, Lyra.

52
00:03:46,415 --> 00:04:02,415
This way.

53
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:06,383
Lyra.

54
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:18,351
Lyra!

55
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,052
I see you.

56
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,767
Will, wake up!
Will, we need to get out of here!

57
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,623
Angelica's downstairs
and she's going to kill us.

58
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,951
Will, hurry up!

59
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:55,727
Come on, this way.

60
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:59,375
Will, help me!

61
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,687
Can you get us out of here?

62
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,927
Hurry!

63
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:28,052
He has the knife!
Look, we don't want to hurt you.

64
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:31,055
We want to hurt you.

65
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:34,895
You killed our brother
and you stole the knife.

66
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:38,095
It would have protected us
and our adults in the hills.

67
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,972
I am so sorry about your brother.

68
00:05:53,972 --> 00:07:44,303
Leave. Now.

69
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:56,079
Let me see the wound.

70
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,692
Was it your knife that made that?

71
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:10,671
Show them, Will.

72
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,335
If you trust me, you trust her.

73
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:14,063
You never met her.

74
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:19,119
And if you think you can keep
anything from her, you can't.

75
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:26,372
They're here to help us.

76
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,412
You ever seen such a blade before?

77
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:31,663
No.

78
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,943
This edge.

79
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,543
What does this edge cut?

80
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:49,652
Everything.
Nothing.

81
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,172
Well, you're not poisoned.

82
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,807
But this isn't a normal wound.

83
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,623
It's going to take more than plants
to heal it.

84
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,695
It needs a spell.

85
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:23,055
We need to gather lichens.

86
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:31,292
Well, if that isn't
the craziest thing.

87
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,172
Do you think
you can fly through it?

88
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,367
Just make yourself comfortable,
Mr Jopari.

89
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:45,583
We're going in.

90
00:09:45,583 --> 00:10:17,263
Woohoo!

91
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:20,079
OK, so, not quite
the Cave and a keyboard,

92
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,932
but let's see if you work as well.

93
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:51,452
"Turning to the summit for provision
of nourishment brings good fortune.

94
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:59,887
"Spying about with sharp eyes like a
tiger with insatiable craving.

95
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:03,407
"Keeping still as the mountain,
it is a bypath.

96
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:08,527
"It means little stones,
doors and openings.

97
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:12,303
"Signs are coming that will
steel you on your path."

98
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:18,092
Good. Something
I can understand for a change.

99
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:24,692
You know, you keep staring at me.

100
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:28,175
I've always wanted to meet a witch.

101
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,287
My father gave me a book
about witches.

102
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,039
It had pictures in it.

103
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,412
They all had raven hair.

104
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,692
I find those books irritating.

105
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:39,183
Asriel knows what
a witch looks like.

106
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:42,932
Don't touch that flower.

107
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:44,879
I want to know everything.

108
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,415
What can you do?

109
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,015
What can I do?

110
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:50,132
I know you can fly, obviously.

111
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,732
And you can kill, pretty easily.

112
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,951
And the cold doesn't affect you.

113
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:58,959
And you can hear
whispers on the wind.

114
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,212
Are we safe?

115
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:07,919
Is Will safe?

116
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,839
His wound is deep.
But he'll get better.

117
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,015
Right? Now that we're with you,
he'll be better?

118
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:14,703
We will do what we can here.

119
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:18,479
But then we must travel
to our lands.

120
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,951
Our lands?

121
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:22,255
The flora is more
powerful in our world.

122
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,092
Taking us home?

123
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:27,092
I pledged to keep you safe, Lyra.

124
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,132
We'll do so at home.

125
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,511
A place I know.

126
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:53,615
A place I can hide you.

127
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,495
Why isn't she frightened?

128
00:12:56,495 --> 00:13:05,199
She's not from here, is she?

129
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,092
Maybe they're right.
Maybe we should go to my world.

130
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:30,031
Why did you leave, Lyra?

131
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:33,332
To investigate Dust.

132
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:38,372
To try to do my best by Roger.

133
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:41,423
The thing is, these witches...

134
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:44,431
..they're connected to the Earth,
they can find answer after answer.

135
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:48,143
And my father?

136
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,215
What does the
alethiometer say to do?

137
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,199
Will, I can see the way you're
hiding your hand,

138
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,932
I know it's bleeding.

139
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:56,143
Only a little.

140
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,292
There are more powerful
plants in my world.

141
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,572
They say that, and I think
that, too.Look, I get it.

142
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:04,463
You're scared cos
you think I can't go on.

143
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,812
I can do this.

144
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,007
We can do this.

145
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:11,252
Ask the alethiometer
where my father is,

146
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:30,127
what world he's in,
where we might find him.

147
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,983
He's close.

148
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:59,055
What?!

149
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,772
He's in this world.

150
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:13,652
So this is a new world?

151
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:18,332
New to those not born in it -
as old as yours or mine otherwise.

152
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:21,932
What Asriel has done has shaken
everything up, Mr Scoresby.

153
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:23,375
Looks empty.

154
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:28,431
Not so. Beyond that headland
is a city once powerful and wealthy.

155
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,095
That's where we're headed to.

156
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,527
The knife bearer may be there.

157
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,732
Once great, the city
has fallen on hard times.

158
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,863
In another life, I'd be looking for
what I could scavenge.

159
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:42,092
In another life, neither
of us would be here at all.

160
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:44,751
You have a strange way about you,
Mr Jopari.

161
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,892
They say things about shamans.

162
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:49,359
Oh, yeah, what do they say?
That they have powers.

163
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,599
That they can fly.

164
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,223
Yet you cannot.

165
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:55,532
Oh, but I can.

166
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:57,871
How do you figure?I needed to fly.

167
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,919
I summoned you.

168
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,375
Here I am - flying.

169
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,052
I'm human, but I've learnt
a few things along the way.

170
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:10,415
I've spent time with witches,
academicians, spirits.

171
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:14,895
I've found folly everywhere.

172
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,612
And this journey,
is it folly or wisdom?

173
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:23,732
This journey?

174
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,292
I don't know.

175
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:28,052
So we find the bearer of
the Subtle Knife, and what then?

176
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,999
We tell him what his task is.

177
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,292
And that task includes
protecting Lyra?

178
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:40,815
It will protect us all.

179
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:43,567
That's it, we're stopping.
No, ask the alethiometer.

180
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,852
Ask how close my father is.

181
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,703
There's no point getting you
to your father if,

182
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,495
when we get you there,
you're half-dead.

183
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:57,647
No, you're using me
as an excuse to stop.

184
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:58,892
I'm sorry.

185
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:04,111
I know you wouldn't use me
as an excuse to stop.

186
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:09,999
Apology accepted.

187
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:31,375
You should rest, too.

188
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,423
Are you sure about this?

189
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:36,367
I have never been more sure.

190
00:17:36,367 --> 00:18:14,492
You want the knife, don't you?

191
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,079
She's there.

192
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,935
It's all right, you know?

193
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:27,375
You can come out.

194
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,492
Hello. I'm Mary.

195
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:37,615
Do you want something to eat?

196
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,983
It's no good for you at all.
It's full of sugar.

197
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:47,023
I won't tell your parents.

198
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,495
Haven't got parents.

199
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,543
The Spectres got 'em.

200
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,012
The Spectres?

201
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,087
How come they're not
getting you, miss?

202
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,903
Can you not even see them?

203
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,892
Oh, we can't see them either, but...

204
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,727
Paola.

205
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,199
Hi.

206
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,783
So, you're alone, then?

207
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,575
The other adults
used to look after us,

208
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,332
but then they got scared,
ran up to the hills.

209
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:13,903
To the mountain.

210
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,295
Now the other kids have gone, too.

211
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,879
You're not from this world, are you?

212
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,479
Like that Lyra girl.

213
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:24,271
Lyra? You've seen Lyra?

214
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:26,732
I don't like her.

215
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,095
She did something bad to Tullio.

216
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:34,831
We were trying to kill her,
but she escaped.

217
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,495
Was that wrong?

218
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,095
Yes.

219
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,972
Everything's wrong here, miss,
you'll learn that soon enough.

220
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,412
Where has Lyra gone?

221
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:48,335
She's with the witch.

222
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:54,095
Miss, can I have a hug?

223
00:19:54,095 --> 00:20:03,247
Yeah.

224
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,492
Can you stay for a bit?

225
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:07,535
Look after us?

226
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:09,135
The Spectres aren't getting you -

227
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:10,927
you don't have to go
like the others.

228
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:18,479
You can make us have baths and tell
us what to do and all that.

229
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:21,935
I've been sent here
to do something important.

230
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:24,367
We'll be fine.

231
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,031
We've got each other.

232
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:30,092
Go on, Paola.

233
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,292
Wait.

234
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,591
You shouldn't be here alone.

235
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:38,852
Come with me.

236
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:43,311
I'll bring you to your adults.

237
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:47,151
I'm thinking
about my wife and my son.

238
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:50,735
I feel closer to him here.

239
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:54,452
I haven't been back to this world
since I left my own.

240
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,711
I hadn't even met Sayan Kotor.

241
00:20:57,711 --> 00:21:01,615
You don't see your
daemon in my world.

242
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:10,319
I'd given up hope of finding a
window and getting back to them.

243
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,791
Anyway, you were right.

244
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,007
I should sleep.

245
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,612
If only I could.

246
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:17,423
I tell you what - why don't we
make some coffee instead?

247
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:23,887
Thank you.

248
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:26,767
Let me help.

249
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:31,183
Yeah, can you magic us up some fire?

250
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:35,919
One moment.

251
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:51,343
Right.

252
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,607
The knife that Will carries,
the way it's cut him -

253
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:56,732
it's no ordinary cut.

254
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,092
It scares me, how he got
a weapon this powerful.

255
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:02,735
You think you need
to protect me from Will?

256
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,783
Will's knife is amazing.

257
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,623
It can be very dangerous if it's
in the wrong hands, but...

258
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:14,063
..Will's the bearer,
he wouldn't do anything to me.

259
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:18,159
Serafina Pekkala, my job is
to help Will find his father.

260
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,852
Will's father?

261
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,703
The alethiometer said so.

262
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:26,492
I stopped trusting it
after Roger died.

263
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:30,383
But I lost it.

264
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:34,652
And I found out how important it is.

265
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,679
How it's a part of me.

266
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,999
So if it says I need to help Will,
then that's what I've got to do.

267
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,303
People told me it was your
reading of the alethiometer

268
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:50,735
that I'd find impressive.

269
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:53,295
The truth is...

270
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:57,583
..it's your obstinacy
that's your gift.

271
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,692
Our task is to protect you, Lyra.

272
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:04,687
If that means protecting you
and Will, then so be it,

273
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:09,103
even though this world
makes me very uneasy.

274
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:11,983
Well, you should be uneasy.

275
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:13,711
There's creatures here.

276
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:16,463
They don't hurt children,
but they could hurt you.

277
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,663
We will help you find
Will's father...

278
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:26,191
..but we need to stop
Will's bleeding first.

279
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:06,255
Please tell me he'll be all right.

280
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:13,103
We've done all we can here.

281
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:28,532
Your alethiometer - where does it
say to find his father?

282
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:38,732
Up.

283
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:40,175
Keep going up.

284
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:44,783
That's all it says.

285
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,447
Stay close to him.

286
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:47,855
He'll be cold tonight.

287
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:59,375
We'll continue up the mountain
in the morning.

288
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,935
We feel safe here...

289
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:12,303
..don't we?

290
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,455
Ahem.

291
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:21,583
Fra Pavel.

292
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:24,932
I have consulted the alethiometer
as you've asked.

293
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:27,983
I don't entirely understand
what I've seen.

294
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:31,503
Perhaps if you tell me, we shall
understand it better together.

295
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:32,911
May I speak freely?

296
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,612
Even though I should rightly be
punished for such words.

297
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:38,671
Whatever it is...

298
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:42,127
..it has come from the
alethiometer, am I right?

299
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:45,135
You are.

300
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,887
So why should you be punished
for telling me something

301
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:51,983
which you in turn have been told?

302
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:55,503
Go ahead.

303
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,959
Mrs Coulter is looking
for her child.

304
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:04,532
The girl has gone
into another world.

305
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:09,135
Before Asriel opened the hole in the
sky, Mrs Coulter came to see me.

306
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:16,052
There was something
she wanted me to ask.

307
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,903
What was the question?

308
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,783
Who is Lyra Belacqua?

309
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:21,871
And?

310
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,623
I've discovered the girl
has another name.

311
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,415
The witches know it from a prophecy.

312
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:27,887
It's heresy, beyond doubt.

313
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,252
You are not a heretic.

314
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:33,135
Repeat what you have learned
and waste me no more time.

315
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,132
I rather fear you have
become Cardinal

316
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:38,612
at the most burdensome of times.
Tell me what you know.

317
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:40,687
The name is her destiny.

318
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:43,823
It foretells she will be in the
position of the one

319
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:47,279
who brought about our downfall.

320
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,943
Mother of us all.

321
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:51,247
Cause of all sin.

322
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,615
What is the child's name?

323
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:55,855
The alethiometer does not forecast.

324
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:58,671
If it comes about that she is
tempted by the serpent,

325
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:01,532
then it is likely she will fall,
and Dust and sin will triumph.

326
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:05,775
The name, Fra Pavel.

327
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:13,711
Speak the name.

328
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:16,532
You know this place.

329
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:20,623
You really have no sense
of where Lyra might be?

330
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:32,399
I know it a little.

331
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,535
Why are you so nervous?

332
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:37,903
Well, it's just...

333
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:40,975
..the Spectres have multiplied
since Asriel tore the sky.

334
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:44,175
Ugh.One minute this place is
empty, the next it isn't.

335
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,903
And then it's too late.

336
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:48,463
They didn't get you.
You managed to get back.

337
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:52,412
Only because I ran.
Oh, yes, you were frightened.

338
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:54,159
I need to find her and, in turn,

339
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:28,591
you will get the boy
with the Subtle Knife.

340
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:43,532
It's almost like Spectres
sever their victims.

341
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:47,732
They don't sever, these Spectres.

342
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:50,991
It's stronger than that,
whatever they do.

343
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:58,671
We could learn from this.

344
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:03,663
I have been praying.

345
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:09,935
And I believe that we have yet to
understand our true purpose.

346
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:18,639
But today the Authority himself
has spoken to me.

347
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,932
This Magisterium...

348
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:30,351
..the Magisterium over which
I am Cardinal, has a new direction.

349
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,039
Fra Pavel...

350
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,183
..has brought me information
of a threat so grave in nature...

351
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:44,132
..that the world
has only seen it once before.

352
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:46,927
Under my leadership...

353
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,935
..we will do whatever is necessary.

354
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:54,607
We have sent troops
through the anomaly...

355
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,143
..to face that threat.

356
00:29:56,143 --> 00:30:01,071
Yes, Cardinal.

357
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:05,743
In the name of the Authority...

358
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:11,972
..we will not waver.

359
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:14,972
And the first to partake

360
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:20,783
of this great sacrifice...

361
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,663
..will be the child...

362
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:32,559
..Lyra Belacqua.

363
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,252
It's holding up,
the spell worked.

364
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:39,932
A wound caused by magic
must be closed by magic.

365
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:46,063
I've done my best.

366
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:50,492
She's lost a lot, for one so young.

367
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,079
I know that.

368
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,023
Tell him.

369
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:03,452
She's important, Will.

370
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:06,287
There's a prophecy surrounding Lyra,

371
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:10,575
a prophecy that includes a boy
who must travel with her.

372
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:14,287
I don't know whether
you're that boy.

373
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:17,551
She thinks you're her
responsibility.

374
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:21,519
Don't lose sight of the fact
that she's your responsibility, too.

375
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,807
She must be protected.

376
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:12,143
Marisa.

377
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:24,175
Those are the Spectres?

378
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:27,092
There's a swarm of them down there!

379
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,423
Yes, that's them.

380
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:33,263
If they're that close to the tower,
then the knife isn't there.

381
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:36,271
We should land. Lyra could be
down there in danger.

382
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,612
The Spectres would seize us
immediately.

383
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,412
They can't get us up here.

384
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,031
What if Lyra's there?

385
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,252
Don't worry,
the Spectres feed on Dust.

386
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:46,447
Children are not attractive to them.

387
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:49,071
As soon as adulthood comes,
they'll be there.

388
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:52,532
We will help everyone
and Lyra by finding the bearer.

389
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:58,351
If we die, we're of no help
and we can do no further good.

390
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,692
Take us further up.

391
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:04,495
Over the forest.
The knife bearer is not in the city.

392
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:11,279
What's that noise?

393
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,711
What do you see?

394
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:17,167
Magisterium airships.

395
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,599
I didn't think they'd be allowed
to cross the worlds.

396
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:38,671
Keep us flying.
The wind will be on our side.

397
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:46,863
Go...

398
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:56,852
You can control them.

399
00:35:56,852 --> 00:36:00,815
Isn't it wonderful?

400
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:10,652
Let's celebrate.

401
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:14,703
Do you think Angelica and Paola
will be all right?

402
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:19,439
I don't think they were as bad
as we thought.

403
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:23,023
Although I was scared.

404
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:26,372
I've never seen children
act like that before.

405
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:33,332
I have.

406
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:36,015
My mum.

407
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,231
Every now and again,

408
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:41,455
she'd start thinking things
that weren't true.

409
00:36:41,455 --> 00:36:45,359
Doing stuff that didn't make sense.

410
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,012
Like...touching the railings
in the park or...

411
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:52,052
..counting the bricks in the wall.

412
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:54,255
Stuff like that.

413
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,519
These boys found out.

414
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,887
They were mean.

415
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:03,471
For no reason.

416
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:10,063
They were worse than Angelica.

417
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:13,172
When I was younger...

418
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:17,423
..I used to pretend that my dad
was some place abroad...

419
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:20,303
..and that one day I'd go get him.

420
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:24,015
He'd have the answer to everything.

421
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,743
And I could go to school.

422
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,367
Have friends.

423
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:30,607
But the older I got...

424
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:32,271
The more you stopped believing that.

425
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:37,135
Yeah.

426
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:39,823
I couldn't trust anyone.

427
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:44,687
Till you met me.

428
00:37:44,687 --> 00:38:20,399
Yeah.

429
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:27,759
Another?

430
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:28,975
Hmm.

431
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,639
Tell me something.

432
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:35,311
I will tell you anything you like.

433
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,655
How do you control them?

434
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,895
Well, they consume
what makes us human,

435
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:42,543
so I just...hid that from them.

436
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:48,452
I suppressed myself.

437
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:52,292
Marisa, with that ability,

438
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:54,511
we can go wherever we please
in this city.

439
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:58,927
Yes, I can find Lyra,
and you can finally find the boy,

440
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:02,191
and the knife is yours.Ours!

441
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:03,932
You understand?

442
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:08,143
It has a power that could
be useful for both of us.

443
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:14,799
And I would like an equal
to share it all with.

444
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:19,343
You think me your equal?

445
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:29,903
In every way.

446
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:32,732
Then let's
drink to that.

447
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,215
The Subtle Knife of Cittagazze -

448
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:54,572
not even the makers
know what it can do.

449
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:57,692
No-one is invulnerable to it.

450
00:39:57,692 --> 00:40:03,951
Matter.

451
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:08,012
Air.

452
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,903
Go on.

453
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,023
This place...

454
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:16,815
..the window.

455
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,335
All the things you've kept from me.

456
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,935
It would have been so much easier

457
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:27,631
if you'd told me about Lyra
when you first had her.

458
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:32,431
You did so much for me.
Don't think I don't know that.

459
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,415
But your ambitions were small.

460
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:40,943
They would have always ended here.

461
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:44,975
Boreal, I don't need you.

462
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:49,652
You would only hold me back.

463
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:57,212
You are not, nor have
you ever been, my equal.

464
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:05,263
What have you...done?

465
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:11,279
Don't fight it. Don't fight it.

466
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:42,831
Goodbye, old friend.

467
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,012
Mr Jopari, you remember
that problem I mentioned?

468
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:53,012
It's grown more urgent.

469
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,095
Yes.

470
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,335
Yes? That's all you're saying?

471
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,063
Yes?

472
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:00,239
They're faster than us.

473
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,612
They were always going to
catch up at some point.

474
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:04,335
Well, now is not a good point.

475
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:06,703
We've no defences,

476
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:08,879
which means that
we've got to set down.

477
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,927
The only way is into that valley.

478
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:14,972
Do the best you can.

479
00:42:14,972 --> 00:42:18,735
Open your eyes and wake up!
We're not playing around.

480
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,492
Do you need wind?

481
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,132
No, they can use wind as easy as us,
and they're built for speed.

482
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,415
Do you need a storm?

483
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:29,167
Is that all you can summon,
the weather? You're a shaman.

484
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,892
Shaman us up some big guns
and some iron cladding.

485
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:41,612
Are you summoning a storm? Because
I can't pilot well in a storm!

486
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:51,951
I trust your skill.

487
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:53,423
Can we trust him?

488
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:56,047
Do we have another choice?

489
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,892
I guess these are the cards we've
been dealt. It's time to play 'em.

490
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:00,463
For Lyra?

491
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:02,895
For Lyra.

492
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:46,223
Will, the knife!Lyra!

493
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,079
Mm.

494
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:27,247
Strength is salvation.

495
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:36,463
Hmm.

496
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:42,452
Remember that.

497
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:43,892
Whoo!

498
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:47,343
You cook up a fine storm,
Mr Jopari.

499
00:44:47,343 --> 00:44:49,327
There's still two more!

500
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:56,623
Get down!

501
00:45:38,223 --> 00:45:47,055
It's turning!

502
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:55,823
The gas canister!

502
00:45:56,305 --> 00:46:56,408

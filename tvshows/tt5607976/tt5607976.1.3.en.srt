1
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:06,691
The Master has asked if
I can find a place for you.

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:13,895
I like you, and I want to offer
you a position as my assistant.

3
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:16,415
We shouldn't change just
so we can fit in here.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,615
She's being very kind to us, Pan.

5
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:23,055
Stop! You can't treat me like this!

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,575
My uncle won't let you!

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,015
He's done nothing!

8
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:29,096
He's a failure of a man
and a failure of a father!

9
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:35,295
A Gyptian boy, Billy Costa, is missing.

10
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,135
We're going to get him back.

11
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,375
The Gobblers are real.

12
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,495
I don't think she's been
looking for Roger at all.

13
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,495
We have to find out what she's doing.

14
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,855
General Oblation Board of London.

15
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,495
That's what they call it, isn't it?

16
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:53,255
The initials, you see.
General. Oblation. Board.

17
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:57,335
Gobbler. She is the Oblation Board.

18
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,895
I need to find this man.

19
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:01,975
A man with an osprey for a daemon?

20
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,055
So he's done what you've done.

21
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,556
Did he use the same window?

22
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,975
- Lyra!
- I need to find Roger.

23
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,736
We're going on a trip... to the North.

24

25
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,255
Let me go!

26
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:27,296
Turn here.

27
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,095
Looks empty.

28
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:35,056
Let's get the girl inside.

29
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,696
Go! Go!

30
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,935
Let him go!

31
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,175
Let him go!

32
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,976
Check if there's anyone in the back.

33
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,815
Lyra.

34
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,496
Tony Costa.

35
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:46,711
<font color="#800000">♪ His Dark Materials 1x03 ♪</font>
<font color="#B03060">The Spies</font>

36
00:03:57,665 --> 00:03:58,785
Start in there!

37
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:03,536
Find me something that
is heretical or illegal.

38
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:27,416
You could make this easier for yourself.

39
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:32,295
Just tell me where she is.

40
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,255
I left Lyra with you.

41
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,016
I trusted you to look after her.

42
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,535
She is here,

43
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,135
or you know where she is.

44
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:44,975
I wouldn't expect Boreal to
understand scholastic sanctuary,

45
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,707
- but you...
- No, no, Master, I never,

46
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,735
never understood it either.

47
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,016
Why does scholarship need protecting?

48
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:58,575
You don't believe original
thinking should be protected?

49
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:02,055
Well, if the thinking was clever enough,

50
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,295
it would find a way to obscure itself

51
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,656
from the Magisterium, wouldn't it?

52
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,174
Scholastic sanctuary is just another way

53
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,935
of protecting bloated privilege.

54
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:21,016
Tired old men, talking in a tired
old way about tired old things.

55
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,194
Oh, dear.

56
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,194
And you, Master,

57
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,955
you have been abusing your privilege.

58
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,155
Do you deny they're yours?

59
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:39,554
We do have ways of
identifying who last read them.

60
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:42,274
Those are academic texts.

61
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,394
I have perfect right...

62
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:47,514
These books are for those
who read alethiometers.

63
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:53,194
The only alethiometers in use
are sanctioned by the Magisterium.

64
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:59,795
There is no record of there being
an alethiometer at Jordan College.

65
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:10,434
Now, Lyra must be here,

66
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:14,114
so tell me where she is or
I will find the alethiometer.

67
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:15,315
You know I will.

68
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,314
And if I find it...

69
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:21,514
I no longer have it.

70
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,755
And who does?

71
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,674
Lyra.

72
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,194
She arrived in my care with it.

73
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,035
I merely returned it to her.

74
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:41,733
Tell me where she is...

75
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,475
... or I will destroy all of this.

76
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:49,714
I kept her safe in this
college for 12 years.

77
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:51,754
I gave her to you to look after,

78
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,634
and you lost her.

79
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:57,915
You've already done the
worst you can possibly do.

80
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,554
You heard him.

81
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:09,235
Tear everything apart!

82
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,315
Widen the search. She's not here.

83
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,315
I've never seen so many Gyptians.

84
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,755
Who are all of these people?

85
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,354
The Gyptians aren't just
in Oxford, you know, Lyra.

86
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:43,434
They've come from all over the
country to meet here in London

87
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:44,955
to find the missing children.

88
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,636
Tony, please, just explain
how you found her.

89
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:02,074
From the beginning.

90
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:05,834
- We were just out getting supplies.
- What supplies?

91
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:06,994
Well, there was this van,

92
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,154
and then there was someone driving it,

93
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,935
and there was, like,
noises from the back...

94
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,635
muffled screaming and that.

95
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,434
Obviously, we was like, "Yeah,
we're going to have to stop it".

96
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,755
So we chased it and got lucky.

97
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,861
Tony rescued me, Ma Costa.

98
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,914
I don't understand.

99
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,716
I was just out with the guys, Ma!

100
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,249
Don't even think about lying
to me, Tony Costa,

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,874
because you know you're
not very good atit.

102
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,395
We got one! We've finally
got a clue to where Billy is!

103
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:38,956
So close.

104
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:42,754
Close isn't good enough, though, is it?

105
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,875
It's something.

106
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,894
It's a start.

107
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,286
The start of beating them.

108
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,634
I will give you that.

109
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,355
We need the girl.

110
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:03,995
It's all right.

111
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,714
You've had a fortunate
escape, Lyra Belacqua,

112
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:32,915
but now, I ask you to help us.

113
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,670
Did you have a sense of
where they were taking you?

114
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,190
Is he not talking... the Gobbler?

115
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:43,230
Not as yet. So, anything you saw?

116
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,870
I didn't know where I was,

117
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,991
and I didn't know where
they were taking me.

118
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,951
I'm sorry. I wish I
could be of more help.

119
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,830
Ma Costa has agreed to take you in,

120
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,870
so if we could talk again tomorrow...

121
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,470
- You're keeping me here?
- For your own safety.

122
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,070
We want to look after you.

123
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,710
Why? I need to find my friend Roger!

124
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,550
I don't know who you are!

125
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:09,150
And as fun as it may seem
to stay a prisoner again...

126
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,270
You may not know us,

127
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:12,931
but we know you, Lyra.

128
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,531
And have done since you were a baby.

129
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,150
You are not our prisoner, Lyra,

130
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:23,031
but you have always
been important to us.

131
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,110
Is this because of my father?

132
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:27,751
Because he's Lord Asriel?

133
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,790
Who told you that?

134
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,470
Your father was good to us.

135
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,110
He has always respected our way of life.

136
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,630
But you are special on your own account.

137
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:41,790
Why?!

138
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,271
Frustrating as it may seem...

139
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,510
... that's not a question
for me to answer.

140
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,750
I can't ask you to trust us, Lyra.

141
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,310
I can only hope we'll earn your trust.

142
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:55,030
We all want to find
the missing children.

143
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,551
So... will you stay with us?

144
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:09,710
The girl needs to be found. Mrs.
Coulter's quite insistent on it.

145
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,350
- Any help that the Magisterium...
- Jordan College's sanctuary

146
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:16,350
is long-held and, this
morning, disrupted.

147
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,830
She did what she had to do.

148
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:20,230
She did it badly and baldly.

149
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,231
And she would happily bear consequence.

150
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:28,150
Were you not part of this raid?

151
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,151
And I will happily
bear consequence, too.

152
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:36,671
As it turns out...

153
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,351
... there's been developments.

154
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,710
There's a rumour the Gyptians have her.

155
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,711
The girl.

156
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,591
- And you're sending... ?
- Officers are being dispatched now.

157
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:53,830
The sooner this unseemly
situation is contained,

158
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,831
the better.

159
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:03,590
We can't run away from them.

160
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,510
You said you'd give them a chance.

161
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,670
They know more about
the Gobblers than we do.

162
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,910
We're more likely to find
Roger with them than on our own.

163
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:14,190
Pan, how do you know we'll be safe here?

164
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,390
They want to get their children back.

165
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:19,350
I think we can trust them,

166
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,070
and I never thought that about her.

167
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:25,031
Well, we'll be better disguised
in their clothes than hers.

168
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:40,910
Lyra, what do the symbols mean?

169
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:44,231
It's clear that it means something,
but I have no idea what.

170
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,551
Lyra!

171
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:57,230
Oh, look at you. You
make a fine Gyptian.

172
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,231
Much better.

173
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,111
I'm cooking. Will you help?

174
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:08,110
My friend, Roger,

175
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,630
he worked in kitchens.

176
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,190
Never thought you should learn?

177
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,710
What good it do me?

178
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:16,830
Oh, a Gyptian woman learns more
than just cooking in our kitchens,

179
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,270
Lyra Belacqua. We're armed.

180
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,950
There you go, girl!

181
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,790
While you're stuck indoors,

182
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,831
we'll learn you some of our tricks.

183
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,350
There! Lesson one learned already.

184
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,470
You'll be a Gyptian woman yet.

185
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:37,311
Is that what I'm going to be...
a Gyptian woman?

186
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,790
You'll be whatever you want to be.

187
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,230
Be your path.

188
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,430
That's your choice,

189
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:47,711
and yours alone.

190
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:51,190
I'm glad you're staying, Lyra.

191
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,231
You'll be safe as
houses here. You'll see.

192
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,986
We're not like Mrs. Coulter, you know.

193
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,390
We just want to keep you safe.

194
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:21,670
Yeah, she said something
similar to me, too.

195
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,071
I'm sure she did.

196
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,270
Maybe she even meant it,

197
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:31,910
but maybe Mrs. Coulter isn't
as powerful as she thinks.

198
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,550
After all, you got away, didn't you?

199
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,550
Although I still haven't
got to the bottom

200
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,990
of why she has a monkey daemon.

201
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:42,430
Then again, I'm often
confused by daemons.

202
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,030
I would never have guessed

203
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,971
Tony Costa's daemon would
have settled as a hawk.

204
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:52,110
I think I'll settle as a mole.

205
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:55,630
Oh! A mole, is it?

206
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:57,390
Yes, so we can burrow underground

207
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,230
and stay safe from all you grown-ups.

208
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,511
Very sensible.

209
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:08,550
But, er, not so good on the water, huh?

210
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,590
Nowhere to burrow.

211
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:16,431
I don't want Pantalaimon to settle.

212
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,750
I want him to be able to change forever.

213
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,430
And so does he.

214
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:27,950
Well, there will come a time when
you will be tired of him changing.

215
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:33,310
When you come of age, and your
daemon settles into its final form,

216
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:36,451
it will reveal what kind
of person you really are.

217
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:43,190
Suppose you don't like the shape
that your daemon settles as?

218
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:48,590
Well, that would mean
you are discontented.

219
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,910
Many people would like to
have a lion as a daemon,

220
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,191
and they end up with a poodle.

221
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,430
No, I would not change
a hair on Sophonax,

222
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,470
but that is not to say

223
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,731
that sometimes I don't
dream her different.

224
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,431
Now...

225
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,591
... would you like to see
the man who took you?

226
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:32,030
You people think you're so clever,
but we found you, didn't we?

227
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,830
There's no protection for you here.

228
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,151
Just me and you in a room.

229
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,110
Tell me where they are.

230
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,670
I know you know.

231
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,310
Tell me where they are
and why you've taken them.

232
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,791
Is this all right, Lyra?

233
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:47,831
Tell me.

234
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,630
Tell... me.

235
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:53,470
He wanted to do worse
to Roger and Billy.

236
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,470
Why would they take them
and the other children

237
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,951
if it wasn't to hurt them?

238
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,710
Grumman isn't who you think he is.

239
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,630
I ran a facial recognition
trace based on your photo,

240
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,111
whatever that was, and I found a match.

241
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:38,870
Colonel John Parry, 49th Commando.

242
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:42,110
Former Marine and explorer,
presumed dead around 13 years ago.

243
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,030
He was lost in Alaska,

244
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:46,978
supporting a government-funded
science expedition

245
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,070
environmental thing.

246
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:49,990
He'd done a couple of
gigs for them before.

247
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:55,031
Prior to that, he was 14
years in the Royal Marines.

248
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,310
He was born here.

249
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,311
In my world.

250
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,870
Charles, he didn't travel
from your world to mine.

251
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:05,950
He travelled from my world to yours.

252
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:09,430
Not possible. He has a
daemon clearly in the picture.

253
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,871
No-one is born in this
world with a daemon.

254
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:14,671
I don't think you know that.

255
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,550
Maybe you acquire a daemon
when you cross, or...

256
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:25,983
Where precisely did he disappear?

257
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,430
Look, this stuff was well locked up.

258
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:30,310
Somebody didn't want just anybody
poking about. He was a colonel.

259
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:32,551
But you're good, and
you found out anyway.

260
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:37,791
I traced his ship.

261
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,431
Alaska.

262
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:42,871
The Brooks Range.

263
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:52,590
He's long gone from there by now.

264
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,351
- This is of no use to me.
- Okay.

265
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,471
Maybe this might be.

266
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:02,231
He left a wife... and a child.

267
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:06,950
I found them on voter registration.

268
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,950
Maybe she'll know something.

269
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:11,390
But she's not well. Medical records.

270
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,231
She's had a long-term history
of mental health problems.

271
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:25,111
This is a hard copy... of
everything... that I found.

272
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:29,871
It's all there.

273
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,190
Is this search just for you,

274
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,871
or whoever you work for?

275
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,591
It's just you, isn't it?

276
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:50,110
Why did you never try to follow me?

277
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,390
You could have.

278
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,470
You know enough to
have crossed behind me.

279
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:57,910
You don't have the
courage that's needed.

280
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,991
You don't want to find the window,
because you're scared of it.

281
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,511
It's true.

282
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,871
I was scared, too.

283
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,911
But I mastered my fear.

284
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:17,910
I never thought that I was
the only person to cross.

285
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:21,030
But until Stanislaus, I
never came across anyone

286
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,631
who was fearless enough to have done it.

287
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,950
I want to know what he knows,

288
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,525
I want to know where he crosses,

289
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,775
and I want to know what he has seen.

290
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:38,791
This is very helpful.

291
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,791
I'll let myself out.

292
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,795
_

293
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,751
Is he saying anything?

294
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,990
He said she's taking them North,

295
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,390
but he doesn't know where.

296
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,510
Of course. They can do anything
they want with them there.

297
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,790
But I saw, in her study, plans, papers.

298
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,151
If we could just get to them...

299
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,310
No! We are not going to Mrs. Coulter!

300
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:44,390
- Maybe we could...
- Mrs. Coulter cannot know where we are.

301
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,230
If you got captured, we'd
risk her knowing everything.

302
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,430
I forbid it!

303
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:54,230
Go! Now!

304
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:56,550
By order of the Magisterium,

305
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,790
we are searching all
Gyptian boats in the area.

306
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,590
Prepare to be boarded.

307
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:02,791
Hurry, Lyra.

308
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,510
By order of the Magisterium,

309
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:10,230
we are searching all
Gyptian boats in the area.

310
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:11,591
Prepare to be boarded.

311
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,830
Lyra, quick! I'll hide you.

312
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,390
You said I'd be safe here!

313
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,590
Hey! Hey!

314
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:30,350
Under whose jurisdiction
dare you board these boats?!

315
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:32,470
Article Three of the Watercourse Bill.

316
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,391
The Magisterium have no rights here.

317
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,231
Never seen her.

318
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,431
What are you looking for this time?

319
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:53,390
My son's missing, you
know that, don't you?

320
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,070
It's Billy. Billy Costa.

321
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,230
Write that down.

322
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,990
Mean anything to you? No, of course not.

323
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,510
You should be looking for my son

324
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,671
and all the other
missing Gyptian children!

325
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,391
Lyra, don't breathe!

326
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,591
She's not here. Let's get moving.

327
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:13,831
We'll search further downriver.

328
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:18,350
It's safe to come out.

329
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:20,630
I'll never be safe!

330
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,150
Where are you going now?

331
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,230
Away from you! Away from all this!

332
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,350
I'm sorry we had to
keep you hid like that.

333
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:30,590
And it's her! It's all her!

334
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,710
And Farder Coram says she won't find me,

335
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:35,070
but I don't think she'll
stop until she does!

336
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:38,030
And I don't know why, and I
don't know if I can trust you.

337
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,226
All I do know is that, on my
own, everything makes sense,

338
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:43,390
and when I'm with you,
I'm just as much at risk!

339
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,910
You're right.

340
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:47,030
She won't stop until she finds you.

341
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:48,031
Why?

342
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,951
Why am I so important to her?

343
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:56,750
How am I supposed to trust you
when no-one tells me the truth?!

344
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:58,870
The truth is complicated.

345
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:01,110
Some things, you're
better off not knowing.

346
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,621
I am so bored of being told that!

347
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:09,911
She's your mother, Lyra!

348
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:13,750
That's what no-one is telling you.

349
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,231
She's your ma.

350
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:18,230
No.

351
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,070
No, no.

352
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,590
Lyra. Lyra. Listen. Wait!

353
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:25,030
It's time you knew.

354
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:27,073
As a young man, Asriel, your father,

355
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,270
went exploring all over the North.

356
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:31,750
He was high-spirited, quick to anger.

357
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,670
Your ma, she was already married.

358
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,631
As soon as they met, they fell in love.

359
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:42,046
When she was pregnant with you,

360
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,750
they thought they
could get away with it,

361
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:47,311
but soon as you was born, there
was no hiding the Asriel in you.

362
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,948
Your father had estates,

363
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,135
so he put you in the
care of a Gyptian nurse.

364
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:58,590
But Edward Coulter, your
mother's husband, followed,

365
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:00,390
determined to kill you.

366
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,430
Kill me?

367
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,031
Men get funny about their shame.

368
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,390
He ransacked the place.

369
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:09,391
The Gyptian hid you well, but
he'd have found you eventually.

370
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,510
Asriel fought him there and then,

371
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,591
and Edward Coulter was killed.

372
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:20,550
The law didn't know how to respond.

373
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,910
Asriel killed defending his home,

374
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,031
but the law also allows a man to
avenge the violation of his wife.

375
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:30,583
Your ma was broken with
the shame of it all.

376
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,230
It's why she's like she is.

377
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,590
She was a pariah for years.

378
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:39,030
And they stripped all money,
land and property from Asriel.

379
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,870
You, the law placed in a nunnery,

380
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:46,071
but in the great flood,
Asriel stole you away...

381
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,471
... and took you to Jordan College.

382
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,391
And that's all I know.

383
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:54,791
That's all I remember.

384
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:58,191
You were the Gyptian nurse.

385
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:05,991
I held you for the whole night.

386
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:10,751
I just want to keep you safe.

387
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,150
I didn't manage it before.

388
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:17,511
Let me manage it now.

389
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,311
Oh!

390
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:25,831
I need your help.

391
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,470
This house.

392
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,551
This family.

393
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,230
They're connected to someone
I desperately need to find.

394
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:45,070
Watch them and report back to me.

395
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,071
You've got it.

396
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,670
As your king, I called this Roping

397
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,990
for us to come to listen and to decide.

398
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,191
You all know why.

399
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,670
27 Gyptian children have been taken.

400
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:14,011
Some from families in this very room.

401
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:19,270
Others from our Gyptian brothers
and sisters across Britain.

402
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,550
And who is taking them?

403
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:23,830
- We believe it's the Gobblers.
- Yes!

404
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,511
And now's the time for action.

405
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:30,470
For no-one else is
doing anything about it.

406
00:32:30,471 --> 00:32:33,030
Not those in power, the law makers.

407
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:37,590
In fact, the authorities, the
landloper police and the clergy,

408
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:41,950
are invading our boats,
making us the criminal.

409
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:45,390
So we have no choice but to deal
with these Gobblers ourselves.

410
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:46,671
I disagree!

411
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:50,030
Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?

412
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:53,910
Lord Faa, the landlopers
invaded us, not out of scorn,

413
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:56,630
but because we harbour fugitives.

414
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,710
And not even one of our own.

415
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:03,218
If we attempt to take on the Gobblers,

416
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,024
we'll attract even more attention

417
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,771
- from the Magisterium!
- Exactly!

418
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:09,550
Our children are not the
only children being taken.

419
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,590
Let the landlopers find these Gobblers!

420
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,270
- So we let them fight for us, Ray?
- Why not?

421
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:18,350
And what of those who've
already had their kids taken?

422
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,070
What of us, Raymond?

423
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:23,630
As a father, I am sorry for
what you have lost, Ma Costa...

424
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,351
She hasn't lost anything yet.

425
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,030
To risk so much?

426
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,510
Who knows what they're
doing to our children?!

427
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,283
Even if we do succeed,

428
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:36,030
are we really prepared
to lose more sons?

429
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:38,030
- More daughters?
- We have to do something!

430
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,990
Raymond's right. She's a threat!

431
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:43,430
- Get rid of the girl!
- Get rid of her!

432
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,310
Ma, we need to get her out of here.

433
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:48,990
Do what you want with me,
but you have to stop her!

434
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,151
I know them.

435
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,870
The Gobblers.

436
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,270
Her.

437
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:55,711
She won't stop.

438
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:59,751
I'm frightened, too!

439
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:06,151
They took my friend Roger,
and I reckon, Billy, Roger...

440
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,951
... they're more frightened.

441
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,111
What I know is they'll... she'll
just keep on taking your children.

442
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,130
Fighting back is the only way.

443
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:27,110
The Gobblers have taken their
prisoners to the far North.

444
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,270
To the land of the dark.

445
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,190
So we are going after them.

446
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:34,910
Any Gyptian still travelling
here has been sent word

447
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:36,470
to head straight for the port.

448
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:38,950
Do we know where
they are? The North is vast.

449
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,310
Yeah!

450
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,470
- We can discover that information...
- No, we do not know where.

451
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,670
But we will go to Trollesund,

452
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:48,510
and we will ask the
witches for their support.

453
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:50,070
What if the witches say no?

454
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,510
Too many questions.

455
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:54,910
We know it will be dangerous.
We also know we're strong!

456
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:56,590
So, yes,

457
00:34:56,591 --> 00:35:00,830
now I am asking you to put
yourselves more at risk.

458
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,710
- For Lyra!
- Yes!

459
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,950
- For the children we have lost!
- Yes!

460
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:08,750
- But mostly for ourselves!
- Yes!

461
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,470
I am the Western King,

462
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:14,390
and I'm asking you to ready
yourselves to travel North,

463
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,590
ready yourselves to fight,

464
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:19,070
and ready yourselves to
bring our children home.

465
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,710
Yes!

466
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:25,230
Heads of families, raise
a tax, muster a levy,

467
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:28,150
find me the best
warriors from every home!

468
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:30,430
- Yes!
- And bring them to me!

469
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:33,950
- Yes!
- We shall strike the strength out of them.

470
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:36,550
- Yes!
- We shall leave them ruined and wasted!

471
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,910
- Yes!
- Broken and shattered!

472
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,863
- Yes!
- Torn to a thousand pieces

473
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:44,550
and scattered to the four winds!

474
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,470
Yes!

475
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:52,830
- Gyptians!
- Gyptians!

476
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,830
- Gyptians!
- Gyptians!

477
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:56,750
- Gyptians!
- Gyptians!

478
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:59,071
- Gyptians!
- Gyptians!

479
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:53,871
Serpent.

480
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:57,431
Lightning bolt.

481
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,230
Fish.

482
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,311
Is that a fish?

483
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:09,631
Don't think I won't
hurt you, Tony Costa.

484
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:16,310
- How'd you know it was me?
- I could smell your hair slick.

485
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:18,910
- Go back to bed, Lyra.
- Or I could come with you?

486
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:22,710
No. Got to stay out of sight, remember?

487
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,870
If you don't tell me where
you're going, Tony Costa,

488
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,390
I will scream this place down,
and your ma will come running...

489
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,470
Okay, fine!

490
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:31,151
All right, Farder Coram,
he thinks we know enough.

491
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:36,150
He doesn't want to risk any more
damage before we go up North,

492
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,777
but he's old and frightened,

493
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:40,390
so we think there's more to find out.

494
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,231
You're going to her place?

495
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,510
Benjamin says you was
talking about plans,

496
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,791
and if we can find them, well...

497
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:55,630
At the end of her flat, her study.

498
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:57,510
You go through the right-hand drawer,

499
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,111
and she's got everything there.

500
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,071
You didn't see me.

501
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:30,631
- We should sleep.
- With him gone? I can't sleep.

502
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:42,470
- Pan.
- I saw it.

503
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:43,830
What were you thinking about?

504
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:47,190
It was... strange.

505
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,871
Like... like my mind, it...

506
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,710
- ... it went blank.
- Then make your mind go blank again.

507
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,031
You should be good at that.

508
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:03,870
Wow!

509
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:05,111
It's really working.

510
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:16,751
Tony?

511
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:27,071
Tony?

512
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,192
Where's Tony?

513
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,031
He's not in his bed!

514
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:54,831
She said... top right drawer.

515
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:42,711
Uh...

516
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:03,190
Not so easy to escape me.

517
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,631
Who sent you, Gyptian boy?

518
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:40,511
I asked who sent you, boy?

519
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:51,511
There is no way out of here.

520
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,071
So this is just you and me.

521
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:03,870
Have you any idea how
much pain I can cause you?

522
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:12,751
You'll tell me everything.

523
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:16,751
No!

524
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:20,031
I betray my family for no-one.

525
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:23,151
Oh, no, no!

526
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:11,150
I've asked all over the camp.
No-one knows anything.

527
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:13,670
If I find out you or John Faa
have put anything in Tony's head...

528
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:16,350
Blame will help no-one here.

529
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:17,910
Me.

530
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:19,550
It'll help me.

531
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:21,071
Then blame my mother.

532
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:25,591
Or me.

533
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:39,590
Many people tried to stop Tony Costa.

534
00:44:39,591 --> 00:44:41,590
Myself included.

535
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:42,711
None succeeded.

536
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:45,991
It's not your fault, Lyra.

537
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,551
I know that.

538
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,511
And she knows that.

539
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,950
It was because of me why
you wouldn't let Benjamin

540
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:02,710
go to Mrs. Coulter's, right?

541
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:06,470
Because you thought it
would allow her to find us.

542
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,230
Me.

543
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:09,231
That's right.

544
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:13,111
Thank you.

545
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:15,311
For trying to...

546
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:18,151
For keeping me safe.

547
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,630
The Master at Jordan gave me something.

548
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:28,830
He told me not to tell her about it,

549
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:30,911
but I think I can trust you.

550
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:45,791
You know what one is, then?

551
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,490
I never thought I would... set
my eyes on one of those again.

552
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:55,110
The Magisterium have
confiscated them all.

553
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:58,271
He said it tells the truth,
not that I know how.

554
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:02,790
Well,

555
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,990
I was told that you frame a question

556
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:07,990
by turning the three
hands on these pictures.

557
00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:12,390
Each symbol has many,
maybe infinite, meanings.

558
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:15,550
And then the needle
points to another symbol

559
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,251
within which you can find your answer.

560
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:21,550
Can it help us now? With Tony?

561
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,471
No, sadly not.

562
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:28,750
Reading it takes years of study.

563
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:30,430
Many books.

564
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:33,551
And without those books, it's useless.

565
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:38,431
Now, I must wake John Faa...

566
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,271
... and decide what to do.

567
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,310
Farder Coram was very clear.

568
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:05,910
It takes years of learning and books.

569
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:08,630
It's the only way I can help, Pan.

570
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,430
Then you need to clear your mind again.

571
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:11,551
Like you did before.

572
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:27,431
All right, Benjamin's a spy, so...

573
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:33,431
... the serpent for cunning.

574
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,311
Crucible for knowledge.

575
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:49,791
Beehive for hard work.

576
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,111
It worked!

577
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:04,790
- It worked, Pan.
- What?

578
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,950
No, that's impossible.

579
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,831
No, it's not. Look!

580
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:16,111
Wow!

581
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:20,551
It's...

582
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,231
... an hourglass...

583
00:48:26,435 --> 00:48:27,875
... with a skull on top of it.

584
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:31,471
So that means...

585
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,430
Farder Coram!

586
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:36,230
Farder Coram!

587
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:37,630
Farder Coram!

588
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,630
Lyra, get inside!

589
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:42,230
Lyra, I told you to get below!

590
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:45,590
I made it work. The alethiometer.
It told me Benjamin's dead!

591
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:47,190
What are you talking about?

592
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:50,670
- Tony, too, maybe. Listen to me!
- I told you to stay below...

593
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,711
Lyra!

594
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,630
Pan!

595
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,071
Argh!

596
00:49:16,391 --> 00:49:18,150
Someone get the other one!

597
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:20,791
Hold it!

598
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,071
What is it?

599
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:38,951
A spy-fly.

600
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,310
Spy what?

601
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:44,350
What worries me is the
one that's got away.

602
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:48,190
Right now, it'll be on
its way to Mrs. Coulter

603
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:50,271
to tell her it has seen you.

604
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:55,030
We go North. Now!

605
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,231
- Ma!
- Oh!

606
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:02,310
Tony.

607
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,311
So sorry.

608
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:08,391
I left him. I did. I got scared.

609
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,630
You came home. You did right.

610
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,031
This is the only thing we found.

611
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:19,791
There's so many.

612
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:22,751
There's so many!

613
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:25,511
It's got Billy on it.

614
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:30,830
Looks like it's got every
child they've ever took on it.

615
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,110
We've got to help them, John.

616
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:36,790
We've got to. Billy's on it!

617
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:37,871
Where's Benjamin?

618
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:02,631
Can we at least recover the body?

619
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:06,470
No.

620
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:08,310
She has the body, I'm afraid.

621
00:51:08,311 --> 00:51:11,750
Lord Faa, we must leave.

622
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:15,350
That was the first death,
but there will be others.

623
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,328
But with the right wind,

624
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:20,190
with the witches on our side and Lyra...

625
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,670
You really think she's that important?

626
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:25,390
She can read the alethiometer

627
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:26,631
without the books.

628
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:31,431
She can do what? How?

629
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,391
That, I...

630
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:40,070
... I don't understand, but it
told her of Benjamin's death.

631
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:42,350
I don't know how she does it,

632
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,590
but if she can continue to do it,

633
00:51:44,591 --> 00:51:49,470
she will be more valuable to
us than any soldier we have.

634
00:51:49,471 --> 00:51:52,070
They trust you, John.

635
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:53,311
They will follow you.

636
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:57,830
It's your strength they need,
and for what's it's worth,

637
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:00,911
I believe we will get our children back.

638
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:12,830
Load up the ship.

639
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,910
We travel to the port.

640
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:17,991
Tell the captain... set
a course for Trollesund.

641
00:52:57,631 --> 00:52:59,671
And what are you
intending to do with that?

642
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:02,550
Throw it in the sea.

643
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:05,150
Spy-fly doesn't live. It wouldn't drown.

644
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:09,750
Inside is just a bad spirit
with a spell through its heart.

645
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:11,190
They're forbidden.

646
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,870
Even the Magisterium
are frightened of them.

647
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:16,031
She broke the law sending it after me.

648
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,191
That's the second reason to keep it.

649
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:25,830
Loving gesture, hateful gesture.

650
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,950
It's a symbol of your
mother's desperation for you,

651
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:29,151
so it should be kept.

652
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,751
Give it back to Farder
Coram. He'll weld it safe.

653
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:38,750
The North is going to
test us all, you know that?

654
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:42,870
We're going to find out what
they're doing to the children

655
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,591
and why they've been doing it.

656
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:47,431
I'm ready to fight.

657
00:53:52,391 --> 00:53:54,871
You're a remarkable girl, Lyra Belacqua.

658
00:53:57,311 --> 00:53:59,591
I don't think the North
knows what's coming.

659
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:20,111
Your new security team are rigorous.

660
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:24,030
Sadly, they're necessary.

661
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:26,350
Gyptians, I hear.

662
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:27,351
What do they want?

663
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,710
- And the Magisterium... ?
- All taken care of.

664
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:38,911
We still have a card to play.

665
00:54:57,831 --> 00:54:59,151
A spy-fly.

666
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:02,710
Are you out of your mind?

667
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:03,951
We've found her.

668
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,666
